60 so it's like 30 pairs is like 10

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.910 
60 so it's like 30 pairs is like 10
bucks<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.780> basically<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.410> much<00:00:58.530> cheaper

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
for the first couple of days and now I

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.180

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
use that at night at night I really like

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.940 
use that at night at night I really like
to<00:04:26.280> nurse<00:04:26.490> on<00:04:26.760> one<00:04:27.030> side<00:04:27.360> per<00:04:27.900> feeding<00:04:28.320> just

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
to nurse on one side per feeding just

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.440 
to nurse on one side per feeding just
because<00:04:29.250> I<00:04:29.370> feel<00:04:29.520> like<00:04:29.670> it<00:04:29.760> wakes<00:04:29.970> them<00:04:30.090> up<00:04:30.240> if

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
because I feel like it wakes them up if

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.210 
because I feel like it wakes them up if
I<00:04:30.540> try<00:04:30.720> to<00:04:30.750> move<00:04:30.900> them<00:04:30.990> to<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.140> other<00:04:31.350> side<00:04:31.410> so

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
I try to move them to the other side so

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.680 
I try to move them to the other side so
I<00:04:32.250> kinda<00:04:32.670> just<00:04:32.790> like<00:04:33.030> feed<00:04:33.270> him<00:04:33.390> you<00:04:33.450> let<00:04:33.570> him

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
I kinda just like feed him you let him

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.570 
I kinda just like feed him you let him
fall<00:04:33.870> asleep<00:04:33.900> on<00:04:34.260> that<00:04:34.320> boob<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:34.920> then<00:04:35.460> what

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
fall asleep on that boob and then what

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.210 
fall asleep on that boob and then what
I'll<00:04:35.670> do<00:04:35.850> is<00:04:35.970> pump<00:04:36.270> on<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.900> other<00:04:37.020> side<00:04:37.350> so<00:04:38.190> I

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
I'll do is pump on the other side so I

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.460 
I'll do is pump on the other side so I
find<00:04:38.700> that<00:04:38.790> the<00:04:38.940> hand<00:04:39.150> pump<00:04:39.390> is<00:04:39.630> really<00:04:40.320> really

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
find that the hand pump is really really

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.110 
find that the hand pump is really really
easy<00:04:40.650> I'll<00:04:40.920> just<00:04:41.100> pump<00:04:41.580> for<00:04:41.790> a<00:04:41.820> couple<00:04:42.060> of

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
easy I'll just pump for a couple of

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.420 
easy I'll just pump for a couple of
minutes<00:04:42.330> just<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.840> hand<00:04:43.050> pump<00:04:43.260> just<00:04:43.500> so<00:04:44.400> I

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
minutes just the hand pump just so I

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.460 
minutes just the hand pump just so I
don't<00:04:44.520> get<00:04:44.670> super<00:04:44.940> super<00:04:45.090> engorged<00:04:45.690> until<00:04:46.410> the

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
don't get super super engorged until the

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.440 
don't get super super engorged until the
next<00:04:46.620> feeding<00:04:46.860> so<00:04:47.670> I<00:04:47.700> use<00:04:47.850> that<00:04:48.060> and<00:04:48.270> then<00:04:48.360> I

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
next feeding so I use that and then I

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.990 
next feeding so I use that and then I
also<00:04:48.600> use<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:48.960> double<00:04:49.170> electric<00:04:49.560> I<00:04:49.680> pump<00:04:50.130> I<00:04:50.400> do

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
also use the double electric I pump I do

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.090 
also use the double electric I pump I do

I<00:05:48.900> like<00:05:49.320> them<00:05:49.470> better<00:05:49.590> because<00:05:50.010> they're

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
I like them better because they're

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.020 
I like them better because they're
bigger<00:05:50.760> and<00:05:51.440> I<00:05:52.440> don't<00:05:53.250> know<00:05:53.340> I<00:05:53.640> just<00:05:53.760> like

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
bigger and I don't know I just like

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.250 
bigger and I don't know I just like
these<00:05:54.150> better<00:05:54.390> I<00:05:54.450> like<00:05:54.600> the<00:05:54.720> texture<00:05:55.050> of<00:05:55.110> them

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
these better I like the texture of them

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.320 
these better I like the texture of them
I<00:05:55.410> don't<00:05:55.560> know<00:05:55.620> it's<00:05:55.950> really<00:05:56.160> weird<00:05:56.330> but

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
I don't know it's really weird but

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.300 
I don't know it's really weird but
definitely<00:05:57.660> these<00:05:57.780> I<00:05:58.140> don't<00:05:58.440> pump<00:05:58.860> directly

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
definitely these I don't pump directly

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.190 
definitely these I don't pump directly
into<00:05:59.580> them<00:05:59.730> I<00:05:59.910> have<00:06:00.120> the<00:06:00.270> Medela<00:06:00.660> ones<00:06:00.840> you<00:06:01.020> can

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
into them I have the Medela ones you can

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.610 
into them I have the Medela ones you can
pump<00:06:01.440> directly<00:06:01.680> into<00:06:02.750> but<00:06:03.750> I<00:06:03.780> find<00:06:04.320> that<00:06:04.470> it's

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
pump directly into but I find that it's

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.080 
pump directly into but I find that it's
easier<00:06:04.890> to<00:06:04.980> pump<00:06:05.190> into<00:06:05.340> the<00:06:05.430> bottles<00:06:05.820> because

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
easier to pump into the bottles because

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.250 
easier to pump into the bottles because
then<00:06:06.270> I<00:06:06.330> keep<00:06:06.540> the<00:06:06.690> bottles<00:06:06.990> in<00:06:07.110> my

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
then I keep the bottles in my

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.660 
then I keep the bottles in my
refrigerator<00:06:07.470> for<00:06:07.800> a<00:06:07.860> couple<00:06:07.920> days<00:06:08.250> in<00:06:08.430> case<00:06:08.550> I

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
refrigerator for a couple days in case I

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.910 
refrigerator for a couple days in case I
need<00:06:08.790> to<00:06:08.820> use<00:06:08.910> that<00:06:09.180> note<00:06:09.390> right<00:06:09.570> away<00:06:09.920> and

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:10.920 
need to use that note right away and

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.620 
need to use that note right away and
then<00:06:11.130> like<00:06:11.460> after<00:06:11.880> I<00:06:11.910> think<00:06:12.210> two<00:06:12.360> or<00:06:12.390> three

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
then like after I think two or three

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.450 
then like after I think two or three
days<00:06:12.780> I<00:06:12.990> just<00:06:13.020> pour<00:06:13.530> in<00:06:13.800> transition<00:06:14.250> to<00:06:14.340> all

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
days I just pour in transition to all

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.430 
days I just pour in transition to all
that<00:06:14.610> I<00:06:14.640> have<00:06:14.880> into<00:06:15.180> the<00:06:15.270> bags<00:06:15.450> I<00:06:15.840> feel<00:06:16.230> like<00:06:16.320> if

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
that I have into the bags I feel like if

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.160 
that I have into the bags I feel like if
I<00:06:16.590> pump<00:06:17.100> directly<00:06:17.340> into<00:06:17.790> the<00:06:17.880> bags<00:06:18.090> that<00:06:18.840> I'm

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.170 
I pump directly into the bags that I'm

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.080 
I pump directly into the bags that I'm
only<00:06:19.320> getting<00:06:19.800> like<00:06:19.830> a<00:06:20.130> couple<00:06:20.400> of<00:06:20.460> ounces<00:06:20.610> so

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
only getting like a couple of ounces so

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.270 
only getting like a couple of ounces so
I

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
I

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.160 
I
