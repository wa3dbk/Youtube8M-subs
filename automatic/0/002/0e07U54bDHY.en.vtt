fine I guess but but not loaded and
weights<00:01:15.090> they<00:01:15.930> just<00:01:16.170> there's<00:01:16.650> something<00:01:16.890> that

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
weights they just there's something that

really didn't think much of it well but
the<00:02:06.090> second<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.719> went<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:06.990> my<00:02:07.140> back<00:02:07.670> it<00:02:08.670> would

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
the second it went on my back it would

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.940 
the second it went on my back it would
be<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.509> world<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.229> difference

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
be a world of difference

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.260 
be a world of difference
is<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.400> there<00:02:11.580> seems<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.819> be<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.970> couple

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
is that there seems to be a couple

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.699 
is that there seems to be a couple
different<00:02:12.330> camps<00:02:12.900> when<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.110> comes<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.590> this

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
different camps when it comes to this

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.479 
different camps when it comes to this
lumbar<00:02:14.280> support<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:15.180> either<00:02:16.099> in<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.250> camp

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
lumbar support you either in the camp

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.660 
lumbar support you either in the camp
that<00:02:17.750> loves<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.930> like<00:02:19.050> myself<00:02:19.290> or<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:20.310> hate<00:02:20.459> it

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
that loves it like myself or you hate it

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.790 
that loves it like myself or you hate it
and<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.810> go<00:02:22.080> for<00:02:22.230> when<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.440> other<00:02:22.590> bags

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
and so you go for when the other bags

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.820 
and so you go for when the other bags
like<00:02:23.040> an<00:02:23.160> osprey<00:02:23.610> or<00:02:23.819> eaten<00:02:24.420> has<00:02:24.569> less<00:02:24.840> support

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
like an osprey or eaten has less support

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.220 
like an osprey or eaten has less support
than<00:02:25.860> they<00:02:26.190> obviously<00:02:27.180> be<00:02:27.300> Gregory<00:02:27.630> here<00:02:27.840> the

than they obviously be Gregory here the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.170 
than they obviously be Gregory here the
second<00:02:28.590> reason<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.370> second<00:02:29.700> reason<00:02:29.819> I

haven't<00:02:44.220> done<00:02:44.250> in<00:02:44.489> years<00:02:44.959> is<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.530> fact<00:02:47.250> that

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
haven't done in years is the fact that

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.520 
haven't done in years is the fact that
you<00:02:47.580> really<00:02:48.180> need<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.510> go<00:02:48.630> down<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.110> try<00:02:49.260> on<00:02:49.500> a

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
you really need to go down and try on a

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.240 
you really need to go down and try on a
pack<00:02:49.890> before<00:02:50.849> you<00:02:51.090> buy<00:02:51.269> it

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
pack before you buy it

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
that may be world the difference if I

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.089 
that may be world the difference if I
were<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.989> bought<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.380> pack<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:55.920> was

originally believed thinking about

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.559 
originally believed thinking about
