00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
Move support to boot I can't say this is

Move support to boot I can't say this is
the<00:03:38.120> most<00:03:38.330> ideal<00:03:38.510> way<00:03:38.750> to<00:03:38.930> play<00:03:39.200> puppets<00:03:39.560> here

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
the most ideal way to play puppets here

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.070 
the most ideal way to play puppets here
but<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.310> option<00:03:40.670> is<00:03:40.790> there<00:03:40.850> it's<00:03:41.630> also<00:03:41.810> worth

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
but the option is there it's also worth

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.690

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
local only there's honestly not much to

scenes are easily skippable which I
still<00:04:25.850> wouldn't<00:04:26.060> even<00:04:26.180> fully<00:04:26.540> recommend

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
still wouldn't even fully recommend

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.450 
still wouldn't even fully recommend
because<00:04:27.290> the<00:04:27.410> game<00:04:27.560> really<00:04:27.830> shines<00:04:27.860> in<00:04:28.280> those
