00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
just perfectly so you're jumping off

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.560 
just perfectly so you're jumping off
right<00:01:04.049> at<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> lip<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.150> if<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.299> don't

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
right at the lip of it and if you don't

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.380 
right at the lip of it and if you don't
do<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:06.840> time<00:01:07.110> you'll<00:01:07.650> fall<00:01:08.130> off<00:01:08.369> or<00:01:09.150> you'll

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
do it in time you'll fall off or you'll

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.649 
do it in time you'll fall off or you'll
just<00:01:09.510> jump<00:01:09.780> too<00:01:09.900> early<00:01:10.790> so<00:01:11.790> basically<00:01:12.479> you

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
just jump too early so basically you

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.340 
just jump too early so basically you
have<00:01:12.840> two<00:01:13.170> jumps<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.270> then<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:16.020> points

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
have two jumps and then you get points

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.429 
have two jumps and then you get points
based<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:17.100> your<00:01:17.549> distance<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.290> balance<00:01:19.290> and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
based on your distance and balance and

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.560 
based on your distance and balance and
stuff<00:01:19.619> like<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.100> when<00:01:20.430> you're<00:01:21.420> in

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
stuff like that and when you're in

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.140 
stuff like that and when you're in
midair<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:22.860> press<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.549> use<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:23.970> your

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
midair you can press a to use like your

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.390 
midair you can press a to use like your
special<00:01:24.540> ability<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.960> guess<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.380> would<00:01:25.470> be<00:01:25.500> just

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
special ability I guess it would be just

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.219 
special ability I guess it would be just
to<00:01:26.490> go<00:01:26.610> further<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.330> usually<00:01:27.780> use<00:01:27.900> mine<00:01:28.080> on

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
to go further so I usually use mine on

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.170 
to go further so I usually use mine on
mm<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.590> peak<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:29.220> about<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.610> start<00:01:29.759> falling

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
mm I peak just about to start falling

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.950 
mm I peak just about to start falling
and<00:01:31.040> yeah<00:01:32.040> that's<00:01:32.610> basically<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:33.600> not<00:01:33.750> too

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
and yeah that's basically it's not too

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.190 
and yeah that's basically it's not too
hard<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.259> an<00:01:34.439> event<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.750> yeah<00:01:36.750> that's<00:01:36.990> about
