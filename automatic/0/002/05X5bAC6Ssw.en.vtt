00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.520
 let's open the program 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.070
 and we are going to assemble what works 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.260
 effectively 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.130

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.450
 my iphone with ios 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.939

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.860
 and very well we go and we have a 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.240
 application is that I will not do what 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.070
 let's do is going to be connect our 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.900
 device 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.840
 this video will only be for the 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.000

 let's close here 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.290
 and recognizes that we have 17 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.390
 let's see now the store tab 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.610
 that were previously red pigtails no longer the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.310
 has I do not know why we're going to have 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.200
 our iphone or ipod or ipad blocked 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.069
 what we are going to do is going to be what 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.130
 next let's check this box 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:24.170
 blue that previously only worked with 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:27.190
 older 4 5 and 6 but there a while ago 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.700
 back a necessary little sign of said 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.200
 from pp 25 that left a part of ios 7 and 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.500
 below is only one small picture 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.870
 that I think of saying accept the 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.290
 give them that box will you how 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.959
 update the pp 25 and that is going to give you the 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.269
 option that now applications that 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.660
 you have ios 7 are going to work again 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.220
 have giving this box 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.310
 with the device or what we do 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.780
 answer the box this process can 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.010
 last more than a minute in a couple of 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.390
 seconds 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.390
 to load 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.870
 to load 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.069
 come here I end up downloading it 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.739
 In the box 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.739
 and so we can see something and download it 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:27.280
 the ninja audio game this game is from a 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.670
 means of payment of the app store gives us the 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.300
 install my iphone because they can see 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.950
 that works effectively that yes to be 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.720
 a beta version may have 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.290
 some mistakes that have to correct 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.960
 to be able to launch the official version 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.610
 that the by itself the beta versions 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.340
 of each of the programs always 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.780
 have some errors some faults 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.290
 but they affected then that we have tried 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.870
 now with payment applications 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.490
 ios 7 work properly very well 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.490
 He says it has already installed 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.590
 ninja game audio on the iPhone going 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.920
 to remove it safely 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.659
 painting this part we will give you that if 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.060
 this is the left side of means 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:16.099
 that if the right side means no 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.099
 I am connecting from our iphone 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.989
 and we are going to open 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.270
 although we have 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.910
 ninja audio 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.849
 in a game means of payment on the part 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.199
 of app store and it works correctly 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.199
 they are watching us on screen 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.009
 a fairly short video to show 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:38.610
 only what you have problems with 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.509
 lionel 7 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.509
 and you can see 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.580
 and the game works totally fine 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.340
 for those who had problems with 17 and 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.430
 that they will not be able to have that 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.770
 application they both wanted and the 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.780
 creation of quite a price 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.680
 elevated as the photograph ones 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.650
 games applications
