for the bottom one all right let's move
on<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.600> back<00:01:57.780> that's<00:01:58.229> enough<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:58.680> that

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
on to the back that's enough for that

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.350 
on to the back that's enough for that
it's<00:02:00.920> just<00:02:01.130> saying<00:02:01.280> that<00:02:01.520> has<00:02:01.700> a<00:02:01.729> pre<00:02:02.270> applied

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
it's just saying that has a pre applied

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.770 
it's just saying that has a pre applied

compound heat compound patented fan
holder<00:02:09.259> obviously<00:02:10.360> that<00:02:11.360> this<00:02:11.750> is<00:02:11.840> what<00:02:11.990> makes

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
holder obviously that this is what makes

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.400 
holder obviously that this is what makes
it<00:02:12.520> quiet<00:02:13.630> and<00:02:15.490> vibration<00:02:16.490> and<00:02:16.959> on<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.110> side

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
it quiet and vibration and on the side

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.510 
it quiet and vibration and on the side
here<00:02:20.530> it's<00:02:21.530> just<00:02:21.740> saying<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.040> same<00:02:22.070> thing<00:02:22.490> but

just talking about and let's look on the
other<00:02:28.010> side<00:02:28.340> it's<00:02:29.240> just<00:02:29.450> different<00:02:29.630> languages

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
other side it's just different languages

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.850 
other side it's just different languages
same<00:02:30.560> thing<00:02:31.270> something<00:02:32.270> as<00:02:32.420> red<00:02:33.489> top<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:36.110> top

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
same thing something as red top the top

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.050 
same thing something as red top the top
is<00:02:36.920> normal<00:02:38.380> bottom<00:02:39.380> was<00:02:39.500> normal<00:02:39.880> barcode<00:02:40.880> and

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
is normal bottom was normal barcode and

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.260 
is normal bottom was normal barcode and
all<00:02:41.209> that<00:02:41.530> okay<00:02:42.530> let's<00:02:42.770> get<00:02:42.920> open<00:02:43.370> this<00:02:43.520> thing

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
insert the white ones into the

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.040 
insert the white ones into the
motherboard<00:03:00.970> then<00:03:01.970> you<00:03:02.239> have<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.600> black<00:03:02.810> ones

motherboard then you have the black ones

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.699 
motherboard then you have the black ones
inserted<00:03:03.680> with<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.750> socket<00:03:07.030> with<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.709> frames

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
inserted with the socket with the frames

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.190 
inserted with the socket with the frames
whatever<00:03:10.570> and<00:03:11.570> you<00:03:11.660> have<00:03:11.780> two<00:03:11.930> screws<00:03:12.140> to

okay first thing you see is the cooler

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.229 
okay first thing you see is the cooler
itself<00:03:35.680> as<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:36.769> can<00:03:36.950> see<00:03:37.070> it<00:03:37.250> is<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.820> is<00:03:38.030> not

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
itself as you can see it is it is not

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.780 
itself as you can see it is it is not
copper<00:03:38.600> heat<00:03:39.079> it<00:03:39.230> it<00:03:40.040> does<00:03:40.220> not<00:03:40.250> have<00:03:40.549> any

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
copper heat it it does not have any

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.430 
copper heat it it does not have any
copper<00:03:41.239> pipes<00:03:41.480> or<00:03:41.660> anything<00:03:41.840> of<00:03:42.110> that<00:03:44.320> but<00:03:45.320> it

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
copper pipes or anything of that but it

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.490 
copper pipes or anything of that but it
is<00:03:45.560> pretty<00:03:45.799> good<00:03:46.040> enough<00:03:47.200> here<00:03:48.200> are<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.380> ways

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
is pretty good enough here are the ways

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.310 
is pretty good enough here are the ways
of<00:03:48.739> if<00:03:49.130> being<00:03:49.519> silent<00:03:49.970> it<00:03:50.120> is<00:03:50.570> not<00:03:50.959> connected

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
of if being silent it is not connected

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.699 
of if being silent it is not connected
to<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:52.510> actual<00:03:53.510> thing<00:03:55.930> so<00:03:56.930> yeah<00:03:57.110> and

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
to the actual thing so yeah and

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.400 
to the actual thing so yeah and
obviously<00:03:57.860> you<00:03:58.220> have<00:03:58.310> to<00:03:58.370> cord<00:03:59.200> so<00:04:00.200> that's

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
obviously you have to cord so that's

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.850 
obviously you have to cord so that's
that<00:04:00.620> just<00:04:01.190> turn<00:04:01.430> that<00:04:01.459> upside<00:04:01.760> down<00:04:02.650> put<00:04:03.650> that

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
that just turn that upside down put that

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.460 
that just turn that upside down put that
right<00:04:04.070> there

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
right there

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.770 
right there
okay<00:04:06.489> the<00:04:07.489> last<00:04:07.669> thing<00:04:07.850> is<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.449> mounting

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
okay the last thing is the mounting

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.000 
okay the last thing is the mounting
brackets

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
brackets

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.120 
brackets
just<00:04:10.489> take<00:04:10.670> that<00:04:10.849> out<00:04:10.909> and<00:04:12.580> have<00:04:13.580> it<00:04:13.700> on<00:04:13.819> there

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
just take that out and have it on there

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.110 
just take that out and have it on there
all<00:04:16.130> right<00:04:16.310> so<00:04:16.609> basically<00:04:18.760> see<00:04:19.760> the<00:04:19.790> black

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
all right so basically see the black

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.219 
all right so basically see the black
ones<00:04:20.359> on<00:04:20.720> here

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
ones on here

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.330 
ones on here
you<00:04:22.070> attach<00:04:22.280> it<00:04:22.310> right<00:04:22.790> onto<00:04:22.970> here<00:04:24.340> picking

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
you attach it right onto here picking

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.120 
you attach it right onto here picking
whichever<00:04:25.910> one<00:04:26.180> it<00:04:26.539> is<00:04:26.650> but<00:04:27.650> remember<00:04:27.740> it<00:04:28.100> is

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
whichever one it is but remember it is

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.900 
whichever one it is but remember it is
for<00:04:28.490> elf<00:04:28.850> it's<00:04:29.690> for<00:04:30.760> 11<00:04:31.760> 56<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:32.600> 775<00:04:33.470> and<00:04:33.910> I

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
for elf it's for 11 56 and 775 and I

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.400 
for elf it's for 11 56 and 775 and I
believe<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.720> closer<00:04:36.710> socket<00:04:38.020> the<00:04:39.020> first<00:04:39.229> one

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
believe the closer socket the first one

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.080 
believe the closer socket the first one
over<00:04:39.530> here<00:04:39.889> that's<00:04:40.880> for<00:04:41.180> a<00:04:41.650> 7<00:04:42.650> 7<00:04:42.830> 5<00:04:43.039> and<00:04:43.370> 11<00:04:43.610> 56

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
over here that's for a 7 7 5 and 11 56

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.750 
over here that's for a 7 7 5 and 11 56
you'll<00:04:44.930> figure<00:04:45.139> it<00:04:45.260> out

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
you'll figure it out

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.689 
you'll figure it out
now<00:04:46.760> I've<00:04:46.910> already<00:04:47.120> had<00:04:47.510> this<00:04:47.690> in<00:04:47.960> my<00:04:48.139> computer

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
now I've already had this in my computer
