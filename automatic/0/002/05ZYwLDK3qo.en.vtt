00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hello everyone, Eugene is with you again 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:11.309
 last lessons we have learned 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:14.340
 cut apples and as I promised you 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.980
 today we will make such an element 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.029
 carrot can make this element 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:25.710
 cucumber for which you need it 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.490
 eat when you start practicing 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.320
 carving then some ask show 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.410
 show something there that you can 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.170
 do a quick so here I am 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.629
 the element is also the fastest 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.100
 Do you urgently need to decorate a salad? 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.079
 any dish can be made 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.850
 This item is very fast and thus 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.969
 that is, you gain time for us 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.510
 need for this carrot and wide 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.230
 wide knife and of course thai where 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.129
 without it, let's start what we will do 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:09.000
 eat i took the carrots i put on half here 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:15.240
 cut in half now I will cut the carrot 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:19.140
 still in half here and here if the cuts 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.049
 look at this 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.820
 angles that is we need to make perfect 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.490
 square 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:31.310
 what we do for this is putting our 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.310
 about half the table 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.310
 cut off 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.770
 turn over the workpiece and cut it off 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.770
 the top 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:53.610
 all our preparation is ready now I have it 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:59.090
 trim a little wide knife 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.090
 that is, you need to round the corners a little 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:08.790
 from below here we have 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:14.000
 such a cigar at the end of the semicircular that we 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:17.210
 do further and I take a Thai knife and 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.540
 making simple movements that is 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:27.050
 I pull the leaf that is this one 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:34.520
 corner squeezing looking for some knife inside 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:37.290
 I deduce our again and again mean respect 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.540
 that is, with this element I am late calls 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.900
 Moscow, that is, I wanted a Chinese restaurant 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.000
 I'm just very interested and here 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.660
 These are this element. That is, they are fast. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.670
 very make these bells called them 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.360
 bells 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:58.760
 I'll cut this part now 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.760
 and now do the same 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:10.430
 like this with one carrot you can 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:10.430
 get 10 to 20 of these flowers 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.550
 here twisting if the example is not taken out 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:28.380
 The main thing is not to pick, we cut 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:28.380
 carrot should go out itself that is 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:39.620
 Cutting through Cutting through even here a multiple of 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.719
 here that is now at the moment ate 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.209
 three flowers on 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:53.370
 what do we do next as I told you 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:59.159

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:11.310
 decorate that is on a toothpick so in 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:13.560
 right place the center of the bell 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.320
 yes that is, the center of this flower can 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.320
 put some red berry 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:26.400
 or for example you can have a fish dish 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.710
 put in there and roll either black or 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.710
 red will also complement 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:42.180

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.000
