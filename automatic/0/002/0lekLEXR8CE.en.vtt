actually kind of relaxing at first when
I<00:04:30.150> received<00:04:31.150> a<00:04:31.360> fight<00:04:31.750> I<00:04:32.080> didn't<00:04:32.410> know<00:04:32.470> what<00:04:32.620> to

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
I received a fight I didn't know what to

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.210 
I received a fight I didn't know what to
expect<00:04:32.770> on<00:04:33.280> it<00:04:33.460> but<00:04:33.669> it's<00:04:34.180> fun<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:35.220> relaxing

expect on it but it's fun and relaxing

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.279 
expect on it but it's fun and relaxing
space<00:04:36.520> which<00:04:36.970> is<00:04:37.090> kind<00:04:37.360> of<00:04:37.419> evil<00:04:37.780> also<00:04:38.110> but

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
space which is kind of evil also but

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:39.510 
space which is kind of evil also but
you're<00:04:38.410> not<00:04:38.530> hurting<00:04:38.860> anyone

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
you're not hurting anyone

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.790 
you're not hurting anyone
and<00:04:39.690> they're<00:04:40.690> just<00:04:40.840> bugs<00:04:41.139> so<00:04:41.470> you're<00:04:41.650> not

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
and they're just bugs so you're not

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.360 
and they're just bugs so you're not
doing<00:04:42.070> any<00:04:42.660> bad<00:04:43.660> thing<00:04:44.050> right<00:04:44.229> here<00:04:44.500> you<00:04:45.220> can

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
doing any bad thing right here you can

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:52.800 
doing any bad thing right here you can
create<00:04:45.580> like<00:04:45.789> a<00:04:45.970> laser<00:04:46.750> feel<00:04:50.669> they<00:04:51.669> get<00:04:52.090> killed

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
create like a laser feel they get killed

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.940 
create like a laser feel they get killed
that<00:04:53.080> they<00:04:54.060> touch<00:04:55.060> one<00:04:55.330> of<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.570> lasers

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
that they touch one of the lasers

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.520 
that they touch one of the lasers
let's<00:04:57.729> see<00:04:57.910> if<00:04:57.970> we<00:04:58.030> can<00:04:58.120> drop<00:04:58.300> mines<00:04:58.690> and<00:04:59.139> the

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
let's see if we can drop mines and the

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.240 
let's see if we can drop mines and the
game<00:05:00.570> so<00:05:01.570> if<00:05:01.810> they<00:05:01.990> go<00:05:02.200> over<00:05:02.530> the<00:05:02.620> mines<00:05:02.919> they

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
game so if they go over the mines they

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.310 
game so if they go over the mines they
they<00:05:04.150> die<00:05:04.560> we<00:05:05.560> can<00:05:05.740> use<00:05:06.340> a<00:05:06.510> missile<00:05:07.510> a<00:05:07.750> rocket

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
they die we can use a missile a rocket

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.930 
they die we can use a missile a rocket
launcher<00:05:10.740> did<00:05:11.740> you<00:05:11.860> see<00:05:12.039> how<00:05:12.190> I<00:05:12.460> kill<00:05:12.820> them

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
launcher did you see how I kill them

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.230 
launcher did you see how I kill them
with<00:05:13.120> a<00:05:13.150> rocket<00:05:13.539> launcher<00:05:13.570> now<00:05:14.099> we<00:05:15.099> can<00:05:15.520> use<00:05:15.789> if

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
with a rocket launcher now we can use if

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.640

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
go

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.879 
go
in<00:05:25.610> theory<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.330> screen<00:05:26.599> so<00:05:27.379> you<00:05:27.560> all<00:05:27.680> see<00:05:27.860> it

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
in theory the screen so you all see it

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.689 
in theory the screen so you all see it
and<00:05:28.580> there<00:05:29.180> was<00:05:29.360> an<00:05:29.449> insult<00:05:29.750> Sousa<00:05:30.639> kind<00:05:31.639> of

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
and there was an insult Sousa kind of

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.360 
and there was an insult Sousa kind of
matches<00:05:32.030> with<00:05:32.210> the<00:05:32.300> picture<00:05:32.860> we<00:05:33.860> can<00:05:33.949> use<00:05:34.220> an

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
matches with the picture we can use an

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.600 
matches with the picture we can use an
earthquake<00:05:34.909> so<00:05:35.720> I'll<00:05:36.710> wait<00:05:36.949> for<00:05:37.190> it<00:05:37.220> to<00:05:37.430> load

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
earthquake so I'll wait for it to load

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.710 
earthquake so I'll wait for it to load
and<00:05:37.940> if<00:05:38.330> I<00:05:38.449> shake<00:05:38.690> my<00:05:38.810> device<00:05:40.389> actually<00:05:41.389> has<00:05:41.599> a

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
and if I shake my device actually has a

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.260 
and if I shake my device actually has a
press<00:05:41.960> heart<00:05:42.229> if<00:05:43.009> I<00:05:43.190> press<00:05:43.490> on<00:05:43.639> the<00:05:43.759> screen<00:05:43.819> and

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
press heart if I press on the screen and

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.999 
press heart if I press on the screen and
the<00:05:44.330> earthquake<00:05:44.659> kills<00:05:44.960> all<00:05:45.199> the<00:05:45.349> bugs<00:05:47.860> we<00:05:48.860> can

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
the earthquake kills all the bugs we can

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:51.969 
the earthquake kills all the bugs we can
use<00:05:49.190> a<00:05:49.759> stealth<00:05:50.479> bomber<00:05:50.599> and<00:05:51.289> drop<00:05:51.800> an

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
use a stealth bomber and drop an
