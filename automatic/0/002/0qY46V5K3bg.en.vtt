looks<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.289> bazooka<00:00:40.859> kinda<00:00:41.690> so<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.289> can

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
looks like a bazooka kinda so it you can

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.509 
looks like a bazooka kinda so it you can
put<00:00:43.679> it<00:00:43.769> around<00:00:44.010> your<00:00:44.719> shoulder<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:47.070> takes

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
put it around your shoulder and it takes

put it around your shoulder and it takes
a<00:00:48.589> cylinder<00:00:49.589> of<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.609> map<00:00:51.420> gas<00:00:51.780> but<00:00:52.679> I'd

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
a cylinder of the map gas but I'd

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.329 
a cylinder of the map gas but I'd
suggest<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.329> look<00:00:54.600> at<00:00:54.749> the<00:00:55.100> video<00:00:56.100> on

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
suggest that you look at the video on

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.719 
suggest that you look at the video on
the<00:00:56.370> website<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:57.269> launches<00:00:58.109> what<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.309> launches

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
the website it launches what it launches

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.290 
the website it launches what it launches
bumpers<00:01:00.179> it<00:01:00.989> makes<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.350> sound<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.769> a<00:01:01.859> shotgun

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
bumpers it makes the sound of a shotgun

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.119 
bumpers it makes the sound of a shotgun
while<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.510> lot<00:01:03.749> launches<00:01:04.440> them<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
while it lot launches them but the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.219 
while it lot launches them but the
advantages<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.600> saw<00:01:06.960> for<00:01:07.170> myself

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
advantages of it that I saw for myself

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.539 
advantages of it that I saw for myself
are<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.810> you<00:01:09.810> don't<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.500> keep<00:01:10.740> putting

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
are that you don't have to keep putting

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.459 
are that you don't have to keep putting
shells<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.360> sometimes<00:01:13.079> the<00:01:13.200> shells

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 
shells in it sometimes the shells

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.370 
shells in it sometimes the shells
misfire<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.570> fact<00:01:15.719> that<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.229> move

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
misfire I like the fact that I can move

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.929 
misfire I like the fact that I can move
around<00:01:16.530> with<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.189> just<00:01:17.399> put<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> bumper

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
around with it and just put the bumper

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.929 
around with it and just put the bumper
on<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> end<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.539> it<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.490> shoot<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.579> whatever<00:01:20.850> I

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
on the end of it and shoot it whatever I

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.899 
on the end of it and shoot it whatever I
want<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.750> simulates<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.700> shotgun<00:01:23.700> so

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
want and that it simulates a shotgun so

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.190 
want and that it simulates a shotgun so
it's<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.149> shotgun<00:01:24.930> shell<00:01:25.320> it's<00:01:25.680> totally<00:01:26.009> safe

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
it's a shotgun shell it's totally safe

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.620
