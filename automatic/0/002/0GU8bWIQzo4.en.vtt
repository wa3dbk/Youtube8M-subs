would you is good I haven't tried this
out<00:01:30.299> yet<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.720> there<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> glitch<00:01:31.770> hopefully

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
out yet so there is a glitch hopefully

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.039 
out yet so there is a glitch hopefully
still<00:01:32.520> there<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.820> do<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.420> exit<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.900> go

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
still there you do this you exit you go

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.620 
still there you do this you exit you go
back<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:35.009> go<00:01:35.130> into<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> dropper<00:01:35.820> no

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
back in and you go into the dropper no

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.899 
back in and you go into the dropper no
because<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.740> glitch<00:01:38.159> was<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.610> spawn

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
because you do the glitch was you spawn

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.030 
because you do the glitch was you spawn
back<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.270> there<00:01:39.479> but<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.170> guess<00:01:40.650> we<00:01:40.829> have<00:01:41.009> to

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
back up there but I guess we have to

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.679 
back up there but I guess we have to
take<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.610> let's<00:01:41.970> go<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.150> level<00:01:42.390> two<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.570> guess

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
take this let's go to level two I guess

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.800 
take this let's go to level two I guess
alright<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.310> often<00:01:44.610> level<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:45.119> ok<00:01:45.750> so

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
alright so this is often level one ok so

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.950 
alright so this is often level one ok so
we<00:01:45.899> break<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.710> think<00:01:47.149> all<00:01:48.149> right<00:01:48.360> let's<00:01:48.810> do

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
we break this I think all right let's do

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.370 
we break this I think all right let's do
this<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.649> more<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.860> down<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.340> go<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.880> more

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
this the more you down you go the more

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.630 
this the more you down you go the more
checkpoints<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.740> stuff<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.100> get<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.280> guess

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
checkpoints and stuff you get I guess

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.050 
checkpoints and stuff you get I guess
all<00:01:53.970> right<00:01:54.210> level<00:01:54.960> two<00:01:55.259> no<00:01:56.189> signs<00:01:56.579> telling<00:01:56.850> us

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
all right level two no signs telling us

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.810 
all right level two no signs telling us

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
only flaw with this is I fall under the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.590 
only flaw with this is I fall under the
world<00:03:15.209> which<00:03:15.500> sucks<00:03:16.500> oh<00:03:17.150> yeah<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.299> took<00:03:18.450> me

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
world which sucks oh yeah it took me

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.910 
world which sucks oh yeah it took me
quite<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.810> while<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.049> do<00:03:19.320> this<00:03:19.500> just<00:03:19.769> because

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
quite a while to do this just because

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.710 
quite a while to do this just because
the<00:03:20.130> map<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:20.820> huge<00:03:21.269> I<00:03:21.390> think<00:03:21.570> I<00:03:21.660> should

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
the map is so huge I think I should

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.170 
the map is so huge I think I should
realize<00:03:22.140> how<00:03:22.260> big<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.590> was<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:23.610> she<00:03:23.670> said<00:03:23.970> um

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
realize how big it was so she said um

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.240 
realize how big it was so she said um
yeah<00:03:24.480> hopefully<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:25.110> can<00:03:25.170> yes<00:03:25.530> okay<00:03:25.980> that's

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
yeah hopefully I can yes okay that's

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.670 
yeah hopefully I can yes okay that's
that's<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.640> I've<00:03:26.880> forgot<00:03:27.570> about<00:03:27.690> that<00:03:27.750> so

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680
