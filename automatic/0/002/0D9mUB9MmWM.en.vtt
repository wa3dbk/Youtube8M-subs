00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
what's going on over one this is dr. 13

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.350 
what's going on over one this is dr. 13
and<00:00:10.530> today<00:00:10.740> i'll<00:00:10.830> be<00:00:10.860> doing<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.340> review<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.940> the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
and today i'll be doing a review of the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.810 
and today i'll be doing a review of the
new<00:00:12.509> lightning<00:00:12.929> connector<00:00:13.620> for<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.160> iphone<00:00:14.549> 5

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
new lightning connector for the iphone 5

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.240 
new lightning connector for the iphone 5
all<00:00:15.330> right<00:00:15.599> so<00:00:15.809> as<00:00:15.839> we<00:00:16.230> all<00:00:16.350> know<00:00:16.560> Apple<00:00:17.220> has

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
all right so as we all know Apple has

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.370 
all right so as we all know Apple has
decided<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.970> go<00:00:18.119> with<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.390> new<00:00:18.750> 8-pin<00:00:19.350> connector

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
decided to go with a new 8-pin connector

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.170 
decided to go with a new 8-pin connector
instead<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.310> original<00:00:20.400> 30<00:00:20.939> pin<00:00:21.150> connector

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
instead of the original 30 pin connector

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.890 
instead of the original 30 pin connector
and<00:00:21.750> they<00:00:22.230> call<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.619> lightning<00:00:22.890> now<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.510> not

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
and they call it lightning now it is not

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.279 
and they call it lightning now it is not
USB<00:00:25.289> 3.0<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.160> still<00:00:26.400> USB<00:00:27.119> 2.0<00:00:27.420> Slyke<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
USB 3.0 it's still USB 2.0 Slyke the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.109 
USB 3.0 it's still USB 2.0 Slyke the
original<00:00:28.680> 30<00:00:28.859> pin<00:00:29.039> connector<00:00:29.070> but<00:00:29.910> they<00:00:30.060> do

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
original 30 pin connector but they do

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.290 
original 30 pin connector but they do
claim<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.410> faster<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.180> can

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
claim that it is faster and as you can

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.110 
claim that it is faster and as you can
see<00:00:33.329> from<00:00:33.899> my<00:00:34.110> comparison<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.309> did<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.670> is

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
see from my comparison I just did it is

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.360 
see from my comparison I just did it is
a<00:00:36.149> lot<00:00:36.570> smaller<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.590> USB<00:00:38.100> side

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
a lot smaller and this is the USB side

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.220 
a lot smaller and this is the USB side
of<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.700> cables<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.629> as<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.809> can<00:00:39.930> see<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
of the cables and as you can see the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.220 
of the cables and as you can see the
Lightning<00:00:40.559> one<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.860> smaller<00:00:41.100> too<00:00:41.250> but<00:00:42.110> here<00:00:43.110> is

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
Lightning one is smaller too but here is

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.569 
Lightning one is smaller too but here is
the<00:00:43.260> 30<00:00:43.590> pin<00:00:43.800> connector<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.340> how<00:00:44.520> you

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
the 30 pin connector this is how you

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.979 
the 30 pin connector this is how you
originally<00:00:45.120> had<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.300> plug<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.840> only

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
originally had to plug in and you only

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.020 
originally had to plug in and you only
can<00:00:46.230> plug<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.710> one<00:00:46.920> way<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.399> it's<00:00:47.910> just

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
can plug it in one way and it's just

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.459 
can plug it in one way and it's just
harder<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.390> put<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.050> took<00:00:49.230> up<00:00:49.350> more

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
harder to put in and it took up more

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.049 
harder to put in and it took up more
space<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:49.980> bottom<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.250> your<00:00:50.309> device<00:00:50.610> of

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
space in the bottom of your device of

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.490 
space in the bottom of your device of
your<00:00:51.360> device<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.629> as<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.320> see<00:00:52.379> right

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
your device and as you can see right

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.840 
your device and as you can see right
here<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.920> couldn't<00:00:53.219> put<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> other

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
here you couldn't put it in the other

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.660 
here you couldn't put it in the other
way<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.360> wouldn't<00:00:54.750> go<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.320> that's<00:00:55.949> one

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
way just wouldn't go in and that's one

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.920 
way just wouldn't go in and that's one
thing<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.910> really<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.539> about<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.809> new

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
thing I really like about the new

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.450 
thing I really like about the new
lightning<00:00:58.140> connector<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.010> lot<00:00:59.280> easier

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
lightning connector is it's a lot easier

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.580 
lightning connector is it's a lot easier
to<00:00:59.820> put<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.210> takes<00:01:00.780> up<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.989> lot<00:01:01.140> less<00:01:01.170> space<00:01:01.559> in

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
to put in takes up a lot less space in

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.569 
to put in takes up a lot less space in
the<00:01:01.770> bottom<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.129> as<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.489> right

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the bottom and as you can see right

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.240 
the bottom and as you can see right
there<00:01:03.049> you<00:01:04.049> can<00:01:04.199> put<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.619> either<00:01:04.860> way<00:01:05.189> you

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
there you can put it in either way you

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.789 
there you can put it in either way you
can<00:01:05.400> put<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.720> way<00:01:06.780> or<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.439> can<00:01:07.560> flip

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
can put it in that way or you can flip

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.950 
can put it in that way or you can flip
it<00:01:07.920> over<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:09.150> can<00:01:09.180> put<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> other

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
it over and you can put it in the other

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.840 
it over and you can put it in the other
way<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.530> really<00:01:11.159> really<00:01:11.280> liked<00:01:11.520> how<00:01:11.729> they

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
way and I really really liked how they

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.640 
way and I really really liked how they
did<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.869> think<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.320> really<00:01:13.470> nice

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
did that and I think it's really nice

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.249 
did that and I think it's really nice
but<00:01:13.890> now<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.369> important<00:01:15.030> part<00:01:15.270> as<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.170> can

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
but now on the important part as you can

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.810 
but now on the important part as you can
see<00:01:16.439> right<00:01:16.470> here<00:01:16.770> i<00:01:16.830> have<00:01:17.070> itunes<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.759> i'm

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
see right here i have itunes and i'm

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.240 
see right here i have itunes and i'm
sinking<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> exact<00:01:18.810> same<00:01:19.080> things<00:01:19.409> onto<00:01:19.710> my

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
sinking the exact same things onto my

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.010 
sinking the exact same things onto my
and<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.700> they<00:01:21.000> were<00:01:21.060> both<00:01:21.270> done<00:01:21.840> at

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
and this is they were both done at

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.270 
and this is they were both done at
separate<00:01:22.350> times<00:01:22.530> i'm<00:01:22.830> sinking<00:01:24.259> 191<00:01:25.259> songs<00:01:25.560> to

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
separate times i'm sinking 191 songs to

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.819 
separate times i'm sinking 191 songs to
my<00:01:26.549> 4s<00:01:27.090> through<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.869> 30<00:01:28.080> pin<00:01:28.290> connector<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
my 4s through the 30 pin connector the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.890 
my 4s through the 30 pin connector the
original<00:01:29.189> one<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.520> i'm<00:01:30.030> sinking<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.600> exact

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
original one and i'm sinking the exact

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.410 
original one and i'm sinking the exact
same<00:01:31.140> thing<00:01:31.439> 191<00:01:32.369> songs<00:01:32.640> through<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
same thing 191 songs through the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.370 
same thing 191 songs through the
lightning<00:01:33.780> connector<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.409> my<00:01:34.530> iphone<00:01:34.710> 5<00:01:35.250> now

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
lightning connector to my iphone 5 now

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.990 
lightning connector to my iphone 5 now
like<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.560> said<00:01:37.920> these<00:01:38.250> were<00:01:38.460> filmed<00:01:38.850> at

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
like I just said these were filmed at

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.640 
like I just said these were filmed at
separate<00:01:39.360> times<00:01:39.540> they<00:01:39.840> weren't<00:01:40.049> at<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> exact

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
separate times they weren't at the exact

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.230 
separate times they weren't at the exact
same<00:01:40.829> time<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:42.049> it's<00:01:43.049> not<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> huge<00:01:43.890> difference

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
same time and it's not a huge difference

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.700 
same time and it's not a huge difference
the<00:01:45.240> third<00:01:45.420> lightning<00:01:45.750> connector<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.229> not<00:01:46.470> as

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
the third lightning connector is not as

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.679 
the third lightning connector is not as
big<00:01:47.189> as<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.520> difference<00:01:48.030> as<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.329> would<00:01:48.479> be

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
big as the difference as it would be

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.920 
big as the difference as it would be
between<00:01:49.110> USB<00:01:49.649> 3.0<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.340> USB<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.850> Pune<00:01:51.149> but<00:01:51.750> it

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
between USB 3.0 and USB to Pune but it

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.980 
between USB 3.0 and USB to Pune but it
is<00:01:52.110> still<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.979> lot<00:01:53.189> faster<00:01:53.759> than<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.479> original

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
is still a lot faster than the original

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.230 
is still a lot faster than the original
30<00:01:55.290> pin<00:01:55.530> connector<00:01:55.560> which<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.430> really<00:01:56.939> really

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
30 pin connector which I really really

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.850 
30 pin connector which I really really
like<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.689> I'm<00:01:57.780> really<00:01:58.079> glad<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.380> Apple

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
like and I'm really glad that Apple

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.950 
like and I'm really glad that Apple
decided<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.759> include<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.390> lightning

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
decided to include this lightning

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.630 
decided to include this lightning
connector<00:02:01.439> but<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.860> course<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.430> would<00:02:02.549> have

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
connector but of course it would have

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.310 
connector but of course it would have
been<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.759> little<00:02:02.939> better<00:02:03.240> if<00:02:03.479> they<00:02:04.049> could<00:02:04.259> have

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
been a little better if they could have

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.679 
been a little better if they could have
kept<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.740> exact<00:02:05.070> same<00:02:05.100> thing<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:05.729> USB<00:02:06.180> 3.0

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
kept it the exact same thing but USB 3.0

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.109 
kept it the exact same thing but USB 3.0
but<00:02:07.380> still<00:02:07.649> once<00:02:08.069> again<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.399> really<00:02:08.729> like<00:02:08.910> it

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
but still once again I really like it

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.420 
but still once again I really like it
because<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:10.229> takes<00:02:10.470> up<00:02:10.649> less<00:02:10.860> space<00:02:10.920> on<00:02:11.160> the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
because it takes up less space on the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.240 
because it takes up less space on the
bottom<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.760> your<00:02:11.790> device

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
bottom of your device

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.880 
bottom of your device
it<00:02:12.670> looks<00:02:13.060> nicer<00:02:13.450> it's<00:02:13.660> easier<00:02:13.990> to<00:02:14.110> put<00:02:14.290> in<00:02:14.410> you

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
it looks nicer it's easier to put in you

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.820 
it looks nicer it's easier to put in you
can<00:02:15.010> put<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.250> in<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.460> know<00:02:15.580> both<00:02:15.790> ways<00:02:16.270> and

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
can put it in you know both ways and

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.940 
can put it in you know both ways and
also<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:18.100> is<00:02:18.580> faster<00:02:19.270> but<00:02:19.540> once<00:02:20.320> again<00:02:20.410> if<00:02:20.770> it

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
also it is faster but once again if it

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.170 
also it is faster but once again if it
was<00:02:21.070> USB<00:02:21.430> 3.0<00:02:22.710> as<00:02:23.710> you<00:02:24.160> can<00:02:24.280> see<00:02:24.520> both<00:02:24.850> of<00:02:25.090> them

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
was USB 3.0 as you can see both of them

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.850 
was USB 3.0 as you can see both of them
are<00:02:25.330> almost<00:02:25.630> finished<00:02:25.840> with<00:02:26.110> syncing<00:02:26.590> but<00:02:26.770> the

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
are almost finished with syncing but the

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.170 
are almost finished with syncing but the
lightning<00:02:27.130> connector<00:02:27.490> is<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.670> little<00:02:28.090> bit

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
lightning connector is a little bit

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.760 
lightning connector is a little bit
ahead<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:28.660> depends<00:02:29.320> on<00:02:29.410> how<00:02:29.500> much<00:02:29.620> you're

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
ahead and depends on how much you're

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.890 
ahead and depends on how much you're
putting<00:02:30.040> on<00:02:30.160> your<00:02:30.220> device<00:02:31.150> for<00:02:31.450> how<00:02:31.540> much<00:02:31.690> of<00:02:31.840> a

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
putting on your device for how much of a

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.510 
putting on your device for how much of a
speed<00:02:32.140> difference<00:02:32.290> there<00:02:32.650> is<00:02:32.680> but<00:02:33.040> as<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.459> can

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
speed difference there is but as you can

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.310 
speed difference there is but as you can
see<00:02:33.700> right<00:02:33.730> there<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.150> iphone<00:02:34.660> 5<00:02:34.870> lightning

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
see right there the iphone 5 lightning

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.830 
see right there the iphone 5 lightning
connector<00:02:35.650> just<00:02:35.920> finished<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:36.660> there<00:02:37.660> we<00:02:37.810> go

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
connector just finished and there we go

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.449 
connector just finished and there we go
the<00:02:38.050> 30<00:02:38.260> pin<00:02:38.440> connector<00:02:38.470> just<00:02:38.980> finished<00:02:39.280> so

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
the 30 pin connector just finished so

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.570 
the 30 pin connector just finished so
with<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:40.450> amount<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:41.010> storage<00:02:42.010> well<00:02:42.370> that

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
with that amount of storage well that

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.729 
with that amount of storage well that
amount<00:02:42.820> of<00:02:42.940> data<00:02:43.090> was<00:02:43.360> putting<00:02:43.630> on<00:02:43.720> 191<00:02:44.350> songs

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
amount of data was putting on 191 songs

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.280 
amount of data was putting on 191 songs
it<00:02:45.040> was<00:02:45.370> around<00:02:45.550> a<00:02:45.730> 5<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.450> 10<00:02:46.870> second

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
it was around a 5 to 10 second

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.330 
it was around a 5 to 10 second
difference<00:02:47.620> somewhere<00:02:47.830> around<00:02:48.010> there<00:02:48.310> I

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
difference somewhere around there I

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.820 
difference somewhere around there I
don't<00:02:48.459> know<00:02:48.670> exact<00:02:49.090> but<00:02:49.690> anyways<00:02:50.110> guys<00:02:50.320> that

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
don't know exact but anyways guys that

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.979 
don't know exact but anyways guys that
has<00:02:51.010> been<00:02:51.220> my<00:02:51.370> review<00:02:51.430> of<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:52.540> Lightning

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
has been my review of the Lightning

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.229 
has been my review of the Lightning
connector<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:54.489> it's<00:02:54.700> also<00:02:54.850> been<00:02:55.090> my

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
connector and it's also been my

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.400 
connector and it's also been my
comparison<00:02:55.810> between<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.080> lightning

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
comparison between the lightning

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.620 
comparison between the lightning
connector<00:02:56.770> in<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.100> 30<00:02:57.310> pin<00:02:57.489> connector

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
connector in the 30 pin connector

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
connector in the 30 pin connector
