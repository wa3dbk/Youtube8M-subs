00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.130 
not my most comfortable shoe to wear I
normally<00:01:55.530> prefer<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:56.430> lower<00:01:57.270> cut<00:01:57.600> shoe<00:01:57.869> and

normally prefer a lower cut shoe and
since<00:01:58.380> these<00:01:58.530> are<00:01:58.590> our<00:01:58.799> meds<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.369> think<00:02:00.299> that's

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
since these are our meds I think that's

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.840 
since these are our meds I think that's
why<00:02:00.630> they<00:02:00.780> feel<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.990> little<00:02:01.170> bit<00:02:01.320> uncomfortable
