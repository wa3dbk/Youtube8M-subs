00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
trying to dig around for some crystals

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.830 
trying to dig around for some crystals
to<00:01:44.189> make<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.610> crown<00:01:45.210> that's<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.659> rule<00:01:45.810> a

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
to make a a crown that's going to rule a

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.510 
to make a a crown that's going to rule a
world<00:01:45.930> or<00:01:46.259> something<00:01:46.439> but<00:01:46.799> we<00:01:47.250> could<00:01:47.430> have

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
world or something but we could have

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.980 
world or something but we could have
just<00:01:47.670> told<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.149> passing<00:01:48.360> don't<00:01:48.899> worry

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
just told that in passing don't worry

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.370 
just told that in passing don't worry
about<00:01:49.049> too<00:01:49.259> much<00:01:49.290> about<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.710> anyway<00:01:50.210> so<00:01:51.380> we

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
about too much about that anyway so we

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.749 
about too much about that anyway so we
have<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.560> good<00:01:52.710> bit<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.950> lineup<00:01:53.250> change<00:01:53.549> in

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
have a good bit of a lineup change in

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.910 
have a good bit of a lineup change in
regards<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.540> initial<00:01:55.350> four<00:01:55.530> warriors

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
regards to the initial four warriors

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.170 
regards to the initial four warriors
will<00:01:56.130> come<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.369> through<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> second<00:01:57.000> but

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
will come on through in a second but

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.789 
will come on through in a second but
essentially<00:01:57.960> it's<00:01:58.079> kind<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.290> defending<00:01:58.710> this

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
essentially it's kind of defending this

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.109

multi-million pound or dollar cinema

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.190 
multi-million pound or dollar cinema
release<00:02:17.240> own<00:02:17.450> obviously<00:02:17.840> they're<00:02:17.990> going<00:02:18.110> to

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
release own obviously they're going to

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.410 
release own obviously they're going to
have<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.530> sort<00:02:18.770> of<00:02:18.830> take<00:02:19.430> shortcuts<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.240> do

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
have to sort of take shortcuts and do

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.260 
have to sort of take shortcuts and do
things<00:02:20.630> on<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.840> cheap<00:02:21.220> so<00:02:22.220> let's<00:02:22.910> talk<00:02:23.060> about

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
things on the cheap so let's talk about

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.540 
things on the cheap so let's talk about
the<00:02:23.390> negatives<00:02:23.840> first<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.290> guess<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:25.310> first

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
the negatives first I guess so the first

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.340 
the negatives first I guess so the first
thing<00:02:25.820> here<00:02:26.060> is<00:02:26.210> it<00:02:26.330> does<00:02:26.600> have<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:27.050> kind<00:02:27.320> of

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
thing here is it does have that kind of

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.630 
thing here is it does have that kind of
that's<00:02:28.100> cheaper<00:02:28.760> feel<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.210> it<00:02:29.680> there's<00:02:30.680> not<00:02:31.610> a

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
that's cheaper feel to it there's not a

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.110 
that's cheaper feel to it there's not a
lot<00:02:31.820> of<00:02:31.850> cast<00:02:32.180> here<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:33.620> kind<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.730> action

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
lot of cast here the kind of the action

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.000 
lot of cast here the kind of the action
is<00:02:35.210> all<00:02:35.330> sort<00:02:35.630> of<00:02:35.720> fairly<00:02:36.440> poorly

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
is all sort of fairly poorly

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.940 
is all sort of fairly poorly
choreographed<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:38.720> acting<00:02:39.200> unfortunately

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
choreographed the acting unfortunately

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.490 
choreographed the acting unfortunately
for<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.460> most<00:02:40.700> part<00:02:41.000> anyway<00:02:41.270> is<00:02:41.690> kind<00:02:42.350> of

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
for the most part anyway is kind of

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.920 
for the most part anyway is kind of
quite<00:02:42.710> poor<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.160> quite<00:02:43.370> accepted<00:02:44.210> the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
quite poor and quite accepted the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.560 
quite poor and quite accepted the
effects<00:02:45.590> are<00:02:45.800> kind<00:02:45.980> of<00:02:46.100> fairly<00:02:46.580> minimal<00:02:47.060> the

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
effects are kind of fairly minimal the

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.270 
effects are kind of fairly minimal the
makeup<00:02:47.990> effects<00:02:48.320> on<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.590> actual<00:02:48.890> creatures

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
makeup effects on the actual creatures

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.120 
makeup effects on the actual creatures
themselves<00:02:50.290> are<00:02:51.290> actually<00:02:51.440> quite<00:02:51.860> laughable

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
themselves are actually quite laughable

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.490 
themselves are actually quite laughable
to<00:02:52.730> be<00:02:52.820> literally<00:02:53.390> looks<00:02:53.570> like<00:02:53.660> paper<00:02:54.020> mache

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
to be literally looks like paper mache

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.110 
to be literally looks like paper mache
on<00:02:54.770> certain<00:02:55.550> ones<00:02:56.000> anyway<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:58.040> you<00:02:58.790> know<00:02:58.820> it

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
on certain ones anyway so you know it

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.470 
on certain ones anyway so you know it
sounds<00:02:59.420> terrible<00:02:59.840> doesn't<00:02:59.900> it<00:03:00.200> but<00:03:00.950> I<00:03:01.450> have<00:03:02.450> to

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
sounds terrible doesn't it but I have to

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.050 
sounds terrible doesn't it but I have to
say<00:03:02.780> this<00:03:03.350> has<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.650> genuine<00:03:04.160> sense<00:03:04.460> of<00:03:04.640> fun<00:03:04.850> to

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
say this has a genuine sense of fun to

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.920 
say this has a genuine sense of fun to
it<00:03:05.240> and<00:03:05.590> on<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.650> technical<00:03:07.280> level<00:03:07.310> it<00:03:07.850> kind<00:03:08.720> of<00:03:08.840> a

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
it and on a technical level it kind of a

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.380 
it and on a technical level it kind of a
shot<00:03:09.380> far<00:03:10.100> better<00:03:10.460> than<00:03:10.640> it<00:03:10.760> deserves<00:03:10.880> to<00:03:11.300> be

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
shot far better than it deserves to be

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.940 
shot far better than it deserves to be
so<00:03:11.720> on<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:11.960> technical<00:03:12.320> level<00:03:12.410> the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
so on the technical level the

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.550 
so on the technical level the
cinematography<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:15.140> kind<00:03:15.350> of<00:03:15.410> the

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
cinematography and the kind of the

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.950 
cinematography and the kind of the
lighting<00:03:16.010> stuff<00:03:16.250> like<00:03:16.520> that<00:03:16.730> I<00:03:17.000> think<00:03:17.450> looks

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
lighting stuff like that I think looks

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.710 
lighting stuff like that I think looks
pretty<00:03:18.260> damn<00:03:18.560> good<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:19.250> pretty

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
pretty damn good and pretty

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.660 
pretty damn good and pretty
professionally<00:03:20.720> made<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:20.960> have<00:03:21.320> to<00:03:21.440> say<00:03:21.650> so<00:03:21.710> it

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
professionally made I have to say so it

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.430 
professionally made I have to say so it
kind<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.180> my<00:03:23.390> sometimes<00:03:23.990> you<00:03:24.260> forget

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
kind of you my sometimes you forget

you're<00:03:24.770> kind<00:03:24.950> of<00:03:24.980> watching<00:03:25.160> a<00:03:25.430> very<00:03:25.520> cheap

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
you're kind of watching a very cheap

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.790 
you're kind of watching a very cheap
film<00:03:26.450> if<00:03:26.660> that<00:03:26.780> makes<00:03:26.990> sense<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.410> you<00:03:27.470> kind<00:03:27.740> of

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
film if that makes sense and you kind of

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.430 
film if that makes sense and you kind of
just<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.430> weight<00:03:28.610> of<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:29.690> shot<00:03:29.990> and<00:03:30.110> the

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
just the weight of the shot and the

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.680 
just the weight of the shot and the
story<00:03:30.680> kind<00:03:30.860> of<00:03:30.950> flows<00:03:31.220> even<00:03:32.120> though<00:03:32.330> it<00:03:32.480> has

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
story kind of flows even though it has

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.220 
story kind of flows even though it has
some<00:03:32.720> cheesy<00:03:33.440> and<00:03:33.890> convoluted<00:03:34.430> bits<00:03:34.850> it<00:03:35.030> just

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
some cheesy and convoluted bits it just

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.900 
some cheesy and convoluted bits it just
feels<00:03:36.230> like<00:03:36.440> it's<00:03:36.710> a<00:03:36.770> kind<00:03:37.010> of<00:03:37.160> a<00:03:37.370> slightly

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
feels like it's a kind of a slightly

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.760 
feels like it's a kind of a slightly
higher<00:03:38.180> production<00:03:39.080> value<00:03:39.470> than<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:39.680> actually

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
higher production value than it actually

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.800 
higher production value than it actually
is<00:03:40.070> and<00:03:40.310> all<00:03:40.400> of<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.610> sudden<00:03:40.720> basically<00:03:41.720> all

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
is and all of a sudden basically all

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.380 
is and all of a sudden basically all
kind<00:03:41.990> of<00:03:42.050> it<00:03:42.200> is<00:03:42.320> is<00:03:42.800> currency<00:03:43.100> pan<00:03:43.520> looks<00:03:44.209> kind

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390

of<00:03:44.450> lame<00:03:44.630> in<00:03:44.810> certain<00:03:45.080> places<00:03:45.760> so<00:03:46.760> this<00:03:46.940> is

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
of lame in certain places so this is

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.270 
of lame in certain places so this is
there<00:03:47.270> it's<00:03:47.870> quite<00:03:48.140> a<00:03:48.170> simple<00:03:48.440> story<00:03:48.920> but<00:03:49.220> I

have<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.520> say<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.820> other<00:03:49.880> thing<00:03:50.420> about<00:03:50.510> is<00:03:50.840> the

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
have to say the other thing about is the

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.810 
have to say the other thing about is the
characters<00:03:51.530> are<00:03:51.620> all<00:03:51.770> quite<00:03:52.040> kind<00:03:52.340> of<00:03:52.459> fun<00:03:52.670> as

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
characters are all quite kind of fun as

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.030 
characters are all quite kind of fun as
well<00:03:52.910> this<00:03:53.510> is<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.690> other<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:54.530> good<00:03:54.740> thing<00:03:55.010> to

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
well this is the other the good thing to

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.590 
well this is the other the good thing to
it<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.400> can't<00:03:55.610> really<00:03:55.700> do<00:03:56.000> buy<00:03:56.240> into<00:03:56.510> the

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
it you can't really do buy into the

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.270 
it you can't really do buy into the
characters<00:03:57.080> though<00:03:57.620> I<00:03:57.650> have<00:03:57.860> a<00:03:57.920> couple<00:03:58.130> of

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
characters though I have a couple of

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.280 
characters though I have a couple of
nibel<00:03:58.640> to<00:03:58.760> that<00:03:58.940> so<00:03:59.360> like<00:03:59.510> I<00:03:59.660> said<00:03:59.720> it<00:04:00.140> doesn't

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
nibel to that so like I said it doesn't

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.900 
nibel to that so like I said it doesn't
have<00:04:00.410> a<00:04:00.500> huge<00:04:00.709> card<00:04:01.070> which<00:04:01.220> is<00:04:01.310> probably<00:04:01.670> a<00:04:01.760> to

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
have a huge card which is probably a to

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.430 
have a huge card which is probably a to
its<00:04:02.030> benefit<00:04:02.450> to<00:04:02.540> be<00:04:02.690> honest<00:04:02.900> because<00:04:03.080> you<00:04:03.260> do

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
its benefit to be honest because you do

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.820 
its benefit to be honest because you do
kind<00:04:04.130> of<00:04:04.220> get<00:04:04.370> to<00:04:04.520> know<00:04:04.640> these<00:04:05.500> these<00:04:06.500> kind<00:04:06.740> of
