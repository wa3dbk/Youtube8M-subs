00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
not like a rheostat it has clicks well

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.120

the<00:01:49.039> next<00:01:49.460> click<00:01:49.820> up<00:01:50.060> it's<00:01:50.300> 70<00:01:51.080> some<00:01:51.380> degrees<00:01:51.770> I

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
the next click up it's 70 some degrees I

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.090 
the next click up it's 70 some degrees I
put<00:01:53.000> it<00:01:53.119> on<00:01:53.240> all<00:01:54.050> the<00:01:54.170> way<00:01:54.289> on<00:01:54.410> cold<00:01:54.710> it's<00:01:55.009> too
