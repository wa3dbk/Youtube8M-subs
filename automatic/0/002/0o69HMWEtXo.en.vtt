00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
really simple so I just kind of decided

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.900 
really simple so I just kind of decided
to<00:00:13.139> like<00:00:13.290> put<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.650> off<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> little<00:00:14.190> bit<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.730> then

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
state so basically that kind of means

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.640
