00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
really good price and I thought I'd

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.830 
really good price and I thought I'd
actually<00:00:46.350> like<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.950> smaller<00:00:47.280> size<00:00:47.640> more<00:00:48.450> than

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840

thinking i would sell this intro to pay
for<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.989> then<00:00:58.079> actually<00:00:58.410> after<00:00:58.680> getting

the<00:02:03.270> barely<00:02:03.600> legal<00:02:03.630> here<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:05.070> overall<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.880> is

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
the barely legal here so overall it is

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
believe and my intro i think is october

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.300 
believe and my intro i think is october
so<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.810> little<00:02:44.080> bit<00:02:44.260> newer<00:02:44.530> but<00:02:44.680> not<00:02:44.980> by<00:02:45.130> much

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
so a little bit newer but not by much

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.780 
so a little bit newer but not by much
but<00:02:45.870> overall<00:02:46.870> very<00:02:47.019> very<00:02:47.470> similar<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.010> my

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
but overall very very similar to my

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.300 
but overall very very similar to my
intro<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:50.110> blade<00:02:50.350> shape<00:02:50.590> is<00:02:50.860> slightly

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
intro the blade shape is slightly

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.490 
intro the blade shape is slightly
different<00:02:51.940> this<00:02:52.150> one<00:02:52.330> has<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.570> Bowie<00:02:53.110> style

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500

blade with the clip point going on up

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.330 
blade with the clip point going on up
here<00:02:57.480> whereas<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:58.660> one<00:02:58.720> does<00:02:59.050> not<00:02:59.340> however

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
here whereas this one does not however

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.340 
here whereas this one does not however
from<00:03:00.700> what<00:03:00.880> I've<00:03:01.000> seen<00:03:01.030> he'll<00:03:01.540> do<00:03:01.720> both<00:03:02.019> style

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
from what I've seen he'll do both style

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.949 
from what I've seen he'll do both style
blades<00:03:02.709> and<00:03:03.040> either<00:03:03.400> models<00:03:03.970> so<00:03:04.239> it's<00:03:04.750> not<00:03:04.930> a

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
blades and either models so it's not a

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.320 
blades and either models so it's not a
matter<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.350> this<00:03:05.620> one<00:03:05.800> having<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.430> clip<00:03:07.090> point

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.690 
matter of this one having the clip point
this<00:03:07.510> one<00:03:07.720> not<00:03:07.930> you<00:03:08.680> can<00:03:08.800> get<00:03:08.950> them<00:03:09.069> either<00:03:09.400> way

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
this one not you can get them either way

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.840 
this one not you can get them either way

this<00:03:21.730> caliber<00:03:22.209> particularly<00:03:22.870> in<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.079> exact

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
this caliber particularly in the exact

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.030 
this caliber particularly in the exact
same<00:03:23.650> configuration<00:03:24.750> maybe<00:03:25.750> if<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.709> barely

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
same configuration maybe if the barely

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.580 
same configuration maybe if the barely
legal<00:03:27.329> was<00:03:28.329> something<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:28.810> little<00:03:28.959> different<00:03:29.200> I

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
legal was something a little different I

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.289 
legal was something a little different I
wouldn't<00:03:30.130> be<00:03:30.220> able<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.459> give<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:30.790> up<00:03:30.910> but

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
wouldn't be able to give it up but

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.190 
wouldn't be able to give it up but
seeing<00:03:32.230> how<00:03:32.410> they<00:03:32.680> are<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.130> same

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
seeing how they are the same

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.789 
seeing how they are the same
configuration<00:03:35.850> set<00:03:36.850> to<00:03:37.000> let<00:03:37.120> it<00:03:37.209> go<00:03:37.329> but<00:03:37.799> I

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
configuration set to let it go but I

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.349
