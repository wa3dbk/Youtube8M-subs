00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.979 
didn't go too deep into design with them
just<00:00:34.850> because<00:00:35.059> I<00:00:35.300> wanted<00:00:35.510> to<00:00:35.629> show<00:00:35.809> you<00:00:35.840> that

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
they can be quite flexible as something

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
besides just a banner decor so I'm using

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.079 
besides just a banner decor so I'm using
them<00:00:42.109> as<00:00:42.230> light<00:00:42.469> fixtures<00:00:43.070> in<00:00:43.100> here<00:00:43.640> now<00:00:44.030> the

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
them as light fixtures in here now the

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.329 
them as light fixtures in here now the
back<00:00:44.539> of<00:00:44.749> them<00:00:44.870> were<00:00:44.989> kind<00:00:45.230> of<00:00:45.289> exposed<00:00:45.769> but

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
back of them were kind of exposed but

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.309 
back of them were kind of exposed but
that's<00:00:46.489> not<00:00:46.670> necessarily<00:00:46.909> a<00:00:47.539> terrible<00:00:48.050> thing

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:48.319 
that's not necessarily a terrible thing

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:51.040 
that's not necessarily a terrible thing
it<00:00:48.949> does<00:00:49.370> give<00:00:49.730> it<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:49.940> little<00:00:50.239> bit<00:00:50.480> different

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
it does give it a little bit different

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.139 
it does give it a little bit different
add<00:00:51.230> then<00:00:51.710> just<00:00:52.039> bringing<00:00:52.519> down<00:00:52.670> let's<00:00:52.999> say

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
add then just bringing down let's say

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:54.729 
add then just bringing down let's say
metal<00:00:53.449> bores<00:00:53.659> or<00:00:53.960> glass<00:00:54.199> for<00:00:54.499> the<00:00:54.530> light

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
metal bores or glass for the light

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.680 
metal bores or glass for the light
fixture<00:00:55.249> and<00:00:55.399> I<00:00:55.729> think<00:00:55.999> it<00:00:56.120> worked<00:00:56.300> very<00:00:56.420> well

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
fixture and I think it worked very well

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.860 
fixture and I think it worked very well
also<00:00:57.409> incorporate<00:00:58.280> them<00:00:58.719> incorporated<00:00:59.719> them

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
also incorporate them incorporated them

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.509 
also incorporate them incorporated them
in<00:01:00.019> front<00:01:00.379> of<00:01:00.499> these<00:01:00.620> black<00:01:00.979> stain<00:01:01.249> glass

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
in front of these black stain glass

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.309 
in front of these black stain glass
panes<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:02.149> use<00:01:02.690> them<00:01:02.870> as<00:01:02.989> kind<00:01:03.229> of<00:01:03.260> like

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:03.319 
panes and use them as kind of like

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:05.380 
panes and use them as kind of like
curtains<00:01:03.829> now<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.430> cool<00:01:04.699> thing<00:01:04.729> about<00:01:04.940> these

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
curtains now the cool thing about these

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.320 
curtains now the cool thing about these
is<00:01:05.449> they<00:01:05.810> stack<00:01:06.170> so<00:01:06.530> watch<00:01:07.190> this<00:01:07.490> if<00:01:07.970> I<00:01:08.180> go

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
is they stack so watch this if I go

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.570 
is they stack so watch this if I go
ahead<00:01:08.450> and<00:01:08.600> select<00:01:08.930> one<00:01:09.350> I<00:01:09.560> can<00:01:10.040> use<00:01:10.250> it<00:01:10.430> like

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
ahead and select one I can use it like

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.460 
ahead and select one I can use it like
this<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.150> then<00:01:11.450> I<00:01:11.540> can<00:01:11.720> use<00:01:11.870> it<00:01:11.900> like<00:01:12.170> that<00:01:12.409> and

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
this and then I can use it like that and

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.980 
this and then I can use it like that and
that<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.340> they<00:01:13.790> kind<00:01:14.060> of<00:01:14.120> connect<00:01:14.540> now<00:01:14.750> this<00:01:14.930> is

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
that so they kind of connect now this is

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.870 
that so they kind of connect now this is
the<00:01:15.140> sort<00:01:15.380> X<00:01:15.650> fan<00:01:15.860> wear<00:01:16.070> pack<00:01:16.310> I'm<00:01:16.490> not<00:01:16.670> too

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
the sort X fan wear pack I'm not too

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.480 
the sort X fan wear pack I'm not too
sure<00:01:17.150> how<00:01:17.690> that<00:01:17.930> translates<00:01:18.470> into<00:01:18.830> something

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
sure how that translates into something

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.640 
sure how that translates into something
like<00:01:19.580> fateful<00:01:20.060> or<00:01:20.210> default<00:01:20.600> but<00:01:21.140> all<00:01:21.320> in<00:01:21.500> all

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
like fateful or default but all in all

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.130 
like fateful or default but all in all
they<00:01:22.010> seem<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.490> overlap<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.210> it<00:01:23.570> makes<00:01:23.780> quite

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
they seem to overlap and it makes quite

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.470 
they seem to overlap and it makes quite
a<00:01:24.440> great<00:01:25.040> curtain<00:01:25.550> I<00:01:25.730> really<00:01:26.030> really<00:01:26.270> like

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
a great curtain I really really like

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.170 
a great curtain I really really like
that<00:01:26.800> ended<00:01:27.800> up<00:01:27.890> using<00:01:28.100> some<00:01:28.490> lamps<00:01:28.850> in<00:01:29.150> the

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
that ended up using some lamps in the

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.930 
that ended up using some lamps in the
corners<00:01:29.630> my<00:01:30.140> classic<00:01:30.650> anvil<00:01:31.190> over<00:01:31.220> anvil

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
corners my classic anvil over anvil

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.270 
corners my classic anvil over anvil
crossed<00:01:32.300> up<00:01:32.540> with<00:01:33.110> a<00:01:33.320> glow<00:01:33.650> stone<00:01:33.860> block<00:01:34.100> and

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
crossed up with a glow stone block and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.370 
crossed up with a glow stone block and
behind<00:01:34.580> that<00:01:34.670> well<00:01:35.120> behind<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:35.900> redstone

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
behind that well behind the redstone

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.850 
behind that well behind the redstone
lamp<00:01:36.620> I<00:01:36.830> actually<00:01:37.130> have<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.900> hidden<00:01:38.900> redstone

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
lamp I actually have the hidden redstone

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.550 
lamp I actually have the hidden redstone
but<00:01:40.160> it<00:01:40.430> exposes<00:01:40.880> it<00:01:41.150> it<00:01:41.480> it<00:01:41.780> hides<00:01:42.110> it<00:01:42.320> quite

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
but it exposes it it it hides it quite

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.320 
but it exposes it it it hides it quite
well<00:01:42.770> so<00:01:42.830> it's<00:01:43.220> not<00:01:43.340> exposed<00:01:43.790> and<00:01:43.970> it<00:01:44.090> still

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
well so it's not exposed and it still

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.210 
well so it's not exposed and it still
looks<00:01:44.360> good<00:01:44.750> I<00:01:44.990> did<00:01:45.410> a<00:01:45.440> couple<00:01:45.650> of<00:01:45.860> inset

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
looks good I did a couple of inset

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.860 
looks good I did a couple of inset
shelving<00:01:46.700> with<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:46.970> yellow<00:01:47.300> and<00:01:47.480> then<00:01:47.630> with

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
shelving with the yellow and then with

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.750 
shelving with the yellow and then with
the<00:01:47.990> yellow<00:01:48.350> I<00:01:48.530> started<00:01:49.160> thinking<00:01:49.430> what's<00:01:49.640> a

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
the yellow I started thinking what's a

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.310 
the yellow I started thinking what's a
good<00:01:49.940> complementary<00:01:50.540> color<00:01:50.900> so<00:01:51.110> I've<00:01:51.200> decided

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
good complementary color so I've decided

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.920 
good complementary color so I've decided
to<00:01:51.710> go<00:01:51.860> with<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.190> regular<00:01:52.580> stained<00:01:52.880> clay<00:01:53.210> the

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
to go with the regular stained clay the

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.170 
to go with the regular stained clay the
hardened<00:01:54.230> clay<00:01:54.380> as<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:55.190> floor<00:01:55.490> now<00:01:55.970> in

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
hardened clay as the floor now in

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.430 
hardened clay as the floor now in
default<00:01:56.540> this<00:01:56.750> looks<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.080> little<00:01:57.260> bit

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
default this looks a little bit

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.780 
default this looks a little bit
different<00:01:57.890> which<00:01:58.040> you'd<00:01:58.190> probably<00:01:58.400> have<00:01:58.730> to

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
different which you'd probably have to

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.430 
different which you'd probably have to
do<00:01:59.060> is<00:01:59.210> maybe<00:01:59.390> change<00:01:59.750> just<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.020> orange

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
do is maybe change just the orange

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.530 
do is maybe change just the orange
instead<00:02:00.620> of<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.310> yellows<00:02:01.730> and<00:02:01.760> go<00:02:02.090> with<00:02:02.270> red

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
instead of the yellows and go with red

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.780 
instead of the yellows and go with red
sand<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:03.110> I<00:02:03.410> think<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.830> red<00:02:04.010> sand<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.640> the

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
sand and I think the red sand and the

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.670 
sand and I think the red sand and the
Horde<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:05.030> red<00:02:05.240> sand<00:02:05.570> blocks<00:02:05.900> would<00:02:06.440> look

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
Horde and red sand blocks would look

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.199 
Horde and red sand blocks would look
really<00:02:06.920> really<00:02:07.190> good<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.610> complement<00:02:08.179> that

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
really really good to complement that

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.910 
really really good to complement that
but<00:02:08.539> today<00:02:08.569> I<00:02:08.780> wanted<00:02:09.019> to<00:02:09.140> go<00:02:09.259> with<00:02:09.379> yellow<00:02:09.619> I

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
but today I wanted to go with yellow I

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.160 
but today I wanted to go with yellow I
did<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.399> small<00:02:10.700> entrance<00:02:11.180> rug<00:02:11.540> just<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:11.930> kind<00:02:12.110> of

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
did a small entrance rug just to kind of

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.350 
did a small entrance rug just to kind of
give<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.470> room<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.830> variation<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:13.879> I<00:02:14.180> did<00:02:14.330> a

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
give the room a variation and I did a

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.479 
give the room a variation and I did a
little<00:02:14.540> side<00:02:14.840> table<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.470> incorporated<00:02:16.370> a

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
little side table I incorporated a

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.100 
little side table I incorporated a
couple<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.819> paintings<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.420> not<00:02:17.690> only<00:02:17.810> add

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
couple of paintings to not only add

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.780 
couple of paintings to not only add
light<00:02:18.410> but<00:02:18.650> just<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.890> add<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.069> little<00:02:19.280> bit<00:02:19.610> to

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
light but just to add a little bit to

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.280 
light but just to add a little bit to
the<00:02:19.880> walls<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.300> wanted<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.569> stay<00:02:20.750> semi

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
the walls I wanted to stay semi

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.900 
the walls I wanted to stay semi
minimalistic

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
minimalistic

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.850 
minimalistic
I<00:02:22.970> did<00:02:23.300> this<00:02:23.450> cool<00:02:23.720> little<00:02:23.750> clock<00:02:24.200> design<00:02:24.410> now

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
I did this cool little clock design now

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.530 
I did this cool little clock design now
the<00:02:25.340> compass<00:02:25.760> actually<00:02:26.150> kind<00:02:26.330> of<00:02:26.360> works

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
the compass actually kind of works

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.540 
the compass actually kind of works
better<00:02:26.810> in<00:02:27.020> sort<00:02:27.290> x<00:02:27.500> fanfare<00:02:27.950> but<00:02:28.100> I<00:02:28.160> decided

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
better in sort x fanfare but I decided

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.340 
better in sort x fanfare but I decided
to<00:02:28.700> show<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:29.000> clock<00:02:29.210> just<00:02:29.480> to<00:02:29.600> see<00:02:29.780> what<00:02:30.260> it

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
to show the clock just to see what it

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.630 
to show the clock just to see what it
would<00:02:30.440> look<00:02:30.620> like<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.040> it's<00:02:31.130> not<00:02:31.310> too<00:02:31.490> bad

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
would look like and it's not too bad

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.550 
would look like and it's not too bad
since<00:02:31.910> it's<00:02:32.180> like<00:02:32.360> that<00:02:32.420> yellow<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.020> gold<00:02:33.170> tin

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
since it's like that yellow and gold tin

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.920 
since it's like that yellow and gold tin
the<00:02:34.280> black<00:02:34.550> is<00:02:34.760> quite<00:02:35.120> seamless<00:02:35.660> in<00:02:35.810> this

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
the black is quite seamless in this

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.020 
the black is quite seamless in this
texture<00:02:36.320> pack<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.980> can<00:02:37.010> probably<00:02:37.580> use<00:02:37.610> coal

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
texture pack you can probably use coal

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.880 
texture pack you can probably use coal
blocks<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.540> emulate<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.080> same<00:02:39.320> type<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:39.590> look

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
blocks to emulate the same type of look

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.610 
blocks to emulate the same type of look
in<00:02:40.100> vanilla<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:41.000> for<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.600> windows<00:02:41.990> I<00:02:42.230> also

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
in vanilla and for the windows I also

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.980 
in vanilla and for the windows I also
chose<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.220> light<00:02:43.400> grey<00:02:43.760> wool<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.720> went

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
chose the light grey wool that went

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.350 
chose the light grey wool that went
behind<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.620> windows<00:02:45.950> on<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.190> outside<00:02:46.670> so<00:02:47.240> it

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
behind the windows on the outside so it

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.150 
behind the windows on the outside so it
kind<00:02:47.570> of<00:02:47.630> shows<00:02:47.840> like<00:02:48.140> a<00:02:48.170> mini<00:02:48.500> blind<00:02:48.800> effect

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
kind of shows like a mini blind effect

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160 
kind of shows like a mini blind effect
or<00:02:49.310> whatever<00:02:49.580> all<00:02:49.970> in<00:02:50.180> all<00:02:50.300> it<00:02:50.510> really<00:02:50.840> really

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
or whatever all in all it really really

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.960 
or whatever all in all it really really
pulls<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.680> room<00:02:51.890> together<00:02:52.100> and<00:02:52.370> I<00:02:52.550> was<00:02:52.670> really

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
pulls the room together and I was really

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.730 
pulls the room together and I was really
happy<00:02:53.180> about<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:54.020> bed<00:02:54.230> is<00:02:54.260> something

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
happy about it the bed is something

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.350 
happy about it the bed is something
simple<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.190> use<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.490> yellow<00:02:55.670> stained<00:02:56.030> clay
