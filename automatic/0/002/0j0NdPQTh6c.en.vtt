have been certain outliers in the past
that<00:01:14.040> we've<00:01:14.189> seen<00:01:14.400> how<00:01:14.580> certain<00:01:14.850> decks<00:01:15.090> have

that we've seen how certain decks have

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.670 
that we've seen how certain decks have
been<00:01:15.420> slightly<00:01:15.659> more<00:01:15.960> complicated<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.500> play

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
been slightly more complicated to play

been slightly more complicated to play
but<00:01:17.640> after<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> wild<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.570> with<00:01:18.659> enough

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840

work type is pretty much had the same

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.620 
work type is pretty much had the same
several<00:01:40.020> things<00:01:40.259> um<00:01:40.759> it's<00:01:41.759> ha<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.329> has<00:01:42.479> an

blows a background something that blows
up<00:01:53.579> monsters<00:01:54.240> um<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:55.320> card<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.890> softlocks<00:01:56.460> the

to the game seeing as far as on you know
monster<00:02:14.300> wise<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:15.770> makes<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:15.980> really<00:02:16.130> easy

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
monster wise and it makes it really easy

monster wise and it makes it really easy
for<00:02:16.460> Konami<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:16.970> design<00:02:17.300> these<00:02:17.450> things<00:02:17.690> they

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
for Konami to design these things they

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.420 
for Konami to design these things they
pretty<00:02:17.990> much<00:02:18.080> just<00:02:18.230> slap<00:02:18.770> a<00:02:18.800> whole<00:02:19.070> new<00:02:19.220> name

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
pretty much just slap a whole new name

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.610 
pretty much just slap a whole new name
on<00:02:19.670> an<00:02:19.910> archetype<00:02:20.750> change<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.200> wording<00:02:21.560> here

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
on an archetype change the wording here

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.980 
on an archetype change the wording here
there<00:02:22.100> um<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:23.240> know<00:02:23.300> create<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:23.660> couple<00:02:23.810> new

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
there um you know create a couple new

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.570 
there um you know create a couple new
names<00:02:24.230> for<00:02:24.350> monsters<00:02:24.890> change<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.400> attack

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
names for monsters change the attack

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.180 
names for monsters change the attack
values<00:02:25.940> but<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.960> general<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.650> general<00:02:27.680> idea

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
values but the general the general idea

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.430 
values but the general the general idea
is<00:02:28.250> it's<00:02:28.460> really<00:02:28.760> simple<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.780> essentially

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
is it's really simple and essentially

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.840 
is it's really simple and essentially
it's<00:02:30.530> really<00:02:30.770> easy<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.340> go<00:02:31.640> between

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
it's really easy to go between

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.780 
it's really easy to go between
archetypes<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.600> themes<00:02:32.870> for<00:02:33.110> players<00:02:33.790> that

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
archetypes and themes for players that

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.440 
archetypes and themes for players that
want<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.330> is<00:02:35.360> um<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.850> I<00:02:37.970> think<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.300> makes

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
want to that is um and I think it makes

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.720 
want to that is um and I think it makes
it<00:02:38.660> really<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:39.680> makes<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.950> game<00:02:40.070> more<00:02:40.280> simple

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
it really it makes the game more simple

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.730 
it really it makes the game more simple
believe<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.060> or<00:02:41.150> not<00:02:41.240> as<00:02:41.510> far<00:02:41.750> as<00:02:41.780> competition

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
believe it or not as far as competition

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.940 
believe it or not as far as competition
you<00:02:43.370> kinda<00:02:43.730> like<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:44.900> know<00:02:45.080> what<00:02:45.590> every<00:02:45.830> deck

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
you kinda like you know what every deck

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.860 
you kinda like you know what every deck
is<00:02:46.070> going<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.280> do<00:02:46.370> it<00:02:46.460> doesn't<00:02:47.000> really<00:02:47.120> make

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
is going to do it doesn't really make

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.240 
is going to do it doesn't really make
every<00:02:48.140> deck<00:02:48.290> centralized<00:02:48.800> sort<00:02:49.070> his<00:02:49.160> own

thing like every deck all this he's
going<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.420> have<00:02:50.540> its<00:02:50.690> own<00:02:50.780> goal<00:02:51.050> um<00:02:51.320> some<00:02:52.280> decks

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
going to have its own goal um some decks

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.460 
going to have its own goal um some decks
all<00:02:52.580> have<00:02:52.700> their<00:02:52.880> own<00:02:52.910> specific<00:02:53.210> mechanic<00:02:53.990> to

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
all have their own specific mechanic to

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.250 
all have their own specific mechanic to
what<00:02:54.590> they<00:02:54.710> do<00:02:54.770> whether<00:02:55.310> it<00:02:55.460> be<00:02:55.640> a<00:02:56.260> milling

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
what they do whether it be a milling

what they do whether it be a milling
whether<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:57.740> be<00:02:58.720> drawing<00:02:59.720> cards<00:03:00.290> whether<00:03:00.410> it

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
whether it be drawing cards whether it

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.080 
whether it be drawing cards whether it
be<00:03:00.680> protecting<00:03:01.220> each<00:03:01.250> other<00:03:01.430> whether<00:03:01.790> it<00:03:01.970> be

be protecting each other whether it be

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.540 
be protecting each other whether it be
flow<00:03:02.420> of<00:03:02.690> being<00:03:02.960> a<00:03:03.050> floater<00:03:03.380> whether<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:04.460> be

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
flow of being a floater whether it be

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.760 
flow of being a floater whether it be
flipping<00:03:05.060> like<00:03:05.210> your<00:03:05.420> dolls<00:03:05.630> um<00:03:06.260> just

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
flipping like your dolls um just

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.310 
flipping like your dolls um just
anything<00:03:07.040> along<00:03:07.250> that<00:03:07.310> nature<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:08.320> themes

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
anything along that nature and themes

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.630 
anything along that nature and themes
make<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.620> game<00:03:09.770> really<00:03:10.010> simple<00:03:10.430> in<00:03:10.520> my

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
make the game really simple in my

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.090 
make the game really simple in my
opinion<00:03:10.910> they<00:03:11.210> don't<00:03:11.360> really<00:03:11.690> they<00:03:12.170> add<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.530> new

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
opinion they don't really they add a new

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.350 
opinion they don't really they add a new
level<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.060> game<00:03:14.240> where<00:03:14.540> it's<00:03:15.200> not<00:03:15.410> a<00:03:15.440> it's

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
level to the game where it's not a it's

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.460 
level to the game where it's not a it's
not<00:03:17.360> like<00:03:17.660> we're<00:03:17.810> every<00:03:18.080> deck<00:03:18.230> isn't

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
not like we're every deck isn't

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.020 
not like we're every deck isn't
necessarily<00:03:18.980> going<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.250> be<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.460> same<00:03:19.670> just

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
necessarily going to be the same just

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.310 
necessarily going to be the same just
because<00:03:20.300> like<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.630> themes<00:03:20.960> or<00:03:21.170> what

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
because like the themes or what

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.230 
because like the themes or what
separates<00:03:21.740> like<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.010> names<00:03:22.280> typically<00:03:22.940> and

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
separates like the names typically and

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.640 
separates like the names typically and
some<00:03:23.660> of<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.780> mechanics<00:03:23.900> behind<00:03:24.320> that<00:03:24.590> I

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
some of the mechanics behind that I

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.100 
some of the mechanics behind that I
separate<00:03:25.190> them<00:03:25.400> but<00:03:25.940> they<00:03:26.090> don't<00:03:26.270> really<00:03:26.480> it's

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
separate them but they don't really it's

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.960 
separate them but they don't really it's
not<00:03:27.230> like<00:03:27.290> before<00:03:27.740> we're<00:03:28.070> a<00:03:28.100> live<00:03:28.430> son<00:03:28.850> of

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
not like before we're a live son of

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.800 
not like before we're a live son of
generic<00:03:29.270> cards<00:03:29.630> and<00:03:29.780> um<00:03:31.210> in<00:03:32.210> certain<00:03:32.600> decks

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
generic cards and um in certain decks

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.260 
generic cards and um in certain decks
and<00:03:33.110> players<00:03:33.530> could<00:03:33.770> pretty<00:03:33.980> much<00:03:34.070> just<00:03:34.460> just

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
and players could pretty much just just

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.730 
and players could pretty much just just
use<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.630> one<00:03:35.810> generic<00:03:36.110> deck<00:03:36.350> that<00:03:36.500> was<00:03:36.620> the

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
use the one generic deck that was the

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.560 
use the one generic deck that was the
most<00:03:36.890> optimal<00:03:37.340> version<00:03:37.700> of<00:03:37.760> that<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.420> change

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
most optimal version of that and change

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.930 
most optimal version of that and change
it<00:03:38.780> to<00:03:38.810> whatever<00:03:39.430> event<00:03:40.430> they<00:03:40.550> want<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.790> play

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
it to whatever event they want to play

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.670 
it to whatever event they want to play
right<00:03:41.120> now<00:03:41.150> it<00:03:41.810> makes<00:03:42.110> everything<00:03:42.410> really

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
right now it makes everything really

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.950 
right now it makes everything really
simple<00:03:43.250> as<00:03:43.400> far<00:03:43.610> as<00:03:43.760> how<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.120> deck<00:03:44.480> is<00:03:44.630> played

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
simple as far as how the deck is played

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.780 
simple as far as how the deck is played
and<00:03:45.260> it's<00:03:45.590> kind<00:03:45.830> of<00:03:45.860> just<00:03:46.010> spoon<00:03:46.370> fed<00:03:46.640> to

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
and it's kind of just spoon fed to

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.670 
and it's kind of just spoon fed to
players<00:03:47.140> which<00:03:48.140> is<00:03:48.260> probably<00:03:48.440> a<00:03:48.560> negative

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
players which is probably a negative

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.230 
players which is probably a negative
which<00:03:49.010> we'll<00:03:49.130> talk<00:03:49.160> about<00:03:49.310> in<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:49.730> next<00:03:49.790> video

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
which we'll talk about in the next video

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.080 
which we'll talk about in the next video
um<00:03:50.560> but<00:03:51.560> it<00:03:51.980> kind<00:03:52.190> of<00:03:52.250> gives<00:03:52.400> people<00:03:52.790> like<00:03:52.820> as

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
um but it kind of gives people like as

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.550 
um but it kind of gives people like as
soon<00:03:53.270> as<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.480> theme<00:03:53.660> is<00:03:53.780> released<00:03:54.110> in<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.350> set

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
soon as the theme is released in a set

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.890 
soon as the theme is released in a set
um<00:03:54.830> you<00:03:55.640> pretty<00:03:55.850> much<00:03:55.940> know<00:03:56.390> whether<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:56.810> be

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
um you pretty much know whether it be

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.630 
um you pretty much know whether it be
from<00:03:56.990> the<00:03:57.140> ocg<00:03:57.620> or<00:03:57.740> just<00:03:57.980> from<00:03:58.160> reading<00:03:58.430> the

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
from the ocg or just from reading the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.080 
from the ocg or just from reading the
cards<00:03:58.940> when<00:03:59.270> you<00:03:59.330> get<00:03:59.510> them<00:03:59.720> um<00:04:00.220> what's<00:04:01.220> what

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
cards when you get them um what's what

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.460 
cards when you get them um what's what
should<00:04:02.300> be<00:04:02.450> played<00:04:02.690> in<00:04:02.720> and<00:04:02.990> what<00:04:03.110> should<00:04:03.320> be

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
should be played in and what should be

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.390 
should be played in and what should be
played<00:04:03.710> in<00:04:03.740> it<00:04:04.040> I<00:04:04.100> mean<00:04:04.250> you're<00:04:04.370> obviously

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
played in it I mean you're obviously

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.010 
played in it I mean you're obviously
prank<00:04:04.850> me<00:04:04.970> playing<00:04:05.210> some<00:04:05.480> one<00:04:05.660> of<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:05.780> three

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
prank me playing some one of the three

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.050 
prank me playing some one of the three
of<00:04:06.170> draw<00:04:06.350> cards<00:04:06.680> you'll<00:04:06.860> be<00:04:06.950> playing<00:04:07.220> I<00:04:07.490> don't

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
of draw cards you'll be playing I don't

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.370 
of draw cards you'll be playing I don't
know<00:04:08.120> like<00:04:08.300> like<00:04:08.480> let's<00:04:08.780> take<00:04:09.020> I<00:04:09.170> don't<00:04:09.200> know

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
know like like let's take I don't know

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.170 
know like like let's take I don't know
so<00:04:09.530> tell<00:04:09.710> us<00:04:09.740> for<00:04:09.950> example<00:04:10.310> it's<00:04:10.640> obviously<00:04:11.120> a

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
so tell us for example it's obviously a

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.850 
so tell us for example it's obviously a
really<00:04:11.420> popular<00:04:11.570> deck<00:04:11.960> right<00:04:12.140> now<00:04:12.200> let's

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
really popular deck right now let's

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.980 
really popular deck right now let's
takes<00:04:13.040> to<00:04:13.130> tell<00:04:13.310> us<00:04:13.430> that<00:04:13.610> X<00:04:13.910> really<00:04:14.330> um<00:04:14.600> it's

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
takes to tell us that X really um it's

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
takes to tell us that X really um it's
really<00:04:15.050> straightforward<00:04:15.410> like<00:04:15.800> what<00:04:15.920> you're

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
really straightforward like what you're

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.900 
really straightforward like what you're
going<00:04:16.130> to<00:04:16.190> plan<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.489> you're<00:04:16.609> going<00:04:16.700> to<00:04:16.790> play

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
going to plan it you're going to play

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.460 
going to plan it you're going to play
the<00:04:17.060> three<00:04:17.270> debris<00:04:17.480> dragon<00:04:17.870> guide<00:04:18.020> as<00:04:18.290> an

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
the three debris dragon guide as an

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.810 
the three debris dragon guide as an
altar<00:04:18.739> you're<00:04:18.950> going<00:04:19.070> to<00:04:19.130> play<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.370> 32<00:04:19.640> nebs

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
altar you're going to play the 32 nebs

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.400 
altar you're going to play the 32 nebs
which<00:04:20.000> is<00:04:20.150> your<00:04:20.299> Stratos<00:04:20.810> which<00:04:21.290> is

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
which is your Stratos which is

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.110 
which is your Stratos which is
essentially<00:04:21.799> your<00:04:21.950> enabler<00:04:22.130> you're<00:04:22.940> going<00:04:23.060> to

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
essentially your enabler you're going to

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.629 
essentially your enabler you're going to
be<00:04:23.210> playing

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
be playing

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.520 
be playing
the<00:04:25.060> which<00:04:25.180> I'm<00:04:25.300> call<00:04:25.509> the<00:04:25.539> Vega<00:04:26.199> guy<00:04:26.469> the

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
the which I'm call the Vega guy the

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.379 
the which I'm call the Vega guy the
basically<00:04:27.159> the<00:04:27.280> Bogart<00:04:27.759> night<00:04:27.939> guy<00:04:28.150> he

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
basically the Bogart night guy he

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.300 
basically the Bogart night guy he
enables<00:04:28.780> someplace<00:04:29.050> like<00:04:29.620> and<00:04:29.860> there's<00:04:30.009> a<00:04:30.099> ton

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
enables someplace like and there's a ton

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.260 
enables someplace like and there's a ton
of<00:04:30.370> different<00:04:30.550> things<00:04:30.819> and<00:04:30.909> then<00:04:31.030> they<00:04:31.150> have

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
of different things and then they have

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.320 
of different things and then they have
their<00:04:31.389> boss<00:04:31.569> monster<00:04:32.050> in<00:04:32.259> there<00:04:32.469> in<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.969> Delta

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
their boss monster in there in the Delta

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.700 
their boss monster in there in the Delta
roast<00:04:34.509> or<00:04:34.659> whatever<00:04:34.840> it's<00:04:35.020> called<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.409> Exede

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
like it's really just like I said it

like it's really just like I said it
goes<00:05:06.879> back<00:05:07.060> to<00:05:07.090> that<00:05:07.240> whole<00:05:07.449> user<00:05:07.629> friendly

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
goes back to that whole user friendly

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.200 
goes back to that whole user friendly
thing<00:05:08.349> and<00:05:08.409> I<00:05:08.590> figure<00:05:08.919> that's<00:05:09.699> why<00:05:09.849> the<00:05:09.909> best

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
thing and I figure that's why the best

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.939 
thing and I figure that's why the best
thing<00:05:10.389> about<00:05:10.479> themes<00:05:10.840> oh<00:05:11.110> and<00:05:11.560> a<00:05:11.590> lot<00:05:11.740> of<00:05:11.770> those

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
thing about themes oh and a lot of those

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:12.899 
thing about themes oh and a lot of those
things<00:05:12.069> obviously<00:05:12.460> can<00:05:12.610> be<00:05:12.699> interpreted

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:12.909 
things obviously can be interpreted

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:14.790 
things obviously can be interpreted
differently<00:05:13.419> and<00:05:13.599> like<00:05:14.139> I<00:05:14.199> said<00:05:14.259> in<00:05:14.500> the<00:05:14.590> next

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
differently and like I said in the next

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.719 
differently and like I said in the next
video<00:05:14.979> we'll<00:05:15.099> be<00:05:15.129> talking<00:05:15.279> about<00:05:15.490> what<00:05:15.699> I

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
video we'll be talking about what I

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:17.519 
video we'll be talking about what I
think<00:05:16.029> themes<00:05:16.449> are<00:05:16.629> really<00:05:16.870> in<00:05:17.020> architecture

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:17.529 
think themes are really in architecture

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:19.980 
think themes are really in architecture
really<00:05:17.770> bad<00:05:17.919> for<00:05:18.129> this<00:05:18.279> game<00:05:18.430> um<00:05:18.900> like<00:05:19.900> I<00:05:19.960> said

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
really bad for this game um like I said

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.209 
really bad for this game um like I said
there's<00:05:20.289> there's<00:05:20.500> two<00:05:20.680> totally<00:05:21.069> different

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:21.219 
there's there's two totally different

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:22.769 
there's there's two totally different
spectrums<00:05:21.669> that<00:05:21.789> you<00:05:21.849> could<00:05:21.969> look<00:05:22.120> look<00:05:22.689> at

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:22.779 
spectrums that you could look look at

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:25.230 
spectrums that you could look look at
the<00:05:22.900> game<00:05:23.080> as<00:05:24.009> far<00:05:24.129> as<00:05:24.249> arc<00:05:24.430> types<00:05:24.669> of<00:05:24.969> the

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
the game as far as arc types of the

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.170 
the game as far as arc types of the
benefits<00:05:25.749> the<00:05:26.589> negatives<00:05:27.009> obviously<00:05:27.460> pros

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
benefits the negatives obviously pros

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.499 
benefits the negatives obviously pros
and<00:05:28.360> cons<00:05:28.509> that<00:05:28.719> is<00:05:29.129> so<00:05:30.129> there's<00:05:31.089> definitely<00:05:31.210> a

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 
and cons that is so there's definitely a

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:32.730 
and cons that is so there's definitely a
bunch<00:05:31.960> of<00:05:31.990> different<00:05:32.080> candidates<00:05:32.560> you<00:05:32.620> could

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
bunch of different candidates you could

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.990 
bunch of different candidates you could
go<00:05:32.860> off<00:05:32.979> there's<00:05:33.189> public<00:05:33.339> on<00:05:33.550> things<00:05:33.699> i<00:05:33.789> didn't

actually kind of should mention is a
themes<00:06:14.439> kind<00:06:14.649> of<00:06:14.710> bring<00:06:14.830> a<00:06:14.919> lot<00:06:15.069> more

themes kind of bring a lot more
diversity<00:06:15.639> the<00:06:15.819> game<00:06:15.969> especially<00:06:16.270> because

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:16.659 
diversity the game especially because

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:18.570 
diversity the game especially because
certain<00:06:17.139> themes<00:06:17.379> are<00:06:17.649> kind<00:06:18.219> of<00:06:18.279> on<00:06:18.370> a<00:06:18.430> level

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
certain themes are kind of on a level

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.249 
certain themes are kind of on a level
playing<00:06:18.879> field<00:06:19.149> it<00:06:19.389> makes<00:06:19.629> it<00:06:19.750> easier<00:06:19.990> for<00:06:20.229> a

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:20.259 
playing field it makes it easier for a

there should always is burning abyss in

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.510 
there should always is burning abyss in
there<00:06:25.870> it's<00:06:26.020> two<00:06:26.169> tellers<00:06:26.379> it's<00:06:27.159> kind<00:06:27.279> of<00:06:27.399> just

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
there it's two tellers it's kind of just

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.740 
there it's two tellers it's kind of just
like<00:06:27.610> a<00:06:27.729> circle<00:06:28.089> all<00:06:28.210> the<00:06:28.240> decks<00:06:28.509> to<00:06:28.629> either

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
like a circle all the decks to either

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.029 
like a circle all the decks to either
beat<00:06:29.080> each<00:06:29.229> other<00:06:29.379> I<00:06:29.649> mean<00:06:29.770> obvious<00:06:29.979> you

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 
beat each other I mean obvious you

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:31.350 
beat each other I mean obvious you
should<00:06:30.069> all<00:06:30.279> just<00:06:30.399> buy<00:06:30.550> the<00:06:30.610> best<00:06:30.879> out<00:06:31.120> of<00:06:31.149> the

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
should all just buy the best out of the

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.019 
should all just buy the best out of the
three<00:06:31.389> but<00:06:32.639> realistically<00:06:33.639> it's<00:06:33.819> kind<00:06:33.969> of

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:34.029 
three but realistically it's kind of

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:35.369 
three but realistically it's kind of
just<00:06:34.120> like<00:06:34.209> a<00:06:34.300> circle<00:06:34.719> and<00:06:34.810> all<00:06:34.930> that<00:06:35.050> X<00:06:35.169> either

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:35.379 
just like a circle and all that X either

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:36.950 
just like a circle and all that X either
beat<00:06:35.589> each<00:06:35.709> other<00:06:35.860> or<00:06:36.190> they're<00:06:36.339> kind<00:06:36.519> of<00:06:36.580> row

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
beat each other or they're kind of row

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.379 
beat each other or they're kind of row
to<00:06:37.110> be<00:06:37.289> equal<00:06:37.560> to<00:06:37.680> each<00:06:37.770> other<00:06:37.919> arm<00:06:38.310> and<00:06:39.210> it

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:39.389 
to be equal to each other arm and it

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:40.939 
to be equal to each other arm and it
kind<00:06:39.569> of<00:06:39.630> makes<00:06:39.810> it<00:06:40.020> diverse<00:06:40.470> in<00:06:40.680> its<00:06:40.770> own

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:40.949 
kind of makes it diverse in its own

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:42.409 
kind of makes it diverse in its own
sense<00:06:41.310> they<00:06:41.580> and<00:06:41.759> i<00:06:41.819> don't<00:06:42.030> mean<00:06:42.060> obviously

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 
sense they and i don't mean obviously

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:44.180 
sense they and i don't mean obviously
because<00:06:42.660> it's<00:06:42.810> just<00:06:42.840> three<00:06:43.080> decks<00:06:43.350> i<00:06:43.500> mean<00:06:44.069> in

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
because it's just three decks i mean in

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.559 
because it's just three decks i mean in
generally<00:06:44.550> it<00:06:44.669> makes<00:06:44.819> it<00:06:44.940> kind<00:06:45.090> of<00:06:45.120> diverse<00:06:45.419> in

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:45.569 
generally it makes it kind of diverse in

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:46.610 
generally it makes it kind of diverse in
the<00:06:45.630> sense<00:06:45.810> that<00:06:45.870> people<00:06:46.229> are<00:06:46.410> gonna<00:06:46.470> be

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
the sense that people are gonna be

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.719 
the sense that people are gonna be
wanting<00:06:46.860> to<00:06:46.919> play<00:06:47.069> different<00:06:47.190> themes<00:06:47.550> what

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:47.729 
wanting to play different themes what

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:50.809 
wanting to play different themes what
they<00:06:47.819> like<00:06:48.030> what<00:06:48.150> they<00:06:48.270> don't<00:06:48.300> like<00:06:48.479> um<00:06:49.819> it

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 
they like what they don't like um it

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:52.730 
they like what they don't like um it
makes<00:06:50.970> it<00:06:51.090> easier<00:06:51.389> for<00:06:51.630> for<00:06:52.349> the<00:06:52.410> game<00:06:52.590> to<00:06:52.710> be

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
makes it easier for for the game to be

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.170 
makes it easier for for the game to be
more<00:06:52.979> diverse<00:06:53.220> rather<00:06:53.550> than<00:06:53.729> it<00:06:53.849> being<00:06:53.880> like

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
more diverse rather than it being like

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.360 
more diverse rather than it being like
one<00:06:54.539> single<00:06:54.990> generic<00:06:55.380> duck<00:06:55.680> that's<00:06:56.220> just

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
one single generic duck that's just

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.890 
one single generic duck that's just
destroying<00:06:56.819> everything<00:06:57.120> and<00:06:57.419> it's<00:06:57.509> just

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
destroying everything and it's just

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.710 
destroying everything and it's just
pretty<00:06:58.169> much<00:06:58.380> mirror<00:06:58.710> match<00:06:58.860> based<00:06:59.099> um<00:06:59.720> and

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 
pretty much mirror match based um and

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.990 
pretty much mirror match based um and
beans<00:07:01.259> kind<00:07:01.560> of<00:07:01.650> allow<00:07:01.830> that<00:07:01.889> prevent<00:07:02.819> their

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 
beans kind of allow that prevent their

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.309 
beans kind of allow that prevent their
to<00:07:03.090> be<00:07:03.240> too<00:07:03.479> many<00:07:03.599> mere<00:07:03.840> matches<00:07:04.199> from

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 
to be too many mere matches from

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:06.860 
to be too many mere matches from
occurring<00:07:04.770> um<00:07:04.979> any<00:07:05.789> kind<00:07:06.030> of<00:07:06.120> they<00:07:06.720> don't

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:06.870 
occurring um any kind of they don't

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.110 
occurring um any kind of they don't
really<00:07:06.990> inhibit<00:07:07.460> diversity<00:07:08.460> they<00:07:08.639> promote

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 
really inhibit diversity they promote

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.450 
really inhibit diversity they promote
diversity<00:07:09.360> um<00:07:09.990> so<00:07:10.470> yeah<00:07:10.590> that's<00:07:11.070> pretty<00:07:11.220> much

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.460 
diversity um so yeah that's pretty much

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.740 
diversity um so yeah that's pretty much
it<00:07:11.520> let<00:07:11.849> me<00:07:11.880> know<00:07:11.940> what<00:07:12.060> you<00:07:12.180> guys<00:07:12.270> think<00:07:12.539> I

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:14.190 
kind of went off a lil bit of a tangent

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.920 
kind of went off a lil bit of a tangent
