break<00:02:22.820> number<00:02:23.820> three<00:02:24.210> is<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.510> film<00:02:24.930> that

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
break number three is a film that

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.600 
break number three is a film that
contains<00:02:25.500> maybe<00:02:25.770> it's<00:02:25.980> not<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.250> best<00:02:26.280> Disney

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610

the<00:02:28.410> best<00:02:28.620> performance<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.520> any<00:02:29.670> Disney<00:02:30.030> movie

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
the best performance of any Disney movie
