00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
could use an a connect stay I just

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.110 
could use an a connect stay I just
hadn't<00:03:46.659> recovered<00:03:47.790> just<00:03:48.790> here<00:03:49.090> on

straightforward<00:03:49.900> 60<00:03:50.229> degree<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:50.470> swear<00:03:50.859> we

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:50.949 
straightforward 60 degree I swear we

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.289 
straightforward 60 degree I swear we
should<00:03:51.099> have<00:03:51.190> been<00:03:51.340> moving<00:03:51.819> together
