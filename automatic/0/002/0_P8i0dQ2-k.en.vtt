entirely new block state and the reason
that's<00:02:26.100> happened<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:27.270> we<00:02:27.630> now<00:02:27.840> have

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
that's happened is that we now have

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.500 
that's happened is that we now have
different<00:02:28.620> textures<00:02:29.069> for<00:02:29.760> conditional<00:02:30.360> and

different textures for conditional and

now more pointed when the block is in
