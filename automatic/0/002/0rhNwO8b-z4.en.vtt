from<00:00:04.850> first<00:00:05.850> moment<00:00:06.359> you<00:00:06.540> know<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:07.379> can<00:00:07.680> get<00:00:07.980> a

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
from first moment you know you can get a

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.620 
from first moment you know you can get a
lot<00:00:08.220> of<00:00:08.340> benefit<00:00:08.760> out<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.330> Paulo

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
lot of benefit out of this Paulo

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.629 
lot of benefit out of this Paulo
technologies<00:00:10.230> because<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:11.070> can<00:00:11.250> see<00:00:11.519> the

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
technologies because you can see the

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.580 
technologies because you can see the
real<00:00:11.849> time<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.420> heart<00:00:12.630> rate<00:00:12.750> responses<00:00:13.380> and

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
real time the heart rate responses and

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.530 
real time the heart rate responses and
also<00:00:14.309> training<00:00:14.549> load<00:00:14.820> after<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.240> training

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
also training load after a training

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.080 
also training load after a training
session<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.520> after<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.640> first<00:00:17.910> training

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
session so after the first training

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.880 
session so after the first training
session<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.779> can<00:00:18.960> really<00:00:19.230> see<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.500> lot<00:00:19.619> of

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
session you can really see a lot of

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.279 
session you can really see a lot of
information<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.730> could<00:00:21.359> see<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.600> results<00:00:22.020> from

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
information I could see the results from

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.410 
information I could see the results from
day<00:00:22.590> one<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.340> one<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.670> features<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.090> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
day one so one of the features of the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.890 
day one so one of the features of the
polar<00:00:25.289> system<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> trainer<00:00:26.609> loaned<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.180> so

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
polar system is a trainer loaned and so

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.019 
polar system is a trainer loaned and so
we<00:00:28.199> use<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.740> Spector's<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.670> one<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:29.970> a

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
we use that a Spector's is one of a

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.220 
we use that a Spector's is one of a
number<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.300> aspects<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.840> monitoring<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
number of aspects of monitoring the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.979 
number of aspects of monitoring the
players<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.800> gives<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.099> an<00:00:32.219> overall

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
players so it gives you an overall

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.479 
players so it gives you an overall
summary<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.350> load<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.739> each<00:00:34.890> player<00:00:35.190> based

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
summary of the load of each player based

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.889 
summary of the load of each player based
on<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> time<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.210> each<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.510> their<00:00:36.630> different

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
on the time in each of their different

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.139 
on the time in each of their different
heart<00:00:37.079> rate<00:00:37.200> training<00:00:37.440> zones<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:38.969> use

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
heart rate training zones and so we use

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.369 
heart rate training zones and so we use
that<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.570> know<00:00:39.629> as<00:00:39.840> well<00:00:39.989> as<00:00:40.110> some<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
that you know as well as some of the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.410 
that you know as well as some of the
other<00:00:40.530> data<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.910> just<00:00:42.090> gives<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.300> an

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
other data and it just gives you an

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.000 
other data and it just gives you an
overall<00:00:42.690> picture<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:43.170> how<00:00:43.290> hard<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.680> session

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
overall picture of how hard the session

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.590 
overall picture of how hard the session
is<00:00:44.129> being<00:00:44.250> for<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.550> choir<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.149> get<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> sense

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
is being for the choir you get a sense

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.090 
is being for the choir you get a sense
of<00:00:45.750> where<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.079> are<00:00:46.230> physically<00:00:46.680> but<00:00:46.950> there's

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
of where you are physically but there's

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.590 
of where you are physically but there's
nothing<00:00:47.460> nothing<00:00:48.180> better<00:00:48.360> than<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
nothing nothing better than the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.240 
nothing nothing better than the
reinforcement<00:00:49.260> from<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.530> polar<00:00:49.739> equipment

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
reinforcement from the polar equipment

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.729 
reinforcement from the polar equipment
and<00:00:50.399> technology<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.600> let<00:00:51.960> us<00:00:52.079> know<00:00:52.260> exactly

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
and technology to let us know exactly

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.959 
and technology to let us know exactly
where<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.070> are<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.309> know<00:00:53.399> we<00:00:53.520> all<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> good

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
where we are you know we all have a good

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.910 
where we are you know we all have a good
feeling<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:54.870> until<00:00:55.140> we<00:00:55.260> know<00:00:55.379> exactly<00:00:55.410> where

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
feeling but until we know exactly where

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.160 
feeling but until we know exactly where
physically<00:00:56.579> during<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.570> after<00:00:57.780> training

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
physically during and after training

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.380 
physically during and after training
there's<00:00:59.100> no<00:00:59.190> substitute<00:00:59.609> for<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.239> just

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
there's no substitute for that it just

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.760 
there's no substitute for that it just
gives<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.629> good<00:01:00.840> indicator<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.469> whether<00:01:01.649> or

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
gives you a good indicator of whether or

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.200 
gives you a good indicator of whether or
not<00:01:01.890> how<00:01:02.460> hard<00:01:02.670> you're<00:01:02.789> working

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
not how hard you're working

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.359 
not how hard you're working
if<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.019> recovered<00:01:04.439> after<00:01:04.619> your<00:01:04.830> workouts<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
if you recovered after your workouts the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.910 
if you recovered after your workouts the
next<00:01:05.610> day<00:01:05.840> if<00:01:06.840> you're<00:01:07.049> still<00:01:07.350> fatigued<00:01:07.680> you

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
next day if you're still fatigued you

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.899 
next day if you're still fatigued you
maybe<00:01:08.070> need<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.340> take<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.610> little<00:01:08.700> bit

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
maybe need to take it a little bit

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.730 
maybe need to take it a little bit
lighter<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.510> day<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.590> really

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
lighter that day so it's just a really

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.679 
lighter that day so it's just a really
good<00:01:10.860> indicator<00:01:11.250> telling<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.820> how<00:01:12.000> how<00:01:12.540> much

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
good indicator telling you how how much

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.000 
good indicator telling you how how much
you're<00:01:12.840> doing<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.590> off<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> field

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
you're doing on and off the field

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.560 
you're doing on and off the field
actually<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.760> gives<00:01:14.850> us<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> opportunity<00:01:15.299> to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
actually it gives us the opportunity to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.270 
actually it gives us the opportunity to
have<00:01:15.720> constant<00:01:16.290> feedback<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:16.799> our<00:01:16.920> fitness

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
have constant feedback with our fitness

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.260 
have constant feedback with our fitness
coaches<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.820> coaches<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:19.259> order<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.710> maintain

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
coaches and coaches in order to maintain

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.910 
coaches and coaches in order to maintain
the<00:01:21.270> current<00:01:21.479> level<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.810> training<00:01:22.110> reduce<00:01:22.619> or

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the current level of training reduce or

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.310 
the current level of training reduce or
increase<00:01:23.689> accordingly<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.869> how<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.020> players

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
increase accordingly to how the players

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.499 
increase accordingly to how the players
before<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.979> particular<00:01:26.400> day<00:01:26.520> we<00:01:27.150> look<00:01:27.330> at

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
before that particular day we look at

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.210 
before that particular day we look at
above<00:01:28.020> 90<00:01:28.290> percent<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> heart<00:01:28.860> rate<00:01:29.009> max

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
above 90 percent of the heart rate max

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.130 
above 90 percent of the heart rate max
so<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.000> make<00:01:30.119> sure<00:01:30.360> they<00:01:30.509> get<00:01:30.720> X<00:01:30.960> amount

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
so if we can make sure they get X amount

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.749 
so if we can make sure they get X amount
of<00:01:31.350> minutes<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.829> zone<00:01:32.070> then<00:01:32.369> we<00:01:32.549> know

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
of minutes in that zone then we know

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.880 
of minutes in that zone then we know
we're<00:01:33.000> improving<00:01:33.540> them<00:01:33.780> aerobic<00:01:34.170> ly<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
we're improving them aerobic ly the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.350 
we're improving them aerobic ly the
other<00:01:35.009> side<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.400> looking<00:01:35.549> at<00:01:35.759> recovery<00:01:36.150> rate

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
other side is looking at recovery rate

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.999 
other side is looking at recovery rate
so<00:01:36.630> again<00:01:36.930> if<00:01:37.020> they're<00:01:37.200> doing<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.470> practice<00:01:37.890> or

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
so again if they're doing a practice or

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.620 
so again if they're doing a practice or
a<00:01:38.070> drill<00:01:38.369> how<00:01:38.790> quickly<00:01:39.090> does<00:01:39.270> their<00:01:39.420> heart

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
a drill how quickly does their heart

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.539 
a drill how quickly does their heart
rate<00:01:39.780> drop<00:01:40.439> down<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.860> normal<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.340> again

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
rate drop down to normal so again

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.039 
rate drop down to normal so again
another<00:01:41.729> indicator<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.360> fitness<00:01:42.630> level<00:01:42.899> and

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
another indicator of fitness level and

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.160 
another indicator of fitness level and
then<00:01:44.040> also<00:01:44.189> with<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.909> polar<00:01:45.450> watch<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> nice

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
then also with the polar watch is a nice

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.950 
then also with the polar watch is a nice
little<00:01:46.409> way<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.159> monitoring<00:01:47.549> how<00:01:48.000> what<00:01:48.750> kind

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
little way of monitoring how what kind

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.690 
little way of monitoring how what kind
of<00:01:48.990> recovered<00:01:49.409> state<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> plays<00:01:49.920> are<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.220> with

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
of recovered state the plays are in with

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.789 
of recovered state the plays are in with
that<00:01:50.909> we<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.210> see<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.990> players<00:01:52.229> over<00:01:52.409> trained

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
that we can see the players over trained

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.649 
that we can see the players over trained
fatigue<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:53.970> build<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.240> into<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
fatigue and just build that into the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.240 
fatigue and just build that into the
whole<00:01:54.840> profile<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> player<00:01:55.710> we've

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
whole profile of the player we've

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.100 
whole profile of the player we've
learned<00:01:56.490> quickly<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.090> now<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.930> we're

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
learned quickly and now it's that we're

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.289 
learned quickly and now it's that we're
able<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.350> use<00:01:58.469> them<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:58.710> our<00:01:58.740> own<00:01:58.890> yeah<00:01:59.310> at<00:02:00.119> home

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
able to use them on our own yeah at home

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.789 
able to use them on our own yeah at home
and<00:02:00.540> it's<00:02:00.689> easy<00:02:01.079> we<00:02:01.350> just<00:02:01.380> turn<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.740> our

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
and it's easy we just turn in our

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.139 
and it's easy we just turn in our
minutes<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.340> go<00:02:02.549> from<00:02:02.729> there<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:02.909> she

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
minutes and go from there and she

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.240 
minutes and go from there and she
collects<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.930> data<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.409> sees<00:02:04.619> how<00:02:04.799> how<00:02:05.130> we're

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
collects the data and sees how how we're

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.310 
collects the data and sees how how we're
doing<00:02:05.369> each<00:02:05.549> week<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.479> offseason<00:02:06.840> our

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
help during the offseason you know a

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.160 
help during the offseason you know a
soccer<00:02:17.670> training<00:02:17.939> basically<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:18.870> cannot

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
soccer training basically we cannot

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.559 
soccer training basically we cannot
control<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.129> distance<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.879> a<00:02:20.939> sprint<00:02:21.299> or<00:02:21.510> a

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
control the distance of a sprint or a

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.350 
control the distance of a sprint or a
duration<00:02:22.319> of<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.500> work<00:02:22.709> or<00:02:23.370> know<00:02:23.610> how<00:02:24.150> many

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
duration of the work or know how many

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.729 
duration of the work or know how many
times<00:02:24.599> they<00:02:24.810> make<00:02:25.079> it<00:02:25.200> change<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.560> direction

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
times they make it change the direction

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.350 
times they make it change the direction
those<00:02:26.519> kind<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.849> stuff

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
those kind of stuff

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.509 
those kind of stuff
so<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:28.049> really<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.709> know<00:02:28.799> important<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.280> see

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
so it's really you know important to see

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.119 
so it's really you know important to see
their<00:02:29.790> actual<00:02:30.090> physical<00:02:30.390> response<00:02:30.840> from<00:02:31.739> the

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
their actual physical response from the

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.920 
their actual physical response from the
soccer<00:02:32.340> training<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:33.180> more<00:02:33.329> information<00:02:33.540> we

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
soccer training the more information we

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.899 
soccer training the more information we
gather<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.980> more<00:02:35.159> training<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.609> do<00:02:35.760> with

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
gather and the more training you do with

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.750 
gather and the more training you do with
the<00:02:36.000> technology<00:02:36.629> it<00:02:36.870> gives<00:02:37.349> you<00:02:37.829> a<00:02:37.859> bigger

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
the technology it gives you a bigger

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.449 
the technology it gives you a bigger
database<00:02:39.269> in<00:02:39.480> order<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:40.439> have<00:02:40.590> your<00:02:40.920> target<00:02:41.370> of

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
database in order to have your target of

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.770 
database in order to have your target of
where<00:02:41.579> you<00:02:41.640> want<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.879> be<00:02:41.970> physically<00:02:42.480> now

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
where you want to be physically now

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.059 
where you want to be physically now
that's<00:02:42.959> not<00:02:43.109> the<00:02:43.140> only<00:02:43.379> aspect<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.799> become

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
that's not the only aspect to become

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.190 
that's not the only aspect to become
professional<00:02:44.549> athlete<00:02:44.879> but<00:02:45.480> as<00:02:45.599> certainly<00:02:46.079> is

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
professional athlete but as certainly is

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.110 
professional athlete but as certainly is
certainly<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.590> very<00:02:46.709> important<00:02:47.190> one<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.519> the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
certainly a very important one and the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.280 
certainly a very important one and the
most<00:02:48.299> important<00:02:48.659> one<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.780> maintain<00:02:49.170> your

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
most important one to maintain your

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.809 
most important one to maintain your
fitness<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.859> everyone's<00:02:50.220> going<00:02:50.459> hard

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
fitness and everyone's going hard

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.069 
fitness and everyone's going hard
everyone's<00:02:51.150> gonna<00:02:51.299> train<00:02:51.569> hard<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:51.930> need<00:02:52.019> to

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
everyone's gonna train hard you need to

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.210 
everyone's gonna train hard you need to
make<00:02:52.379> sure<00:02:52.409> that<00:02:52.739> they're<00:02:52.829> recovering

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
make sure that they're recovering

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.280 
make sure that they're recovering
properly<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.389> think<00:02:54.510> that's<00:02:54.659> been<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.840> big

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
properly and I think that's been a big

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.599 
properly and I think that's been a big
key<00:02:55.500> especially<00:02:55.709> because<00:02:56.040> we<00:02:56.250> have<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.400> wide

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
key especially because we have a wide

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.759 
key especially because we have a wide
range<00:02:56.849> of<00:02:57.000> Ages<00:02:57.180> on<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.629> on<00:02:58.349> this<00:02:58.560> team

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
range of Ages on this on this team

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.629 
range of Ages on this on this team
ranging<00:02:59.069> from<00:02:59.159> like<00:02:59.310> 36<00:02:59.909> 37<00:03:00.359> to<00:03:01.280> 22<00:03:02.280> year-olds

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.369 
different everybody's different so I
think<00:03:05.670> it's<00:03:05.940> important<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.629> I<00:03:06.989> absolutely

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
think it's important and I absolutely

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.339 
think it's important and I absolutely
recommend<00:03:07.730> polar<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:09.209> any<00:03:09.389> team<00:03:09.629> I<00:03:09.840> mean<00:03:10.049> from

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
recommend polar to any team I mean from

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.220 
recommend polar to any team I mean from
any<00:03:10.769> sport<00:03:11.159> really<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.430> mean<00:03:11.609> you<00:03:11.670> really<00:03:11.790> got<00:03:11.970> a

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
any sport really I mean you really got a

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.990 
any sport really I mean you really got a
monitor<00:03:13.230> your<00:03:13.470> players<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:14.340> fatigue<00:03:14.730> and

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
monitor your players and the fatigue and

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.369 
monitor your players and the fatigue and
they're<00:03:15.449> not<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.599> workload<00:03:15.810> they're<00:03:16.079> doing<00:03:16.260> as

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
they're not a workload they're doing as

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:17.900 
they're not a workload they're doing as
well<00:03:16.530> obviously<00:03:16.889> it<00:03:17.220> means<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.519> can<00:03:17.669> optimize

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
well obviously it means you can optimize

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.580 
well obviously it means you can optimize
what<00:03:18.269> you're<00:03:18.389> doing<00:03:18.540> in<00:03:18.660> your<00:03:18.690> training<00:03:19.079> and

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
what you're doing in your training and

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.050 
what you're doing in your training and
if<00:03:19.829> you<00:03:19.949> monitoring<00:03:20.310> your<00:03:20.459> heart<00:03:20.609> rate<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:20.940> you

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
if you monitoring your heart rate so you

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.009 
if you monitoring your heart rate so you
can<00:03:21.209> make<00:03:21.329> sure<00:03:21.480> you're<00:03:21.599> getting<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.840> physical

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
can make sure you're getting a physical

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.289 
can make sure you're getting a physical
outcome<00:03:22.739> as<00:03:22.829> well<00:03:22.980> as<00:03:23.069> technical<00:03:23.370> outcome<00:03:23.819> so

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
outcome as well as technical outcome so

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.759 
outcome as well as technical outcome so
even<00:03:24.599> if<00:03:24.720> you<00:03:24.870> know<00:03:24.989> grass<00:03:25.260> roots<00:03:25.530> right

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
even if you know grass roots right

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.309 
even if you know grass roots right
through<00:03:26.069> to<00:03:26.280> elite<00:03:26.970> level<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.480> think<00:03:27.780> any<00:03:27.900> team

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
through to elite level I think any team

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.920 
through to elite level I think any team
would<00:03:28.590> get<00:03:28.739> benefit<00:03:29.250> from<00:03:29.519> from<00:03:30.449> either<00:03:30.629> using

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
would get benefit from from either using

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.659 
would get benefit from from either using
a<00:03:30.989> team<00:03:31.199> system<00:03:31.620> for<00:03:32.099> the<00:03:32.160> whole<00:03:32.310> team<00:03:32.489> or

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
a team system for the whole team or

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:33.800 
a team system for the whole team or
individuals<00:03:33.150> using<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.540> heart<00:03:33.690> rate

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
individuals using the heart rate

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.839 
individuals using the heart rate
monitors<00:03:34.230> I<00:03:34.379> think<00:03:34.889> its<00:03:35.010> massive<00:03:35.400> in<00:03:35.489> terms<00:03:35.730> of

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
monitors I think its massive in terms of

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.189 
monitors I think its massive in terms of
the<00:03:35.910> outcomes<00:03:36.269> players<00:03:36.540> can<00:03:36.780> get<00:03:36.930> from<00:03:37.109> the

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
the outcomes players can get from the

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.539 
the outcomes players can get from the
training<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.799> would<00:03:38.099> definitely<00:03:38.430> recommend

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
training I would definitely recommend

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.270 
training I would definitely recommend
using<00:03:39.239> this<00:03:39.540> power<00:03:39.870> technology<00:03:40.379> to<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.129> other

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
using this power technology to the other

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.330 
using this power technology to the other
coaches<00:03:41.609> and<00:03:41.819> fitness<00:03:42.209> coaches<00:03:42.709> because<00:03:43.709> this

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
coaches and fitness coaches because this

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.170 
coaches and fitness coaches because this
will<00:03:44.669> give<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.389> a<00:03:45.810> lot<00:03:46.709> of<00:03:46.739> information<00:03:47.519> on

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
will give you a lot of information on

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.479 
will give you a lot of information on
the<00:03:48.299> players<00:03:48.599> and<00:03:49.049> this<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.739> very<00:03:49.949> useful<00:03:50.459> to

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
the players and this is very useful to

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.759 
the players and this is very useful to
your<00:03:50.760> planning<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:51.480> executing<00:03:52.260> also

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
your planning and executing also

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.589 
your planning and executing also
reviewing<00:03:53.159> the<00:03:53.280> training<00:03:53.639> sessions<00:03:54.030> I<00:03:54.269> can

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
reviewing the training sessions I can

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.379 
reviewing the training sessions I can
only<00:03:54.780> pass<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:55.889> on<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:56.280> say<00:03:56.430> use<00:03:57.060> it<00:03:57.239> because

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
only pass it on and say use it because

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.089 
only pass it on and say use it because
all<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:57.870> my<00:03:58.049> experiences<00:03:58.650> have<00:03:58.739> been<00:03:58.889> very

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
all of my experiences have been very
