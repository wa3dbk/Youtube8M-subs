off<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.200> twitch<00:00:13.380> plays<00:00:13.620> Pokemon<00:00:14.099> stream

the<00:00:30.090> light<00:00:30.240> sweep<00:00:30.539> started<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.410> we're

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
the light sweep started so we're

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.720 
the light sweep started so we're
starting<00:00:31.740> out<00:00:31.980> with<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.160> battle<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.489> start

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
starting out with the battle I start

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.610 
starting out with the battle I start
with<00:00:32.820> my<00:00:32.940> skully<00:00:33.270> OPD<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.989> do<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.590> I

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
with my skully OPD and I do that so I

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.620 
with my skully OPD and I do that so I
can<00:00:34.800> actually<00:00:34.920> get<00:00:35.370> up<00:00:35.550> iron<00:00:35.850> defenses<00:00:36.480> and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
can actually get up iron defenses and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.600 
can actually get up iron defenses and
boost<00:00:36.840> my<00:00:36.960> defense<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.530> look<00:00:38.010> at<00:00:38.100> his<00:00:38.219> team<00:00:38.430> and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
boost my defense I look at his team and

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.310 
boost my defense I look at his team and
most<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.879> his<00:00:38.969> Pokemon<00:00:39.360> or<00:00:39.480> physical<00:00:39.870> pokemon

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
most of his Pokemon or physical pokemon

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.990 
most of his Pokemon or physical pokemon
so<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.559> knew<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> could<00:00:41.070> set<00:00:41.250> up<00:00:41.370> some<00:00:41.640> physical

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
so I knew I could set up some physical

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.940 
so I knew I could set up some physical
defense<00:00:42.300> moves<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.230> right<00:00:43.590> here<00:00:43.800> I'm<00:00:43.920> just

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
defense moves so right here I'm just

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.560 
defense moves so right here I'm just
boosting<00:00:44.430> my<00:00:44.489> defense<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.180> ability

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
boosting my defense and it's ability

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.000 
boosting my defense and it's ability
lets<00:00:45.780> me<00:00:45.840> raise<00:00:46.050> my<00:00:46.079> speed<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
lets me raise my speed so it's like a

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.130 
lets me raise my speed so it's like a
two-for-one<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.879> his<00:00:48.360> scissor<00:00:48.600> isn't<00:00:48.989> really

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
two-for-one and his scissor isn't really

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.840 
two-for-one and his scissor isn't really
doing<00:00:49.289> anything<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:50.010> me<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.340> he<00:00:50.430> switches<00:00:50.670> out

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
doing anything to me so he switches out

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.779 
doing anything to me so he switches out
to<00:00:51.090> his<00:00:51.210> toxic<00:00:51.660> crabs<00:00:51.960> his<00:00:52.230> Gliscor<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:53.460> once

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.340 
to his toxic crabs his Gliscor but once
again<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.210> four<00:00:54.449> times<00:00:54.690> defense<00:00:55.050> that's<00:00:55.260> not

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
again on four times defense that's not

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.540 
again on four times defense that's not
really<00:00:55.530> gonna<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:55.770> anything<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.160> me<00:00:56.250> either<00:00:56.399> so

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
start raising my special defense and you

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.689 
start raising my special defense and you
see<00:01:00.809> there<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.140> earthquake<00:01:01.559> does<00:01:01.770> 2.5%

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
see there that earthquake does 2.5%

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.570 
see there that earthquake does 2.5%
damage<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:04.470> was<00:01:04.589> kind<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.890> really<00:01:05.100> bad<00:01:05.280> I

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
damage so that was kind of really bad I

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.580 
damage so that was kind of really bad I
go<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.180> substitute<00:01:06.659> here<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.500> was

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
go for the substitute here and that was

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.530 
go for the substitute here and that was
really<00:01:07.860> good<00:01:08.070> for<00:01:08.130> me<00:01:08.400> because<00:01:08.549> toxic<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.420> he

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
really good for me because toxic if he

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.149 
really good for me because toxic if he
got<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.750> off<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.500> would<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.770> messed<00:01:11.010> up

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
got that off that would have messed up

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.710 
got that off that would have messed up
this<00:01:11.340> whole<00:01:11.520> sweep<00:01:11.790> made<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> lot<00:01:12.330> harder<00:01:12.390> to

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
this whole sweep made it a lot harder to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.530 
this whole sweep made it a lot harder to
do<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.549> because<00:01:14.549> I'm<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:14.760> four<00:01:14.939> times<00:01:15.150> defense

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
do and because I'm on four times defense

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.929 
do and because I'm on four times defense
I<00:01:15.689> take<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.080> ice<00:01:16.320> Fang<00:01:16.619> from<00:01:16.920> his<00:01:17.070> Gliscor

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
I take that ice Fang from his Gliscor

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.999 
I take that ice Fang from his Gliscor
like<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> tank<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.650> could<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:19.920> keep

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
like a tank and I could just keep

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.770 
like a tank and I could just keep
setting<00:01:20.280> up<00:01:20.369> my<00:01:20.460> comm<00:01:20.729> lines<00:01:21.030> over<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.570> over

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
setting up my comm lines over and over

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.880 
setting up my comm lines over and over
and<00:01:21.900> over<00:01:22.110> again<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.560> raise<00:01:22.860> my

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
and over again so I just raise my

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.950 
and over again so I just raise my
defense<00:01:23.520> actually<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.390> raise<00:01:24.509> my<00:01:24.630> special

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
defense actually I raise my special

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.020 
defense actually I raise my special
defense<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.530> special<00:01:25.950> attack<00:01:26.220> really<00:01:26.759> high

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
defense and special attack really high

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.899 
defense and special attack really high
so<00:01:28.020> I'm<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:28.560> setting<00:01:28.799> up<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.040> him<00:01:29.220> getting

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
so I'm just setting up on him getting

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.490 
so I'm just setting up on him getting
the<00:01:29.970> nice<00:01:30.119> leftovers<00:01:30.750> recovery<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.350> he

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
the nice leftovers recovery and he

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.109 
the nice leftovers recovery and he
realizes<00:01:31.829> it's<00:01:32.100> not<00:01:32.159> working<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:32.790> he<00:01:32.880> switches

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
realizes it's not working so he switches

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.359 
realizes it's not working so he switches
him<00:01:33.360> back<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.689> his<00:01:33.810> scissor<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:35.040> thought<00:01:35.310> I

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
him back to his scissor and I thought I

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.280 
him back to his scissor and I thought I
could<00:01:35.640> take<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.060> scissor<00:01:36.299> much<00:01:36.810> better<00:01:37.110> than

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
could take the scissor much better than

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.980 
could take the scissor much better than
I<00:01:37.380> could<00:01:37.439> but<00:01:38.150> you'll<00:01:39.150> see<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.570> second

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
I could but you'll see in a second

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.749 
I could but you'll see in a second
that's<00:01:40.200> not<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.680> case<00:01:40.829> he<00:01:41.130> goes<00:01:41.280> for<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.520> bug

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
that's not the case he goes for the bug

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.700 
that's not the case he goes for the bug
bite<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.600> does<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.780> lot<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> celebrate

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
bite and that does a lot to celebrate

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.069 
bite and that does a lot to celebrate
even<00:01:44.250> with<00:01:44.399> four<00:01:44.579> times<00:01:44.820> defense<00:01:45.240> because

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
even with four times defense because

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.990 
even with four times defense because
scissor<00:01:46.500> has<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.829> ability<00:01:47.189> technician<00:01:47.820> which

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
scissor has the ability technician which

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.969 
scissor has the ability technician which
boosts<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.479> attack<00:01:48.899> power<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.439> get<00:01:49.560> stabbed

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
boosts that attack power to get stabbed

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.850 
boosts that attack power to get stabbed
so<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:50.579> doing<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.880> lot<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.149> damage<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.860> can

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
so it's doing a lot of damage you can

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.700 
so it's doing a lot of damage you can
see<00:01:52.979> right<00:01:53.159> here<00:01:53.460> does<00:01:53.899> 48<00:01:54.899> percent<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.680> that

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
see right here does 48 percent so that

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.609 
see right here does 48 percent so that
would<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.310> KO<00:01:56.520> me<00:01:56.899> so<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.200> have<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.439> switch

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
would to it KO me so I have to switch

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.709 
would to it KO me so I have to switch
right<00:01:58.799> out<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:58.950> there<00:01:59.159> into<00:01:59.310> gliscor<00:01:59.939> which<00:02:00.540> is

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
right out of there into gliscor which is

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.990 
right out of there into gliscor which is
already<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> natural<00:02:01.500> tank<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.100> then<00:02:02.670> he

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
already a natural tank and then he

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.760 
already a natural tank and then he
decides<00:02:03.390> he's<00:02:03.630> gonna<00:02:03.810> switch<00:02:04.140> out<00:02:04.320> right<00:02:04.530> here

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
decides he's gonna switch out right here

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.180 
decides he's gonna switch out right here
into<00:02:05.270> his<00:02:06.270> glide<00:02:06.540> score<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.190> normally

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
into his glide score and normally

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.619 
into his glide score and normally
that'll<00:02:08.369> be<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.520> decent<00:02:08.819> switch<00:02:09.209> because<00:02:09.360> he

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
that'll be a decent switch because he

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.059 
that'll be a decent switch because he
has<00:02:09.720> ice<00:02:09.929> Fang<00:02:10.200> but<00:02:10.410> I'm<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.649> four<00:02:10.860> times

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
has ice Fang but I'm on four times

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.920 
has ice Fang but I'm on four times
defense<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.849> his<00:02:12.120> glass<00:02:12.330> core<00:02:12.569> isn't<00:02:12.780> really

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
defense and his glass core isn't really

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.470 
defense and his glass core isn't really
that<00:02:12.959> strong

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
that strong

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.600 
that strong
attacking<00:02:13.810> as<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.170> saw<00:02:14.349> earlier<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:14.890> I'm<00:02:15.489> just

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
attacking as you saw earlier so I'm just

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.460 
attacking as you saw earlier so I'm just
taking<00:02:15.819> that<00:02:16.090> like<00:02:16.269> a<00:02:16.300> boss<00:02:16.540> I<00:02:16.840> baton<00:02:17.170> passed

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
taking that like a boss I baton passed

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.960 
taking that like a boss I baton passed
into<00:02:17.709> Celebi<00:02:18.159> because<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.430> know<00:02:18.489> it's<00:02:18.879> not

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
into Celebi because I know it's not

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.369 
into Celebi because I know it's not
gonna<00:02:19.239> hurt<00:02:19.360> me<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:19.690> much<00:02:19.810> with<00:02:19.959> ice<00:02:20.110> Fang

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
gonna hurt me that much with ice Fang

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.550 
gonna hurt me that much with ice Fang
and<00:02:21.180> here<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.209> go<00:02:22.360> for<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.599> substitute<00:02:23.170> knowing

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
and here I go for the substitute knowing

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.839 
and here I go for the substitute knowing
he's<00:02:23.709> gonna<00:02:23.830> switch<00:02:24.099> out<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.400> scissor<00:02:24.580> and

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
he's gonna switch out to scissor and

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.789 
he's gonna switch out to scissor and
then<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.569> could<00:02:25.720> just<00:02:25.750> baton<00:02:26.110> pass<00:02:26.349> right<00:02:26.620> there

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
then I could just baton pass right there

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.380 
then I could just baton pass right there
passing<00:02:27.129> over<00:02:27.519> all<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.760> booths<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.299> the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
passing over all the booths and the

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.690 
passing over all the booths and the
substitute<00:02:29.019> over<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.470> onda<00:02:29.830> might<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.220> that's

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
substitute over to onda might and that's

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.700 
substitute over to onda might and that's
GG<00:02:31.120> right<00:02:31.360> there

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
GG right there
