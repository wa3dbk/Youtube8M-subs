Bioshock<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.610> my<00:01:08.729> opinion<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.180> doesn't<00:01:09.479> look

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
Bioshock in my opinion it doesn't look

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.170 
Bioshock in my opinion it doesn't look
you<00:01:10.229> know<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:11.070> death<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.549> Call<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.820> Duty

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
you know as in death this Call of Duty

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.399 
you know as in death this Call of Duty
you<00:01:12.270> know<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.659> instance<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:13.020> mean<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
you know for instance I mean like the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.260 
you know for instance I mean like the
gun<00:01:13.650> doesn't<00:01:14.250> add<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.460> much<00:01:14.640> detail<00:01:14.939> but<00:01:15.240> I

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
gun doesn't add that much detail but I

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.120 
gun doesn't add that much detail but I
think<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.630> like<00:01:15.960> Bioshock<00:01:16.500> 2<00:01:16.830> if<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.040> guys

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
think it's like Bioshock 2 if you guys

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.039 
think it's like Bioshock 2 if you guys
play<00:01:17.340> Bioshock<00:01:17.549> 2<00:01:18.000> your<00:01:18.180> BioShock<00:01:18.540> Infinite

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.080 
play Bioshock 2 your BioShock Infinite

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
I feel like it's on that level of detail

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.109 
I feel like it's on that level of detail
and<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:22.350> looks<00:01:22.530> really<00:01:22.830> fun<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.790> really

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119

want to say a week or so ago go check

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.350 
want to say a week or so ago go check
that<00:01:35.430> out<00:01:35.490> it's<00:01:35.700> really<00:01:35.970> quick<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.180> easy

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
that out it's really quick and easy

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.760 
that out it's really quick and easy
takes<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.840> about<00:01:36.990> three<00:01:37.290> minutes<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.710> you

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
takes you about three minutes and you

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.560 
takes you about three minutes and you
can<00:01:37.920> actually<00:01:38.100> have<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.670> first-person<00:01:39.329> view

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570

point however when you're doing that

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.039 
point however when you're doing that
glitter<00:01:41.939> you're<00:01:42.150> limited<00:01:42.600> because<00:01:42.780> you're

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
glitter you're limited because you're

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.050 
glitter you're limited because you're
not<00:01:43.170> able<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.619> actually<00:01:43.770> use<00:01:44.250> guns<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.909> when

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
not able to actually use guns and when

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.880 
not able to actually use guns and when
you're<00:01:45.149> driving<00:01:45.270> vehicles<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.649> nearly

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
you're driving vehicles it's nearly

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.010 
you're driving vehicles it's nearly
impossible<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.820> drive<00:01:48.119> vehicles<00:01:48.750> because

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
impossible to drive vehicles because

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.980 
impossible to drive vehicles because
like<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.310> probably<00:01:50.670> see<00:01:51.210> just<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.689> sky

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
like you can probably see just the sky

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.539 
like you can probably see just the sky
and<00:01:52.320> some<00:01:52.470> trees<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.979> really<00:01:53.220> can't<00:01:53.399> see

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
and some trees you really can't see

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.580 
and some trees you really can't see
what's<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:53.939> front<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.630> unfortunately

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
what's in front of you and unfortunately

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.319 
what's in front of you and unfortunately
you<00:01:55.740> can<00:01:55.890> only<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.369> around<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.700> beach<00:01:56.880> area

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
you can only do it around the beach area

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.870 
you can only do it around the beach area
whereas<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.140> mod<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.159> actually<00:01:59.670> use

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
whereas in this mod you can actually use

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.730 
whereas in this mod you can actually use
guns<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.630> actually<00:02:00.990> see<00:02:01.259> out<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.469> a

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
guns you can actually see out of a

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.370 
guns you can actually see out of a
vehicle<00:02:02.189> when<00:02:02.310> you're<00:02:02.430> driving<00:02:02.759> and

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
vehicle when you're driving and

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.080 
vehicle when you're driving and
everything<00:02:04.380> works<00:02:04.860> along<00:02:05.790> with<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.060> I

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
everything works along with that I

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.760 
everything works along with that I
believe<00:02:06.360> it's<00:02:06.479> also<00:02:06.630> easier<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.200> control<00:02:07.530> now

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
believe it's also easier to control now

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.779 
believe it's also easier to control now
I<00:02:07.829> believe<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.459> also

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
I believe this is also

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.490 
I believe this is also
one<00:02:09.939> of<00:02:10.030> those<00:02:10.119> scripts<00:02:10.539> mods<00:02:10.810> really<00:02:11.170> hard<00:02:11.349> to

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
one of those scripts mods really hard to

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.990 
one of those scripts mods really hard to
actually<00:02:11.799> get<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:11.950> hold<00:02:12.129> of<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.400> pull<00:02:12.430> off<00:02:12.730> so

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
actually get a hold of and pull off so

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.399 
actually get a hold of and pull off so
this<00:02:13.090> is<00:02:13.150> kind<00:02:13.360> of<00:02:13.420> some<00:02:13.599> rare<00:02:13.780> footage<00:02:14.170> here

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
this is kind of some rare footage here

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:15.990 
this is kind of some rare footage here
and<00:02:14.859> it's<00:02:15.159> really<00:02:15.400> cool<00:02:15.549> because<00:02:15.700> it's<00:02:15.879> like<00:02:15.909> a

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
and it's really cool because it's like a

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.119 
and it's really cool because it's like a
five-star<00:02:16.629> shootout<00:02:17.079> I<00:02:17.109> told<00:02:17.409> Zack<00:02:17.500> I'm<00:02:17.950> like

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
five-star shootout I told Zack I'm like

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.339 
five-star shootout I told Zack I'm like
Zack<00:02:18.579> I<00:02:18.879> want<00:02:19.390> my<00:02:19.510> viewers<00:02:19.569> to<00:02:19.900> see<00:02:20.019> something

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
Zack I want my viewers to see something

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.839 
Zack I want my viewers to see something
that<00:02:20.469> they've<00:02:20.620> never<00:02:20.650> seen<00:02:21.040> this<00:02:21.129> scene

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
that they've never seen this scene

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.580 
that they've never seen this scene
before<00:02:21.879> so<00:02:22.269> let's<00:02:22.420> get<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.599> 5<00:02:22.840> star<00:02:23.200> shit<00:02:23.469> out<00:02:23.560> of

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
before so let's get a 5 star shit out of

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.250 
before so let's get a 5 star shit out of
some<00:02:23.859> cops<00:02:24.129> and<00:02:24.480> make<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.599> really<00:02:25.840> look<00:02:25.989> like<00:02:26.049> a

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
some cops and make it really look like a

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.380 
some cops and make it really look like a
first-person<00:02:26.739> shooter<00:02:27.069> grant<00:02:27.730> that's<00:02:27.909> auto-5

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
first-person shooter grant that's auto-5

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.780 
first-person shooter grant that's auto-5
and<00:02:28.689> it<00:02:28.780> looks<00:02:28.959> sick<00:02:29.379> and<00:02:29.920> I<00:02:30.040> would<00:02:30.189> love<00:02:30.459> love

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
and it looks sick and I would love love

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.640 
and it looks sick and I would love love
love<00:02:30.849> with<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.269> next-gen<00:02:31.629> consoles<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.470> have

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
love with the next-gen consoles to have

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.440 
love with the next-gen consoles to have
this<00:02:32.799> as<00:02:32.980> an<00:02:33.099> option<00:02:33.299> definitely<00:02:34.299> this<00:02:34.390> is

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
this as an option definitely this is

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.580 
this as an option definitely this is
something<00:02:34.569> that<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:34.959> think<00:02:35.049> would<00:02:35.230> be<00:02:35.290> really

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
something that I think would be really

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.009 
something that I think would be really
easy<00:02:35.769> for<00:02:36.010> rockstar<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.519> pull<00:02:36.730> out<00:02:36.909> and<00:02:37.180> you

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
easy for rockstar to pull out and you

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.780 
easy for rockstar to pull out and you
know<00:02:38.139> it<00:02:38.319> can't<00:02:38.560> be<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:38.769> hard<00:02:39.010> it<00:02:39.370> can't<00:02:39.639> be

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
know it can't be that hard it can't be

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.309 
know it can't be that hard it can't be
that<00:02:39.819> hard<00:02:40.090> we're<00:02:40.359> looking<00:02:40.599> at<00:02:40.719> a<00:02:40.870> modded

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
that hard we're looking at a modded

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.569 
that hard we're looking at a modded
version<00:02:41.349> of<00:02:41.739> this<00:02:41.859> right<00:02:42.129> now<00:02:42.280> could<00:02:42.459> you

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
version of this right now could you

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.759 
version of this right now could you
imagine<00:02:42.879> and<00:02:43.389> this<00:02:43.840> was<00:02:44.019> an<00:02:44.139> actual<00:02:44.590> feature

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
imagine and this was an actual feature

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.319 
imagine and this was an actual feature
in<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.069> next-gen<00:02:45.489> version<00:02:45.879> of<00:02:45.970> Grand<00:02:46.180> Theft

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329

in the next-gen version of Grand Theft
Auto<00:02:46.480> 5<00:02:46.870> it'd<00:02:47.230> be<00:02:47.650> completely<00:02:47.799> tweaked<00:02:48.519> out

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
Auto 5 it'd be completely tweaked out

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.460 
Auto 5 it'd be completely tweaked out
it'd<00:02:48.879> be<00:02:48.970> completely<00:02:49.599> configured<00:02:50.169> and<00:02:50.379> it

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
it'd be completely configured and it

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.159 
it'd be completely configured and it
would<00:02:50.560> be<00:02:50.739> so<00:02:51.189> much<00:02:51.459> fun<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:52.090> use<00:02:52.329> either<00:02:52.870> it

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.169 
would be so much fun to use either it

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:54.990 
would be so much fun to use either it
being<00:02:53.349> only<00:02:53.470> in<00:02:53.680> single-player<00:02:54.129> and<00:02:54.400> being<00:02:54.879> an
