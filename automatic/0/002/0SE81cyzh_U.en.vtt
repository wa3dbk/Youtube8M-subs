00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
like to take a moment just to show you

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.970 
like to take a moment just to show you
how<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:12.179> opto<00:00:12.450> 22<00:00:12.710> implementation<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.830> their

how the opto 22 implementation of their
PID<00:00:14.400> loops<00:00:14.790> makes<00:00:15.210> life<00:00:15.450> just<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:15.839> little

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
PID loops makes life just that little

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.109 
PID loops makes life just that little
bit<00:00:16.139> easier<00:00:16.230> for<00:00:16.770> me<00:00:16.920> let's<00:00:17.670> go<00:00:17.789> out<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
bit easier for me let's go out in the

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.609 
bit easier for me let's go out in the
field<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.510> have<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.840> look<00:00:19.020> at<00:00:19.109> what<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.320> do<00:00:19.470> out

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
field and have a look at what we do out

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.349 
field and have a look at what we do out
there<00:00:19.680> then<00:00:20.220> we'll<00:00:20.369> come<00:00:20.580> back<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.970> I'll<00:00:21.180> show

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
there then we'll come back and I'll show

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.090 
there then we'll come back and I'll show
you<00:00:21.390> how<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.230> configuration<00:00:22.529> software

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
me to be able to see exactly what's

me to be able to see exactly what's
going<00:02:03.110> on<00:02:03.380> at<00:02:04.130> really<00:02:04.580> high<00:02:04.610> speeds<00:02:05.179> I<00:02:05.569> can

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
going on at really high speeds I can

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.320 
going on at really high speeds I can
tune<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.500> loop<00:02:06.830> to<00:02:07.220> be<00:02:07.310> very<00:02:07.580> accurate<00:02:07.789> both

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
tune the loop to be very accurate both

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.969 
tune the loop to be very accurate both

change<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.370> spin<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:13.970> just<00:02:14.270> zoom<00:02:14.569> in<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.170> see

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
change the spin and just zoom in and see

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.920 
change the spin and just zoom in and see
accurately<00:02:15.950> what's<00:02:16.520> going<00:02:16.850> on<00:02:17.000> we<00:02:17.660> can<00:02:17.780> even

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
accurately what's going on we can even

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.530 
accurately what's going on we can even
zoom<00:02:18.110> in<00:02:18.500> even<00:02:18.620> more<00:02:18.980> here<00:02:19.310> than<00:02:19.580> down<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.330> one

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
the valve we can see that it's hunting

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.260 
the valve we can see that it's hunting
around<00:02:39.200> very<00:02:39.740> slowly<00:02:39.830> around<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.850> set<00:02:41.060> point

around very slowly around the set point
it's<00:02:41.870> not<00:02:42.050> too<00:02:42.230> bad<00:02:42.410> I<00:02:42.650> could<00:02:42.920> clean<00:02:43.160> things<00:02:43.400> up

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
it's not too bad I could clean things up

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.240 
it's not too bad I could clean things up
a<00:02:43.640> little<00:02:43.790> bit<00:02:44.030> we<00:02:44.840> can<00:02:44.959> also<00:02:45.080> zoom<00:02:45.260> in<00:02:45.830> on<00:02:46.040> the

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
a little bit we can also zoom in on the

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.100 
a little bit we can also zoom in on the
output<00:02:46.400> axis<00:02:46.940> as<00:02:47.090> well<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:47.690> we<00:02:47.780> can<00:02:47.930> see

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
output axis as well and we can see

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.050 
output axis as well and we can see
exactly<00:02:48.470> what<00:02:48.770> that<00:02:48.950> valve<00:02:49.220> might<00:02:49.490> be<00:02:49.640> doing<00:02:49.910> I

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
exactly what that valve might be doing I

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.820 
exactly what that valve might be doing I
know<00:02:50.390> there's<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.720> bit<00:02:50.870> of<00:02:50.900> hysteresis<00:02:51.410> on<00:02:51.709> the

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
know there's a bit of hysteresis on the

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.680 
know there's a bit of hysteresis on the
valve<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:52.459> it's<00:02:52.580> not<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.760> problem<00:02:53.000> that<00:02:53.540> it's

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
valve so it's not a problem that it's

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.780 
valve so it's not a problem that it's
moving<00:02:53.990> around<00:02:54.230> like<00:02:54.380> this<00:02:54.740> and<00:02:54.980> you<00:02:55.490> can<00:02:55.610> see

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
moving around like this and you can see

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.300 
moving around like this and you can see
I<00:02:55.819> can<00:02:55.910> move<00:02:56.240> things<00:02:56.450> around<00:02:56.660> very<00:02:57.080> easily<00:02:57.310> the

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
I can move things around very easily the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.160 
I can move things around very easily the
other<00:02:58.430> thing<00:02:58.670> i<00:02:58.760> like<00:02:59.030> is<00:02:59.270> i'm<00:02:59.540> able<00:02:59.720> to<00:02:59.930> change

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
other thing i like is i'm able to change

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.740 
other thing i like is i'm able to change
the<00:03:00.380> time<00:03:00.620> axis<00:03:00.890> very<00:03:01.310> easily<00:03:01.580> and<00:03:01.940> i<00:03:02.420> can<00:03:02.599> have

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
the time axis very easily and i can have

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.470 
the time axis very easily and i can have
a<00:03:02.780> look<00:03:02.959> over<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.290> longer<00:03:03.620> time<00:03:03.800> up<00:03:04.700> two<00:03:04.970> hours

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
a look over a longer time up two hours

you<00:03:08.569> won't<00:03:08.750> see<00:03:08.930> much<00:03:09.080> on<00:03:09.290> there<00:03:09.500> but<00:03:10.069> it<00:03:10.159> gives

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
you won't see much on there but it gives

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.220 
you won't see much on there but it gives
you<00:03:10.400> an<00:03:10.459> idea<00:03:10.670> of<00:03:11.000> how<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.330> process<00:03:11.840> might<00:03:12.049> be

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
you an idea of how the process might be

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.410 
you an idea of how the process might be
reacting<00:03:12.709> both<00:03:13.040> in<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.580> very<00:03:13.849> short<00:03:13.909> time

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
reacting both in a very short time

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.140 
reacting both in a very short time
period<00:03:14.599> and<00:03:15.140> also<00:03:15.739> a<00:03:15.950> very<00:03:16.190> long<00:03:16.459> time<00:03:16.700> period

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
period and also a very long time period

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.390 
period and also a very long time period
this<00:03:17.540> is<00:03:17.720> really<00:03:18.049> really<00:03:18.470> helpful<00:03:18.739> to<00:03:19.129> me<00:03:19.250> to

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
different exchanger here we're looking

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.899 
different exchanger here we're looking
at<00:03:33.049> a<00:03:33.110> variable<00:03:33.560> speed<00:03:33.860> drive<00:03:34.220> for<00:03:34.640> one<00:03:34.760> of<00:03:34.849> the

operating theatres but the same
principle<00:03:37.340> applies<00:03:37.670> we<00:03:38.540> won't<00:03:38.750> have<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.930> look

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
principle applies we won't have a look

principle applies we won't have a look
at<00:03:39.200> all<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.409> same<00:03:39.620> stuff<00:03:39.799> let's<00:03:40.700> have<00:03:40.819> a<00:03:40.849> look

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
at all the same stuff let's have a look

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.059 
at all the same stuff let's have a look
at<00:03:41.030> something<00:03:41.239> different<00:03:41.720> here<00:03:42.110> we<00:03:42.530> can<00:03:42.890> zoom

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
at something different here we can zoom

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.270 
at something different here we can zoom
in<00:03:43.610> and<00:03:43.640> have<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.060> look<00:03:44.150> very<00:03:44.750> closely<00:03:45.110> at<00:03:45.410> all

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280

the<00:03:50.989> I<00:03:51.019> valves<00:03:51.650> what<00:03:51.799> they<00:03:51.950> might<00:03:52.160> be<00:03:52.190> doing

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
the I valves what they might be doing

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.280 
the I valves what they might be doing
that's<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:52.940> internal<00:03:53.299> values<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:53.810> here's

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
that's the internal values and here's

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.130 
that's the internal values and here's
the<00:03:54.470> one<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:55.120> engineer<00:03:56.120> really<00:03:56.599> appreciates

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
the one the engineer really appreciates

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.780 
the one the engineer really appreciates
at<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.379> hospital<00:03:57.829> he's<00:03:58.069> able<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.459> see<00:03:58.640> exactly

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
at the hospital he's able to see exactly

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.289 
at the hospital he's able to see exactly
what<00:03:59.390> is<00:03:59.420> being<00:03:59.540> calculated<00:04:00.140> at<00:04:00.709> all<00:04:00.920> times<00:04:01.299> so

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
what is being calculated at all times so

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.509 
what is being calculated at all times so
we<00:04:02.390> can<00:04:02.510> see<00:04:02.690> how<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:02.900> P<00:04:03.470> term<00:04:03.709> is<00:04:03.890> calculated

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
we can see how the P term is calculated

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.729 
we can see how the P term is calculated
that's<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.849> gain<00:04:05.090> how<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:05.840> integral<00:04:06.379> term<00:04:06.560> is

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
that's the gain how the integral term is

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.160 
that's the gain how the integral term is
calculated<00:04:07.489> and<00:04:07.609> how<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.120> D<00:04:08.390> term<00:04:08.660> here<00:04:08.989> is

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
calculated and how the D term here is

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.860 
calculated and how the D term here is
calculated<00:04:10.069> he<00:04:10.819> really<00:04:11.030> appreciates<00:04:11.629> being

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
calculated he really appreciates being

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.960 
calculated he really appreciates being
able<00:04:12.140> to<00:04:12.230> see<00:04:12.410> all<00:04:12.470> this<00:04:12.680> then<00:04:13.250> finally<00:04:13.609> all

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
able to see all this then finally all

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.460 
able to see all this then finally all
these<00:04:14.209> numbers<00:04:14.420> are<00:04:14.660> brought<00:04:14.840> together<00:04:15.019> and

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
these numbers are brought together and

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.740 
these numbers are brought together and
you<00:04:15.769> can<00:04:15.920> see<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.190> output<00:04:16.579> here<00:04:16.789> which<00:04:17.329> is<00:04:17.479> fed

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
you can see the output here which is fed

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.379 
you can see the output here which is fed
to<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:19.449> in<00:04:20.449> this<00:04:20.720> case<00:04:20.930> variable<00:04:21.530> speed<00:04:21.799> drive

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
to the in this case variable speed drive

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.000 
to the in this case variable speed drive
so<00:04:23.389> there<00:04:23.570> you<00:04:23.600> have<00:04:23.720> it<00:04:23.900> by<00:04:24.470> giving<00:04:24.590> me<00:04:24.770> the

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
so there you have it by giving me the

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.590 
so there you have it by giving me the
hardware<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:25.550> software<00:04:25.699> tools<00:04:26.210> that<00:04:26.510> I<00:04:26.570> need
