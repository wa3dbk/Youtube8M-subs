00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
the last question with your development

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.860 
the last question with your development
team<00:04:27.840> and<00:04:28.410> then<00:04:28.950> working<00:04:29.190> on<00:04:29.430> ps4<00:04:30.030> and<00:04:30.330> xbox

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
team and then working on ps4 and xbox

right cool now my thing is this with ps4
and<00:04:51.720> xbox<00:04:52.350> one<00:04:52.470> from<00:04:53.070> a<00:04:53.160> development

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
and xbox one from a development

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.670 
and xbox one from a development
standpoint<00:04:53.970> and<00:04:54.480> the<00:04:54.510> future<00:04:55.410> of<00:04:55.440> these

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
standpoint and the future of these

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.360 
standpoint and the future of these
systems<00:04:56.060> which<00:04:57.060> one<00:04:57.300> you<00:04:57.480> feel<00:04:57.840> gives<00:04:58.830> but

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
systems which one you feel gives but

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.290 
systems which one you feel gives but
there's<00:04:59.640> no<00:04:59.820> more<00:05:00.240> to<00:05:01.230> show<00:05:01.550> to<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.580> fans<00:05:02.970> in

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
there's no more to show to the fans in

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.810 
there's no more to show to the fans in
terms<00:05:03.600> of<00:05:03.750> performance<00:05:04.340> everything<00:05:05.340> which

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
terms of performance everything which

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.540 
terms of performance everything which
one<00:05:06.060> do<00:05:06.510> you<00:05:06.630> feel<00:05:06.990> would<00:05:07.530> eventually<00:05:07.980> be<00:05:08.310> the

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
one do you feel would eventually be the

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.970 
one do you feel would eventually be the
one<00:05:08.970> to<00:05:09.120> give<00:05:09.300> you<00:05:09.540> more<00:05:09.930> to<00:05:10.230> give<00:05:10.440> to<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.680> fans

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
one to give you more to give to the fans

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.840 
one to give you more to give to the fans
but<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.460> good<00:05:11.640> news<00:05:11.670> is<00:05:12.210> that<00:05:13.130> well<00:05:14.130> eh<00:05:14.160> we

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
but the good news is that well eh we

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
but the good news is that well eh we
don't<00:05:14.970> know<00:05:15.150> yet<00:05:15.180> because<00:05:15.390> we're<00:05:15.570> not<00:05:15.690> done

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
don't know yet because we're not done

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.180 
don't know yet because we're not done
making<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.260> boxes<00:05:16.680> they're<00:05:16.860> still<00:05:17.070> in

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
making the boxes they're still in

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.380 
making the boxes they're still in
development<00:05:17.640> they're<00:05:17.730> not<00:05:17.850> final<00:05:18.240> but

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
development they're not final but

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.360 
development they're not final but
ultimately<00:05:19.110> what<00:05:19.350> really<00:05:19.590> matters<00:05:19.890> to<00:05:20.040> us<00:05:20.070> is

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
ultimately what really matters to us is

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.190 
ultimately what really matters to us is
they're<00:05:20.580> both<00:05:20.730> really<00:05:20.940> powerful<00:05:21.510> more

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
they're both really powerful more

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.720 
they're both really powerful more
importantly<00:05:22.650> they're<00:05:22.800> both<00:05:22.980> really<00:05:23.280> similar

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
importantly they're both really similar

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.490 
importantly they're both really similar
so<00:05:24.360> we<00:05:24.480> don't<00:05:24.660> have<00:05:24.750> to<00:05:24.900> spend<00:05:25.110> as<00:05:25.260> much<00:05:25.440> time

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
so we don't have to spend as much time

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.500 
so we don't have to spend as much time
getting<00:05:26.190> the<00:05:26.310> game<00:05:26.520> that<00:05:26.730> we<00:05:26.850> want<00:05:27.060> to<00:05:27.180> make<00:05:27.330> to

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
getting the game that we want to make to

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.240 
getting the game that we want to make to
work<00:05:27.540> on<00:05:27.900> this<00:05:28.140> thing<00:05:28.200> and<00:05:28.590> to<00:05:28.710> work<00:05:28.890> on<00:05:29.040> this

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
work on this thing and to work on this

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.740 
work on this thing and to work on this
thing<00:05:29.310> because<00:05:29.640> they<00:05:29.760> work<00:05:29.910> differently<00:05:30.090> they

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
thing because they work differently they

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.720 
thing because they work differently they
work<00:05:30.990> pretty<00:05:31.200> similarly<00:05:31.830> to<00:05:32.100> one<00:05:32.220> another<00:05:32.490> so

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
work pretty similarly to one another so

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.310 
work pretty similarly to one another so
we<00:05:32.850> can<00:05:33.000> spend<00:05:33.210> more<00:05:33.270> time<00:05:33.450> making<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.140> game

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
we can spend more time making the game

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.470 
we can spend more time making the game
great<00:05:34.620> and<00:05:34.860> less<00:05:35.070> time<00:05:35.280> going<00:05:35.580> oh<00:05:35.880> how<00:05:36.300> do<00:05:36.360> we

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
great and less time going oh how do we

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.150 
great and less time going oh how do we
make<00:05:36.750> it<00:05:36.870> work<00:05:37.020> on<00:05:37.230> this<00:05:37.380> console<00:05:37.830> that<00:05:37.950> works

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
make it work on this console that works

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.040 
make it work on this console that works
like<00:05:38.370> this<00:05:38.610> and<00:05:38.910> then<00:05:39.419> how<00:05:39.540> do<00:05:39.600> we<00:05:39.750> make<00:05:39.900> it

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
like this and then how do we make it

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.300 
like this and then how do we make it
work<00:05:40.140> on<00:05:40.320> this<00:05:40.470> console<00:05:40.860> that<00:05:40.950> works<00:05:41.130> in<00:05:41.250> a

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
work on this console that works in a

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.040 
work on this console that works in a
different<00:05:41.490> way<00:05:41.730> because<00:05:41.910> we<00:05:42.180> can't<00:05:42.419> you<00:05:42.960> know

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
different way because we can't you know

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.870 
different way because we can't you know
I<00:05:43.080> mean<00:05:43.260> so<00:05:43.680> ultimately<00:05:44.070> what<00:05:44.370> matters<00:05:44.430> to<00:05:44.760> us

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
I mean so ultimately what matters to us

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.850 
I mean so ultimately what matters to us
is<00:05:45.180> long-term<00:05:45.480> we<00:05:45.840> spend<00:05:46.080> less<00:05:46.320> time<00:05:46.590> trigger

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
is long-term we spend less time trigger

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.710 
is long-term we spend less time trigger
trying<00:05:47.280> to<00:05:47.340> figure<00:05:47.580> out<00:05:47.610> like<00:05:47.910> how<00:05:48.120> did<00:05:48.419> you

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
trying to figure out like how did you

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.240 
trying to figure out like how did you
decide<00:05:48.990> to<00:05:49.050> make<00:05:49.260> your<00:05:49.470> box<00:05:49.710> versus<00:05:50.100> how<00:05:50.190> do

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
decide to make your box versus how do

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.980 
decide to make your box versus how do
they<00:05:50.520> decide<00:05:50.700> to<00:05:50.880> make<00:05:51.030> bears<00:05:51.270> and<00:05:51.510> just<00:05:51.870> like

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
they decide to make bears and just like

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.240 
they decide to make bears and just like
we're<00:05:52.110> gonna<00:05:52.200> make<00:05:52.350> a<00:05:52.410> great<00:05:52.620> game<00:05:52.830> and<00:05:52.860> spend

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
we're gonna make a great game and spend

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.920 
we're gonna make a great game and spend
more<00:05:53.400> time<00:05:53.610> like<00:05:53.850> polishing<00:05:54.480> it<00:05:54.690> and<00:05:54.810> making

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
more time like polishing it and making

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.180 
more time like polishing it and making
it<00:05:55.080> better<00:05:55.260> and<00:05:55.470> making<00:05:55.650> it<00:05:55.770> great<00:05:55.950> on<00:05:56.160> all

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
it better and making it great on all

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.520 
it better and making it great on all
platforms<00:05:56.790> I<00:05:57.270> can't<00:05:57.750> wait<00:05:57.870> to<00:05:57.900> see<00:05:58.140> well<00:05:58.290> you

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
platforms I can't wait to see well you
