it<00:00:25.970> works<00:00:26.150> on<00:00:26.270> a<00:00:26.330> steady-state<00:00:26.810> memory<00:00:27.350> so

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
it works on a steady-state memory so

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.200 
it works on a steady-state memory so
it's<00:00:27.620> got<00:00:27.770> a<00:00:27.800> one<00:00:28.070> gigabyte<00:00:28.520> memory<00:00:28.970> built

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
it's got a one gigabyte memory built

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.120 
it's got a one gigabyte memory built
into<00:00:29.539> it<00:00:29.690> and<00:00:29.810> it<00:00:30.140> allows<00:00:30.320> you<00:00:30.470> to<00:00:30.500> record<00:00:30.680> both

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
to you could get that much that much

the<00:00:58.160> microphone<00:00:58.820> if<00:00:59.030> you<00:00:59.120> can<00:00:59.270> see<00:00:59.450> it<00:00:59.540> here<00:00:59.899> is

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
the microphone if you can see it here is

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.139 
the microphone if you can see it here is
right<00:01:00.559> at<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:00.770> end<00:01:00.920> of<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.129> device<00:01:01.399> I<00:01:01.700> thought

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
right at the end of the device I thought

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.270 
right at the end of the device I thought
it<00:01:02.239> was<00:01:02.360> excellent<00:01:02.960> for<00:01:03.020> basically<00:01:03.770> a<00:01:03.890> single

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
it was excellent for basically a single

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.429 
it was excellent for basically a single
speaker<00:01:04.489> scenario<00:01:05.360> but<00:01:05.750> it<00:01:05.840> did<00:01:06.020> pick<00:01:06.229> up<00:01:06.320> a

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
speaker scenario but it did pick up a

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.709 
speaker scenario but it did pick up a
lot<00:01:06.590> of<00:01:06.619> ambient<00:01:07.219> noise<00:01:07.280> as<00:01:07.670> well<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:08.179> if<00:01:08.450> you

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:08.719 
lot of ambient noise as well so if you

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:10.090 
lot of ambient noise as well so if you
were<00:01:08.929> going<00:01:09.170> to<00:01:09.259> be<00:01:09.319> able<00:01:09.409> to<00:01:09.560> record<00:01:09.979> a

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
were going to be able to record a

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.949 
were going to be able to record a
conversation<00:01:10.579> maybe<00:01:11.240> a<00:01:11.359> discussion<00:01:11.719> group

00:01:11.949 --> 00:01:11.959 
conversation maybe a discussion group

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:13.779 
conversation maybe a discussion group
you<00:01:12.499> have<00:01:12.799> to<00:01:12.889> be<00:01:13.009> careful<00:01:13.369> because<00:01:13.490> I<00:01:13.609> did

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
you have to be careful because I did

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:14.980 
you have to be careful because I did
find<00:01:14.030> some<00:01:14.179> of<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.329> voices<00:01:14.630> might<00:01:14.810> get<00:01:14.959> a

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
find some of the voices might get a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.899 
find some of the voices might get a
little<00:01:15.200> bit<00:01:15.439> muffled<00:01:15.709> when<00:01:16.399> you<00:01:16.490> want<00:01:16.670> to<00:01:16.759> play
