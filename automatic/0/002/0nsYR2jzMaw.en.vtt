 I want to show you my musk ducks 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:23.880
 we are now out of the enclosures released into the garden 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.699
 for what so that they collected 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.050
 any bugs, all lend themselves to any 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.230
 apples meaning they are orderlies 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.350

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.800
 it's pretty cold but you see ducks 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.329
 feels great in their garden 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.329
 such feeders are suspended so that they will not 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.600
 it was cold in these feeders in 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.250
 suspended feeders reside 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.250
 food feed 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.070
 I'll pour corn on them now because 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.430
 she has been very happy for a long time 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.979
 digested ducks and gives them how to 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.189
 extra heat for the body here 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.020
 see such suspended feeders 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:13.290
 look how they like to walk on 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.950
 the garden is very pretty they have such 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.979
 pleasant pleasure they brush 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.640

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.119
 I want to warn you can say 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.170

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.530
 free range 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.400
 from aviaries need them necessarily 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.009
 trim the wings if you didn't 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.140
 you will do it with me 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.060
 there was one such pretty 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.790
 case 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.610
 A neighbor comes to me and asks Julia 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.860
 nothing's gone 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.990
 oh, I think, of course, that was lost 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.350
 gulf it was last year of course 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.619
 same duck musky she flew away to a neighbor 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.530
 somewhere in about three houses we are with him 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.619
 tried to catch this duck having driven her into 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.550
 glass greenhouse yes there it was 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:10.470
 the booth broke the big glass of the greenhouse and 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.370
 flew away flew away into the unknown 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.970
 direction 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.489
 so we and this duck and did not find it had to 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.400
 say goodbye to her but the fact is that very 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.769
 it is a pity that after all flew away duck she 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.000
 surely doomed to death i can 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:29.970
 eat dogs or she will freeze therefore 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.120
 no need to tempt fate and better for them 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.840
 trim the wings here look how they 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.440

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.890
 what i want to say is ducks middle 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.319
 july you have revealed a day of ducklings here 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.910
 they are already pretty big 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:50.569
 grown we are already starting to fight u so i 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.519
 I want to tell you the meat is just something 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.500
 extraordinary we kept earlier peking 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.489
 Beijing ki meat window 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.709
 not comparable with meat and this duck and 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.700
 This duck still pretty she 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.730
 precocious than i like this duck 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.040
 if Beijing whom time Beijing Cooney to score 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.069
 that is, she has a term when she has grown to 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.620
 slaughter about three months all later 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.859
 Well, as they say, you can lose weight 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.099
 and all the meat is not so much 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:26.569
 Muscovy duck Muscovy duck continues 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:30.060
 grow somewhere around the year constantly 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:33.930
 gaining muscle meat mass 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:37.590
 ie duck duck that yearling is 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.650
 very large ducks drake and slaughter 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.349
 somewhere 7 kilograms net weight that is 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.810
 the duck continues to grow but here again
