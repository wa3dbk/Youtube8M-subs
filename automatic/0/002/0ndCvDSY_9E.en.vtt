okay welcome back to part 2 of my
tutorial<00:00:03.090> on<00:00:03.990> I've<00:00:04.529> are<00:00:04.740> flying<00:00:04.950> on<00:00:05.160> that<00:00:05.910> sim

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:06.890 
tutorial on I've are flying on that sim

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.270 
tutorial on I've are flying on that sim
this<00:00:07.890> section<00:00:08.519> will<00:00:08.760> cover<00:00:09.000> SIDS<00:00:09.840> and

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
this section will cover SIDS and

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.459 
this section will cover SIDS and
depending<00:00:11.280> on<00:00:11.340> how<00:00:11.490> long<00:00:11.990> winded<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.139> am<00:00:13.320> it

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
depending on how long winded I am it

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.410 
depending on how long winded I am it
could<00:00:13.650> also<00:00:13.830> get<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.280> just<00:00:14.490> starts<00:00:14.849> today<00:00:15.030> so

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
could also get and just starts today so

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.349 
could also get and just starts today so
stay<00:00:15.780> tuned<00:00:16.789> alright<00:00:17.789> now<00:00:17.970> I'll<00:00:18.150> start

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
stay tuned alright now I'll start

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.439 
stay tuned alright now I'll start
getting<00:00:18.480> into<00:00:18.930> CID<00:00:19.800> well<00:00:20.760> what<00:00:20.939> exactly<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.359> I

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
getting into CID well what exactly is I

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.660 
getting into CID well what exactly is I
said<00:00:21.750> Sid<00:00:22.020> stands<00:00:22.320> for<00:00:22.619> standard<00:00:22.980> instrument

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
said Sid stands for standard instrument

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.910 
said Sid stands for standard instrument
departure<00:00:23.990> it's<00:00:24.990> basically<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.470> rat<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
departure it's basically a rat that a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.759 
departure it's basically a rat that a
pilot<00:00:26.130> flies<00:00:26.400> after<00:00:26.670> takeoff<00:00:27.210> if<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.199> have

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
pilot flies after takeoff if you have

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.139 
pilot flies after takeoff if you have
heard<00:00:29.750> that<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:31.460> airplanes<00:00:32.460> fly<00:00:32.910> like

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
heard that that airplanes fly like

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.000 
heard that that airplanes fly like
highways<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.960> sky<00:00:34.170> there<00:00:34.680> are<00:00:34.710> different

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
highways in the sky there are different

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.280 
highways in the sky there are different
routes<00:00:35.160> well<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.850> CID<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.239> basically<00:00:36.660> like<00:00:37.110> an

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
routes well the CID is basically like an

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.270 
routes well the CID is basically like an
on-ramp<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.910> highway<00:00:39.950> it's<00:00:40.950> gonna<00:00:41.070> get

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
on-ramp to that highway it's gonna get

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.459 
on-ramp to that highway it's gonna get
you<00:00:41.489> onto<00:00:42.000> your<00:00:42.059> route<00:00:42.329> as<00:00:42.719> quickly<00:00:43.079> and

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
you onto your route as quickly and

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.549 
you onto your route as quickly and
efficiently<00:00:43.890> as<00:00:44.190> possible

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
efficiently as possible

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.240 
efficiently as possible
there<00:00:46.559> are<00:00:46.800> three<00:00:47.129> different<00:00:47.280> types<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.180> SIDS

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
there are three different types of SIDS

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.650 
there are three different types of SIDS
pilot<00:00:50.250> navigation<00:00:50.850> radar<00:00:51.090> vectors<00:00:51.449> and

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
pilot navigation radar vectors and

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.779 
pilot navigation radar vectors and
hybrid<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> couple<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.190> them<00:00:53.340> here

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
hybrid and I have a couple of them here

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.040 
hybrid and I have a couple of them here
the<00:00:54.420> pilot<00:00:54.809> navigation<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:56.719> one<00:00:57.719> like<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the pilot navigation is one like the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.960 
the pilot navigation is one like the
ocean<00:00:58.379> 3<00:00:58.680> departure<00:00:59.160> which<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.789> one<00:01:04.970> this

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
ocean 3 departure which is this one this

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.050 
ocean 3 departure which is this one this
is<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.420> ocean<00:01:06.780> 3<00:01:07.049> departure<00:01:07.670> as<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:08.909> see

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
is the ocean 3 departure as you can see

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.899 
is the ocean 3 departure as you can see
the<00:01:09.180> name<00:01:09.360> over<00:01:09.720> here<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.460> that's<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.670> route

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
the name over here and that's the route

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.370 
the name over here and that's the route
that<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.270> would<00:01:12.360> fly<00:01:12.540> looks<00:01:12.780> confusing<00:01:13.140> now

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
that you would fly looks confusing now

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.600 
that you would fly looks confusing now
but<00:01:13.590> we'll<00:01:13.740> get<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.970> next<00:01:15.210> one<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
but we'll get to it the next one is the

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.179 
but we'll get to it the next one is the
Cincinnati<00:01:17.610> 2<00:01:18.150> or<00:01:18.650> CVG<00:01:19.650> 2<00:01:19.830> as<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.189> saw<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.780> but

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
Cincinnati 2 or CVG 2 as you saw it but

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.320 
Cincinnati 2 or CVG 2 as you saw it but
depending<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.250> which<00:01:23.340> runway<00:01:23.520> take<00:01:23.880> off<00:01:24.060> it's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
depending on which runway take off it's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.210 
depending on which runway take off it's
a<00:01:24.509> heading<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.049> fly<00:01:25.320> initially<00:01:25.950> and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
a heading that you fly initially and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.539 
a heading that you fly initially and
then<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:27.360> whatever<00:01:27.689> your<00:01:27.900> transition<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:30.200> and

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
then to whatever your transition is and

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.270 
then to whatever your transition is and
this<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> rocky<00:01:33.180> for<00:01:33.689> departure<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:35.220> is

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
this is the rocky for departure this is

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.350 
this is the rocky for departure this is
the<00:01:35.640> hybrid<00:01:35.880> one<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.960> has<00:01:37.200> kind<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.360> best

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
the hybrid one it has kind of the best

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.670 
the hybrid one it has kind of the best
of<00:01:39.540> both<00:01:39.659> worlds<00:01:39.689> if<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.259> want<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.439> put<00:01:40.560> it

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
of both worlds if you want to put it

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.580 
of both worlds if you want to put it
that<00:01:40.770> way<00:01:40.829> I'll<00:01:41.400> explain<00:01:41.759> more<00:01:41.970> later<00:01:45.590> alright

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
that way I'll explain more later alright

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.859 
that way I'll explain more later alright
this<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.130> ocean<00:01:47.460> 3<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.240> our<00:01:48.390> pilot

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
this is the ocean 3 this is our pilot

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.410 
this is the ocean 3 this is our pilot
now<00:01:49.310> which<00:01:50.310> say<00:01:51.649> that<00:01:52.649> our<00:01:52.950> active<00:01:53.790> runway<00:01:54.119> is

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
now which say that our active runway is

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.170 
now which say that our active runway is
right<00:01:55.380> here<00:01:58.430> alright<00:01:59.430> here<00:01:59.759> we<00:01:59.790> go<00:01:59.880> there's

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
right here alright here we go there's

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.580 
right here alright here we go there's
our<00:02:00.360> active<00:02:00.689> runway<00:02:01.020> right<00:02:01.110> there<00:02:01.350> which

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
our active runway right there which

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.039 
our active runway right there which
means<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.070> would<00:02:02.189> take<00:02:02.340> off<00:02:03.049> fly

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
means that you would take off fly

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.260 
means that you would take off fly
heading<00:02:04.290> 249<00:02:06.439> get<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.649> here<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.310> docker<00:02:08.580> then

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
heading 249 get to here the docker then

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.420 
heading 249 get to here the docker then
you<00:02:09.420> would<00:02:09.539> go<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.780> 18<00:02:10.760> to<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.000> dole<00:02:12.270> REE

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
you would go to 18 to the dole REE

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.509 
you would go to 18 to the dole REE
excuse<00:02:14.430> me<00:02:14.549> to<00:02:14.760> Wyler<00:02:15.180> which<00:02:15.569> is<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:15.900> one

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
excuse me to Wyler which is this one

excuse me to Wyler which is this one
continue<00:02:17.519> heading<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:18.060> 16<00:02:18.569> to<00:02:19.049> shave<00:02:19.700> then<00:02:20.700> to

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
continue heading to 16 to shave then to

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:27.440 
continue heading to 16 to shave then to
heavy<00:02:22.519> Holt's<00:02:23.519> ocean<00:02:25.010> seal<00:02:26.010> Beach<00:02:26.280> Sebby<00:02:27.090> and

Daggett and then you would go on your
way

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.319 

all<00:02:32.819> right<00:02:33.590> this<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.640> radar<00:02:35.909> vectors

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
all right this is the radar vectors

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.000 
all right this is the radar vectors
which<00:02:36.599> means<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:36.989> say<00:02:37.200> we<00:02:37.379> are<00:02:37.409> taking<00:02:37.890> off

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
which means that say we are taking off

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.929 
which means that say we are taking off
of<00:02:38.280> this<00:02:39.269> runway<00:02:39.720> right<00:02:39.959> here<00:02:40.609> you<00:02:41.609> would<00:02:41.730> take

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
of this runway right here you would take

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.550 
of this runway right here you would take
off<00:02:42.150> fly<00:02:42.870> 4<00:02:43.620> degrees<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:45.319> you<00:02:46.319> would<00:02:46.439> continue

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
off fly 4 degrees and you would continue

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.250 
off fly 4 degrees and you would continue
that<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.280> then<00:02:47.430> say<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:48.329> your<00:02:48.510> transition

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
that and then say that your transition

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.569 
that and then say that your transition
was<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:50.870> Munsey<00:02:51.870> over<00:02:52.169> here<00:02:52.439> then<00:02:53.430> the

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
was the Munsey over here then the

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.710 
was the Munsey over here then the
controller<00:02:54.000> would<00:02:54.209> give<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.629> radar<00:02:55.230> vectors

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
controller would give you radar vectors

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.000 
controller would give you radar vectors
over<00:02:57.720> there<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:58.049> you'd<00:02:58.169> say<00:02:58.439> this<00:02:58.650> heading<00:02:58.889> for

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
over there so you'd say this heading for

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.080 
over there so you'd say this heading for
a<00:02:59.040> while<00:02:59.159> whatever<00:02:59.400> then<00:02:59.669> they<00:02:59.790> were<00:02:59.879> maybe

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
a while whatever then they were maybe

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.300 
a while whatever then they were maybe
Turney<00:03:00.510> this<00:03:00.780> way<00:03:01.049> and<00:03:01.439> maybe<00:03:01.950> have<00:03:02.129> some

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
Turney this way and maybe have some

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.000 
Turney this way and maybe have some
traffic<00:03:02.549> so<00:03:03.000> you'd<00:03:03.180> go<00:03:03.359> up<00:03:03.409> then<00:03:04.409> you'd<00:03:04.650> go<00:03:04.889> in

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
traffic so you'd go up then you'd go in

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:12.710 
traffic so you'd go up then you'd go in
here<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.519> continue<00:03:06.209> on<00:03:06.510> your<00:03:06.870> way<00:03:11.419> the<00:03:12.419> final

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
here and continue on your way the final

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.860 
here and continue on your way the final
one<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:12.870> our<00:03:13.230> hybrid<00:03:13.859> as<00:03:14.069> you<00:03:14.790> can<00:03:14.970> see<00:03:15.450> there

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
one is our hybrid as you can see there

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.399 
one is our hybrid as you can see there
is<00:03:16.079> a<00:03:16.109> definite<00:03:16.620> route<00:03:17.780> that<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:18.989> can<00:03:19.139> see<00:03:19.290> by

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
is a definite route that you can see by

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.089 
is a definite route that you can see by
these<00:03:19.470> bold<00:03:19.889> lines<00:03:20.840> so<00:03:21.840> if<00:03:22.019> you<00:03:22.139> take<00:03:22.319> off<00:03:22.560> here

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
these bold lines so if you take off here

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.319 
these bold lines so if you take off here
on<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.729> runway<00:03:24.560> you<00:03:25.560> would<00:03:25.709> take<00:03:25.919> off<00:03:26.329> fly

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
on this runway you would take off fly

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.899 
on this runway you would take off fly
runway<00:03:27.569> heading<00:03:28.310> for<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.370> little<00:03:29.549> bit<00:03:29.699> then

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
runway heading for a little bit then

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.819 
runway heading for a little bit then
they<00:03:30.060> would<00:03:30.209> write<00:03:30.389> or<00:03:30.540> vector<00:03:30.840> u<00:03:31.139> onto<00:03:31.169> this

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
they would write or vector u onto this

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.210 
they would write or vector u onto this
course<00:03:32.750> so<00:03:33.750> that<00:03:33.810> getting<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.889> you<00:03:34.949> over<00:03:35.129> this

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
course so that getting to you over this

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.890 
course so that getting to you over this
way<00:03:35.430> maybe<00:03:35.669> and<00:03:36.150> then<00:03:36.359> they<00:03:36.479> would<00:03:36.599> take<00:03:36.750> you

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
way maybe and then they would take you

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.330 
way maybe and then they would take you
down<00:03:37.109> and<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:38.190> would<00:03:38.280> go<00:03:38.909> on<00:03:40.069> then<00:03:41.069> take

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
down and you would go on then take

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.500 
down and you would go on then take
spinner<00:03:41.819> and<00:03:42.269> then<00:03:43.019> on<00:03:43.260> your<00:03:43.379> way
