 roof of the house you you have the house

 slab that a singular space if you have 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.620
 roof 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.780
 you could also boot contained 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.600
 that they transparent a video of 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.430
 today then it is those those 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.670
 olinda mac symbols sitting with 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.490
 star is the symbol of snow 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.700
 I had bought already ready windows or 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.070
 and if this star in the form of snow - and 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.270
 connect a certain name but not know 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.940
 how to put in title 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.429
 I also did it in another way that was 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.990
 with the hot glue then so you 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:28.990
 may be doing in various ways 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.740
 berlin because so I know that 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:40.300
 in Brazil it's heat but christmas is a 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:44.810
 own winter thing to itself 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:47.060
 then this symbol of snow because 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.500
 it also shows quite well 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.569
 super cool too if you want to do 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:57.500
 nine are very much that you like 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:59.000
 is a tutorial that is very easy to do 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.280
 So folks, I'm going to start doing this. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.709
 star she is ready and styrofoam 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.170
 I bought it cheaply two euros 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:08.929
 so I'm going to glue it on the normal 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.599
 school and I use a pigment at the time 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.200
 the same ones that wants decency and he is well 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.580
 bright yes and 16 the very old brush 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.680
 because the rope will ruin the brush 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.920
 so I start passing the rope across 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.750
 star and then I'll play the 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.060
 glitter over this segment 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.760
 But this pigment is for making 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.920
 all this star but the other did not give 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.250
 so in this monza only this one that goes 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.629
 look like this looks pretty good on the sides 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.290
 I try to pass from the sides like this 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.840
 in time to pass 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.269
 is the pigment with the glue only that does not 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.469
 so much is pretty effect 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.510
 star 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.849
 so little blurred with white then 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.560
 end up leaving then I'll pass like this 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.040
 giving a beat and peace to the other 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.080
 side to not be embarrassed then the right 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.650
 athlete's pass also the same way 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.030
 [Music] 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.280
 Then she'll be like this. 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.260
 I'll hang her to dry her 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.180
 that if you want to move to play more 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.069
 pigments on top after 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.170
 so it will get brighter then I 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.510
 I spend more, I use a dish like that. 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.139
 makes mess at home is easier for 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.849
 clean up afterwards I'll hang on to it and 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.980
 let it dry while I do the 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.230
 another star she will be made with 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.000
 the hot glue so so if you tremble 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.430
 asks for help from a person who does not tremble because 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.829
 I started to do but how I trembled 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.239
 I asked him to continue for me. 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:37.230
 will make a type an asterisk is not 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:39.599
 hard to do and then you have 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.040
 the star several times to 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.470
 stay very thick 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.790
 then after doing at the tip as time 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.500
 in a wrong niche because I wanted to do 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.620
 another model so later I asked 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.209
 adjust to fit you get caught in a 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.430
 the stylus is cutting into the parts 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.949
 you so wrong right optics 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.669
 then with the help of a knife you 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:04:01.139
 will lift her to get her out of the paper. 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:03.900
 and we used this paper that was a 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:06.629
 background of a picture actually only with 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.150
 a glue took this color from the 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.159
 On the other hand, she became the only 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.269
 that how I'm going to get the shine over 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.489
 it does not matter 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.400
 so I'll always go over and over 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.169
 that white glue and I'm going to use the 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.909
 I used it before the other side stays like this 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:25.110
 but I will not use this side I use the 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:27.630
 another and this star that is used only one 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.570
 side so I'll use that always welcomes 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.130
 myth and that brush and pepper that 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.289
 it will end up does not however I will 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.490
 blend with the white pigment and 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.940
 being beautiful is not done because 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.650
 white star then it will look beautiful 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.330
 then just go across the star and 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.360
 then throw the pigment on top does not have 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.840
 secret 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.940
 [Music] 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.000
 and I'm tapping the brush 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.770
 to fix I try to pass the plate to 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.240
 also pick up the pigment but not 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.980
 It worked 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.150
 then I'll be seeing're going and 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.510
 I had to use this other thread 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.820
 here because the other did not have time I played 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.710
 on top it looks like it's not even pretty 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.740
 wait for good withdrawal because if not then 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.860
 You touch up will leave so I waited. 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.320
 serve well and I'll paste this business 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.610
 to hang objects like Christmas so 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.610
 Coca cola really hot 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.850
 and then I drew those pearls region to 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.070
 bracelet I had that I did not like 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.870
 but for me to stick to the star 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.940
 you can use other things too that 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.100
 if you prefer others in the pearls 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.630
 more beautiful white I had not then zÃ© 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.150
 by myself 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:39.140
 Then I'll speak at each point of the 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:41.550
 star and then I also put it on 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.939
 kind of way to look cuter like this 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.939
 [Music] 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.530
 the end result stayed like this then 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.330
 that 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.180
 Now I'll show you both 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:58.419
 hanging this one here with the glue left 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.069
 so she looks unbeautiful in her bedroom if 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.229
 You can do many more. 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:06.370
 so cool to get worse or you can 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:07.900
 also always hang on the tree was 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.569
 beautiful 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:14.020
 I can not see it very well so the color 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:16.419
 because of what at night is not 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.949
 another one she was like that too 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.039
 brighter than that 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:23.469
 proposal that this pigment is more beautiful 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:25.240
 but I 'm not scared so that's what I hope 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:27.520

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.979
 do as he is 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.539
