invisible<00:01:49.899> and<00:01:50.050> check<00:01:50.200> out<00:01:50.319> the<00:01:50.410> invisible<00:01:50.860> so

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
invisible and check out the invisible so

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.490 
invisible and check out the invisible so
I<00:01:51.849> have<00:01:52.390> a<00:01:52.420> lot<00:01:52.599> I<00:01:52.660> had<00:01:52.899> someone<00:01:53.110> asked<00:01:53.440> me

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
I have a lot I had someone asked me

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.279 
I have a lot I had someone asked me
actually<00:01:53.709> and<00:01:54.069> they<00:01:54.190> asked<00:01:54.399> me<00:01:54.520> if<00:01:54.700> I<00:01:55.060> do<00:01:55.660> live

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
actually and they asked me if I do live

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.550 
actually and they asked me if I do live
commentary<00:01:57.009> when<00:01:57.819> I<00:01:57.849> do<00:01:57.970> all<00:01:58.660> my<00:01:58.720> videos<00:01:59.080> and

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
commentary when I do all my videos and

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.229 
commentary when I do all my videos and
ninety-five<00:02:00.369> percent<00:02:00.550> of<00:02:00.819> them<00:02:00.910> are<00:02:01.030> live

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:01.239 
ninety-five percent of them are live

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:03.630 
ninety-five percent of them are live
commentary<00:02:01.840> like<00:02:02.560> if<00:02:02.679> you<00:02:02.770> see<00:02:02.920> a<00:02:02.950> jump<00:02:03.310> cut<00:02:03.399> or

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
commentary like if you see a jump cut or

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.270 
commentary like if you see a jump cut or
two<00:02:03.849> like<00:02:04.840> a<00:02:05.080> jump<00:02:05.410> cuts<00:02:05.679> pretty<00:02:06.039> much

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
two like a jump cuts pretty much

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.130 
two like a jump cuts pretty much
significant<00:02:06.940> say<00:02:07.330> this<00:02:07.539> is<00:02:07.690> not<00:02:07.720> a<00:02:07.869> lot<00:02:08.080> of

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
significant say this is not a lot of

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.169 
significant say this is not a lot of
commentary<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.920> only<00:02:09.429> do<00:02:09.580> that<00:02:09.700> stuff<00:02:09.880> and

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
commentary and only do that stuff and

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.420 
commentary and only do that stuff and
stuff<00:02:10.390> have<00:02:10.630> to<00:02:10.780> edit<00:02:10.929> such<00:02:11.739> as<00:02:11.920> BuildCraft

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
stuff have to edit such as BuildCraft

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
stuff have to edit such as BuildCraft
maybe<00:02:12.670> but<00:02:13.329> as<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:13.719> thought<00:02:14.310> being<00:02:15.450> invisible

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
maybe but as I thought being invisible

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.030 
maybe but as I thought being invisible
will<00:02:17.200> make<00:02:17.349> you<00:02:17.469> completely

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
will make you completely

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.970 
will make you completely
visible<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.459> you<00:02:18.549> pretty<00:02:18.700> much<00:02:18.790> just<00:02:18.909> have<00:02:19.360> a

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
visible and you pretty much just have a

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.660 
visible and you pretty much just have a
skateboard<00:02:20.980> like<00:02:21.689> it's<00:02:22.689> just<00:02:23.079> a<00:02:23.349> board<00:02:24.189> flying

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
skateboard like it's just a board flying

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.959 
skateboard like it's just a board flying
around<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.810> doing<00:02:26.500> epic<00:02:26.859> tricked<00:02:27.189> by<00:02:27.370> itself

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969 
around and doing epic tricked by itself

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.550 
around and doing epic tricked by itself
it's<00:02:30.969> kind<00:02:31.299> of<00:02:31.420> cool<00:02:31.719> and<00:02:31.930> kind<00:02:32.109> of<00:02:32.140> weird<00:02:32.409> at

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
it's kind of cool and kind of weird at

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.849 
it's kind of cool and kind of weird at
the<00:02:32.680> same<00:02:33.099> exact<00:02:33.730> time<00:02:34.060> like<00:02:35.049> seeing<00:02:35.379> the<00:02:35.470> 54

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
the same exact time like seeing the 54

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.520 
the same exact time like seeing the 54
you<00:02:35.950> flip<00:02:36.159> like<00:02:36.280> that<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.780> seeing<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.349> kick

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
you flip like that and seeing the kick

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.170 
you flip like that and seeing the kick
of<00:02:38.560> late<00:02:38.859> flip<00:02:39.159> in<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.400> triple<00:02:39.790> flip<00:02:40.000> it's

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
of late flip in the triple flip it's

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.000 
of late flip in the triple flip it's
kind<00:02:40.359> of<00:02:40.450> cool<00:02:40.720> with<00:02:40.930> just<00:02:41.049> a<00:02:41.230> skateboard<00:02:41.739> I

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
kind of cool with just a skateboard I

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.160 
kind of cool with just a skateboard I
actually<00:02:42.670> almost<00:02:42.970> wished<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.599> skateboard

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
actually almost wished the skateboard

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.149 
actually almost wished the skateboard
itself<00:02:44.620> just<00:02:45.099> showed<00:02:45.370> up<00:02:45.609> like<00:02:46.290> bigger<00:02:47.290> like

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
itself just showed up like bigger like

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.979 
itself just showed up like bigger like
maybe<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.489> wind<00:02:48.879> visible<00:02:49.299> mode<00:02:49.480> may<00:02:49.810> only<00:02:49.900> be

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
maybe a wind visible mode may only be

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.780 
maybe a wind visible mode may only be
like<00:02:50.079> a<00:02:50.139> big<00:02:50.500> mode<00:02:50.769> that<00:02:51.220> you're<00:02:51.400> gonna<00:02:51.549> lock<00:02:51.760> a

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
like a big mode that you're gonna lock a

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.429 
like a big mode that you're gonna lock a
cheat<00:02:52.209> that<00:02:52.420> makes<00:02:52.599> everything<00:02:52.840> big<00:02:53.200> like

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
cheat that makes everything big like

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.319 
cheat that makes everything big like
your<00:02:53.650> skater<00:02:53.980> runs<00:02:54.340> around<00:02:54.459> big<00:02:54.819> mode<00:02:55.060> and

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
your skater runs around big mode and

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.909 
your skater runs around big mode and
your<00:02:55.420> border<00:02:55.720> be<00:02:55.840> bigger<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.319> then<00:02:56.739> you<00:02:56.829> can

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:56.919 
your border be bigger and then you can

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.229 
your border be bigger and then you can
do<00:02:57.010> invisible<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.609> skate<00:02:57.790> around<00:02:57.909> like<00:02:58.120> an

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
do invisible and skate around like an

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.000 
do invisible and skate around like an
invisible<00:02:58.450> board<00:02:58.989> it<00:02:59.260> would<00:02:59.349> be<00:02:59.470> like<00:02:59.590> a<00:02:59.650> tech

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
invisible board it would be like a tech

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.949 
invisible board it would be like a tech
deck<00:03:00.250> that<00:03:01.060> would<00:03:01.180> be<00:03:01.269> really<00:03:01.450> cool<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:01.900> you

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
deck that would be really cool and you

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.420 
deck that would be really cool and you
can<00:03:02.019> use<00:03:02.200> slow<00:03:02.500> motion<00:03:02.889> and<00:03:02.980> do<00:03:03.099> like<00:03:03.220> really

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
can use slow motion and do like really

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.149 
can use slow motion and do like really
cool<00:03:03.579> montages<00:03:04.200> now<00:03:05.200> if<00:03:05.349> I<00:03:05.439> had<00:03:05.560> patience<00:03:06.040> for

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
cool montages now if I had patience for

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.649 
cool montages now if I had patience for
doing<00:03:06.400> editing<00:03:06.579> and<00:03:06.970> I<00:03:07.060> needed<00:03:07.299> to<00:03:07.359> get<00:03:07.419> a<00:03:07.480> lot

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
doing editing and I needed to get a lot

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.869 
doing editing and I needed to get a lot
of<00:03:07.689> plays<00:03:07.900> I'd<00:03:08.200> do<00:03:08.379> that<00:03:08.560> but<00:03:08.919> it<00:03:09.340> probably

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
of plays I'd do that but it probably

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.490 
of plays I'd do that but it probably
wouldn't<00:03:10.180> got<00:03:10.299> me<00:03:10.480> plays<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.079> it<00:03:11.169> took<00:03:11.349> me

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
wouldn't got me plays and it took me

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.659 
wouldn't got me plays and it took me
awhile<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.829> actually<00:03:12.069> do<00:03:12.220> something<00:03:12.519> that

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:12.669 
awhile to actually do something that

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.740 
awhile to actually do something that
cool<00:03:13.030> but<00:03:13.900> that's<00:03:14.379> it<00:03:14.650> that's<00:03:15.189> what<00:03:15.549> the

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
cool but that's it that's what the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.179 
cool but that's it that's what the
invisible<00:03:16.750> mode<00:03:16.930> is<00:03:17.139> you<00:03:17.500> run<00:03:17.709> around<00:03:17.829> and

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:18.189 
invisible mode is you run around and
