00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.710 
of our infectious diseases I haven't got
a<00:01:54.130> resistance<00:01:54.730> to<00:01:54.850> some<00:01:55.150> of<00:01:55.270> these<00:01:55.360> new

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
a resistance to some of these new

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.980 
a resistance to some of these new
diseases<00:01:56.260> so<00:01:56.710> it's<00:01:56.950> a<00:01:57.070> very<00:01:57.370> big<00:01:57.820> worry<00:01:58.180> that's

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
diseases so it's a very big worry that's

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.380 
diseases so it's a very big worry that's
one<00:01:59.229> of<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.440> big<00:01:59.620> risks<00:01:59.800> of<00:02:00.100> tourism<00:02:00.729> while<00:02:01.330> a

portion of the money raised from gorilla

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.340 
portion of the money raised from gorilla
tourism<00:02:03.820> is<00:02:04.030> used<00:02:04.450> for<00:02:04.600> conservation

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
tourism is used for conservation

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.560 
tourism is used for conservation
some<00:02:05.830> argue<00:02:06.159> that<00:02:06.190> tourism<00:02:06.640> also<00:02:07.210> is<00:02:07.390> the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
some argue that tourism also is the

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.419 
some argue that tourism also is the
cause<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:08.109> their<00:02:08.409> destruction<00:02:08.829> if<00:02:09.399> countries

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
cause of their destruction if countries

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.849 
cause of their destruction if countries
making<00:02:10.729> so<00:02:11.030> much<00:02:11.180> money<00:02:11.450> from<00:02:11.780> allowing<00:02:12.469> six

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:12.859 
making so much money from allowing six

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:14.890 
making so much money from allowing six
people<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.430> follow<00:02:13.609> gorillas<00:02:14.150> for<00:02:14.359> example

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
people to follow gorillas for example

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.349 
people to follow gorillas for example
well<00:02:15.560> then<00:02:15.829> we<00:02:16.099> can<00:02:16.310> make<00:02:16.849> double<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.239> money

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:17.359 
well then we can make double the money

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:19.569 
well then we can make double the money
with<00:02:17.750> 12<00:02:18.049> and<00:02:18.379> then<00:02:18.560> well<00:02:18.829> we<00:02:18.980> can<00:02:19.129> make<00:02:19.340> double

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
with 12 and then well we can make double

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.940 
with 12 and then well we can make double
that<00:02:19.849> money<00:02:20.090> with<00:02:20.329> 24<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.469> number<00:02:21.859> of

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
that money with 24 and so the number of

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.190 
that money with 24 and so the number of
tourists<00:02:22.519> allowed<00:02:22.819> in<00:02:23.180> is<00:02:23.510> gradually

tourists allowed in is gradually

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.099 
tourists allowed in is gradually
increasing<00:02:24.859> and<00:02:25.250> that<00:02:25.549> is<00:02:25.879> destroying<00:02:26.780> the

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.109 
increasing and that is destroying the

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:28.780 
increasing and that is destroying the
very<00:02:27.260> creatures<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.159> you're<00:02:28.340> trying<00:02:28.609> to
