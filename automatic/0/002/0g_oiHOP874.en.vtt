 investment innovation flexibility 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.240
 constant in the structure and equity 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.019
 result in product excellence 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.800
 different odd and a call 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.109
 easy going trip 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.660
 this is the great differential of nilcatex 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.349
 customers and efficiency and 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.349
 dynamism 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.870
 has been a solid company in the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.550
 1993 amilca techtextil serves the entire 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.590
 Brazil and Mercosur 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.000
 the extensive catalog of uniforms 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:00.610
 promotional school supplies 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.860
 know a little more about the 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.650
 home of nilcatex blumenau santa catarina 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.600
 and its affiliates in large field 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.000
 southern and eastern 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.310
 paraguay and accompanies the process that 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.500
 the quality standard and the capex 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.500
 the right deal for you 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.720
 the process of coffee 15 well before 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.190
 product you see it begins the 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.380
 part development 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.900
 observing design materials 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.940
 especially its functionality and is 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:49.479
 here the magic starts with a lot of 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:52.030
 research and planning in the 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.880
 development ypiÃ³ca tex plans 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.820
 study the piece in detail to then 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.640
 be made the pilot piece 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.890
 analyzed again for 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.800
 then the customer will be presented with a 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.800
 approved part starts if your production 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.180
 here at weaving only 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.190
 the process 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.390
 our machines have regulation 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.850
 accurate lfa tests ensure 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.680
 the ideal mesh weight according to 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.980
 need the final product 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.170
 and hence the raw mesh is then revised 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.170
 prepared for processing 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.600
 in the painting area prior to the 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.720
 dyeing and if the 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.580
 development of colors and patterns 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.970
 according to each need 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.370
 with yellow samples approval 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.780
 catex goes to production and 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.910
 advanced machines 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.580
 the dyeing is done according to the profile 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.160
 of each party ends then with 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.310
 which may be tubular in the 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.010
 calanders called felpado or any other 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.020
 other depending on the use of the product by 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.380
 The pieces go back to the lab. 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.650
 for rigorous dimensional tests and says 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.650
 the leader 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.590
 the process follows here in cutting modern 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.020
 machines that use the lap system 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.150
 guarantee quality agility and precision 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.480
 millimeter in perfect performance 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:49.160
 of the raw material is the technology in 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.160
 one piece with perfect trim 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.160
 the accuracy that continues in the seam 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.470
 because here is the strong point of the pattern 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.350
 quality nilcatex hands 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:06.540
 carefully trained 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.540
 perform this very important function 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.470
 another highlight of nilcatex is the 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.540
 customization of the pieces made of 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.190
 according to the needs of each client 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:28.920
 There are several options like embroidery here 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.140
 embroiderers of 12 heads 1,200 points and 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.420
 nine colors are the most 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.790
 durability and quality that only the 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.330
 cutting-edge machinery can 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.330
 to offer 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.290
 if the customer's choice is the 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.460
 transfer customization is applied 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.460
 in these black 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.710
 but if the customer chooses to print 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.870
 nilcatex also has a sector well 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.540
 structured to meet the demand of 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.690
 Factory with extremely fast quality 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.720
 fidelity ratio to max ally also 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.880
 is done here in the former catalog of the sector of 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.620
 delete creates and produces the four 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.370
 as needed 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.920
 quality control at the nape of the neck 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.830
 part of the process but it is still 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.720
 made the final review of each piece and 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.900
 then folded individually 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.640
 packaged then checked and conditioned 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.500
 boxes to follow your trip to your 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.680
 destination anywhere in america 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.140
 Latin America, logistics and distribution are 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.000
 highlight in my land that counts 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.880
 with trucks to make a 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 there is a reliable delivery directly to the 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.000
 client 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.630
 finished the production process between 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.280
 administrative structure nilcatex no 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.860
 it would be good to have such a 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.200
 differentiated as nilcatex thein sein 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.020
 the organized administrative sector and 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.510
 efficient 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:15.090
 here the nilcatex customer receives everything 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.740
 clarification and support to ensure 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.100
 Make sure your product arrives on time 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.100
 assumed and in the most appropriate way is 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.770
 also that the other productive sectors 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:29.780
 support their skills 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:32.340
 the appreciation recognition and incentive 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.430
 search more than the standard of quality 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.620
 logistics and physical structure what makes the 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.900
 difference here are the people 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.819

 more than 30,000 pieces and has been growing 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.940
 12% now because our goal is not to 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:52.949
 is to play the role of just one more
