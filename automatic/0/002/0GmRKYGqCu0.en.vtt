00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:17.150
 It is this time but I think that there is that you have a story that will make a sticker 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.910
 I think to try to immediately make a little ne its original sticker 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.210
 A good quotient for the original sticker 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:30.259

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:25.990
 Transparent sheet to put on finished printed paper 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:30.460
 It seems that this is a so-called outside or surface 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:36.580
 In the Let's printing while editing a little image to set the paper to the printer 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:41.040
 I will try to use the web version for what I think 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.040
 First of all, I will choose the sheet. 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.200
 Then I will capture the image 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.759
 If you import the image in, then you just have to arrange it in the size you like 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:07.250
 Well, I would like to make those various sites as much as possible while rubbing like this 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.250

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:33.019

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:47.400
 The quality is a little lower than Sticker but 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.080
 I was able to make a sticker with this kind of feeling 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.220

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:57.660
 No Would not you say that anyone who wants ze was flint fire-making to fall 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:01.700
 That's all-I wonder if it was 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.700

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.700
