 part of his lion candy 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:16.590
 Here is a bit more contritis 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:21.680
 cumbersome and this is a compact and mechanism 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:27.599
 more improved here sour and here 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:32.579
 learned to sour because they are this technique 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.860
 there is the acidity of the other side 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.920
