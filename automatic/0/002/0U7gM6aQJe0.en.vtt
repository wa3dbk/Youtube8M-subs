00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
suppressor as you guys can see and this

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.110 
suppressor as you guys can see and this
is<00:00:42.660> probably<00:00:43.020> my<00:00:43.980> favorite<00:00:44.010> gun<00:00:44.789> with<00:00:44.969> that

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
is probably my favorite gun with that

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.540 
is probably my favorite gun with that
combination<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.350> put<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.680> red<00:00:47.190> dot<00:00:47.370> and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
combination if you put on red dot and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.639 
combination if you put on red dot and
suppressor<00:00:48.210> with<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.480> m4<00:00:48.899> as<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.350> guys<00:00:49.500> can

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.709 
suppressor with the m4 as you guys can
see<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.100> mean<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:50.789> pretty<00:00:50.940> much<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.210> laser<00:00:51.480> beam

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
see I mean it's pretty much a laser beam

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.389 
see I mean it's pretty much a laser beam
I<00:00:51.899> think<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.559> honestly<00:00:52.949> hits<00:00:53.160> better

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
I think that it honestly hits better

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.229 
I think that it honestly hits better
than<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.120> ACR<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.840> my<00:00:55.020> personal<00:00:55.320> opinion<00:00:56.239> but

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
than the ACR in my personal opinion but

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.939 
than the ACR in my personal opinion but
just<00:00:57.600> with<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.899> particular<00:00:58.260> combination

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
just with this particular combination

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.979 
just with this particular combination
the<00:00:59.070> ACR<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.520> still<00:00:59.879> let<00:01:00.059> me<00:01:00.120> know<00:01:00.239> basically

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
the ACR is still let me know basically

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.860 
the ACR is still let me know basically
the<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.920> best<00:01:02.399> overall<00:01:02.579> assault<00:01:03.420> rifle<00:01:03.780> in

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the the best overall assault rifle in

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.939 
the the best overall assault rifle in
the<00:01:03.899> game<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.140> guess<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.589> could<00:01:04.619> say<00:01:04.920> but

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
the game I guess you could say but

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.230 
the game I guess you could say but
definitely<00:01:05.640> with<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.939> particular

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
definitely with this particular

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.990 
definitely with this particular
combination<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.590> attachments<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.400> feel<00:01:08.970> that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
combination of attachments I feel that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.910 
combination of attachments I feel that
the<00:01:09.240> m4<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.689> probably<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.110> best<00:01:10.260> gun<00:01:10.530> for<00:01:10.770> that

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the m4 is probably the best gun for that

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.010 
the m4 is probably the best gun for that
but<00:01:11.520> um<00:01:11.670> as<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.240> see<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.780> dome
