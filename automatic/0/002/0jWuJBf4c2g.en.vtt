00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
okay guys might here one more time

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.730 
okay guys might here one more time
I<00:00:08.519> didn't<00:00:09.120> feel<00:00:09.210> like<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.480> first<00:00:10.320> comparison

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
I didn't feel like the first comparison

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.110 
I didn't feel like the first comparison
between<00:00:12.139> v.34<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.259> b38<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.040> in<00:00:14.910> one<00:00:15.089> of

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
between v.34 and b38 and in one of

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.930 
between v.34 and b38 and in one of
happens<00:00:15.750> Erna<00:00:15.929> really<00:00:16.710> did<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:16.949> such<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> small

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
happens Erna really did it such a small

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.970 
happens Erna really did it such a small
area<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.449> I've<00:00:18.539> made<00:00:18.660> two<00:00:18.900> little<00:00:19.500> bit<00:00:19.619> larger

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
area so I've made two little bit larger

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.380 
area so I've made two little bit larger
areas<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.340> can<00:00:20.400> work<00:00:20.580> on<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.210> really

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
areas I can work on and really

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.120 
areas I can work on and really
concentrate<00:00:21.660> will<00:00:22.470> flick<00:00:22.680> their<00:00:22.830> line<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
concentrate will flick their line in the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.259 
concentrate will flick their line in the
middle<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.490> could<00:00:23.670> really<00:00:23.789> get<00:00:23.910> over<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
middle so I could really get over to the

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.480 
middle so I could really get over to the
edges<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:25.099> really<00:00:26.099> really<00:00:26.250> good<00:00:26.430> to

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
edges and really really good to

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.679 
edges and really really good to
configure<00:00:26.849> some<00:00:26.970> between<00:00:27.240> these<00:00:27.359> two<00:00:27.539> because

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
configure some between these two because

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.179 
configure some between these two because
that's<00:00:27.990> probably<00:00:28.410> what<00:00:28.619> I'm<00:00:28.740> gonna<00:00:28.859> do<00:00:29.039> one

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
that's probably what I'm gonna do one

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.620 
that's probably what I'm gonna do one
less<00:00:29.310> thing<00:00:29.340> when<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.609> put<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.820> next<00:00:29.849> time<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.599> a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
less thing when I put it next time is a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.970 
less thing when I put it next time is a
two<00:00:30.840> step<00:00:31.019> pause<00:00:31.230> because<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.560> saves<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.769> lot<00:00:31.920> of

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
two step pause because it saves a lot of

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.840 
two step pause because it saves a lot of
time<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.460> get<00:00:32.669> basically<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.600> same<00:00:33.690> results

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
time you get basically the same results

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.180 
time you get basically the same results

a<00:01:29.880> black<00:01:30.060> all-purpose<00:01:30.810> microfiber<00:01:31.229> short<00:01:31.500> now

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
a black all-purpose microfiber short now

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.109 
a black all-purpose microfiber short now
I<00:01:31.829> use<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.159> but<00:01:32.520> for<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.670> second<00:01:32.939> time<00:01:33.030> it

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
I use that but for the second time it

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.490 
I use that but for the second time it
actually<00:01:33.240> didn't<00:01:33.659> use<00:01:33.689> any<00:01:34.049> isopropyl

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
actually didn't use any isopropyl

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.730 
actually didn't use any isopropyl
alcohol<00:01:35.030> because<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.180> stuff<00:01:36.470> doesn't<00:01:37.470> really

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
alcohol because the stuff doesn't really

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.670 
alcohol because the stuff doesn't really
require<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.490> um<00:01:38.850> no<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:39.960> obviously<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.530> was

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
require it um no but obviously it was

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.200 
require it um no but obviously it was
when<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.130> before<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> wax<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.880> would<00:01:42.000> use<00:01:42.119> ice

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
when I before I wax I would use ice

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.160 
when I before I wax I would use ice
probably<00:01:42.450> I'll<00:01:42.509> call<00:01:42.659> but<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:42.960> bet<00:01:43.079> this

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
probably I'll call but you can bet this

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.569 
probably I'll call but you can bet this
stuff<00:01:43.350> off<00:01:43.500> without<00:01:43.740> alcohol<00:01:44.280> which<00:01:44.549> is

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
stuff off without alcohol which is

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.609

the<00:02:01.350> exact<00:02:01.590> same<00:02:01.770> as<00:02:02.610> far<00:02:02.880> as<00:02:02.969> like<00:02:03.469> correction

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
the exact same as far as like correction

the exact same as far as like correction
finishing<00:02:05.579> wise<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:06.060> finished<00:02:06.360> better<00:02:06.479> I

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
finishing wise this finished better I

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.059 
finishing wise this finished better I
believe<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:07.950> because<00:02:08.099> or<00:02:09.030> due<00:02:09.539> to

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
believe it's because or due to

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.860 
believe it's because or due to
105<00:02:10.549> I<00:02:11.019> think<00:02:12.019> that<00:02:12.200> if<00:02:12.319> I<00:02:12.499> did<00:02:13.299> you<00:02:14.299> know<00:02:14.420> these

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
105 I think that if I did you know these

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.289 
105 I think that if I did you know these
34<00:02:15.260> finish<00:02:15.560> with<00:02:15.680> manzara<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.280> would<00:02:16.400> be<00:02:16.519> just

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
34 finish with manzara it would be just

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.229 
34 finish with manzara it would be just
as<00:02:17.480> good<00:02:17.569> as<00:02:17.810> this<00:02:18.310> if<00:02:19.310> not<00:02:19.549> better<00:02:19.790> because<00:02:20.180> I

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
as good as this if not better because I

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.399 
as good as this if not better because I
think<00:02:20.389> they're<00:02:20.629> done<00:02:20.780> finish<00:02:21.109> this<00:02:21.200> better

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
think they're done finish this better

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.369 
think they're done finish this better
than<00:02:21.530> me<00:02:21.650> 38<00:02:21.980> personally<00:02:22.310> on<00:02:22.459> my<00:02:22.790> car<00:02:22.999> anyway

than me 38 personally on my car anyway
but<00:02:24.379> as<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:25.010> two-step<00:02:25.310> polish<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:25.849> can<00:02:25.909> see<00:02:26.120> the

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
but as a two-step polish you can see the

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.300 
but as a two-step polish you can see the
difference<00:02:26.569> here<00:02:26.829> there's<00:02:27.829> still<00:02:28.159> some

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
difference here there's still some

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.020 
difference here there's still some
slight<00:02:32.920> holographic<00:02:33.920> stuff<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.639> you<00:02:34.849> can't

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
slight holographic stuff and you can't

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.459 
slight holographic stuff and you can't
even<00:02:35.150> see<00:02:35.359> this<00:02:35.510> in<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.959> work<00:02:36.109> light<00:02:36.319> you

even see this in a work light you

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:37.509 
even see this in a work light you
literally<00:02:36.829> have<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.129> hit<00:02:37.219> it<00:02:37.310> with<00:02:37.370> this

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
literally have to hit it with this

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:38.830

to this but that's the Magnum xarna well

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:23.379 
to this but that's the Magnum xarna well
you<00:03:22.340> actually<00:03:22.609> actually<00:03:22.729> looks<00:03:23.030> greener

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
you actually actually looks greener

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.399 
you actually actually looks greener
almost<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:23.930> that<00:03:23.959> maybe<00:03:24.139> the<00:03:24.349> oils<00:03:24.769> from<00:03:25.009> the

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
maybe the oils from the p38 as I didn't

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.179 
maybe the oils from the p38 as I didn't
use<00:03:29.840> I'll<00:03:30.290> call<00:03:30.470> on<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.650> side<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:30.919> second

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:31.189 
use I'll call on the side the second

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.759 
use I'll call on the side the second
time<00:03:31.419> to<00:03:32.419> aid<00:03:32.629> and<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:32.959> lubricity<00:03:33.229> so<00:03:33.590> in

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
time to aid and the lubricity so in

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.759 
time to aid and the lubricity so in
scratch<00:03:33.949> it<00:03:34.099> but<00:03:34.849> um<00:03:35.470> we're<00:03:36.470> all<00:03:36.590> very

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
scratch it but um we're all very

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.530 
scratch it but um we're all very
impressed<00:03:37.099> with<00:03:37.189> the<00:03:37.280> right<00:03:37.400> side<00:03:37.639> here<00:03:37.849> this

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
impressed with the right side here this

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.849
