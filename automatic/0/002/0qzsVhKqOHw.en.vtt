00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
hey guys miller here with another xcode

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.640 
hey guys miller here with another xcode
tutorial<00:00:11.430> this<00:00:12.180> is<00:00:12.330> an<00:00:12.450> Xcode<00:00:12.809> full<00:00:13.110> tutorial

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
tutorial this is an Xcode full tutorial

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.890 
tutorial this is an Xcode full tutorial
based<00:00:13.950> around<00:00:14.130> code<00:00:14.580> snippets<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.240> I'm<00:00:15.750> going

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
based around code snippets and I'm going

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.359 
based around code snippets and I'm going
to<00:00:15.960> go<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.110> bit<00:00:16.290> more<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.619> depth<00:00:16.830> on<00:00:16.980> coats<00:00:17.220> and

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
to go a bit more in depth on coats and

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.830 
to go a bit more in depth on coats and
if<00:00:17.430> it's<00:00:17.610> although<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:17.880> do<00:00:18.000> have<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.330> tutorial<00:00:18.630> on

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
if it's although I do have a tutorial on

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.900 
if it's although I do have a tutorial on
this<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.590> just<00:00:19.950> it's<00:00:20.189> not<00:00:20.310> very<00:00:20.430> good<00:00:20.550> because

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
this is just it's not very good because

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.880 
this is just it's not very good because
I<00:00:21.180> just<00:00:21.270> found<00:00:21.720> out<00:00:21.960> about<00:00:22.110> them<00:00:22.470> but<00:00:22.650> now<00:00:22.860> I

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
I just found out about them but now I

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.950 
I just found out about them but now I
know<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.400> bit<00:00:23.939> more<00:00:23.970> about<00:00:24.180> them<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.660> how<00:00:24.810> they

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
know a bit more about them and how they

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.680 
know a bit more about them and how they
can<00:00:25.110> be<00:00:25.350> used<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:26.460> let's<00:00:27.210> say<00:00:27.390> in<00:00:27.570> this

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690 
can be used so let's say in this

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.560 
can be used so let's say in this
tutorial<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:28.440> need<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.310> use<00:00:29.520> a<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.030> love<00:00:30.420> you

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
tutorial I need to use a you I love you

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.900 
tutorial I need to use a you I love you
so<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.590> my<00:00:31.710> view<00:00:31.740> did<00:00:32.099> load<00:00:32.129> if<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.580> just<00:00:32.699> go<00:00:32.850> to

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
so in my view did load if I just go to

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.970 
so in my view did load if I just go to
the<00:00:33.059> dot<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.390> here<00:00:33.720> and<00:00:33.900> under<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.530> green

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the dot in here and under the green

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.820 
the dot in here and under the green
brackets<00:00:35.510> bracket<00:00:36.510> things<00:00:36.720> I<00:00:36.900> want<00:00:37.170> an<00:00:37.530> alert

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
brackets bracket things I want an alert

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.740 
brackets bracket things I want an alert
to<00:00:38.040> appear<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.489> my<00:00:38.610> view<00:00:38.820> did<00:00:39.000> load<00:00:40.550> so<00:00:41.550> yep<00:00:42.540> I

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
to appear in my view did load so yep I

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.380 
to appear in my view did load so yep I
could<00:00:43.199> just<00:00:43.409> go<00:00:43.530> uialertview<00:00:44.250> blow<00:00:45.000> blow<00:00:45.360> blow

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
could just go uialertview blow blow blow

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.049 
could just go uialertview blow blow blow
start<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.710> type<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.129> all<00:00:47.190> out<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.580> that<00:00:47.820> just

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
start and type it all out and that just

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.660 
start and type it all out and that just
takes<00:00:48.150> ages<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.839> I<00:00:49.440> use<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> loop<00:00:50.070> use<00:00:50.309> quite<00:00:50.610> a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
takes ages and I use a loop use quite a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.270 
takes ages and I use a loop use quite a
lot<00:00:50.909> of<00:00:51.000> applications<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.229> i<00:00:52.260> don't<00:00:52.710> i<00:00:52.860> make<00:00:53.220> a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
lot of applications so i don't i make a

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.920 
lot of applications so i don't i make a
code<00:00:53.610> snippet<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:54.120> them<00:00:54.330> so<00:00:54.600> what<00:00:54.750> I'm<00:00:54.809> going

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
code snippet for them so what I'm going

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.420 
code snippet for them so what I'm going
to<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.110> now<00:00:55.290> is<00:00:55.500> I'm<00:00:55.620> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.830> write<00:00:56.159> out<00:00:56.190> my

is my standard love you now i just have
to<00:01:15.210> type<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.420> out<00:01:15.690> but<00:01:16.080> let's<00:01:16.260> say<00:01:16.440> i'll<00:01:16.560> make<00:01:16.710> a

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
to type it out but let's say i'll make a

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.010 
to type it out but let's say i'll make a
code<00:01:17.010> snippet<00:01:17.190> from<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.240> get<00:01:18.660> into<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
code snippet from it so to get into the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.170 
code snippet from it so to get into the
code<00:01:19.230> snippet<00:01:19.620> library<00:01:20.100> we<00:01:20.700> go<00:01:20.850> up<00:01:20.940> here<00:01:21.150> to

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
code snippet library we go up here to

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.750 
code snippet library we go up here to
where<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.540> says<00:01:21.660> view<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:22.770> click<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.160> end<00:01:23.520> one

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
where it says view we click this end one

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.660 
where it says view we click this end one
here<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.780> go<00:01:24.930> down<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.010> bottom<00:01:26.160> here<00:01:26.310> and

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
here we go down to the bottom here and

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.850 
here we go down to the bottom here and
then<00:01:27.450> we<00:01:27.630> click<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.230> one<00:01:28.530> here<00:01:28.710> with<00:01:28.830> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
then we click on this one here with the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.070 
then we click on this one here with the
brackets<00:01:29.340> now<00:01:29.940> we<00:01:30.000> get<00:01:30.450> all<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.750> apple's

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
brackets now we get all of apple's

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.220 
brackets now we get all of apple's
preset<00:01:31.980> code<00:01:32.250> snippets<00:01:32.760> that<00:01:33.000> they<00:01:33.900> give<00:01:34.080> us

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
preset code snippets that they give us

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.540 
preset code snippets that they give us
so<00:01:34.260> there's<00:01:34.500> all<00:01:34.680> sorts<00:01:34.980> of<00:01:35.040> stuff<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.370> here

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
so there's all sorts of stuff in here

we're going to keep its function because
that's<00:03:18.849> what<00:03:19.030> we<00:03:19.150> want<00:03:19.329> it<00:03:19.420> as<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:20.470> language<00:03:21.010> is

that's what we want it as a language is
obviously<00:03:21.669> objective-c<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:23.019> we're<00:03:23.139> going<00:03:23.230> to

go you can now see that we have our nice
parameters<00:05:20.840> in<00:05:20.990> here<00:05:21.200> so<00:05:22.100> you<00:05:22.490> know<00:05:22.580> you<00:05:22.670> can

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
parameters in here so you know you can

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.250 
parameters in here so you know you can
put<00:05:23.120> whatever<00:05:23.240> you<00:05:23.480> want<00:05:23.720> there<00:05:23.930> and<00:05:24.110> it<00:05:24.170> will

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
there we go there's our code with our

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.830 
there we go there's our code with our
code<00:06:04.640> snippets<00:06:05.060> and<00:06:05.180> I've<00:06:05.390> told<00:06:05.540> you<00:06:05.720> how<00:06:05.810> to

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
code snippets and I've told you how to

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.750 
code snippets and I've told you how to
put<00:06:06.020> parameters<00:06:06.260> in<00:06:06.710> there<00:06:06.890> now<00:06:07.460> there<00:06:07.669> are

put parameters in there now there are

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.159 
put parameters in there now there are
obviously<00:06:08.030> other<00:06:08.150> couple<00:06:08.630> stuff<00:06:08.780> you<00:06:08.900> can<00:06:09.050> do

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
obviously other couple stuff you can do

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.570 
obviously other couple stuff you can do
with<00:06:09.200> these<00:06:09.410> depending<00:06:09.950> on<00:06:10.070> the<00:06:10.190> method<00:06:10.490> you

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
with these depending on the method you

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.720 
with these depending on the method you
do<00:06:10.790> so<00:06:11.300> like<00:06:11.450> my<00:06:11.960> MF<00:06:12.440> male<00:06:12.680> 1<00:06:13.010> if<00:06:13.220> we<00:06:13.400> click<00:06:13.520> on

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
do so like my MF male 1 if we click on

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.180 
do so like my MF male 1 if we click on
that<00:06:13.910> we<00:06:14.720> can<00:06:14.960> if<00:06:15.110> we<00:06:15.140> click<00:06:15.440> Edit<00:06:15.770> see<00:06:16.010> that

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
that we can if we click Edit see that

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.950 
that we can if we click Edit see that
it's<00:06:16.370> called<00:06:16.669> a<00:06:16.790> class<00:06:17.030> implementation

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
it's called a class implementation

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.159 
it's called a class implementation
because<00:06:18.140> it's<00:06:18.470> got<00:06:18.800> an<00:06:19.580> IB<00:06:20.210> action<00:06:20.630> in<00:06:20.750> it<00:06:20.900> and

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:21.169 
because it's got an IB action in it and

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.200 
because it's got an IB action in it and
all<00:06:21.740> sorts<00:06:22.010> of<00:06:22.070> an<00:06:22.220> avoidant<00:06:22.790> it<00:06:22.880> like<00:06:23.030> that

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
all sorts of an avoidant it like that

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.030 
all sorts of an avoidant it like that
whereas<00:06:23.750> if<00:06:23.870> we<00:06:23.900> go<00:06:24.020> back<00:06:24.169> to<00:06:24.230> our<00:06:24.410> alert<00:06:24.740> here

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.040 
whereas if we go back to our alert here

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.810 
whereas if we go back to our alert here
it's<00:06:25.669> called<00:06:26.060> a<00:06:26.210> function<00:06:26.630> or<00:06:26.720> a<00:06:26.780> method

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
it's called a function or a method

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.150 
it's called a function or a method
because<00:06:28.820> you<00:06:29.240> know<00:06:29.360> it's<00:06:29.540> it's<00:06:29.840> not<00:06:30.290> got<00:06:30.620> IV

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 
because you know it's it's not got IV

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.760 
because you know it's it's not got IV
action<00:06:31.460> in<00:06:31.580> it<00:06:31.669> or<00:06:31.760> avoid<00:06:32.030> so<00:06:33.020> I<00:06:33.050> hope<00:06:33.560> that

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
action in it or avoid so I hope that

action in it or avoid so I hope that
helps<00:06:33.830> you<00:06:35.140> know<00:06:36.140> I<00:06:36.169> hope<00:06:36.410> that<00:06:36.530> showed<00:06:36.770> you

how you can use Costa bits to their
