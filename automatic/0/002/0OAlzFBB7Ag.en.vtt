00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
chords inside of that scale so we're

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.230 
chords inside of that scale so we're
going<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.229> start<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.860> C<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.580> we're<00:01:06.030> going<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.620 

there's<00:01:12.800> that<00:01:13.130> leading<00:01:13.490> tone<00:01:16.300> then<00:01:17.300> I'm<00:01:17.420> going

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
there's that leading tone then I'm going

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.790 
there's that leading tone then I'm going

to end up on the fifth of a seven into

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.740 
to end up on the fifth of a seven into
the<00:01:21.890> root<00:01:22.160> of<00:01:22.370> G<00:01:22.550> harmonic<00:01:22.790> minor<00:01:23.240> then<00:01:23.570> it's

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
the root of G harmonic minor then it's

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.090 
the root of G harmonic minor then it's
going<00:01:23.930> to<00:01:23.990> shift<00:01:24.050> a<00:01:24.530> little<00:01:24.620> bit<00:01:24.770> we're<00:01:24.980> going

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
going to shift a little bit we're going

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.810 
going to shift a little bit we're going
to<00:01:25.160> actually<00:01:25.430> go<00:01:25.760> to<00:01:26.650> e<00:01:27.650> natural<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.550> come<00:01:28.700> up

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
to actually go to e natural and come up

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.400 
to actually go to e natural and come up
chromatically<00:01:30.430> into<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.550> third<00:01:31.880> of<00:01:32.120> D<00:01:32.810> seven

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
chromatically into the third of D seven

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.750 
through the harmonic minor scale now
instead<00:01:57.260> of<00:01:57.320> going<00:01:57.500> to<00:01:57.620> the<00:01:57.800> flat<00:01:58.160> six<00:01:58.520> we're

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
instead of going to the flat six we're
