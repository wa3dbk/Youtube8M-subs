00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
3-nil so again let's have a little bit

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.830 
3-nil so again let's have a little bit
of<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.040> same<00:01:20.420> we're<00:01:21.420> trying<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.689> stay

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
of the same we're trying to stay

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.899 
of the same we're trying to stay

Newcastle<00:01:24.750> fans<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.200> think<00:01:25.229> probably<00:01:25.590> had<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
Newcastle fans I think probably had a

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.200 
Newcastle fans I think probably had a
bit<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.100> frustrating<00:01:26.520> time<00:01:26.850> over<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
bit of a frustrating time over the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.609 
bit of a frustrating time over the
summer<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.540> terms<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.080> signings<00:01:28.560> that

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
summer in terms of the signings that

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.319 
summer in terms of the signings that
were<00:01:29.130> made<00:01:29.280> or<00:01:29.430> weren't<00:01:29.640> made<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.000> course

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
were made or weren't made of course

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.640 
were made or weren't made of course
they've<00:01:30.479> got<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.689> new<00:01:30.750> sort<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.049> axis<00:01:31.439> with

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
they've got this new sort of axis with

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.690 
they've got this new sort of axis with
Joe<00:01:31.799> Kinnear

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
Joe Kinnear

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.670 
Joe Kinnear
working<00:01:33.180> with<00:01:33.270> Alan<00:01:33.479> Pardew<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.350> front

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
working with Alan Pardew on that front

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.530 
working with Alan Pardew on that front
but<00:01:35.280> at<00:01:35.430> least<00:01:35.579> they<00:01:35.790> do<00:01:35.850> have<00:01:36.119> loïc<00:01:36.390> rémy

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
but at least they do have loïc rémy

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.780 
but at least they do have loïc rémy
there<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.170> he<00:01:37.290> has<00:01:37.470> been<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.920> good<00:01:38.220> form<00:01:38.490> this

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
there and he has been in good form this

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.340 
there and he has been in good form this
season<00:01:39.150> yeah<00:01:39.390> well<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.689> was<00:01:39.780> more<00:01:39.930> off<00:01:40.110> field

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
season yeah well it was more off field

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.840 
season yeah well it was more off field
wasn't<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.799> but<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.979> think<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.280> know<00:01:41.400> they've

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
wasn't it but I think you know they've

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.370 
wasn't it but I think you know they've
they've<00:01:42.390> proved<00:01:42.659> everybody<00:01:42.869> wrong<00:01:43.020> they've

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
they've proved everybody wrong they've

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.749 
they've proved everybody wrong they've
got<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.649> points<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.159> board<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.430> season

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
got the points on the board this season

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.100 
got the points on the board this season
Alan<00:01:44.939> Pardew<00:01:45.149> seems<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.630> be<00:01:45.720> getting<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.960> best

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
Alan Pardew seems to be getting the best

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.660 
Alan Pardew seems to be getting the best
out<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.350> these<00:01:46.439> players<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:47.189> gonna<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.490> so

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
out of these players it's gonna be so

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.460 
out of these players it's gonna be so
important<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.479> many<00:01:48.600> areas<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> field

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
important to so many areas of the field

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.319 
important to so many areas of the field
at<00:01:49.649> Newcastle<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.280> be<00:01:50.369> stronger<00:01:50.790> it's<00:01:51.270> a

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
at Newcastle can be stronger it's a

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.330 
at Newcastle can be stronger it's a
so-called<00:01:51.540> breaking<00:01:52.409> into<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> areas<00:01:53.159> well

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
so-called breaking into the areas well

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.520 
so-called breaking into the areas well
they<00:01:53.460> do<00:01:53.610> get<00:01:53.820> plays<00:01:54.119> into<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> area<00:01:54.869> Gouffran

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
they do get plays into the area Gouffran

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.170 
they do get plays into the area Gouffran
breaking<00:01:55.979> down<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.280> right<00:01:56.490> hand<00:01:56.700> side<00:01:57.000> as

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
breaking down that right hand side as

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.389 
breaking down that right hand side as
well<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.570> we<00:01:57.810> just<00:01:58.020> touched<00:01:58.229> some<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.920> Remy<00:01:59.159> I

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
well and we just touched some on Remy I

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.469 
well and we just touched some on Remy I
actually<00:01:59.759> thought<00:02:00.030> he<00:02:00.090> would<00:02:00.299> have<00:02:00.390> been

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
actually thought he would have been

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.480 
actually thought he would have been
playing<00:02:00.719> up<00:02:00.899> front<00:02:01.140> but<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.469> know<00:02:01.560> we<00:02:01.710> found

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
playing up front but you know we found

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.280 
playing up front but you know we found
this<00:02:02.670> formula<00:02:03.119> last<00:02:03.329> week<00:02:03.509> with<00:02:03.689> Ben<00:02:03.869> Arfa<00:02:04.049> up

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
this formula last week with Ben Arfa up

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.749 
this formula last week with Ben Arfa up
front<00:02:04.530> because<00:02:04.829> we<00:02:04.950> all<00:02:05.100> know<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.430> Ben<00:02:05.579> Arfa

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
front because we all know that Ben Arfa

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.819 
front because we all know that Ben Arfa
isn't<00:02:06.570> going<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.750> track<00:02:06.960> back<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.649> maybe

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
isn't going to track back so maybe

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.440 
isn't going to track back so maybe
that's<00:02:08.069> working<00:02:08.489> in<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> favour<00:02:08.910> as<00:02:09.119> well<00:02:09.300> and

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
that's working in the favour as well and

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.300 
that's working in the favour as well and
then<00:02:09.539> very<00:02:09.720> hard<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.050> break<00:02:10.229> down<00:02:10.470> now<00:02:10.709> Steve

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
then very hard to break down now Steve

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.920 
then very hard to break down now Steve
and<00:02:11.340> Sayla<00:02:11.760> coming<00:02:12.030> back<00:02:12.150> into<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.510> side<00:02:12.720> is

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
and Sayla coming back into the side is

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.869 
and Sayla coming back into the side is
well<00:02:13.019> alongside<00:02:13.290> Williamson<00:02:14.159> yeah<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.579> little

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
it's how Sunderland can break them down

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.089 
it's how Sunderland can break them down
well<00:02:21.569> yeah<00:02:21.719> and<00:02:22.109> on<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.469> point

give that andra percent sure that little
bit<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.560> passion<00:03:25.739> and<00:03:26.099> I<00:03:26.159> think<00:03:26.370> if<00:03:26.489> whoever

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
bit of passion and I think if whoever

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.339
