00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.110
 hello everyone in that reason welcome 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.359
 to the channel and welcome to a new video 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.000
 in this case in a new episode of top 

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:20.010
 5 video games this time 25 worst 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.320
 video games a lot of people have allowed me 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.850
 this top and you have recommended me even 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.340
 some video games like for example 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.080
 ltda tar and in this case I'm going to focus 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.270
 in games a little more current and 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.039
 personally 5 that I have tried of 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.589
 first hand that I have been able to enjoy 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:36.449
 in quotation marks me and in this case someone 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:37.769
 as its not my opinion you already know that 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.390
 it always stayed the same as you 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.129
 you can put your top five worse 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.929
 videogames in the description and it will be so 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.550
 right like mine so without more 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.370
 procrastination let's analyze these 5 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.539
 gems of videogame arts for 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.729
 start in fifth position we 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.409
 we found with star wars kinect that of 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:54.329
 start when someone can say 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.219
 well you're going to play a video game 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.249
 star wars with kinect you think of 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.350
 lightsabers in pod races something 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:03.450
 super entertaining and really when you 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.700
 you find 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.950
 you do not know what to do or personally I do not 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.230
 I knew what to do to dance 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.780
 sell throw dancing duels against luke 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.520
 skywalker and the emperor certainly not 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.010
 is what I expected as a fan or 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.330
 follower of star wars and in order to weigh 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.090
 that the quality of the game is not 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.550
 neither horrible is it written yet that put 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.770
 in the place stars of that saga 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.660
 size put them to dance personally 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.310
 if I fall a myth but good what there is 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.260
 in my opinion it deserves a fifth 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.850
 star wars kinect position in the fourth 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.400
 position in this case would place the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.080
 video game harry potter and the relics 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.880
 of death 'both the first part 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.590
 like the second one mainly because to 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.970
 Although they are two different sets 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.210
 as well and the two different movies 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.369
 is practically the same title is not 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.410
 have bothered neither to change graphics nor 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.940
 in changing gameplay because the 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.290
 argument is different that is that if not 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.450
 I would swear I was playing at the same 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.920
 game anyway so there is a 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.810
 bunch of bugs an infinity of 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.130
 problems with the game that are playing 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.720
 that suddenly a mission you can not 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.790
 complete it because miss hermione 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.170
 He has decided to stop and look at a 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.010
 door without knowing what to do instead of 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.290
 open it 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.420
 is what is a video game in another can 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.250
 have a great time is really a shooter 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.870
 It's not so much time advancing calaverita 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.060
 spells and already ran out of 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.410
 puzzles hardly there was a little bit the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.780
 fun of the first titles of 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.640
 this saga and good if you are interested as 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.500
 I say is a magician shooter then there 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.330
 is harry potter and the relics of the 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.310
 death in the third position would place 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.310
 god but there could be a video game 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.770
 that after more than 15 years of waiting 15 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.390
 years waiting for a sequel to a 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.850
 of the best videogame sagas that 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.340
 existed formerly we find ourselves with 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.230
 this mediocrity for not saying anything else 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.940
 of videogame something that really does not 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.130
 was at the height that was supposed to 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.050
 after so many years of development 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.510
 and so much money invested in this title 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.400
 was going to revolutionize or at least it was what 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.210
 it was expected and not much less 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.820
 we found some graphics 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.130
 deficient with a gameplay in order 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.750
 painful and that basically seemed like it's 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.610
 a title from a previous generation of 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.220
 consoles than from the current one of any 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.320
 way if they have not personally escalated 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.000
 for me more positions instead of being 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.830
 in the second bullet that opposition is in 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.819
 the third only because of the bad 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.739
 What is it 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.530
 absolutely horrible that are your 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.719
 arguments and their lines is that you laugh 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.760
 then you really have a good time 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:19.590
 bad but you have a great time with the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.599
 Finally, I 'm not going to a third videogame 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.129
 position for never in forever in the 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.409
 second position we find ourselves with a 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.030
 man versus wild multiple than with said 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.549
 name may not sound much but if 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.469
 diego the last survivor maybe the 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.510
 things start to change even though 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:35.939
 the series finally has a certain quality 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.889
 has a huge amount of followers 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:39.599
 it really is pretty good 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.549
 the video game certainly does not 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.349
 justice to our friend feli louis what 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.359
 you see on the screen is simply all the 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.829
 action that you are going to find you are giving 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.359
 around the world for different 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.590
 scenarios and from time to time you 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.389
 you find animals that you have to 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.120
 face them through quick time 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:56.340
 events and that 's it, that's all you do not have 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.260
 nothing more to do than defeat those quick 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.180
 time events and turning until 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.969
 you find the output of each map not 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.099
 has no complication whatsoever 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.930
 that can be the most entertaining and as 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.579
 you see the animations the graphics seem 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.099
 a video game five years ago 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.030
 practically did not play nor is it something 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.650
 to do 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.109
 and left to play and scream to put aside 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.700
 the graphics is efficient and good at 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.650
 Although you are followers of the 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.669
 of course we have to recognize 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.620
 that there are video games that is better not 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.940
 create then for me in a second 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.440
 position if still the last 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.180
 survivor or also known as 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.650
 to see if Uruguay and in a 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.360
 deserved first position we 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.040
 we find a title that in many 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.480
 you have always recommended me 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.419
 we talked about the subject of all five 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.650
 worst video games in this case always 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.020
 said name of any of you 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.210
 he named them and treated them like no more 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.919
 nor less than brink a title that of 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.660
 start are given the idea very well all 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.910
 we had a lot of hope personally 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.150
 when good fish exit trailers 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.250
 good geographical do what past 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.960
 amazing all mix the parkour with 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.390
 a multiplayer shooter is that it was 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.850
 incredible left very well and when 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.710
 went on sale nothing was what it seemed 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.440
 said implementation of parkour was 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.620
 made with pincers as I did 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.630
 Fateful lives many very many 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.389
 you fell sometimes when jumping a 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.220
 railing and you ended up committing suicide 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:15.060
 inexplicably inexplicably because 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.760
 sorry but 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.040
 it happened that not only is it going to go 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.720
 as a shooter it was really bad 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.690
 multiplayer gave a lot of problems 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.419
 of connection in addition to constant drops 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.490
 the incredible only the servers 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.440
 they dedicated in the US are the only ones 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.810
 They are worth the rest it was horrible 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.970
 I play everything and I did not write a 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.889
 campaign without the single player player 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.010
 worth practically worth 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:42.480
 non-existent then on my part in addition 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.130
 of a lot of technical issues 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.320
 graphics and in terms of gameplay 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.020
 terrible I think that bring deserves the 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.580
 first position and finally I do not know about you 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.380
 that I will think but for me at least 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.060
 been one of the worst video games that 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.979
 has come to try and finally until 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.840
 is all five worst video games like 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:00.030
 say is a collection of 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.410
 current video games in quotes and from 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.120
 those that I have been able to try to cool 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.700
 people that's why I mention it if I do not 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.650
 I would comment and what worse have appeared 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.330
 that I really liked the least 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.479
 I say leave me any kind of 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.060
 suggestion about the other types of tops 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:16.229
 about what would be your two worst 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.740
 video games I would love to know it engine 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:23.210
 and nothing for me to be happy 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.210
