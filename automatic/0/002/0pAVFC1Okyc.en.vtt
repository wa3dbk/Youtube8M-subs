they worked and everything I thought was

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.440 
they worked and everything I thought was
amazing<00:00:37.590> they<00:00:37.950> never<00:00:38.100> really<00:00:38.489> could<00:00:38.700> do<00:00:39.239> too

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
amazing they never really could do too

amazing they never really could do too
great<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.710> idea<00:00:41.010> was<00:00:41.070> good<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.550> liked<00:00:41.820> how

they<00:00:42.090> were<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.629> with<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.469> diamond<00:00:43.920> core<00:00:44.129> of

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.319 
they were so with this diamond core of
quang<00:00:44.370> Camaro<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.820> think<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.120> gonna<00:00:45.210> be

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
quang Camaro I think it's gonna be

quang Camaro I think it's gonna be
pretty<00:00:45.420> good<00:00:45.690> i'm<00:00:46.170> gonna<00:00:46.320> assume<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.559> like

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739

the whole theme there and I can we see

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.850 
the whole theme there and I can we see
what<00:03:07.450> this<00:03:07.570> is<00:03:07.720> gonna<00:03:07.810> do<00:03:08.020> as<00:03:08.140> well<00:03:08.380> I<00:03:08.590> see

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
what this is gonna do as well I see

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.640 
what this is gonna do as well I see
flames<00:03:09.130> were<00:03:09.370> pretty<00:03:09.610> fun<00:03:09.820> to<00:03:10.000> use<00:03:10.270> so<00:03:11.020> I'm<00:03:11.320> I

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
flames were pretty fun to use so I'm I

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.770 
flames were pretty fun to use so I'm I
hope<00:03:12.400> it<00:03:12.520> will<00:03:12.550> be<00:03:12.700> useful<00:03:13.000> i<00:03:13.420> really<00:03:13.630> have<00:03:13.750> a

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
hope it will be useful i really have a

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.080 
hope it will be useful i really have a
guess<00:03:13.990> on<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.200> effect<00:03:14.530> or<00:03:14.680> anything<00:03:15.040> I<00:03:15.250> guess

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
guess on the effect or anything I guess

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.180 
guess on the effect or anything I guess
I'll<00:03:16.209> just<00:03:16.240> maybe<00:03:16.900> be<00:03:17.080> easy<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.500> bring<00:03:17.709> out<00:03:17.860> and

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
I'll just maybe be easy to bring out and

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.190 
I'll just maybe be easy to bring out and
go<00:03:18.640> for<00:03:18.820> your<00:03:18.910> rank<00:03:19.090> 6<00:03:19.360> monsters<00:03:19.570> or<00:03:19.900> something

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
go for your rank 6 monsters or something

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.580 
go for your rank 6 monsters or something
is<00:03:20.320> what<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.650> guess<00:03:20.890> will<00:03:21.010> be<00:03:21.070> my<00:03:21.220> best<00:03:21.459> guess

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
is what I guess will be my best guess

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.830 
is what I guess will be my best guess
after<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.680> way<00:03:23.830> a<00:03:23.860> mecha<00:03:24.100> phantom<00:03:24.250> beast

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
after that way a mecha phantom beast

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.840 
after that way a mecha phantom beast
olean<00:03:25.840> had<00:03:26.410> this<00:03:26.920> one<00:03:27.130> I'm<00:03:27.280> gonna<00:03:27.400> assume<00:03:27.670> as<00:03:27.820> a

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
olean had this one I'm gonna assume as a

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.790 
olean had this one I'm gonna assume as a
Tuner<00:03:28.180> monster<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.780> no<00:03:29.110> confirmation<00:03:29.709> on

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
Tuner monster and no confirmation on

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.740 
Tuner monster and no confirmation on
that<00:03:29.860> but<00:03:30.370> I'm<00:03:30.580> just<00:03:30.820> gonna<00:03:30.910> guess<00:03:31.209> that<00:03:31.239> it's

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
that but I'm just gonna guess that it's

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.390 
that but I'm just gonna guess that it's
a<00:03:31.989> smaller<00:03:32.260> looking<00:03:32.590> monsters<00:03:33.010> like<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.160> little

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
a smaller looking monsters like a little

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.270 
a smaller looking monsters like a little
sad<00:03:33.550> light<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.019> he<00:03:35.019> is<00:03:35.290> level<00:03:36.010> 2<00:03:36.160> or<00:03:36.400> yeah<00:03:37.330> so<00:03:37.750> I

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
sad light and he is level 2 or yeah so I

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.110 
sad light and he is level 2 or yeah so I
feel<00:03:39.280> like<00:03:39.370> that's<00:03:39.489> gonna<00:03:39.640> be<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:39.850> tuner

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
feel like that's gonna be a tuner

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.150 
feel like that's gonna be a tuner
monster<00:03:40.540> i<00:03:40.720> don't<00:03:41.019> know<00:03:41.080> why<00:03:41.260> wait<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:41.920> see

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
monster i don't know why wait and see

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.350 
monster i don't know why wait and see
but<00:03:42.310> that's<00:03:42.400> gonna<00:03:42.580> be<00:03:42.670> my<00:03:42.820> guess<00:03:43.060> it<00:03:43.209> can<00:03:43.299> be

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
but that's gonna be my guess it can be

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.789 
but that's gonna be my guess it can be
something<00:03:43.570> that<00:03:43.720> will<00:03:43.900> help<00:03:44.019> go<00:03:44.290> with<00:03:44.440> more

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
something that will help go with more

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.560 
something that will help go with more
syncros<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.340> really<00:03:45.970> have<00:03:46.150> another<00:03:46.360> mecha

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
syncros and really have another mecha

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.690 
syncros and really have another mecha
phantom<00:03:46.750> beast<00:03:46.959> doesn't<00:03:47.650> surprise<00:03:48.220> me<00:03:48.250> I'm

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700

down i'll try to try to go for some kind
of<00:04:16.750> good<00:04:16.870> guess<00:04:17.109> for<00:04:17.290> scraps<00:04:17.560> scraps<00:04:18.340> another

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
of good guess for scraps scraps another

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.490 
of good guess for scraps scraps another
art<00:04:18.820> type<00:04:19.000> though<00:04:19.120> that's<00:04:19.330> pretty<00:04:19.600> good<00:04:19.870> you

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
art type though that's pretty good you

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.830 
art type though that's pretty good you
know<00:04:20.650> but<00:04:21.039> it's<00:04:21.340> just<00:04:21.609> missing<00:04:22.180> few<00:04:22.419> cards<00:04:22.660> to

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
know but it's just missing few cards to

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.510 
know but it's just missing few cards to
it's<00:04:22.990> not<00:04:23.110> one<00:04:23.289> you're<00:04:23.440> gonna<00:04:23.530> probably<00:04:24.220> see

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
it's not one you're gonna probably see

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.070 
it's not one you're gonna probably see
top<00:04:24.789> anything<00:04:25.300> maybe

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
top anything maybe

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.529 
top anything maybe
that<00:04:26.229> may<00:04:26.349> be<00:04:26.379> different<00:04:26.800> but<00:04:27.610> it's<00:04:28.330> an<00:04:28.419> art

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
that may be different but it's an art

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.119 
that may be different but it's an art
type<00:04:28.659> that<00:04:28.840> at<00:04:29.020> least<00:04:29.199> for<00:04:29.409> fun<00:04:29.590> will<00:04:29.800> hold<00:04:29.949> its

00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:30.129 
type that at least for fun will hold its

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:32.550 
type that at least for fun will hold its
own<00:04:30.220> i<00:04:30.280> do<00:04:30.520> really<00:04:30.699> well<00:04:30.909> so<00:04:31.539> I<00:04:32.020> can't<00:04:32.409> wait<00:04:32.500> to
