happening all day otherwise they'd

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.170 
happening all day otherwise they'd
behave<00:00:46.070> yeah<00:00:47.070> i<00:00:47.100> think<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.489> basically<00:00:47.850> she

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
behave yeah i think that basically she

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.880 
behave yeah i think that basically she
has<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> go<00:00:48.660> at<00:00:48.780> him<00:00:48.809> but<00:00:49.379> things<00:00:49.590> don't<00:00:49.739> really

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
has a go at him but things don't really

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.229 
has a go at him but things don't really
bother<00:00:50.129> him<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.520> much<00:00:50.670> man<00:00:50.940> that

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
bother him that much man that

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.880 
bother him that much man that
exacerbates<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.020> situation<00:00:52.050> because<00:00:52.739> she

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
exacerbates the situation because she

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.250 
exacerbates the situation because she
she<00:00:53.309> wants<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.699> reaction<00:00:53.850> okay<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.899> now<00:00:55.079> this

trying to influence someone you want to
understand<00:01:55.740> what<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.490> their<00:01:56.640> mind<00:01:56.909> what

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
understand what is on their mind what

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.030 
understand what is on their mind what
they<00:01:57.240> think<00:01:57.479> about<00:01:57.570> something<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.680> jess

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
they think about something so jess

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.950 
they think about something so jess
asking<00:01:59.490> lots<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.729> open-ended<00:02:00.329> questions

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
asking lots of open-ended questions

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.899 
asking lots of open-ended questions
encouraging<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.770> other<00:02:01.799> person<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.280> talk<00:02:02.549> she

was<00:02:03.030> pumping<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.540> for<00:02:03.689> info<00:02:03.810> right<00:02:04.110> yeah<00:02:04.409> but

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
was pumping in for info right yeah but

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.289 
was pumping in for info right yeah but
in<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.040> very<00:02:05.070> polite<00:02:05.399> way<00:02:05.759> whereas<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.270> think

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
in a very polite way whereas I think

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.559 
in a very polite way whereas I think
Martin<00:02:06.840> your<00:02:07.110> approach<00:02:07.590> was<00:02:08.209> perhaps<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.420> few

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
Martin your approach was perhaps a few

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.880 
Martin your approach was perhaps a few
more<00:02:09.750> questions<00:02:09.869> would<00:02:10.319> have<00:02:10.410> been<00:02:10.530> helping

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
more questions would have been helping

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.990 
more questions would have been helping
pumping<00:02:11.580> less<00:02:11.760> just<00:02:11.940> three<00:02:12.209> pumps<00:02:12.569> for<00:02:12.780> you

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
pumping less just three pumps for you

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
pumping less just three pumps for you
exactly<00:02:15.000> essentially<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.290> member<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.810> then

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
exactly essentially is a member and then

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.080 
exactly essentially is a member and then
Jeremy<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:20.130> go<00:02:20.280> in<00:02:20.430> there<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.820> basically

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
Jeremy to go in there and basically

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.940

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
whatever you do I think it's rubbish

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.110 
whatever you do I think it's rubbish
perhaps<00:02:25.980> not<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.340> brightest<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.820> thing<00:02:26.970> I've

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
perhaps not the brightest of thing I've

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.390 
perhaps not the brightest of thing I've
it<00:02:27.330> wasn't<00:02:27.660> very<00:02:27.720> good<00:02:27.840> start<00:02:28.230> was<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.100> now

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
it wasn't very good start was it and now

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.580 
it wasn't very good start was it and now
Rob<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.880> Emma<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.630> Martin<00:02:31.020> they<00:02:31.440> actually

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590

yeah<00:02:32.070> they<00:02:32.310> went<00:02:32.490> this<00:02:32.610> week<00:02:32.850> what<00:02:33.300> was<00:02:33.420> their

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
yeah they went this week what was their

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.450 
yeah they went this week what was their
fundamental<00:02:34.050> weakness<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.590> think<00:02:35.310> well

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
fundamental weakness I think well

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.550 
fundamental weakness I think well
there's<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.700> concept<00:02:36.090> we<00:02:36.930> talk<00:02:37.110> about<00:02:37.230> called

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
there's a concept we talk about called

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.010 
there's a concept we talk about called
emotional<00:02:37.920> labor<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:39.210> idea<00:02:39.570> being<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.900> if

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020
