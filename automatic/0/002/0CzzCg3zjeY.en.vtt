00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
you guys are gonna ask me is how much

you guys are gonna ask me is how much
difference<00:02:33.090> does<00:02:33.239> that<00:02:33.270> make<00:02:33.390> as<00:02:33.780> far<00:02:33.959> as

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
difference does that make as far as

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.720
