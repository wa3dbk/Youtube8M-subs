00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
think made by nerve not by me of course

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.740 
think made by nerve not by me of course
I<00:00:51.570> can't<00:00:51.809> make<00:00:51.960> something<00:00:52.230> that's<00:00:52.530> good

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
I can't make something that's good

I can't make something that's good
alright<00:00:54.750> also<00:00:56.870> basically<00:00:59.600> it's<00:01:00.600> not<00:01:00.809> very

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
alright also basically it's not very

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.170 
alright also basically it's not very
that<00:01:01.230> hard<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.620> configure<00:01:02.129> or<00:01:02.579> how<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.850> build

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
that hard to configure or how to build

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.880 
that hard to configure or how to build
it<00:01:04.129> instructions<00:01:05.129> are<00:01:05.430> very<00:01:05.460> easy<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:06.119> follow

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
it instructions are very easy to follow

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.679 
it instructions are very easy to follow
which<00:01:07.890> what<00:01:08.549> would<00:01:08.729> what<00:01:09.180> was<00:01:09.330> very

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
which what would what was very

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.179 
which what would what was very
interesting<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.200> me<00:01:10.320> before<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.770> put<00:01:11.010> this

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
interesting to me before I put this

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.130 
interesting to me before I put this
thing<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.610> which<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.060> very<00:01:12.450> hard<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.750> take<00:01:12.930> off

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.730 
thing on which is very hard to take off
or<00:01:13.470> better<00:01:13.799> yet<00:01:13.920> impossible<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.850> take<00:01:15.060> off<00:01:15.740> it

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
or better yet impossible to take off it

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
that's also very interesting better than

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.929 
that's also very interesting better than
the<00:01:38.220> lungs<00:01:38.700> lungs<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:40.110> lungs<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.920> get<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> long

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
shot this gun would will be even better

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.399 
shot this gun would will be even better
than<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.509> pistol<00:01:49.439> would<00:01:49.680> still<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:52.110> make<00:01:52.259> it

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
than the pistol would still to make it

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.490 
than the pistol would still to make it
to<00:01:52.860> make<00:01:52.979> things<00:01:53.369> better<00:01:53.579> for<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.880> long<00:01:54.060> strike

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500

to make things better for a long strike
this<00:01:55.500> thing<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.219> looks<00:01:56.729> like<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.719> end<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:58.290> a

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
this thing it looks like the end of a

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.389 
this thing it looks like the end of a
sniper<00:01:58.740> rifle

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
sniper rifle

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.880 
sniper rifle
we've<00:02:00.030> probably<00:02:00.270> seen<00:02:00.600> like<00:02:00.960> called<00:02:01.290> duty<00:02:01.860> ER

we've probably seen like called duty ER

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.709 
we've probably seen like called duty ER
or<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.610> modern<00:02:03.540> warfare<00:02:03.750> or<00:02:04.259> whatever<00:02:05.630> it's<00:02:06.630> a

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
or a modern warfare or whatever it's a

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.859 
or a modern warfare or whatever it's a
very<00:02:07.110> interesting<00:02:07.560> gun<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.520> really<00:02:09.270> really

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
very interesting gun and I really really

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.820 
very interesting gun and I really really
like<00:02:10.050> it's<00:02:10.920> pretty<00:02:11.129> interesting

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.650

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
well it's this this thing here I think

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.000 
well it's this this thing here I think
it's<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.990> scope<00:02:21.630> it's<00:02:22.630> pretty<00:02:23.230> simple<00:02:23.560> really

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
it's the scope it's pretty simple really

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.550 
it's the scope it's pretty simple really
they're<00:02:24.940> like<00:02:25.090> different<00:02:25.750> they're<00:02:26.350> like

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
they're like different they're like

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.890 
they're like different they're like

you got this basically you're trying to
aim<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:38.709> then<00:02:39.100> there's<00:02:39.600> this<00:02:42.390> basically<00:02:43.390> the

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
aim and then there's this basically the

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.630 
aim and then there's this basically the
same<00:02:43.870> thing<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.380> thought<00:02:45.310> that<00:02:45.490> was<00:02:45.580> very

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
same thing I thought that was very

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.850 
same thing I thought that was very
interesting<00:02:46.050> it's<00:02:47.050> probably<00:02:47.350> not<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.500> part<00:02:47.800> of

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
interesting it's probably not a part of

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.360 
interesting it's probably not a part of
it<00:02:47.980> but<00:02:48.209> but<00:02:49.209> it's<00:02:49.360> just<00:02:49.570> very<00:02:49.690> interesting

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
it but but it's just very interesting

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.610 
it but but it's just very interesting
now<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.670> just<00:02:52.420> think<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:52.959> hold<00:02:53.110> three<00:02:53.320> clips
