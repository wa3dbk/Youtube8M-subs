but that's about all at the tablets
going<00:02:42.739> for<00:02:42.980> maybe<00:02:43.489> if<00:02:43.730> Samsung<00:02:44.209> had<00:02:44.390> opted<00:02:44.750> to

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
going for maybe if Samsung had opted to

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.449 
going for maybe if Samsung had opted to
include<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.350> s-pen<00:02:45.799> we<00:02:45.980> would<00:02:46.160> have<00:02:46.280> thought

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
include the s-pen we would have thought

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.340 
include the s-pen we would have thought
that<00:02:46.579> the<00:02:46.670> tablet<00:02:47.060> offered<00:02:47.420> more<00:02:47.660> but<00:02:48.170> they

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
that the tablet offered more but they

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.470 
that the tablet offered more but they
did<00:02:48.560> not<00:02:48.769> as<00:02:49.070> a<00:02:49.549> right<00:02:49.820> now<00:02:49.940> there<00:02:50.209> is<00:02:50.299> nothing

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
did not as a right now there is nothing

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.390 
did not as a right now there is nothing
that<00:02:50.660> really<00:02:51.079> separates<00:02:51.650> this<00:02:51.860> tablet<00:02:52.220> from

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
that really separates this tablet from

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.920 
that really separates this tablet from
all<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.610> other<00:02:52.760> Android<00:02:53.180> tablets<00:02:53.540> out<00:02:53.690> there

all the other Android tablets out there

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.740 
all the other Android tablets out there

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
I'm sure this is mostly because of
