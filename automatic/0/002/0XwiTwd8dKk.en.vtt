00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
favorite thing to get sometimes could

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.060 
favorite thing to get sometimes could
use<00:05:21.630> our<00:05:21.810> ice<00:05:21.960> spell<00:05:22.289> I<00:05:22.500> don't<00:05:22.710> know<00:05:22.800> what<00:05:22.979> it

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
use our ice spell I don't know what it

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.589 
use our ice spell I don't know what it
does<00:05:23.280> but<00:05:23.520> let's<00:05:23.729> figure<00:05:24.000> it<00:05:24.270> out<00:05:24.389> together

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
does but let's figure it out together

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.060 
does but let's figure it out together
here<00:05:25.320> we<00:05:25.410> go

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
here we go

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.770 
here we go
okay<00:05:26.400> well<00:05:26.760> I<00:05:26.970> guess<00:05:27.210> it<00:05:27.360> just<00:05:27.389> turns

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
okay well I guess it just turns

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.180 
okay well I guess it just turns
everything<00:05:27.900> into<00:05:28.260> ice<00:05:28.470> which<00:05:28.830> is<00:05:28.950> interesting

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
everything into ice which is interesting
