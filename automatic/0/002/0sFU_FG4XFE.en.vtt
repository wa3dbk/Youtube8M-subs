00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
this point in time you should have your

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.530 
this point in time you should have your
primary<00:04:56.130> our<00:04:56.310> updated<00:04:56.850> all<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.120> way<00:04:57.240> so<00:04:57.300> that

your lightning bolts drain electricity

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.100 
your lightning bolts drain electricity
as<00:05:00.510> well<00:05:01.970> so<00:05:02.970> just<00:05:03.000> hitting<00:05:03.450> him<00:05:03.600> should<00:05:03.900> give

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
as well so just hitting him should give

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.990 
as well so just hitting him should give

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.170 
you a couple extra balls light gigawatts
of<00:05:09.300> electricity

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:19.689 

ten<00:05:12.810> thousand<00:05:13.139> idiot<00:05:13.470> she<00:05:13.740> wants<00:05:14.990> exactly

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.770 

fortunately<00:05:20.699> the<00:05:20.820> ghosts<00:05:21.210> a<00:05:21.300> pretty<00:05:21.509> easy<00:05:21.720> to

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
fortunately the ghosts a pretty easy to

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.320 
fortunately the ghosts a pretty easy to
kill<00:05:21.990> they<00:05:22.169> just<00:05:22.320> take<00:05:22.470> one<00:05:22.680> mental<00:05:22.889> shot<00:05:23.330> he

does drop a bunch of those flying box

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.850 
does drop a bunch of those flying box
which<00:05:27.539> can<00:05:27.780> be<00:05:27.990> kind<00:05:28.199> of<00:05:28.229> a<00:05:28.289> pain<00:05:28.470> to<00:05:28.500> kill<00:05:30.860> but

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
which can be kind of a pain to kill but

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.290 
which can be kind of a pain to kill but
again<00:05:31.949> just<00:05:32.100> keep<00:05:32.490> throwing<00:05:32.669> grenades<00:05:32.910> those

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
again just keep throwing grenades those

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.610 
again just keep throwing grenades those
feet<00:05:34.550> hold<00:05:35.550> on

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
feet hold on

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.439 
feet hold on
who<00:05:38.160> is<00:05:38.370> he<00:05:38.550> is<00:05:38.880> it<00:05:39.120> George<00:05:39.300> Bush<00:05:40.910> uh-oh<00:05:41.910> spoil

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
who is he is it George Bush uh-oh spoil

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:43.879 
who is he is it George Bush uh-oh spoil
it<00:05:42.660> I<00:05:42.780> mean<00:05:42.930> it<00:05:43.110> could<00:05:43.260> be<00:05:43.380> this<00:05:43.530> far<00:05:43.710> in<00:05:43.860> the

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
it I mean it could be this far in the

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:48.290 
it I mean it could be this far in the
game<00:05:44.100> probably<00:05:44.490> know<00:05:44.820> already<00:05:45.680> he's<00:05:46.680> you<00:05:47.300> from
