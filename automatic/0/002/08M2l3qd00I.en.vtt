00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.580
 hello how about friends I am the 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.260
 dentist surgeon variety and today they 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.590
 I will give a forecast teaches about the 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.930
 dental caries this is a disease 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.050
 infectious and transmissible the word 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.240
 caries comes from the Latin meaning 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.790
 putrefaction due to dental caries 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.980
 It is a disease that will destroy 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.440
 classified fabrics there are different 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.890
 degrees of caries decay that only 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.899
 covers enamel enamel and dentin is 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.739
 mars dentin and vascular-nervous package 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:42.640
 in this case the dentin enamel pulp 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.249
 muscle-nerve bundle and the root or 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.679
 I can only accept the root 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:50.079
 currently more than 95% of the population 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.390
 world has cavities this will be presented 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.120
 in all age groups there are 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.930
 multiple factors that can lead to 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.880
 this sickness 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.010
 among which can be divided into 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.200
 two large groups the primary and 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.360
 modulators within the factors 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.210
 primary or primary we find three 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.600
 the first the microorganisms the 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.729
 active lactobacillus mutans streptococcus 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.890
 misis among others this will go very 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.020
 linked to the anatomical situation of 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.390
 tooth where you will find the kind of 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.180
 decay either enamel enamel 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.970
 identity or also at the root in 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.710
 second place the diet if it is high 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.440
 in carbohydrates especially the 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.570
 sucrose will be your preferred substrate for 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.790
 the bacteria is to say that at 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.330
 metabolize them they will discard them in 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.490
 acid form so the waste 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.369
 of bacteria is what causes the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.530
 caries the third one is the host ie 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.509
 we saliva will play a very important role 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.850
 important within the carios process or 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.860
 the lower the salivary flow, the greater 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.110
 proliferation of tooth decay will be due to 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.580
 a change in the ph that in this case will be 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.130
 plus 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.170
 genetics is also important 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.630
 as the anatomy and disposition of 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.930
 teeth inside the total cavity between 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.180
 Greater beech crowding is teeth 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.979
 more guys there will be more accumulation of 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.979
 microbial or dentobacteriana plaque
