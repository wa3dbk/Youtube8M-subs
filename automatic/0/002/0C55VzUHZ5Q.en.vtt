00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
just count your steps you have to turn

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.160 
just count your steps you have to turn
that<00:03:07.830> both<00:03:08.070> on<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.610> off<00:03:08.820> so<00:03:09.780> if<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:09.960> want<00:03:10.140> to

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
that both on and off so if I want to

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.660 
that both on and off so if I want to
hear<00:03:10.320> it<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.530> wanted<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:10.920> switch<00:03:11.250> they<00:03:11.490> call

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
hear it I wanted to switch they call

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.550 
hear it I wanted to switch they call
it's<00:03:11.820> which<00:03:12.090> basically<00:03:12.600> switching<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.200> on<00:03:13.350> and

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
it's which basically switching it on and

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.740 
it's which basically switching it on and
off<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.490> wanted<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.820> turn<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.000> off<00:03:15.330> I<00:03:15.570> could

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
off and I wanted to turn it off I could

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.200 
off and I wanted to turn it off I could
turn<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:16.080> off<00:03:16.260> or<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.680> could<00:03:17.580> go<00:03:17.730> ahead<00:03:17.970> turn

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
turn it off or I could go ahead turn

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.940 
turn it off or I could go ahead turn
this<00:03:18.510> on<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:18.990> it<00:03:19.170> does<00:03:19.410> work<00:03:19.620> pretty<00:03:19.860> good

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
this on and it does work pretty good

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.460 
this on and it does work pretty good
counting<00:03:20.430> your<00:03:20.580> steps<00:03:20.610> as<00:03:21.180> long<00:03:21.840> as<00:03:21.990> your<00:03:22.170> arms

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
counting your steps as long as your arms

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.110 
counting your steps as long as your arms
are<00:03:22.650> moving<00:03:23.040> if<00:03:23.160> you're<00:03:23.310> on<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.460> treadmill<00:03:23.760> or

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
are moving if you're on a treadmill or

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.460 
are moving if you're on a treadmill or
something<00:03:24.420> like<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.600> it's<00:03:24.990> not<00:03:25.170> really

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
something like that it's not really

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.880 
something like that it's not really
gonna<00:03:25.620> be<00:03:25.980> too<00:03:26.790> accurate<00:03:27.390> but<00:03:28.170> we<00:03:28.380> can<00:03:28.530> go<00:03:28.620> into

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
gonna be too accurate but we can go into

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.130 
gonna be too accurate but we can go into
sleep<00:03:29.370> monitor<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:30.000> lot<00:03:30.630> of<00:03:30.780> these<00:03:30.900> health

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
sleep monitor a lot of these health

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.950 
sleep monitor a lot of these health
bands<00:03:31.410> make<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.300> switch<00:03:33.300> it<00:03:33.510> into<00:03:33.690> sleep<00:03:33.900> mode

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
bands make you switch it into sleep mode

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.480 
bands make you switch it into sleep mode
when<00:03:34.320> you're<00:03:34.440> going<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.680> sleep<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.190> doesn't

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
when you're going to sleep it doesn't

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.400 
when you're going to sleep it doesn't
automatically<00:03:35.970> know<00:03:36.270> so<00:03:36.900> if<00:03:36.990> I<00:03:37.080> wanted<00:03:37.320> to

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
automatically know so if I wanted to

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.300 
automatically know so if I wanted to
switch<00:03:37.710> on<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:39.180> sleep<00:03:39.810> monitor<00:03:40.200> it<00:03:40.440> will<00:03:40.650> I'll

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
switch on the sleep monitor it will I'll

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.160 
switch on the sleep monitor it will I'll
obviously<00:03:41.610> have<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.150> turn<00:03:42.330> off<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.780> the

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
obviously have to turn off the the

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.980 
obviously have to turn off the the
tracking<00:03:43.650> one<00:03:43.830> so<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.310> says<00:03:44.520> exit<00:03:45.420> pedometer

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
tracking one so it says exit pedometer

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.580 
tracking one so it says exit pedometer
and<00:03:46.640> sleep<00:03:47.640> monitor<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.450> I<00:03:49.260> haven't<00:03:49.440> really

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
and sleep monitor and I haven't really

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.960 
and sleep monitor and I haven't really
