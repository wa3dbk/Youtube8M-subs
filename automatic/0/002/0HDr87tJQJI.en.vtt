00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.560
 hello sesame welcome lady of this 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:20.100
 surrender of rhythm guitar lessons 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.140
 for beginner to intermediate this 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.000
 new series I'm going to learn how 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.400
 from the most basic rhythm for 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.270
 to go there will see a groove rhythm but 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.560
 naughty in several lessons and I'll 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.329
 proposes to follow them one after the other 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.190
 others to develop your acute sense of 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.680
 rhythm that will make you a rock star 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.450
 there is a small month on pubs 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.560
 appears there below I know this 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.329
 is not very nice it's a small 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.040
 source of income for me and I 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.260
 encourage you if you want me 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.430
 pleasure from time to time make a small 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.170
 click on the ads can close the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.880
 windows after this regard I do not care 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.530
 the important thing is that I prefer that 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.640
 google pays in your place for 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.710
 course that I hope the most fun 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.570
 possible do not go too much blah 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.380
 tackles the first rhythms 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.720
 now that you know a little bit 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.309
 the concept of four-beat measurement 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.630
 who are inside this measure 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.460
 we will do something a little bit 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.650
 different is that we will divide it into 8 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.820
 this measure so if you want we have 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.100
 always the same number of times 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.270
 simply we will divide them again into 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.490
 two which will give eight 8 units to 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.650
 inside of this measurement and the fact 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.960
 to have eight units will ask us to 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.909
 find a numbering system that 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.580
 so that I can show you what 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.869
 pace we will find and this system there it 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.970
 is like that a little bit in the middle 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.670
 of the guitar I do not know why it is 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.450
 name one and two and three and four 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.040
 and so we go each time added a is 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.900
 between the numbers it's quite practical 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.380
 because you're going to play with your hand 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.450
 right 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.909
 the air always represents blows 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.950
 against water if I do you once again 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:53.369
 on the rope always haunts me the eight 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.659
 years so that's 1 2 and 3 and stations and 1 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.590
 and 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:02.499
 and 4th but that 's a measure 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.679
 so the 4s is the last two half time 

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:07.780
 if you want some measure so we will not 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.549
 Too late to put into practice 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.280
 going to do together grant me me and 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:15.599
 the two measures of each to arrive at 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:33.110
 divide our measure in eight years according to 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:35.560
 early retirement in common 2 3 4 3 3 2 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.560
 and you
