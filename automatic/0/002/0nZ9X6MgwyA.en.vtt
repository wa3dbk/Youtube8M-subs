00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.890
 what are we going to do again like more than 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.780
 white 2 as in the title I bring you 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.610
 another challenge more than everything now is how 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.580
 come in the comments they put me 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.250
 several these says that gives 20 a will be a 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.230
 Game of arms or exchange game and 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.240
 the one tells me to get you a run of 15 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.839
 I also made a run of 15 because 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.550
 obviously that 20-0 is pure 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:33.240
 hurry up here no kings aguilar score 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.700
 suites are the advantages if there are but if 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.620
 there is or there is not or I do not remember here 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.050
 there are no advantages either, only that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.750
 pure weapon this one put the challenge was to stay 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.430
 20 0 perfect game to be remembered 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.990
 that I have a cytology scene was 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.850
 thinking about uploading a topic since I have not 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.040
 uploaded I already have several days that I have not 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.620
 uploaded to that series series that he tried 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.420
 of giving them life advice not sometimes 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.580
 they are advice as for experiences that 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.800
 obtained for people who need a 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.500
 little help with family with friends 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.360
 or with something other than a video game that 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.420
 be something from real life not really 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.189
 is I'm trying to help you not those 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.619
 series to help you because you say that 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.540
 There are people who are doing badly but not 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.740
 they do not say it is addicted and they do not have 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.290
 who talk 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.540
 nothing more positioning happening this and I 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.060
 Well, I can talk to you and tell you 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.130
 I do not support and this I would do this if 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.869
 was situation or one more for 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.149
 listen to them not if you have any problems 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.240
 or if it does not have to be a problem only 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.009
 an advice not as they said valentino 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.899
 or something that they would really like 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.939
 get fewer comments if they wanted 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.369
 some special topic for a little bit 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.159
 and if not the volume I will be uploading 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.409
 one with a theme that is mine but look 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.289
 that there I bring you down if you see in the 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.420
 corner other clip also than 20-0 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.429
 of that game since I made them two 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.159
 sometimes not because there are times that says that 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.619
 is lucky or that although not really 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.690
 of this map is of note and actually I 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.880
 yes it was harder than the other because 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.009
 the other that they appeared and then 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.080
 They appeared about 20 meters from me but 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.299
 here in luton they appear 5 meters from me 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.950
 notice that as he swallowed lava his field in 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.410
 the one that is above that was what 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.299
 I learned in the first attempt to do this 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.849
 challenge I was killed with the bazooka and babÃ­n 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:17.160
 shit but I was exploited culeros is 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.079
 the most played because the bazooka in which 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.640
 unless they are likely to have 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:23.400
 get away because suddenly 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.500
 hip and all look here to have a 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.209
 list I was thinking of following me 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.610
 below but if you look below me 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.950
 it adds to be able to win that they will appear to me 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.770
 back 20 here this appear by all 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.990
 sides at the end came out here I killed him and there 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.670
 is the challenge u and I did the challenge in the 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.770
 little screen here, this is the one 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.930
 the other account is only to give 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.670
 normal because I take it out since I'm going to 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.260
 to do the same as what is serious and what the 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.000
 girl could not sometimes put them there 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.530
 so that they see it I hope that it has 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.930
 liked this challenge if you have some other 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.700
