00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.410
 in the united states in the state of kentucky 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:10.630
 this is the spring life takes a little 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.490
 everywhere including at the center of 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.170
 Wildlife Safeguard 2008 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.190
 island 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.320
 this is where the animal carer 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.160
 linda williams cares for animals 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.600
 injured or orphaned 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.450
 I have mattern more than a dozen 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.280
 Raccoon babies I spend my time at 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.630
 give the bottle and clean their 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:34.629
 needs for a crazy it must be that 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.190
 someone cares for these animals but 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:37.500
 the adoptive mom can not handle everything 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.329
 alone 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.780
 nancy reynolds one of his colleagues is 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.320
 come to lend him a hand in the 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.120
 Kentucky 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.519
 there are only two or three healers per 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:53.050
 counted then we were obliged to 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:56.079
 shake your elbows are there when he screams 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.370
 it's all at the same time but for 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.760
 the moment they are calm 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.190
 I will start with these two there 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.780
 how can you do this alone 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.980
 I admit it is not easy it is 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.330
 little stressful cbb raccoon arrive 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.680
 from all of western kentucky 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.600
 they come from different environments 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.840
 and have different stories 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.380
 the small ones as a careful 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.600
 animal 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.500
 my role is that these babies are also in 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.570
 form only if their mother had been there to 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.820
 their birth the raccoons weighs in 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.950
 barely 60 grams to stay in good 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.120
 health they must grow quickly 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.340
 so you have to feed them very often 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.030
 is soaked with air or pee I know 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.980
 not very good it will be necessary to give them the 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.360
 bottle until their six weeks when 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.900
 they can start eating 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.180
 all alone 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.860
 then it will be necessary to treat them and 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.910
 monitor up to their release 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.130
 in autumn 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:56.540

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:03.140

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:05.120
 continues to receive phone calls to 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.950
 media we're going to come get them okay 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.550

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.940

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.130

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.580
 very sad hello he feels or up there 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.080

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.480

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.660
 wallach board rank or less a lot 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.540
 of individuals and businesses pose 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.090
 traps against wild animals 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.680
 not knowing if they have small is 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.860
 one and the babies end up on the 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.400

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.160
 and determine whether he should have a 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.420
