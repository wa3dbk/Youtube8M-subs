00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.770 
really taking off in fact Apple
computers<00:06:42.639> coming<00:06:42.820> right<00:06:43.030> up<00:06:43.150> into<00:06:43.270> gap<00:06:43.540> fill

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780 
computers coming right up into gap fill

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.120 
computers coming right up into gap fill
in<00:06:43.900> fact<00:06:44.080> it<00:06:44.199> looks<00:06:44.320> like<00:06:44.440> it<00:06:44.530> got<00:06:44.680> there<00:06:44.979> but

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
in fact it looks like it got there but

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.830 
in fact it looks like it got there but
this<00:06:45.610> is<00:06:45.760> you're<00:06:45.910> shorting<00:06:46.270> opportunity

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
this is you're shorting opportunity

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.120 
this is you're shorting opportunity
right<00:06:47.020> here<00:06:47.050> folks<00:06:47.530> if<00:06:47.680> you<00:06:47.740> want<00:06:47.949> to<00:06:48.010> take<00:06:48.100> a

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.130 
right here folks if you want to take a

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.070 
right here folks if you want to take a
nap<00:06:48.310> afternoon<00:06:48.940> short<00:06:49.210> I<00:06:49.300> think<00:06:49.330> I'd<00:06:49.750> be

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
nap afternoon short I think I'd be

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.600 
nap afternoon short I think I'd be
surprised<00:06:50.560> if<00:06:50.740> Apple<00:06:51.070> can<00:06:51.190> get<00:06:51.310> through<00:06:51.490> this

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
surprised if Apple can get through this

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.960 
surprised if Apple can get through this
line<00:06:51.669> right<00:06:52.090> here<00:06:52.150> which<00:06:52.479> is<00:06:52.600> at<00:06:52.750> 200<00:06:53.530> spot<00:06:54.340> 75

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970 
line right here which is at 200 spot 75

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.580 
line right here which is at 200 spot 75
or<00:06:55.180> so<00:06:55.330> if<00:06:55.600> you<00:06:55.810> get<00:06:55.960> through<00:06:56.169> that<00:06:56.290> then<00:06:56.500> this

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.590 
or so if you get through that then this

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.379 
or so if you get through that then this
would<00:06:56.770> be<00:06:56.860> another<00:06:57.250> fantastic<00:06:57.850> shorting

00:06:58.379 --> 00:06:58.389 
would be another fantastic shorting

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:01.920 
would be another fantastic shorting
opportunity<00:06:58.900> on<00:06:59.050> Apple<00:06:59.530> at<00:06:59.940> 120<00:07:00.940> one<00:07:01.240> spot<00:07:01.540> 40

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930 
opportunity on Apple at 120 one spot 40

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.530 
opportunity on Apple at 120 one spot 40
so<00:07:02.290> 2014<00:07:03.040> t<00:07:03.220> on<00:07:03.370> Apple<00:07:03.910> would<00:07:03.970> be<00:07:04.090> another<00:07:04.270> play

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:04.540 
so 2014 t on Apple would be another play

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.790 
so 2014 t on Apple would be another play
but<00:07:04.690> right<00:07:04.900> in<00:07:05.020> here<00:07:05.169> you<00:07:05.290> have<00:07:05.320> to<00:07:05.470> say<00:07:05.680> this

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
but right in here you have to say this

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.820 
but right in here you have to say this
Apple<00:07:06.160> chart<00:07:06.370> is<00:07:06.460> extremely<00:07:07.210> and<00:07:07.330> I<00:07:07.389> repeat
