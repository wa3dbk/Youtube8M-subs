CLG<00:03:19.870> win<00:03:20.940> our<00:03:21.940> players<00:03:22.210> do<00:03:22.690> really<00:03:22.930> want<00:03:23.110> to

CLG win our players do really want to

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.130 
CLG win our players do really want to
win<00:03:23.350> that<00:03:23.740> they<00:03:24.280> do<00:03:24.490> feel<00:03:24.880> like<00:03:25.450> there<00:03:25.660> is<00:03:25.690> a

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
win that they do feel like there is a

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.010 
win that they do feel like there is a
rivalry<00:03:26.920> from<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.250> past<00:03:27.460> I<00:03:27.730> think<00:03:28.630> that<00:03:28.780> if

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
rivalry from the past I think that if

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.690 
rivalry from the past I think that if
CLG<00:03:29.380> starts<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:29.710> performing<00:03:30.190> in<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.400> sarissa

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
CLG starts to performing in the sarissa

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.460 
CLG starts to performing in the sarissa
fight<00:03:30.850> well<00:03:31.060> again<00:03:31.270> maybe<00:03:32.080> there'll<00:03:32.320> be<00:03:32.350> a

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
fight well again maybe there'll be a

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.180 
fight well again maybe there'll be a
rough<00:03:32.950> road<00:03:33.130> back<00:03:33.430> again<00:03:33.790> in<00:03:34.540> CLG<00:03:34.960> beats<00:03:35.350> TSM<00:03:35.920> I

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
rough road back again in CLG beats TSM I

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.760 
rough road back again in CLG beats TSM I
think<00:03:36.850> TSM<00:03:37.450> fans<00:03:37.810> are<00:03:38.080> going<00:03:38.170> to<00:03:38.260> be<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.380> real

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
think TSM fans are going to be a real

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.180 
think TSM fans are going to be a real
salty<00:03:39.580> so<00:03:40.390> it'll<00:03:40.810> kind<00:03:41.050> of<00:03:41.140> add<00:03:41.410> a<00:03:41.470> spark<00:03:42.130> to

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
salty so it'll kind of add a spark to

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.580 
salty so it'll kind of add a spark to
the<00:03:42.370> fire<00:03:42.700> if<00:03:43.480> we<00:03:43.660> were<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.050> take<00:03:44.170> second<00:03:44.530> in

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
the fire if we were to take second in

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.520 
the fire if we were to take second in
North<00:03:44.770> America<00:03:45.100> we<00:03:45.220> consider<00:03:45.670> that<00:03:45.730> failure

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
North America we consider that failure

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.780 
North America we consider that failure
my<00:03:47.530> players<00:03:47.800> might<00:03:48.100> cut<00:03:48.280> yourself<00:03:48.310> and

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
my players might cut yourself and

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.550 
my players might cut yourself and
everyone<00:03:49.060> worked<00:03:49.420> extremely<00:03:49.990> hard<00:03:50.170> for<00:03:50.350> this

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
everyone worked extremely hard for this

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.990 
everyone worked extremely hard for this
year<00:03:50.800> if<00:03:51.250> we<00:03:51.370> were<00:03:51.460> to<00:03:51.610> lose<00:03:51.760> I<00:03:52.440> think<00:03:53.440> that

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
year if we were to lose I think that

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.850 
year if we were to lose I think that
I've<00:03:55.000> been<00:03:55.300> tears<00:03:55.630> but<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.930> same<00:03:56.110> time<00:03:56.350> weird

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
I've been tears but the same time weird

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.070 
I've been tears but the same time weird
away<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.340> I<00:03:57.370> think<00:03:57.580> that<00:03:57.730> it<00:03:58.060> is<00:03:58.090> going<00:03:58.720> to<00:03:59.020> be

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
away and I think that it is going to be

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.450 
away and I think that it is going to be
another<00:03:59.920> Molson<00:04:00.250> that<00:04:00.670> we<00:04:00.760> paid<00:04:02.460> everything
