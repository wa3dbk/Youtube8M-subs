where the saddlebag was normally latched

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.270 
where the saddlebag was normally latched
so<00:03:27.850> what<00:03:27.970> we're<00:03:28.090> going<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.240> do<00:03:28.620> is<00:03:29.620> get<00:03:29.890> another

so what we're going to do is get another
one<00:03:30.460> of<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.700> long<00:03:30.910> rivets<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.980> get<00:03:33.160> it<00:03:33.280> ready

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
one of the long rivets and get it ready

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.770 
one of the long rivets and get it ready
to<00:03:33.520> install<00:03:34.680> so<00:03:35.680> then<00:03:35.860> what<00:03:36.040> we've<00:03:36.190> got<00:03:36.310> to<00:03:36.430> do

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
to install so then what we've got to do

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.980 
to install so then what we've got to do
is<00:03:37.780> lift<00:03:38.470> this<00:03:38.710> one<00:03:38.920> up<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.280> install<00:03:39.580> it<00:03:39.730> also
