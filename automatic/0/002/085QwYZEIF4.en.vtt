00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 this is a video I was asked for 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:11.160
 aloud in a loud voice you do 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.700
 a video on books and books comparison 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.270
 then this is a bit where ruby ciccio 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.449
 it is not really the book yes vabbÃ¨ sentences 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.460
 so you throw it really is a video where 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:29.130
 I explain the transposition because 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.070
 no one is materially anyone e 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.980
 guidelines and tell me a second thing 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.610
 me when he draws always says better 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.540
 the book respects the film could 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:47.850
 being true, however, is a little taken 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:50.399
 little gay it is true grants exactly 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.980
 I was like that at the beginning 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.530
 I approached films taken from books or from 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.620
 other things from other works in a way 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.949
 wrong in the sense I imagined myself or is 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.780
 also the Italian language is said 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.909
 transposition in my opinion instead not 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.090
 must be so there is a film not 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.600
 faithfully follows what the book was in 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.820
 comics etc. etc. should not not 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.299
 be taken into consideration because it is 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.729
 a 1 ter apart I do I give you a 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.250
 Checco example then let's take that ne 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.130
 I know a still life picture and see 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.750
 there is an apple just a sail or a 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.390
 framework so all you want that 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.049
 in the land obviously aimed at the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.079
 what you say cabbage that beautiful 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.270
 the colors these concerns these things 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.549
 the same subject of the same nature 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.829
 to death the same apple if you do in 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.170
 sculpture obviously will be of a single one 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.630
 color then seeing the sculpture not 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.640
 you can say yes but yours are missing 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.829
 colors that gave him life because he is 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.340
 another thing is the strengths 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.100
 others is another medium and therefore you must 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.670
 take into account only the subject what 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.399
 expresses that the picture is what expresses it 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.810
 same subject people sculptural of 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:12.360
 gods sculpture sector like Italian 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.060
 so why should not it 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.640
 normal that a little more book on the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.160
 interior monologue, however, a film cannot 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.140
 be two hours of which there are half an hour 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.569
 monologues where the protagonist speaks with 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.700
 himself is normal that gives him more 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.830
 the interiority and the film of the must 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.280
 show interiority but also make 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.819
 talk the protagonists for a minimum e 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:40.140
 so it's normal and normal that I know 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:42.060
 the harry potter film lasts two hours 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.709
 normal that something is missing because 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.630
 otherwise they could make a film of 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.190
 four and I don't know how many if 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.410
 would be seen we must always 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.340
 remember that even a commercial thing 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.480
 so you can see the book if you sell it 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.150
 to a single person 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.150
 the film projects it to a room 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.130
 cinematographic that at 100 places and therefore 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.630
 it's not like you 're talking to one 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.200
 person but you're talking to so many 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.480
 people 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.349
 you always have to take movies like 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.709
 something a subject that only skeleton 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:16.170
 original was also a starting point e 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.880
 don't expect something identical 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.420
 because the teeth have literally 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.609
 impossible in my opinion we should do 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.870
 console always of orange lily 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.900
 mechanics 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.940
 the very different book there is a chapter in 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.160
 more than completely distorts the whole 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.049
 history of building still described in the 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.420
 book is certainly not the costumes of 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.069
 kubrick and in my opinion the aesthetics in the film 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.980
 of kubrick especially for costumes is 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.980
 something fantastic because it is surrendered 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.380
 that movie without time just because not 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.540
 you can hit delete because 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.680
 he looks like crazy with his mother 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.510
 in short, with hair the mouths stuff 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.400
 so we don't have to wait or 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.990
 remain scandalized if you change 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.240
 something also heard remains the same 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.120
 let's take it to make it a little bit with 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.480
 detachment from the sense the original point 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.700
 the same the skeleton is the same only 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.910
 that a version has become a book 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.410
 it was high and became a movie so not 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.120
 making comparisons in my opinion is 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:22.880
 impossible because really like 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:27.590
 compare the jesus he painted the jesus 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:30.490
 in what is pity perhaps always with 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:35.180
 same jesus is the question in a picture 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:37.510
 that competes what you compare if not the 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.780
 subject that the only thing that is 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.450
 unchanged 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.370
 but when you become a film that is 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.560
 identical sketches to everything as I was 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.520
 imagined, however, it is one thing 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.820
 impossible and therefore I only need 30 per 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.820
 to say
