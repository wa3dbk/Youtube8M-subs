00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.280
 I am standing there for at least ten minutes in line for the new and Jos 5D 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.099
 Mark two 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:13.279
 I was lucky 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.900
 if I have the opportunity to 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.779
 today to talk with the canon song also new canon 5d why 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.010
 so many people are waiting there for you to look for an incredible amount 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.269
 interest for this new camera is only because it has more pixels 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.140
 Listen after that interview that he will be recorded earlier with you from 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.080
 canon 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.050
 the 5d mark 2 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.790
 the news of the photo kina 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.790
 but now when I look on the second day how busy it is it is busier on the 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.200
 on the first day that is five rows thick in front of that camera 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.840
 we see an 18-year-old goalkeeper was very difficult to fix a camera 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.460
 hold 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.680
 but what i make into a new one 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.989
 akamai why these people want there is more pixels 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.180
 that's more than over 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.460
 yes they are not just more pixels they heard and have become more beautiful there 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.550
 it is of course about 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.220
 one has finished the number of pixels once 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.370
 with 21 omari megapixels you are on the level 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.470
 of the new format 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.470
 but what those pixels do in the dark is what matters 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.370
 For more information 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.560
 do you already have a new one, there is a new chip in it or is it just one 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.340
 new jacket 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.420
 completely new chip 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.790
 it is just like a number of pixels may be equal to that of the nds 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.070
 he has gross there is more but the pictures are true on the chips and also 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.070
 redeveloped so it's less sensitive to less noise 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.650
 in addition to the mess 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.650
 second, chip the processor 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.020
 he also said that this is a new digic 4 the next generation 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.250
 new algorithm smeerdijk a power 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.250
 even better able to calculate noise 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.329
 but i heard that this camera can video a quarter ad 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.570
 hear telenet fidea 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.570
 yes you can also experience video here 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.370
 you have been seeing great favorites for some time 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.320
 see the assets from within 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.320
 that I now turn on 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.030
 it now shows me 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.030
 on the new display or on it is 920,000 pixels 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:11.949
 therefore that was already a need for photographers said yes that is nice his camera 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:15.859
 but that is when that stays behind with this is prices again all the way around 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:19.109
 the sharpness beautiful color reproduction 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:23.499
 but just to film you have been seeing photographers for a long time 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:24.699
 projecting 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:25.520
 often on 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.379
 multimedia modes 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.929
 but bring their customers and that requires the integration of photo and film 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:33.489
 a lot is now more beautiful 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.319
 then with such a large chip 35 millimeters the colder film format is hop 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.290
 thieves with a very nice short depth of field to cope with that 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.719
 to film 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.139
 three minutes 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.339
 for what should be imagine no if your card is big enough one 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:49.139
 half an hour 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.010
 and as I just quoted 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.020
 nice short depth of field it will be cinematic again we use 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.719
 19 20 10 80 30 p 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:01.170
 but I have just checked ap one of those monitors is sick 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.090
 brilliant movie I understand that so the demo just could not come 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.410
 don't believe yes you see that was in the credits we have 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.140
 but 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.470
 especially if you are technically in work then you can see in the 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.899
 depth of field and oil 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:17.819
 the sharpness is also extended that we can actually do what we can do again 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.009
 long miss we miss that nice sharpness is in the right place for your information 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:23.259
 who likes to know this 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:26.389
 but we had the first day on the website there with all those 30 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.049
 orders for this camera impossible because 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.249
 I look there as good news that I hope it continues 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:35.869
 if people come to you it seems then what is the except the canon the 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:37.150
 new Dutch market 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.799
 5d to see the more 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.720
 the 50d announced two weeks earlier also includes the spectacular new duty 4 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:48.349
 in addition, there were of course a lot of compact cameras 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.230
 part of which is also equipped with that new processor a number of new ones 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.299
 features we know it will be easier to take beautiful pictures and again 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.519
 enjoy your camera and the image you are experiencing 4 congratulations with this 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.989
 fantastic camera I fell in love with it 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.899
 I think a lot of people have to come and look at the site soon 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:09.359
 like having wine in the store 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.919
 this is a quality mark for bald with for the profit of expenses
