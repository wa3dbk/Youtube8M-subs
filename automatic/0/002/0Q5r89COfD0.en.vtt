the I'd have to say the stamping seems

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.460 
the I'd have to say the stamping seems
okay<00:01:49.890> inside<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.210> leather<00:01:51.470> doesn't

the line these are always very hard
these<00:02:03.750> these<00:02:04.290> are<00:02:04.590> authentications<00:02:05.490> when<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
these these are authentications when the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.630 
these these are authentications when the

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
is a fake and the reason I say that is

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.440 
is a fake and the reason I say that is
okay<00:02:17.530> on<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.880> handle

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
okay on the handle

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.140 
okay on the handle
it's<00:02:19.570> got<00:02:19.900> Louis<00:02:20.560> Vuitton<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.610> bucket<00:02:21.940> bag

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
it's got Louis Vuitton the bucket bag

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.200 
it's got Louis Vuitton the bucket bag
itself<00:02:22.570> that<00:02:23.320> model<00:02:23.800> my<00:02:24.310> wife<00:02:24.550> has<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:24.820> bucket

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
itself that model my wife has a bucket

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.940 
itself that model my wife has a bucket
bag<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.660> it<00:02:25.750> doesn't<00:02:26.140> actually<00:02:26.260> have<00:02:26.620> Louis

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
bag and it doesn't actually have Louis

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.240 
bag and it doesn't actually have Louis
Vuitton<00:02:26.980> on<00:02:27.520> it<00:02:27.760> so<00:02:28.000> that's<00:02:28.720> one<00:02:29.080> alarm<00:02:29.440> the

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
Vuitton on it so that's one alarm the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.160 
Vuitton on it so that's one alarm the
next<00:02:30.550> thing<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:30.970> is<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.570> leather<00:02:31.780> seems

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
next thing is is that the leather seems

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.340 
next thing is is that the leather seems
to<00:02:32.350> be<00:02:32.500> very<00:02:32.770> worn<00:02:33.250> inside<00:02:33.810> that's<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.930> second

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
to be very worn inside that's the second

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.080 
to be very worn inside that's the second
alarm<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.800> doesn't<00:02:36.100> seem<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.370> be<00:02:36.490> cut<00:02:36.760> off<00:02:36.880> that

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
alarm it doesn't seem to be cut off that

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.840 
alarm it doesn't seem to be cut off that
well<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.630> seems<00:02:37.930> like<00:02:38.200> it's<00:02:39.010> it's<00:02:39.640> been

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
well it seems like it's it's been

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.270 
well it seems like it's it's been
artificially<00:02:40.150> aged<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.440> with<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.980> super

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
artificially aged and with the super

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.690 
artificially aged and with the super
fakes<00:02:42.520> from<00:02:42.760> Japan<00:02:43.210> and<00:02:43.860> this<00:02:44.860> is<00:02:45.070> a<00:02:45.100> bags<00:02:45.430> that

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
fakes from Japan and this is a bags that

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.000 
fakes from Japan and this is a bags that
were<00:02:45.820> sourced<00:02:46.180> in<00:02:46.330> Korea<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:47.350> quality<00:02:47.800> of<00:02:47.920> the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
were sourced in Korea the quality of the

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.060 
were sourced in Korea the quality of the
fakes<00:02:48.310> are<00:02:48.670> very<00:02:49.390> very<00:02:49.690> good<00:02:49.960> so<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:50.560> I'm

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
fakes are very very good so I I'm

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.370 
fakes are very very good so I I'm
leaning<00:02:51.760> towards<00:02:52.360> saying<00:02:52.570> it's<00:02:52.810> fake

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
leaning towards saying it's fake

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.100 
leaning towards saying it's fake
I<00:02:53.410> also<00:02:54.400> if<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:54.790> look<00:02:54.910> at<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.180> date<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.960> batch

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
I also if you look at the date the batch

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.740 
I also if you look at the date the batch
code<00:02:56.410> on<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.800> that<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.190> two<00:02:57.460> on<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:58.480> the

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
code on it that the two on the the

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.290 
code on it that the two on the the
number<00:02:59.080> there<00:02:59.230> doesn't<00:02:59.770> seem<00:03:00.060> perfect<00:03:01.060> and

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
number there doesn't seem perfect and

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.410 
number there doesn't seem perfect and
I'm<00:03:02.340> edging<00:03:03.340> towards<00:03:03.700> saying<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:04.210> that

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
I'm edging towards saying that that

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.280 
I'm edging towards saying that that
that's<00:03:04.770> it's<00:03:05.770> almost<00:03:06.220> almost<00:03:06.970> perfect<00:03:07.780> but<00:03:07.990> I

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
that's it's almost almost perfect but I

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.030 
that's it's almost almost perfect but I
don't<00:03:08.860> think<00:03:09.070> it<00:03:09.190> is<00:03:09.340> so<00:03:09.700> there<00:03:10.360> we<00:03:10.480> have<00:03:10.660> it<00:03:11.040> at

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
don't think it is so there we have it at

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.730 
don't think it is so there we have it at
this<00:03:12.220> bag<00:03:12.490> here<00:03:12.850> I'm<00:03:13.240> going<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.630> say<00:03:13.870> is<00:03:14.170> fake

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
this bag here I'm going to say is fake

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.710 
this bag here I'm going to say is fake
