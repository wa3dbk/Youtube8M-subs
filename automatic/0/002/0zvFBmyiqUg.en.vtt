00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.600
 a makeup 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:13.860
 and if you want to learn like me first 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.930
 He started leaving me a lancÃ´me tonic 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.550
 this technique is extremely good projected 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.250
 a lot of pretty around the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.660
 nose that are open and I have done 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.880
 always after being on the side of the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.890
 face has received hot water for a long time 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.410
 weather 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.660
 then continue to start in the shadows like this 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.670
 that I started putting a first one so that 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.490
 the shadows are throughout the day 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.880
 and I started to blur it super well 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:42.130
 then a planet brochette takes a color 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.530
 coral that is that color that is also 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.010
 serious and he began to place it all over my 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.010
 eyelid mobile 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.379
 I think the best technique to place 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.460
 shadows in that part of the eye is 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.460
 just tap 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.780
 then I took a much darker and 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.670
 I started placing it on the foot part 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.950
 of the eye with a blurred broach 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.520
 now this looks like the look was already 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.520
 of much more 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.700
 and fading 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.470
 then he is also a much clearer man 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.410
 and lights to illuminate use a 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.960
 little planet brochita and place the 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.530
 shadow in the arch of the eyebrow and in the 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.530
 lacrimal area 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.300
 I finished all the part of the shadow of 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.760
 the eyes now I started with the face and 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.710
 for this I started putting myself a live 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.720
 cream that is to leave my er and in truth I 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.390
 has been very good recently 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.430
 summit and I really thought it was great 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.050
 and female covers very well and I do not need a 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.050
 first to last all day 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.070
 and I used my hands because I feel that 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.659
 It makes it much easier for me to put 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.130
 bicrim but you can use 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.130
 videochat or a sponge 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.079
 and I decided to make a small contour 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.259
 for this I used a much more base 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.510
 dark and I started to place it in the 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.250
 of my cheekbones under them and in the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.250
 nose to be able to do it a little 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.260
 and to this right that is the real 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.269
 techniques I started to blur it and very 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.410
 well so that I have a more natural look 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.840
 and not so marked 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.180
 I did a much clearer corrector 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.700
 my skin color and I started to place it 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.470
 in the part of the dark circles and in the part 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.040
 of the nose and what I know most of all 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.040
 to illuminate 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.240
 and to seal all the makeup I used 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.480
 my favorite compact powders that are 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.200
 distilled 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.730
 as error use the public Lord of 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.730
 century in pink 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.900
 and to define a little more my eyebrows 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.300
 Use a shade of tan color with 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.370
 a brush much more gradient and I started to 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.440
 put on all the part of the eyebrows 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.489
 trying to give that little bow that in 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.489
 it really looks very nice 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.650
 I took a shade of chocolate and 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.110
 I started to put it on my eyelashes 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.750
 lower this makes it look like 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.730
 if they were a little more populated 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.520
 with this right now I started to put my 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.410
 eyebrows and then I went to reason my eyelashes 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.200
 since it is the only way that my 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.510
 eyelashes are completely curled what 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.770
 to check them I put the mask on 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.660
 tabs that are seeing that is the 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.340
 collection from the middle and it really is 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.730
 very good because it gives you a lot of 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.730
 volume 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.190
 then to hydrate me there have already been 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.790
 use the lip balm that is on 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.950
 vanilla flavor 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.620
 but 2009 could forget about me 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.359
 favorite mask that is the real one of 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.359
 benefit for lower lashes 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:09.740
 and well that would be all affection with this 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.870
 makeup that I bring you and nothing less 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.420
