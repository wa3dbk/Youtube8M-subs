got to get this car it's the same one
that's<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.719> vanishing<00:00:58.140> point<00:00:58.760> of<00:00:59.760> course<00:01:00.059> it

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
that's in vanishing point of course it

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.290 
that's in vanishing point of course it
needed<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.660> be<00:01:00.780> painted<00:01:01.140> white<00:01:01.350> after<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:02.300> so

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
needed to be painted white after that so

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.030 
needed to be painted white after that so
it's<00:01:03.539> at<00:01:03.690> about<00:01:03.899> three<00:01:04.170> white<00:01:04.409> paint<00:01:04.769> jobs

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
since that time it was originally the b5

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.820 
since that time it was originally the b5
blue<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.780> course<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.140> has<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> rust<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.710> all

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
blue and of course it has a rust in all

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.950 
blue and of course it has a rust in all
the<00:01:13.979> right<00:01:14.100> spots<00:01:15.920> needs<00:01:16.920> new<00:01:17.130> quarters<00:01:17.960> which

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
the right spots needs new quarters which

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.870 
the right spots needs new quarters which
I<00:01:19.200> kind<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.710> wanted<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.009> do<00:01:20.159> myself<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:20.700> I

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
I kind of wanted to do myself but I

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.340 
I kind of wanted to do myself but I
don't<00:01:21.090> know<00:01:21.210> how<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.360> weld<00:01:22.189> so<00:01:24.110> it's<00:01:25.110> pretty

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
don't know how to weld so it's pretty

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.910 
don't know how to weld so it's pretty
straight<00:01:25.680> other<00:01:25.890> than<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:27.590> that<00:01:28.590> was<00:01:28.770> done

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
straight other than that that was done

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.910 
straight other than that that was done
prior<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.220> nineteen<00:01:29.640> eighty<00:01:30.740> somebody<00:01:31.740> who

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
prior to nineteen eighty somebody who

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.940 
prior to nineteen eighty somebody who
did<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.240> Frankenstein<00:01:33.240> job<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.500> skin<00:01:34.829> of

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
did a Frankenstein job on the skin of

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.929 
did a Frankenstein job on the skin of
the<00:01:34.979> quarter<00:01:35.340> panel<00:01:35.640> there<00:01:36.409> and<00:01:40.579> it<00:01:41.579> doesn't

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
the quarter panel there and it doesn't

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.700 
the quarter panel there and it doesn't
have<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.090> cutouts<00:01:42.570> for<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.869> exhaust<00:01:43.290> because

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
have the cutouts for the exhaust because

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.429 
have the cutouts for the exhaust because
again<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.250> not<00:01:44.399> our<00:01:44.729> tea<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.420> had<00:01:45.600> turn<00:01:46.170> downs

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439
