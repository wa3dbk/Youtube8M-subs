 at all I do not pray if you do not like damien 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.849
 you would have liquid nitrogen 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.529
 it's for chloe but what is it 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.670
 manufactures with all that she builds a 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.670
 temporal convector or what 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.520
 no but without laughing at steria at 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.940
 Serious how do you do when you pray 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.770
 you talk to god you tu tu formula 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.850
 politeness to know how you do 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.629
 today I would like to answer a 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.550
 question of caroline de monaco seeks 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.440
 jérôme learn us took to the property 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.360
 caroline you knocked on the right door 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.970
 it's true that technique quite 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.380
 impressive it makes me happy this 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.670
 that you say mine I'm happy that 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.960
 you recognize it I do not understand how to last 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.850
 caroline the most important if you want 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.920
 really private is to find you a 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.060
 good police this is a position 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.540
 which marks the respect and the 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.100
 contemplation 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.899
 but especially a position not too much 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.899
 painful not to commit too quickly 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.830
 also think to tell him that it is 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.870
 to set a time and stick to it 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.280
 when we pray we must let ourselves be burned 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.619
 by love become a little bit like a 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.770
 herd of fiery buffalo and for that 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:52.600
 nothing like setting the time 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:54.100
 cooking but then concretely what 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.869
 what we say when we pray for 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.700
 start you can use prayers 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.470
 already written the important thing is really to 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.020
 use it personal things with 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.720
 own words eg 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.970
 injustice or peace in the world 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.700
 all do the prayer it's a kind of 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.500
 opinion speech against what not of course 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.580
 that no no no no the idea is 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:19.950
 to really use and me you oh god 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:24.989
 you are our father who are in heaven 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:28.660
 and your name to you god they're 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.550
 sanctified and that their reign comes 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.709
 also how do you stay 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.299
 concentrated of important is not your 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.370
 concentration but the will that you have 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.970
 to stay focused that wants strictly 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.700
 say nothing 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.930
 damien here as for distractions you 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.579
 can always during a Bible and the 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.579
 read in general that calm 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.920
 otherwise you will also have the possibility 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.840
 to learn by heart psalms or 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.580
 passages of the gospel like that you can 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.870
 pray without a Bible then something for 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.970
 business that's learning them 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.200
 changing as we were sure of you 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.230
 there you worry 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.959
 it's a cardboard stoning this adult woman 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:14.150
 is one of you who is without 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:22.989
 sin throws him the first stone at the 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:22.989
 stoned pide to stoning to peace 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.940
 otherwise to put you in the mood of 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.110
 prayer you always have the possibility 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.610
 to go to a church 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.110
 yeah it's an atmosphere 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.349
 great that you will find nowhere 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.780
 elsewhere 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.340
 after you really believe ah yeah the 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.780
 best proof of that is that is going 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.290
 try to get an organ into 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:48.970
 a municipal hall all agree that 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:52.230
 it has nothing to do there is agreement says 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.230
 that because it's unstoppable that's all
