 you come in Yucatec I worked in Yucatec 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:19.680
 the church community I think that 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.750
 in the Mexican Republic I love 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.540
 because it has a wonderful gastronomy 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.540
 but speaking of preferred states 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.660
 I agree with people 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.660
 completely the jarocha 

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:45.679

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:53.039
 no I'm not going so dung to salduna mom the king 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.569
 do not add by god that which other I think 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.519
 that those are my three favorite ones 

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:59.219
 game for me are my 33 drowned cakes 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.079
 of equal-gives the rockrose and if I like me 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.280
 like to go to so many drowned in the jacuzzi 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.280

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.900

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.940
 versions but good surely this 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.479
 they liked it is very easy to do 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.280
 notice that the lime season begins 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.619
 in Mexico in cough I thought it was very good 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.050
 very good to make them remember how it is 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.740
 the nature so wise that it starts to 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.690
 be cold and those those this fruits that 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.460
 they contain so much vitamin c then 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.950
 They begin to like the orange 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.369

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.700
 to have a soup of this meeting in the 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.980
 that primary television called 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.019
 miramax and now if you have already concentrated 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.370

 also cooking very well 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.160
 In this, let the boil go 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.200
 cover in this way as soon as you release 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.930
 If the bowl is much faster so we 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.940
