there<00:01:47.460> was<00:01:47.670> like<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.000> said<00:01:48.210> one<00:01:48.570> other<00:01:48.720> skate

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
there was like I said one other skate

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.260 
there was like I said one other skate
park<00:01:49.439> around<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:49.890> but<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.820> was<00:01:50.939> hardly<00:01:51.180> a

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270

let's try backflip for the grand finale

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.760 
let's try backflip for the grand finale
here<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.390> I'm<00:02:16.569> about<00:02:16.720> ready<00:02:16.990> to<00:02:17.140> wrap<00:02:17.560> this

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
here so I'm about ready to wrap this

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:25.500 
here so I'm about ready to wrap this
video<00:02:18.040> up<00:02:22.020> let<00:02:23.020> me<00:02:23.110> get<00:02:23.260> some<00:02:23.380> speed<00:02:24.300> let's<00:02:25.300> put

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
video up let me get some speed let's put

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.449 
video up let me get some speed let's put
on<00:02:25.600> this<00:02:25.870> mode<00:02:26.200> this<00:02:26.650> see<00:02:27.069> if<00:02:27.160> it<00:02:27.250> could<00:02:27.370> be

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
on this mode this see if it could be

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.220 
on this mode this see if it could be
like<00:02:27.610> this<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.940> entire<00:02:28.270> time<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.870> never<00:02:28.989> move

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
like this the entire time and never move

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.750 
like this the entire time and never move
from<00:02:29.380> this<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:29.950> would<00:02:30.069> actually<00:02:30.400> make<00:02:30.610> it

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
from this that would actually make it

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.540 
from this that would actually make it
easier<00:02:30.880> but<00:02:31.330> then<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.290> goes<00:02:32.800> like<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.010> out<00:02:33.400> of

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
easier but then it goes like that out of

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.160 
easier but then it goes like that out of
nowhere<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.209> makes<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.569> hard<00:02:34.900> all<00:02:35.050> of<00:02:35.110> a

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
nowhere and makes it hard all of a

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.650 
nowhere and makes it hard all of a
sudden<00:02:37.170> what<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.440> hell<00:02:38.620> kind<00:02:38.860> of<00:02:38.890> use<00:02:39.100> this

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
sudden what the hell kind of use this

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.000 
sudden what the hell kind of use this
and<00:02:40.660> somehow<00:02:40.989> he<00:02:41.140> lands<00:02:41.470> at<00:02:41.739> what<00:02:43.620> there<00:02:44.620> see

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
and somehow he lands at what there see

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.650 
and somehow he lands at what there see
that's<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.370> cool<00:02:45.550> view<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.209> backflip<00:02:46.870> time<00:02:47.080> oh

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
that's a cool view and backflip time oh

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.690 
that's a cool view and backflip time oh
he<00:02:49.660> actually<00:02:49.930> did<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.680> an<00:02:50.830> awesome<00:02:51.010> view<00:02:51.459> -

that was perfect now that we've done the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.670 
that was perfect now that we've done the
backflip<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:55.630> know<00:02:55.720> what<00:02:55.959> might<00:02:56.260> as<00:02:56.350> well<00:02:56.440> try

backflip you know what might as well try

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.770 
backflip you know what might as well try
front<00:02:57.010> flip<00:02:57.280> because<00:02:57.580> why<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.209> hell<00:02:58.510> not
