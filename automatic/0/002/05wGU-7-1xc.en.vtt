00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
watercolors people seem to think or

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.049 
watercolors people seem to think or
watercolors<00:00:49.710> one<00:00:49.890> technique<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.580> oil<00:00:51.000> is

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059

completely different this not really

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.979 
completely different this not really
techniques<00:00:53.280> cross<00:00:53.580> all<00:00:53.820> boundaries<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.960> I

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
techniques cross all boundaries so I

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.660 
techniques cross all boundaries so I
