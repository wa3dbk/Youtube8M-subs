00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
evolved with him as well let's get out

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.610 
evolved with him as well let's get out
of<00:03:57.080> here<00:03:57.230> let's<00:03:57.560> check<00:03:58.160> out<00:03:58.550> his<00:03:58.880> size<00:03:59.270> in<00:04:00.080> the

of here let's check out his size in the

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.040 
of here let's check out his size in the
habitat<00:04:01.220> if<00:04:01.610> people<00:04:02.240> would<00:04:02.450> get<00:04:02.660> out<00:04:02.840> of<00:04:02.960> the

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
habitat if people would get out of the

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:09.130 
habitat if people would get out of the
way<00:04:05.860> all<00:04:06.860> right<00:04:06.920> there<00:04:07.190> it<00:04:07.280> is<00:04:07.750> okay<00:04:08.750> so<00:04:08.840> we're

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
way all right there it is okay so we're

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.550 
way all right there it is okay so we're
gonna<00:04:09.290> okay<00:04:10.570> so<00:04:11.570> what<00:04:11.840> happens<00:04:12.230> is<00:04:12.380> you

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560

gonna okay so what happens is you
started<00:04:12.830> laughing<00:04:13.010> and<00:04:13.370> then<00:04:13.490> I<00:04:13.670> think<00:04:13.880> he

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
started laughing and then I think he

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:25.210 
started laughing and then I think he
kind<00:04:14.210> of<00:04:14.300> burns<00:04:14.750> everything<00:04:15.110> up<00:04:24.130> okay<00:04:25.130> so

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
kind of burns everything up okay so

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.700 
kind of burns everything up okay so
that's<00:04:25.520> about<00:04:25.700> it<00:04:25.910> for<00:04:26.240> his<00:04:26.360> animation<00:04:27.110> we're

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
that's about it for his animation we're

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.310 
that's about it for his animation we're
gonna<00:04:27.860> evolve<00:04:28.190> it<00:04:28.430> to<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.700> second<00:04:29.570> or<00:04:29.810> final

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
gonna evolve it to the second or final

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:45.879 
gonna evolve it to the second or final
form<00:04:30.590> rather

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.950 

I'm<00:04:46.550> just<00:04:46.999> trying<00:04:47.210> to<00:04:47.270> figure<00:04:47.449> out<00:04:47.569> what<00:04:47.780> he's

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
then a beam of light comes down or a

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.959 
then a beam of light comes down or a
beam<00:04:54.379> Allah<00:04:54.650> I<00:04:54.919> don't<00:04:55.249> know<00:04:55.310> what<00:04:55.550> comes<00:04:55.759> out

beam Allah I don't know what comes out
makes<00:04:56.240> a<00:04:56.360> circle<00:04:57.069> and<00:04:58.120> you'll<00:04:59.120> notice<00:04:59.300> the

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
makes a circle and you'll notice the

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:01.360 
makes a circle and you'll notice the

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
maybe even a year early then that is how

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.389
