00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.929
 The following situation they have provided the aging desktop ads 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:22.140

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.590
 and Doerr ice cream is no longer up here in the Tuscany Rach 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.849
 and so there is no way to get that old again 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.050
 Trash is 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.710
 Here is the original Bola reports on it giving a kick at the time of

 Many concrete comes that can not exist anymore 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.420
 So we have no way to recover the symbol 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.800
 In addition to being asked how it can produce 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.590
 and I want to show that to you now 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.719
 it is quite simple, we need it and the editor 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.620
 and now we give here in percent 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.690
 the opponents on 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.549

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:18.299
 Ride just now just have chanted set as theoretically that could be 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:19.239
 contrary 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.159
 but that's what we have now on the knock or so makes believe 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.429
 that a principle is not 

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:27.429
