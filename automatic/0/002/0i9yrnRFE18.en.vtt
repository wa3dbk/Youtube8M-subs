hey<00:00:10.950> guys<00:00:11.129> here's<00:00:11.519> another<00:00:11.820> doodle<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:12.900> made

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:13.789 
hey guys here's another doodle I made

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:17.540 
hey guys here's another doodle I made
just<00:00:14.789> sketching<00:00:15.330> out<00:00:15.750> some<00:00:16.320> grapes<00:00:16.710> using

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
just sketching out some grapes using

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.929 
just sketching out some grapes using
nothing<00:00:18.420> but<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.599> ballpoint<00:00:19.140> pen<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.939> the

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
nothing but a ballpoint pen and the

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.819 
nothing but a ballpoint pen and the
whole<00:00:21.119> thing<00:00:21.360> is<00:00:21.390> going<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.930> be<00:00:22.079> done<00:00:22.320> using

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:22.829 
whole thing is going to be done using

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.569 
whole thing is going to be done using
hatching<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.550> cross-hatching<00:00:24.680> so<00:00:25.680> first<00:00:26.250> I

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:26.579 
hatching and cross-hatching so first I

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.749 
hatching and cross-hatching so first I
laid<00:00:27.149> out<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.630> bunch<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.140> circles<00:00:29.040> for<00:00:29.640> my

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
laid out a bunch of circles for my

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.160 
laid out a bunch of circles for my
grapes<00:00:30.059> and<00:00:30.649> I<00:00:31.649> just<00:00:31.860> went<00:00:32.070> random<00:00:32.870> and<00:00:33.870> I'm

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
grapes and I just went random and I'm

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.889 
grapes and I just went random and I'm
looking<00:00:34.680> for<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> good<00:00:35.129> composition<00:00:35.750> for<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
looking for a good composition for the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.930 
looking for a good composition for the
final<00:00:37.260> result

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.150 

and<00:00:44.940> as<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.449> make<00:00:45.660> my<00:00:45.690> circles<00:00:46.410> they're<00:00:46.920> just

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
and as I make my circles they're just

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.400 
and as I make my circles they're just
really<00:00:47.339> loose<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.879> sketchy<00:00:48.239> there's<00:00:48.899> no<00:00:49.140> need

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
really loose and sketchy there's no need

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.450 
really loose and sketchy there's no need
to<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.769> perfect<00:00:50.480> with<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.649> pen<00:00:52.649> sketch<00:00:53.010> because

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
to be perfect with a pen sketch because

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.310 
to be perfect with a pen sketch because
you<00:00:54.059> will<00:00:54.269> make<00:00:54.420> some<00:00:54.659> mistakes

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
you will make some mistakes

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:11.280 
you will make some mistakes
so<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:56.699> remember<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:57.269> just<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.690> sketch

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.370 

some<00:01:11.860> of<00:01:11.980> the<00:01:12.040> lines<00:01:12.280> that<00:01:12.460> I'm<00:01:12.580> adding<00:01:12.820> here

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
some of the lines that I'm adding here

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.890 
some of the lines that I'm adding here
for<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.470> branches<00:01:14.950> of<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.190> grapes<00:01:15.720> will<00:01:16.720> be

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
for the branches of the grapes will be

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.930 
for the branches of the grapes will be
hidden<00:01:17.670> later<00:01:18.670> on<00:01:18.880> when<00:01:19.510> I<00:01:19.540> add<00:01:19.750> some<00:01:20.050> more

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
hidden later on when I add some more

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.780 
hidden later on when I add some more
hatching<00:01:21.940> in<00:01:22.180> certain<00:01:22.630> areas<00:01:23.610> but<00:01:24.610> that's

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
hatching in certain areas but that's

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.270 
hatching in certain areas but that's
okay<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:28.420> main<00:01:28.630> thing<00:01:28.870> is<00:01:29.050> for<00:01:29.080> of<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:29.650> sketch

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
okay the main thing is for of a sketch

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.590 
okay the main thing is for of a sketch
to<00:01:30.690> look<00:01:31.690> like<00:01:31.930> it's<00:01:32.260> a<00:01:32.410> bunch<00:01:32.620> of<00:01:32.710> grapes

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
to look like it's a bunch of grapes

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.030 
to look like it's a bunch of grapes
hanging<00:01:34.600> off<00:01:34.840> of<00:01:34.870> a<00:01:35.110> small<00:01:35.350> branch<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.740> here

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
hanging off of a small branch and here

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.890 
hanging off of a small branch and here
I'm<00:01:39.250> using<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.730> single<00:01:40.000> hatching<00:01:40.330> technique<00:01:40.480> to

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
I'm using a single hatching technique to

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.840 
I'm using a single hatching technique to
lay<00:01:41.050> down<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:42.330> shadow<00:01:43.330> of<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.930> background<00:01:44.850> so

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
lay down the shadow of the background so

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.790 
lay down the shadow of the background so
it's<00:01:46.000> a<00:01:46.060> flat<00:01:46.270> surface<00:01:46.510> that<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:47.230> grapes<00:01:47.560> are

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
it's a flat surface that the grapes are

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:55.200 
it's a flat surface that the grapes are
sitting<00:01:48.190> on<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:54.310> notice<00:01:54.580> I'm<00:01:54.700> going<00:01:54.850> in<00:01:55.060> one

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
sitting on and notice I'm going in one

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.840 
sitting on and notice I'm going in one
direction<00:01:55.360> with<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.170> hatching<00:01:57.130> lines<00:01:59.850> you

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
direction with the hatching lines you

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.820 
direction with the hatching lines you
always<00:02:01.090> want<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.300> start<00:02:01.570> your<00:02:01.720> any<00:02:02.470> cross

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
always want to start your any cross

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.250 
always want to start your any cross
hatching<00:02:03.310> with<00:02:03.340> single<00:02:03.850> hatching<00:02:04.300> in<00:02:04.480> the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
hatching with single hatching in the

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.240 
hatching with single hatching in the
same<00:02:05.530> direction<00:02:05.740> don't<00:02:06.370> go<00:02:06.700> round<00:02:06.940> them<00:02:07.210> yet

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
same direction don't go round them yet

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.570 
same direction don't go round them yet
so<00:02:09.250> here<00:02:09.730> I'm<00:02:10.660> adding<00:02:11.170> more<00:02:11.920> hatching<00:02:12.400> lines

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
so here I'm adding more hatching lines

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:21.910 
so here I'm adding more hatching lines
to<00:02:12.970> every<00:02:13.420> single<00:02:13.690> one<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.140> grapes

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.590 

now<00:02:22.520> I'm<00:02:22.580> starting<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:22.970> add<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.270> little<00:02:23.420> bit

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
now I'm starting to add a little bit

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.060 
now I'm starting to add a little bit
across<00:02:23.810> hatching<00:02:24.380> by<00:02:24.500> changing<00:02:24.950> the

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
across hatching by changing the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.250 
across hatching by changing the
direction<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:27.380> same<00:02:27.950> thing<00:02:27.980> with<00:02:28.190> the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
direction and same thing with the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:37.150 
direction and same thing with the
surface<00:02:30.260> background<00:02:35.830> now<00:02:36.830> I<00:02:36.860> want<00:02:37.040> the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
surface background now I want the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.000 
surface background now I want the
background<00:02:37.460> of<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.330> surface<00:02:39.290> to<00:02:39.440> be<00:02:39.590> darker

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
background of the surface to be darker

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.460 
background of the surface to be darker
than<00:02:40.040> that<00:02:40.220> grapes<00:02:40.670> themselves<00:02:41.360> so<00:02:41.600> I'm<00:02:42.290> going

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
than that grapes themselves so I'm going

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.440 
than that grapes themselves so I'm going
to<00:02:42.530> work<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.890> lot<00:02:43.070> on<00:02:43.340> adding<00:02:43.610> more<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.360> more

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
to work a lot on adding more and more

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.699 
to work a lot on adding more and more
hatching<00:02:45.260> lines<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:48.140> background

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
hatching lines to the the background

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.050 
hatching lines to the the background
behind<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.370> grapes<00:02:51.459> right<00:02:52.459> here<00:02:52.670> I<00:02:52.700> want<00:02:52.940> to

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
behind the grapes right here I want to

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.340 
behind the grapes right here I want to
have<00:02:53.240> you<00:02:53.360> on<00:02:53.390> that<00:02:53.570> one<00:02:53.600> grapes<00:02:53.959> I'm<00:02:54.170> going<00:02:54.290> to

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
have you on that one grapes I'm going to

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.580 
have you on that one grapes I'm going to
add<00:02:54.470> another<00:02:54.620> grape<00:02:55.070> and<00:02:56.020> just<00:02:57.020> trying<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:57.380> fix

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
add another grape and just trying to fix

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:07.910 
add another grape and just trying to fix
the<00:02:57.740> little<00:02:57.890> mistake<00:02:58.250> it's<00:02:58.850> no<00:02:59.000> biggie

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.920 

making<00:03:08.640> my<00:03:08.760> branches<00:03:09.240> a<00:03:09.270> little<00:03:09.480> bit<00:03:09.600> darker

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
making my branches a little bit darker

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.130 
making my branches a little bit darker
by<00:03:10.110> creating<00:03:10.710> a<00:03:10.830> strong<00:03:11.390> shadow<00:03:12.390> on<00:03:13.050> the

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
by creating a strong shadow on the

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.480 
by creating a strong shadow on the
bottom<00:03:13.520> and<00:03:14.810> here<00:03:15.810> I'm<00:03:15.900> adding<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.560> deeper<00:03:17.250> tone

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
bottom and here I'm adding a deeper tone

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.780 
bottom and here I'm adding a deeper tone
to<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:18.800> background<00:03:19.800> surface<00:03:22.790> so

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
to the background surface so

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.940 
to the background surface so
cross-hatching<00:03:24.270> is<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.600> lot<00:03:25.140> of<00:03:25.290> fun<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:25.800> can

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
cross-hatching is a lot of fun you can

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.840 
cross-hatching is a lot of fun you can
really<00:03:26.870> use<00:03:27.870> this<00:03:28.080> technique<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:30.560> render<00:03:31.560> any

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
really use this technique to render any

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.130 
really use this technique to render any
drawings<00:03:32.850> whether<00:03:33.090> it's<00:03:33.330> in<00:03:33.510> pen<00:03:33.840> or<00:03:34.080> in

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
drawings whether it's in pen or in

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.690 
drawings whether it's in pen or in
pencil<00:03:35.030> of<00:03:36.030> course<00:03:36.090> with<00:03:36.600> pan<00:03:36.959> it's<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:38.400> little

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
pencil of course with pan it's a little

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.660 
pencil of course with pan it's a little
bit<00:03:38.820> harder<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.150> erase<00:03:39.450> so<00:03:40.020> you<00:03:40.860> lay<00:03:41.130> down<00:03:41.160> your

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
bit harder to erase so you lay down your

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.870 
bit harder to erase so you lay down your
strokes<00:03:42.209> that's<00:03:43.080> where<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.830> final<00:03:44.370> is<00:03:44.580> going

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
strokes that's where the final is going

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:52.010 
strokes that's where the final is going
to<00:03:45.000> be

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.270 

but<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.680> point<00:03:52.980> is<00:03:53.160> when<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.240> do<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:55.280> pen

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
but the point is when you do a pen

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.710 
but the point is when you do a pen
doodle<00:03:56.580> with<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:57.060> ballpoint<00:03:58.020> pen<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:59.720> you

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
doodle with the ballpoint pen and you

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.480 
doodle with the ballpoint pen and you
end<00:04:00.930> up<00:04:01.110> coming<00:04:01.530> up<00:04:01.620> with<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:01.860> really<00:04:02.160> good

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
end up coming up with a really good

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.870 
end up coming up with a really good
sketch<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.270> whole<00:04:03.420> thing<00:04:03.600> is<00:04:03.720> in<00:04:03.870> pen<00:04:04.880> you

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
sketch and the whole thing is in pen you

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.030 
sketch and the whole thing is in pen you
feel<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.270> sense<00:04:06.480> of<00:04:06.600> accomplishment<00:04:06.900> it's<00:04:07.860> a

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
feel the sense of accomplishment it's a

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.470 
feel the sense of accomplishment it's a
really<00:04:08.340> cool<00:04:08.520> thing<00:04:08.580> to<00:04:08.910> do<00:04:10.130> and<00:04:11.130> you<00:04:11.240> also<00:04:12.240> get

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
really cool thing to do and you also get

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.050 
really cool thing to do and you also get
to<00:04:12.540> practice<00:04:12.840> more<00:04:13.470> on<00:04:13.880> controlling<00:04:14.880> your

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
to practice more on controlling your

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.250 
to practice more on controlling your
cross<00:04:15.420> hatching<00:04:17.120> so<00:04:18.120> it's<00:04:18.270> a<00:04:18.360> bunch<00:04:18.570> of<00:04:18.720> layers

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
cross hatching so it's a bunch of layers

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.240 
cross hatching so it's a bunch of layers
on<00:04:19.739> top<00:04:19.799> of<00:04:19.980> layers<00:04:20.270> it's<00:04:21.270> also<00:04:21.860> intensity<00:04:22.860> how

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
on top of layers it's also intensity how

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.740 
on top of layers it's also intensity how
much<00:04:23.880> pressure<00:04:25.130> you<00:04:26.130> use<00:04:27.680> for<00:04:28.680> your<00:04:28.800> strokes

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
much pressure you use for your strokes

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.270 
much pressure you use for your strokes
so<00:04:30.750> for<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:30.990> light<00:04:31.200> hatching<00:04:31.680> that<00:04:31.980> I'm<00:04:32.070> doing

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
so for the light hatching that I'm doing

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.600 
so for the light hatching that I'm doing
right<00:04:32.430> now<00:04:32.490> I'm<00:04:32.970> going<00:04:33.360> really<00:04:33.780> light<00:04:33.990> and

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
right now I'm going really light and

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.070 
right now I'm going really light and
changing<00:04:35.610> direction<00:04:35.760> following<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.810> curve

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
changing direction following the curve

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.830 
changing direction following the curve
of<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.530> grape<00:04:39.530> so<00:04:40.530> I'm<00:04:40.620> trying<00:04:40.920> to<00:04:41.840> create

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
of the grape so I'm trying to create

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.090 
of the grape so I'm trying to create
that<00:04:43.490> look<00:04:44.490> of<00:04:44.670> a<00:04:44.760> sphere<00:04:45.240> and<00:04:45.620> notice<00:04:46.620> how<00:04:46.770> I'm

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
that look of a sphere and notice how I'm

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.250 
that look of a sphere and notice how I'm
not<00:04:47.310> sketching<00:04:48.240> where<00:04:48.420> the<00:04:48.600> highlights<00:04:49.050> are

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
not sketching where the highlights are

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.840 
not sketching where the highlights are
I'm<00:04:49.590> just<00:04:49.650> leaving<00:04:49.980> that<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.370> color<00:04:50.610> of<00:04:50.730> the

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
I'm just leaving that the color of the

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.910 
I'm just leaving that the color of the
paper<00:04:51.030> which<00:04:51.330> is<00:04:51.450> white<00:04:52.100> so<00:04:54.710> you're<00:04:55.710> just

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
paper which is white so you're just

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.310 
paper which is white so you're just
working<00:04:56.040> with<00:04:56.340> your<00:04:56.370> shadows<00:04:56.970> and<00:04:57.390> you're

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
working with your shadows and you're

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.650 
working with your shadows and you're
also<00:04:58.500> trying<00:04:58.890> to<00:04:59.010> make<00:04:59.250> sure<00:04:59.460> that<00:04:59.760> you<00:05:00.480> know

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
also trying to make sure that you know

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.240 
also trying to make sure that you know
where<00:05:00.870> your<00:05:01.020> highlights<00:05:01.560> are<00:05:01.710> going<00:05:01.950> to<00:05:02.070> be

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
where your highlights are going to be

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.030 
where your highlights are going to be
and<00:05:02.580> you<00:05:02.820> just<00:05:02.850> simply<00:05:03.240> don't<00:05:03.600> do<00:05:04.470> any<00:05:04.710> lines

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
and you just simply don't do any lines

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.290 
and you just simply don't do any lines
over<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.580> highlights<00:05:05.970> with<00:05:06.240> pen<00:05:08.060> if<00:05:09.060> or

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
over the highlights with pen if or

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.390 
over the highlights with pen if or
pencil<00:05:09.780> you<00:05:10.170> can<00:05:10.350> go<00:05:10.500> back<00:05:10.680> and<00:05:10.830> erase<00:05:11.070> them

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
pencil you can go back and erase them

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.210 
pencil you can go back and erase them
and<00:05:11.430> get<00:05:11.940> your<00:05:12.060> highlights<00:05:12.480> back<00:05:13.040> but<00:05:14.040> with

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
and get your highlights back but with

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:34.080 
and get your highlights back but with
pen<00:05:14.550> you<00:05:15.060> kind<00:05:15.330> of<00:05:15.390> have<00:05:15.570> to<00:05:15.980> plan<00:05:16.980> it<00:05:17.190> out

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.360 

so<00:05:34.690> I'm<00:05:34.930> just<00:05:35.169> adding<00:05:35.350> some<00:05:35.650> more<00:05:35.770> details<00:05:36.190> to

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
so I'm just adding some more details to

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.540 
so I'm just adding some more details to
the<00:05:36.400> grapes<00:05:36.820> and<00:05:37.150> I'm<00:05:37.419> making<00:05:37.570> the<00:05:38.550> background

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
the grapes and I'm making the background

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.650 
the grapes and I'm making the background
a<00:05:40.240> lot<00:05:40.630> darker<00:05:40.900> now<00:05:42.000> I'm<00:05:43.000> almost<00:05:43.210> trying<00:05:43.480> to

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
a lot darker now I'm almost trying to

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.360 
a lot darker now I'm almost trying to
get<00:05:43.840> it<00:05:43.960> to<00:05:44.110> be<00:05:45.270> black<00:05:46.270> so<00:05:46.830> the<00:05:47.830> way<00:05:47.950> to<00:05:48.010> do<00:05:48.220> that

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
get it to be black so the way to do that

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.980 
get it to be black so the way to do that
just<00:05:48.669> to<00:05:48.790> keep<00:05:48.970> adding<00:05:49.330> layers<00:05:49.480> on<00:05:49.810> top<00:05:49.840> of

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
just to keep adding layers on top of

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
just to keep adding layers on top of
layers<00:05:51.389> we<00:05:52.389> also<00:05:52.540> want<00:05:52.810> to<00:05:52.900> fade<00:05:53.139> out<00:05:53.169> or<00:05:53.590> blend

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
layers we also want to fade out or blend

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.659 
layers we also want to fade out or blend
your<00:05:54.820> shadows<00:05:55.389> and<00:05:55.780> keep<00:05:56.620> that<00:05:56.830> shadow<00:05:57.160> effect

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
your shadows and keep that shadow effect

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:05.730 
your shadows and keep that shadow effect
kind<00:05:58.090> of<00:05:58.210> soft<00:06:04.080> so<00:06:05.080> I'm<00:06:05.230> pretty<00:06:05.410> much<00:06:05.530> just

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
kind of soft so I'm pretty much just

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.340 
kind of soft so I'm pretty much just
about<00:06:06.160> finished<00:06:06.580> with<00:06:06.639> this<00:06:06.880> sketch<00:06:07.350> the

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
about finished with this sketch the

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.980 
about finished with this sketch the
video<00:06:08.650> was<00:06:08.889> sped<00:06:09.490> up<00:06:09.639> two<00:06:10.300> times<00:06:10.510> and<00:06:10.870> three

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
video was sped up two times and three

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:17.070 
video was sped up two times and three
times<00:06:11.200> just<00:06:11.770> to<00:06:13.290> for<00:06:14.290> the<00:06:14.350> time<00:06:14.590> factor<00:06:16.080> but

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
times just to for the time factor but

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.110
