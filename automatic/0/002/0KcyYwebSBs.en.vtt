00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.870 
barcodes and put it right into my phone
into<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.990> apps<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.009> tell<00:01:38.250> me<00:01:38.400> if

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
still rocking the PDA got a PDA here

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.460 
still rocking the PDA got a PDA here
this<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:31.030> use<00:02:31.630> this<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.990> old-school

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
this is use this the old-school

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.890 
this is use this the old-school
technology<00:02:32.880> that's<00:02:33.880> used<00:02:34.000> with<00:02:34.330> some<00:02:34.510> of<00:02:34.720> the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
technology that's used with some of the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.960 
technology that's used with some of the
apps<00:02:35.170> they're<00:02:35.680> not<00:02:35.830> really<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.070> guess<00:02:36.250> software

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
apps they're not really I guess software

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.090 
apps they're not really I guess software
I<00:02:37.270> guess<00:02:37.660> would<00:02:37.780> be<00:02:37.840> an<00:02:37.990> app<00:02:38.110> for<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.410> but<00:02:38.620> you

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
I guess would be an app for it but you

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.700 
I guess would be an app for it but you
download<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.670> database<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:41.050> PDA<00:02:41.380> and

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
download the database to the PDA and

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.520 
download the database to the PDA and
then<00:02:42.460> you<00:02:42.730> can<00:02:42.940> use<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.630> this<00:02:43.720> as<00:02:43.900> a<00:02:43.930> scanner<00:02:44.290> on

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
then you can use it this as a scanner on

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.650 
then you can use it this as a scanner on
the<00:02:44.650> end<00:02:44.800> here<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.250> don't<00:02:46.000> use<00:02:46.300> this<00:02:46.420> anymore

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
the end here I don't use this anymore

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.830 
the end here I don't use this anymore
because<00:02:46.930> now<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:48.250> use<00:02:48.640> needle<00:02:49.060> Pricer<00:02:49.420> which

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
because now I use needle Pricer which

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.810 
because now I use needle Pricer which
does<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.440> on<00:02:50.590> my<00:02:50.740> phone

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820
