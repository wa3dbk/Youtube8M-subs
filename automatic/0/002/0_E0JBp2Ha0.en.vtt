thick roof on top now you can do one

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.389 
thick roof on top now you can do one
thick<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.480> having<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.340> one-sixth<00:00:47.340> of

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
thick but having it to one-sixth of

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.950 
thick but having it to one-sixth of
water<00:00:47.640> will<00:00:47.850> seep<00:00:48.030> through<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.539> you'll<00:00:48.719> get

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
water will seep through so you'll get

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.150 
water will seep through so you'll get
that<00:00:49.170> drippy<00:00:49.920> water<00:00:50.160> look<00:00:50.780> which<00:00:51.780> hmm<00:00:52.379> it

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
you don't need to place these if you're

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.950 
you don't need to place these if you're
just<00:01:14.820> going<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.060> remember<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.540> more<00:01:15.750> if<00:01:15.810> they

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
just going to remember the more if they

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.260 
just going to remember the more if they
all<00:01:16.080> do<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.409> same<00:01:16.439> thing<00:01:16.939> then<00:01:17.939> what<00:01:18.150> you're

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
all do the same thing then what you're

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.820 
all do the same thing then what you're
going<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.450> do<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.840> lining<00:01:19.470> up<00:01:19.590> with<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
going to do is lining up with the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.830 
going to do is lining up with the
buttons<00:01:20.220> put<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.700> redstone<00:01:20.909> torch<00:01:21.119> at<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.659> back

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
buttons put a redstone torch at the back

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.190 
buttons put a redstone torch at the back
now<00:01:22.400> having<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.430> different<00:01:24.020> materials<00:01:25.020> here

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
now having the different materials here

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.289 
now having the different materials here
actually<00:01:25.439> makes<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> lot<00:01:26.220> easier<00:01:26.400> because

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
actually makes that a lot easier because

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.319 
actually makes that a lot easier because
I<00:01:27.540> just<00:01:27.600> find<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.080> three<00:01:28.290> scented<00:01:28.680> ones<00:01:29.329> now

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329

line<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.229> blocks<00:01:37.439> above<00:01:37.590> every<00:01:38.040> torch<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.640> if

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
line of blocks above every torch so if

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.760 
line of blocks above every torch so if
you<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> fourth<00:01:40.049> torture<00:01:40.470> which<00:01:40.650> I'll

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
you have a fourth torture which I'll

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.130 
you have a fourth torture which I'll
teach<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.070> how<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.250> add<00:01:41.720> you<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.960> obviously

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
teach you how to add you can obviously

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.130 
teach you how to add you can obviously
do<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.710> too<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.149> do<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.930> put<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
do that too so you do that you put the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.660 
do that too so you do that you put the
blocks<00:01:46.409> above<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.920> then<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.250> top<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.520> those

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
blocks above and then on top of those

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.010 
blocks above and then on top of those
blocks<00:01:48.060> you're<00:01:48.210> going<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.390> put<00:01:48.540> more<00:01:48.689> torches

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
blocks you're going to put more torches

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.410 
blocks you're going to put more torches
and<00:01:49.409> they<00:01:50.250> should<00:01:50.460> turn<00:01:50.670> off<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.060> if<00:01:51.240> they

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
and they should turn off and if they

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.359 
and they should turn off and if they
don't<00:01:51.600> you're<00:01:51.899> obviously<00:01:52.229> using<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.920> blocks

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
don't you're obviously using a blocks

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.859 
don't you're obviously using a blocks
that<00:01:53.520> will<00:01:53.670> not<00:01:53.790> let<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.119> power<00:01:54.270> goes<00:01:54.570> through

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
that will not let the power goes through

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.859 
that will not let the power goes through
now<00:01:55.619> we're<00:01:55.950> going<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.130> go<00:01:56.219> time<00:01:56.579> set<00:01:56.850> day<00:01:57.060> set

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
now we're going to go time set day set

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.679 
now we're going to go time set day set
zero<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.759> then<00:01:59.759> we<00:01:59.969> are<00:02:00.090> going<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.270> put<00:02:00.420> blocks

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
zero and then we are going to put blocks

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.450 
zero and then we are going to put blocks
on<00:02:00.990> top<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.560> torches<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.159> are<00:02:02.310> turned

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
on top of the torches that are turned

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.020 
on top of the torches that are turned
off<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.530> so<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.649> very<00:02:04.799> simple<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.399> on

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
off like so so it's very simple and on

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.580 
off like so so it's very simple and on
top<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.329> these<00:02:06.570> boxes<00:02:07.049> where<00:02:07.229> we're<00:02:07.380> going<00:02:07.530> to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
top of these boxes where we're going to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.440 
top of these boxes where we're going to
put<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.829> dispensers<00:02:08.399> now<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.300> face

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
put the dispensers now you have to face

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.470 
put the dispensers now you have to face
them<00:02:09.660> into<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.080> middle<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.709> so

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
them into the middle like so

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.449

and there you go now they're all going
to<00:02:14.550> shoot<00:02:14.760> into<00:02:14.909> the<00:02:15.120> middle<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:15.510> now<00:02:15.720> we<00:02:15.780> need

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
to shoot into the middle so now we need

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.110 
to shoot into the middle so now we need
to<00:02:16.140> mark<00:02:16.349> out<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.590> hole<00:02:16.920> now<00:02:17.489> if<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.879> want<00:02:18.060> to

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
to mark out the hole now if you want to

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.509 
to mark out the hole now if you want to
have<00:02:18.269> additional<00:02:18.930> buttons<00:02:19.140> here<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:20.190> need<00:02:20.370> to

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
have additional buttons here you need to

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.699 
have additional buttons here you need to
do<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.790> whole<00:02:21.000> further<00:02:21.480> back<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:21.810> here<00:02:22.530> if

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
do the whole further back so here if

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.160 
do the whole further back so here if
you're<00:02:23.129> only<00:02:23.280> going<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.519> have<00:02:23.670> three<00:02:24.090> put<00:02:25.019> the

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
of each and then I think I'll modify

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.210 
of each and then I think I'll modify
this<00:02:29.640> one<00:02:30.000> with<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.330> one<00:02:30.540> back<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.200> yeah<00:02:31.530> so

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
this one with the one back so yeah so

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.309 
this one with the one back so yeah so
once<00:02:32.670> our<00:02:32.879> holes<00:02:33.090> they're<00:02:33.360> marked<00:02:33.780> out<00:02:33.989> you

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
once our holes they're marked out you

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.410 
once our holes they're marked out you
need<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.530> put<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:35.010> block<00:02:35.340> behind<00:02:35.549> the<00:02:35.970> hole<00:02:36.150> and

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
need to put a block behind the hole and

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.569 
need to put a block behind the hole and
we'll<00:02:37.349> actually<00:02:37.590> just<00:02:37.950> do<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:38.099> full<00:02:38.370> line

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
we'll actually just do a full line

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.130 
we'll actually just do a full line
straight<00:02:38.910> away<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.360> then<00:02:39.569> on<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.930> block

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
straight away and then on the block

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.899 
straight away and then on the block
behind<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.650> hole<00:02:40.799> you<00:02:41.010> put<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.220> sign<00:02:41.489> this<00:02:41.730> will

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
behind the hole you put a sign this will

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.720 
behind the hole you put a sign this will
stop<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.150> water<00:02:42.480> from<00:02:42.569> going<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:43.459> now<00:02:44.459> around

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
stop the water from going in now around

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.449 
stop the water from going in now around
the<00:02:44.879> edges<00:02:45.060> where<00:02:45.390> there<00:02:45.660> is<00:02:45.810> armed<00:02:46.459> gaps

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
the edges where there is armed gaps

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.180 
the edges where there is armed gaps
obviously<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.090> want<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.360> put<00:02:48.650> blocks<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.950> stop

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
obviously you want to put blocks to stop

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.610 
obviously you want to put blocks to stop
the<00:02:50.310> water<00:02:50.519> from<00:02:50.579> leaking<00:02:50.849> off<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:52.019> like<00:02:52.319> so

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
the water from leaking off so like so

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.949 
the water from leaking off so like so
I'll<00:02:53.220> get<00:02:53.549> a<00:02:53.579> step<00:02:54.030> back<00:02:54.239> look<00:02:54.450> at<00:02:54.569> this<00:02:54.690> in<00:02:54.870> a

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
I'll get a step back look at this in a

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.780 
I'll get a step back look at this in a
second<00:02:55.290> for<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.500> guys<00:02:55.650> there<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.040> go<00:02:56.220> so

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
second for you guys there you go so

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.550 
second for you guys there you go so
basically<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.420> waters<00:02:57.750> got<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:57.959> little<00:02:58.200> tray

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
basically the waters got a little tray

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.009 
basically the waters got a little tray
there<00:02:58.920> now<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.970> need<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.150> put<00:03:00.359> water<00:03:00.510> in<00:03:00.750> each

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
there now you need to put water in each

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.770 
there now you need to put water in each
corner<00:03:01.290> so<00:03:01.739> here<00:03:02.129> and<00:03:02.310> here<00:03:02.480> but<00:03:03.480> not<00:03:03.660> the

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
corner so here and here but not the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.240 
corner so here and here but not the
corners<00:03:04.140> on<00:03:04.349> the<00:03:04.470> side<00:03:04.709> where<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.069> hole<00:03:05.220> is

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
corners on the side where the hole is

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.089 
corners on the side where the hole is
now<00:03:05.700> all<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.269> water<00:03:06.540> should<00:03:06.989> take<00:03:07.500> every<00:03:07.890> item

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
now all the water should take every item

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.369 
now all the water should take every item
that<00:03:08.250> gets<00:03:08.459> shot<00:03:08.760> into<00:03:08.940> here<00:03:09.239> into<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:10.140> hole

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
that gets shot into here into that hole

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.130 
that gets shot into here into that hole
and<00:03:10.620> yeah<00:03:11.609> that<00:03:12.060> works<00:03:12.239> quite<00:03:12.510> simple<00:03:12.900> now

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
and yeah that works quite simple now

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.530 
and yeah that works quite simple now
what<00:03:13.349> you<00:03:13.440> need<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.739> do<00:03:13.859> is<00:03:14.069> fill<00:03:14.340> up<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.730> foods

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
what you need to do is fill up the foods

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.599 
what you need to do is fill up the foods
that<00:03:15.720> you've<00:03:15.959> done<00:03:16.230> so<00:03:16.919> there<00:03:17.160> we<00:03:17.250> go<00:03:17.280> there's

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
that you've done so there we go there's

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.360 
that you've done so there we go there's
our<00:03:17.760> two<00:03:17.940> foods<00:03:18.239> a<00:03:18.989> little<00:03:19.650> addition<00:03:20.069> I<00:03:20.160> like

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
our two foods a little addition I like

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.009 
our two foods a little addition I like
to<00:03:20.519> add<00:03:20.579> is<00:03:20.609> putting<00:03:21.269> a<00:03:21.389> roof<00:03:21.569> above<00:03:21.840> it

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
to add is putting a roof above it

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.809 
to add is putting a roof above it
because<00:03:22.380> then<00:03:22.680> when<00:03:22.980> you<00:03:23.069> look<00:03:23.280> up<00:03:23.489> through

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
because then when you look up through

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.629 
because then when you look up through
the<00:03:23.970> hole<00:03:24.090> like<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.810> design<00:03:25.410> over<00:03:25.739> here<00:03:25.980> you

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
the hole like this design over here you

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.020 
the hole like this design over here you
can't<00:03:26.880> actually<00:03:27.060> see<00:03:27.480> out<00:03:28.549> you<00:03:29.549> see<00:03:29.730> wood<00:03:29.970> and

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
can't actually see out you see wood and

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.509 
can't actually see out you see wood and
I<00:03:30.329> think<00:03:30.569> that<00:03:30.690> looks<00:03:30.840> quite<00:03:31.109> presentable

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
I think that looks quite presentable

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.190 
I think that looks quite presentable
other<00:03:32.519> than<00:03:32.880> like<00:03:33.120> if<00:03:33.329> yeah<00:03:33.480> if<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:33.840> just<00:03:33.870> had

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
other than like if yeah if you just had

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.930 
other than like if yeah if you just had
a<00:03:34.230> hole<00:03:34.530> there<00:03:34.859> I<00:03:35.099> don't<00:03:35.549> know<00:03:35.609> wouldn't<00:03:35.819> look

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
a hole there I don't know wouldn't look

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.000 
a hole there I don't know wouldn't look
as<00:03:36.090> good<00:03:36.239> another<00:03:36.930> thing<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.349> like<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.590> do<00:03:37.829> is

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
as good another thing I like to do is

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.550 
as good another thing I like to do is
putting<00:03:38.609> a<00:03:38.790> ladder<00:03:39.120> all<00:03:39.389> I<00:03:39.569> would<00:03:39.870> like<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.290> do

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
putting a ladder all I would like to do

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.110 
putting a ladder all I would like to do
if<00:03:40.799> I<00:03:40.919> built<00:03:41.190> this<00:03:41.280> in<00:03:41.459> my<00:03:41.609> world<00:03:41.819> which<00:03:41.970> I

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
if I built this in my world which I

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.120 
if I built this in my world which I
probably<00:03:42.329> will<00:03:42.599> to<00:03:42.870> be<00:03:42.989> honest<00:03:43.260> my<00:03:43.799> deal<00:03:43.980> was

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
probably will to be honest my deal was

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.440 
probably will to be honest my deal was
something<00:03:44.430> different<00:03:44.549> other<00:03:44.880> than<00:03:45.030> food

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
something different other than food

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.259 
something different other than food
because<00:03:45.930> um<00:03:46.260> I'd<00:03:46.799> like<00:03:46.859> multiple<00:03:47.700> food<00:03:47.940> so<00:03:48.239> I

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
because um I'd like multiple food so I

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.300 
because um I'd like multiple food so I
might<00:03:48.510> do<00:03:48.720> or<00:03:49.019> I<00:03:49.049> could<00:03:49.470> maybe<00:03:49.650> connect<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.160> to

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
might do or I could maybe connect it to

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.280 
might do or I could maybe connect it to
like<00:03:50.730> something<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.239> shoot<00:03:51.419> out<00:03:51.630> like<00:03:51.690> 10<00:03:52.049> or

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
like something to shoot out like 10 or

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.379 
like something to shoot out like 10 or
something<00:03:52.650> i'll<00:03:52.950> be<00:03:53.310> at<00:03:53.340> putting<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.970> ladder<00:03:54.180> at

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
something i'll be at putting a ladder at

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:55.849 
something i'll be at putting a ladder at
the<00:03:54.480> back<00:03:54.630> because<00:03:55.049> if<00:03:55.290> you're<00:03:55.410> making<00:03:55.739> this

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
the back because if you're making this

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.110 
the back because if you're making this
you're<00:03:56.069> probably<00:03:56.160> going<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.489> be<00:03:56.609> making<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:57.030> in

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
you're probably going to be making it in

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.569 
you're probably going to be making it in
a<00:03:57.209> legit<00:03:57.569> world<00:03:57.780> where<00:03:58.079> you<00:03:58.169> need<00:03:58.349> food<00:03:58.620> so

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
a legit world where you need food so

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.039 
a legit world where you need food so
having<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.940> ladder<00:04:00.120> at<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.389> back<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:00.750> can<00:04:00.780> go

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
having a ladder at the back you can go

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.530 
having a ladder at the back you can go
through<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.319> access<00:04:01.709> them<00:04:01.889> all<00:04:02.389> so<00:04:03.389> that's

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
through and access them all so that's

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.180 
through and access them all so that's
pretty<00:04:03.780> good<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.169> there<00:04:04.470> we<00:04:04.530> go<00:04:04.560> that's<00:04:04.889> all

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
pretty good and there we go that's all

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.400 
pretty good and there we go that's all
we<00:04:05.400> really<00:04:05.430> need<00:04:05.849> to<00:04:05.879> do<00:04:06.090> now<00:04:06.359> whenever<00:04:07.260> we

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
we really need to do now whenever we

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.900 
we really need to do now whenever we
push<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.769> button<00:04:08.010> with<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.220> signs<00:04:08.579> because

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
push the button with the signs because

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.569 
push the button with the signs because
the<00:04:09.239> other<00:04:09.389> ones<00:04:09.540> don't<00:04:09.720> actually<00:04:10.049> have<00:04:10.199> it

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
the other ones don't actually have it

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.309 
the other ones don't actually have it
that's<00:04:11.579> one<00:04:11.940> little<00:04:12.329> improvement<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:12.959> jevon

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
that's one little improvement that jevon

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.990 
that's one little improvement that jevon
mentioned<00:04:13.829> he<00:04:13.980> would<00:04:14.129> like<00:04:14.310> is<00:04:14.519> to<00:04:14.549> have<00:04:14.699> is

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
mentioned he would like is to have is

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.789 
mentioned he would like is to have is
the<00:04:15.150> food<00:04:15.359> getting<00:04:15.629> to<00:04:15.959> him<00:04:16.139> faster<00:04:16.620> and

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
the food getting to him faster and

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.920 
the food getting to him faster and
because<00:04:17.489> in<00:04:17.729> this<00:04:17.880> design<00:04:18.239> it<00:04:18.419> has<00:04:18.539> to<00:04:18.720> travel

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
because in this design it has to travel

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.890 
because in this design it has to travel
less<00:04:19.169> distance<00:04:19.680> it's<00:04:20.039> a<00:04:20.299> bit<00:04:21.299> more<00:04:21.450> efficient

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
less distance it's a bit more efficient

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.440 
less distance it's a bit more efficient
now<00:04:22.860> what<00:04:23.099> we'll<00:04:23.280> do<00:04:23.460> is<00:04:23.700> I'll<00:04:23.880> teach<00:04:24.120> you<00:04:24.300> guys

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
now what we'll do is I'll teach you guys

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.280 
now what we'll do is I'll teach you guys
how<00:04:24.510> to<00:04:24.750> make

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
how to make

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.070 
how to make
the<00:04:25.910> version<00:04:26.910> where<00:04:27.300> you<00:04:27.450> can<00:04:27.600> have<00:04:27.780> multiple

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
the version where you can have multiple

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.780 
the version where you can have multiple
areas<00:04:28.950> for<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:30.920> food<00:04:31.920> basically<00:04:32.370> so<00:04:32.580> you<00:04:32.670> can

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
areas for the food basically so you can

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.640 
areas for the food basically so you can
have<00:04:32.880> more<00:04:33.030> than<00:04:33.180> three<00:04:33.420> on<00:04:33.540> each<00:04:33.690> column<00:04:34.050> so

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
have more than three on each column so

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.900 
have more than three on each column so
what<00:04:34.890> you<00:04:34.980> need<00:04:35.130> to<00:04:35.220> do<00:04:35.310> is<00:04:35.430> get<00:04:35.580> rid<00:04:35.640> of<00:04:35.790> your

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
what you need to do is get rid of your

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.790 
what you need to do is get rid of your
water<00:04:36.120> if<00:04:36.300> you've<00:04:36.510> already<00:04:37.050> built<00:04:37.170> it<00:04:37.380> and<00:04:37.560> you

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
water if you've already built it and you

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.640 
water if you've already built it and you
are<00:04:38.160> wanting<00:04:38.640> to<00:04:38.760> add<00:04:38.850> more<00:04:39.170> and<00:04:40.170> you<00:04:40.410> want<00:04:40.560> to

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
are wanting to add more and you want to

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.310 
are wanting to add more and you want to
bring<00:04:40.800> this<00:04:40.920> area<00:04:41.310> back<00:04:41.550> one<00:04:41.820> so<00:04:42.240> do<00:04:43.020> it<00:04:43.170> like

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
bring this area back one so do it like

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.010 
bring this area back one so do it like

but if you want them here here or here
here<00:05:06.290> yeah<00:05:07.290> you<00:05:07.590> don't<00:05:08.070> really<00:05:08.250> have<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:08.520> bring

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790

here yeah you don't really have to bring
the<00:05:08.940> wall<00:05:09.090> back<00:05:09.270> anyway<00:05:10.140> so<00:05:10.200> now<00:05:10.770> what<00:05:10.950> you<00:05:11.040> can

do is replace your water and it's quite
simple<00:05:13.680> you<00:05:13.830> just<00:05:13.920> add<00:05:14.280> the<00:05:14.910> areas<00:05:15.330> where<00:05:15.480> you

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
simple you just add the areas where you

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.280 
simple you just add the areas where you
wanted<00:05:15.900> it<00:05:15.990> so<00:05:16.290> we'll<00:05:17.190> go<00:05:17.940> how<00:05:18.870> should<00:05:19.020> we<00:05:19.140> do

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
wanted it so we'll go how should we do

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.320 
wanted it so we'll go how should we do
we'll<00:05:19.560> add<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:20.040> torch<00:05:20.250> behind<00:05:20.640> the<00:05:20.820> button<00:05:21.150> so

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
we'll add the torch behind the button so

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.240 
we'll add the torch behind the button so
that's<00:05:21.510> where<00:05:21.720> our<00:05:21.750> bottom<00:05:22.170> would<00:05:22.290> be<00:05:22.470> our

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
that's where our bottom would be our

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.870 
that's where our bottom would be our
will<00:05:23.880> torch<00:05:24.720> and<00:05:25.110> then<00:05:25.350> mobile<00:05:25.770> and<00:05:26.010> then<00:05:26.670> on

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
will torch and then mobile and then on

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.730 
will torch and then mobile and then on
top<00:05:27.060> of<00:05:27.120> that<00:05:27.240> wolf<00:05:27.540> we<00:05:27.780> put<00:05:28.050> our<00:05:28.200> dispenser

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
top of that wolf we put our dispenser

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.260 
top of that wolf we put our dispenser
and<00:05:28.980> you<00:05:29.130> can<00:05:29.250> put<00:05:29.400> your<00:05:29.490> food<00:05:29.670> in<00:05:29.820> there<00:05:30.060> so

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
we'll put this sign in here and then

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.940 
we'll put this sign in here and then
when<00:05:32.580> we<00:05:32.820> press<00:05:33.060> the<00:05:33.180> dispense<00:05:33.570> button<00:05:33.950> which

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
when we press the dispense button which

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.390 
when we press the dispense button which
would<00:05:35.220> be<00:05:35.400> connected<00:05:36.060> here<00:05:37.010> we<00:05:38.010> should<00:05:38.250> get

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
would be connected here we should get

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.120 
would be connected here we should get
the<00:05:38.550> sign<00:05:38.760> in<00:05:39.030> any<00:05:39.420> second<00:05:40.010> because<00:05:41.010> these

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
the sign in any second because these

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.160 
the sign in any second because these
ones<00:05:41.370> are<00:05:41.520> slightly<00:05:41.760> further<00:05:42.060> away<00:05:42.240> it<00:05:42.720> will

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
ones are slightly further away it will

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.380 
ones are slightly further away it will
actually<00:05:43.380> take<00:05:43.710> a<00:05:43.770> bit<00:05:43.980> longer<00:05:44.010> see<00:05:44.640> the

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
actually take a bit longer see the

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.570 
actually take a bit longer see the
closer<00:05:46.020> ones<00:05:46.200> would<00:05:46.500> be<00:05:46.680> the<00:05:46.920> most<00:05:47.070> efficient

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
closer ones would be the most efficient

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.180 
closer ones would be the most efficient
so<00:05:47.730> I<00:05:47.760> recommend<00:05:48.410> this<00:05:49.410> one<00:05:49.470> here<00:05:49.830> this<00:05:50.130> one

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
so I recommend this one here this one

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.700 
so I recommend this one here this one
here<00:05:50.370> and<00:05:50.730> this<00:05:50.850> one<00:05:51.060> here<00:05:51.270> being<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:51.930> mainly

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
here and this one here being the mainly

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.530 
here and this one here being the mainly
used<00:05:52.980> things<00:05:53.310> but<00:05:53.550> the<00:05:53.670> ones<00:05:53.820> in<00:05:54.000> the<00:05:54.090> corners

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
used things but the ones in the corners

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.840 
used things but the ones in the corners
are<00:05:54.630> a<00:05:54.720> bit<00:05:54.900> more<00:05:55.050> awkward<00:05:55.500> because<00:05:56.100> if<00:05:56.490> you

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
are a bit more awkward because if you

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.220 
are a bit more awkward because if you
push<00:05:57.240> this<00:05:57.390> button<00:05:57.570> here<00:05:57.720> it's<00:05:58.020> going<00:05:58.140> to

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
push this button here it's going to

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.290 
push this button here it's going to
shoot<00:05:58.470> it<00:05:58.590> straight<00:05:58.770> forward<00:05:59.220> so<00:05:59.460> we<00:05:59.700> should

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
shoot it straight forward so we should

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.560 
shoot it straight forward so we should
get<00:06:00.480> a<00:06:00.540> steak<00:06:00.960> quite<00:06:01.350> fast<00:06:01.680> and<00:06:02.450> there<00:06:03.450> we<00:06:03.540> go

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
get a steak quite fast and there we go

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.300 
get a steak quite fast and there we go
we've<00:06:03.900> got<00:06:03.990> the<00:06:04.110> state<00:06:04.320> quite<00:06:04.560> fast<00:06:04.860> if<00:06:05.190> you

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
we've got the state quite fast if you

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.220 
we've got the state quite fast if you
have<00:06:05.460> the<00:06:05.610> hole<00:06:05.790> a<00:06:05.820> bit<00:06:06.090> closer<00:06:06.510> it<00:06:06.930> will<00:06:07.080> also
