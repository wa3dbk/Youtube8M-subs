00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.030 
different patterns they all match up to
the<00:02:15.819> Easton's<00:02:16.569> two<00:02:16.780> powers<00:02:17.230> there's<00:02:17.709> just

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
the Easton's two powers there's just

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.490 
the Easton's two powers there's just
different<00:02:18.280> names<00:02:18.760> on<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.330> but<00:02:19.930> it's<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:20.470> same

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
different names on it but it's the same

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.280 
different names on it but it's the same
curve<00:02:21.099> you<00:02:21.580> just<00:02:21.819> got<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.120> kind<00:02:22.569> of<00:02:22.690> match<00:02:22.930> up

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
curve you just got to kind of match up

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.520 
curve you just got to kind of match up
what<00:02:23.739> curve<00:02:24.069> goes<00:02:24.370> with<00:02:24.640> what<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.319> bad

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
what curve goes with what the the bad

what curve goes with what the the bad
part<00:02:26.830> about<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.190> stick<00:02:27.459> is<00:02:27.670> if<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.209> have<00:02:28.390> a

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
sticks but they're well maintained and

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.880 
sticks but they're well maintained and
I'll<00:02:55.480> be<00:02:55.630> honest<00:02:55.959> with<00:02:56.110> ya<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.290> probably<00:02:56.590> had

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
most most of these sticks is right in

most most of these sticks is right in
here<00:03:07.450> right<00:03:08.110> in<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.380> bottom<00:03:08.799> I'm<00:03:09.069> sorry<00:03:09.100> I'll

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
here right in the bottom I'm sorry I'll

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.860 
here right in the bottom I'm sorry I'll
put<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.850> up<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.090> little<00:03:10.239> bit<00:03:10.390> higher<00:03:10.569> for<00:03:10.600> you

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
put it up a little bit higher for you

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.190 
put it up a little bit higher for you
right<00:03:11.260> in<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.410> heel<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:13.150> starts<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.630> break<00:03:13.840> and

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
right in the heel it starts to break and

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.020 
right in the heel it starts to break and
they<00:03:14.560> get<00:03:14.680> really<00:03:14.980> bad<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.790> blade<00:03:16.000> is

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
they get really bad and the blade is

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.479 
they get really bad and the blade is
flimsy<00:03:16.480> or<00:03:17.019> once<00:03:17.320> in<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.530> while<00:03:17.680> right<00:03:18.040> in<00:03:18.280> this

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
flimsy or once in a while right in this

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.880 
flimsy or once in a while right in this
part<00:03:18.850> right<00:03:19.060> in<00:03:19.209> here<00:03:19.510> from<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.140> puck<00:03:20.500> hit<00:03:20.769> in

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
part right in here from the puck hit in

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.130 
part right in here from the puck hit in
the<00:03:21.010> shaft<00:03:21.310> or<00:03:21.579> the<00:03:21.640> stick<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.450> blade<00:03:22.750> itself

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
the shaft or the stick the blade itself

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.380 
the shaft or the stick the blade itself
it<00:03:23.410> starts<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:23.859> get<00:03:23.980> weakened<00:03:24.489> and<00:03:24.670> you<00:03:25.180> can't

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
it starts to get weakened and you can't

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.849 
it starts to get weakened and you can't
direct<00:03:25.690> your<00:03:25.780> shot<00:03:26.019> anymore<00:03:26.440> because<00:03:26.620> the

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
direct your shot anymore because the

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.970 
direct your shot anymore because the
Flex<00:03:27.190> isn't<00:03:27.549> there<00:03:27.730> in<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.390> blade<00:03:28.709> but<00:03:29.709> most

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
Flex isn't there in the blade but most

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.440 
Flex isn't there in the blade but most
likely<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.790> heel<00:03:31.120> is<00:03:31.420> what<00:03:31.720> breaks<00:03:31.989> on<00:03:33.329> 95%<00:03:34.329> of

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
likely the heel is what breaks on 95% of

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.680 
likely the heel is what breaks on 95% of
all<00:03:34.630> one<00:03:35.260> piece<00:03:35.530> sticks<00:03:35.859> that<00:03:36.130> goes<00:03:36.340> from
