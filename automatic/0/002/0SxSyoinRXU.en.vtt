folks<00:00:00.329> in<00:00:00.510> this<00:00:00.659> video<00:00:00.930> I'm<00:00:01.050> going<00:00:01.230> to

00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:01.319 
folks in this video I'm going to

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:03.740 
folks in this video I'm going to
demonstrate<00:00:01.700> shock<00:00:02.700> sensors<00:00:03.120> and<00:00:03.389> magnetic

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
demonstrate shock sensors and magnetic

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.840 
demonstrate shock sensors and magnetic
contacts<00:00:04.140> on<00:00:04.290> how<00:00:04.380> they<00:00:04.500> work<00:00:04.680> also<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.460> motion

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
contacts on how they work also a motion

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.990 
contacts on how they work also a motion
sensor<00:00:06.060> so<00:00:06.960> this<00:00:07.109> is<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.259> HKC<00:00:07.799> 1070<00:00:08.610> control

office so the motion detector is I have

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.039 
office so the motion detector is I have
three<00:01:28.229> motion<00:01:28.770> detectors<00:01:29.390> so<00:01:30.390> I'll<00:01:30.540> just<00:01:30.720> put

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
three motion detectors so I'll just put

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.600 
three motion detectors so I'll just put
it<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.229> test<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.829> motion<00:01:32.130> detector<00:01:32.490> in

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
it on test for the motion detector in

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.469 
it on test for the motion detector in
the<00:01:32.729> office<00:01:34.009> okay<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.070> if<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.850> walk<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.090> front

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
the office okay so if we walk in front

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.569 
the office okay so if we walk in front
of<00:01:36.630> -<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.110> alarm<00:01:37.320> will<00:01:37.470> also<00:01:37.770> activate<00:01:38.159> for
