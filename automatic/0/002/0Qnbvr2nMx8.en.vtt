all you can see it's got +1 damage + 2 5

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:48.110 
all you can see it's got +1 damage + 2 5
8<00:00:45.269> +<00:00:45.510> -1<00:00:45.900> handling<00:00:46.589> so<00:00:46.830> in<00:00:47.489> my<00:00:47.640> opinion<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
8 + -1 handling so in my opinion the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.670 
8 + -1 handling so in my opinion the
thing<00:00:48.330> that<00:00:48.449> really<00:00:48.629> makes<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.049> insanity<00:00:49.559> you

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
thing that really makes the insanity you

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.439 
thing that really makes the insanity you
know<00:00:49.799> the<00:00:50.040> most<00:00:50.250> lethal<00:00:50.699> and<00:00:51.120> most<00:00:51.299> situations

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
know the most lethal and most situations

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.350 
know the most lethal and most situations
is<00:00:51.989> its<00:00:52.199> fire<00:00:52.470> rate<00:00:52.769> and<00:00:53.210> unfortunately<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
is its fire rate and unfortunately the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.880 
is its fire rate and unfortunately the
fire<00:00:54.570> rate<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.839> not<00:00:55.019> something<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.619> can<00:00:55.769> be

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
fire rate is not something that can be

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.130 
fire rate is not something that can be
duplicated<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.729> normal<00:00:56.970> weapon<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.570> an

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
duplicated on a normal weapon on an

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.780 
duplicated on a normal weapon on an
assault<00:00:58.440> rifle<00:00:58.530> anyway<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.190> I've<00:00:59.489> kind<00:00:59.729> of

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
assault rifle anyway so I've kind of

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.219 
assault rifle anyway so I've kind of
done<00:00:59.909> some<00:01:00.119> research<00:01:00.479> and<00:01:00.690> come<00:01:01.019> to<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
done some research and come to the

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:02.869 
done some research and come to the
conclusion<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.769> there's<00:01:02.010> no<00:01:02.220> full<00:01:02.580> way<00:01:02.820> you

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
conclusion that there's no full way you

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.180 
conclusion that there's no full way you
can<00:01:03.150> make<00:01:03.269> it<00:01:03.390> quote-unquote<00:01:04.019> bootleg<00:01:04.979> and

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
can make it quote-unquote bootleg and

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.830 
can make it quote-unquote bootleg and
Sandy<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.940> same<00:01:06.299> way<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.689> make<00:01:06.810> a

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
Sandy the same way you can make a

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.620 
Sandy the same way you can make a
bootleg<00:01:07.290> asm1<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.189> bootleg<00:01:08.580> obsidian<00:01:09.510> steed

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
bootleg asm1 the bootleg obsidian steed

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.880 
bootleg asm1 the bootleg obsidian steed
all<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.900> kind<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.170> stuff<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.530> make<00:01:10.710> all

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
all that kind of stuff you can make all

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.560 
all that kind of stuff you can make all
those<00:01:11.040> different<00:01:11.400> kind<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.580> weapons<00:01:11.909> very

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
those different kind of weapons very

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.600 
those different kind of weapons very
similar<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.230> so<00:01:13.500> close<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> main<00:01:14.250> variant

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
similar and so close to the main variant

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.460 
similar and so close to the main variant
that<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:14.820> ridiculous<00:01:15.360> but<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:16.380> you

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
that it's ridiculous but on this one you

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.930 
that it's ridiculous but on this one you
can<00:01:16.500> make<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.860> close<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.370> can't<00:01:17.580> get<00:01:17.850> it

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
can make it close but you can't get it

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.380 
can make it close but you can't get it
as<00:01:18.090> close<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.830> that's<00:01:20.280> unfortunate<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:21.240> you

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
as close so that's unfortunate but you

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.240 
as close so that's unfortunate but you
can<00:01:21.630> make<00:01:22.050> up<00:01:22.200> for<00:01:22.230> everything<00:01:22.650> except<00:01:23.160> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
can make up for everything except the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.700 
can make up for everything except the
fire<00:01:23.460> rate<00:01:23.730> with<00:01:24.480> this<00:01:25.020> weapon<00:01:25.320> I'm<00:01:25.530> gonna

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
fire rate with this weapon I'm gonna

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.830 
fire rate with this weapon I'm gonna
tell<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.340> essentially<00:01:27.240> I've<00:01:27.420> got<00:01:27.600> good

so<00:02:03.510> it's<00:02:03.690> pretty<00:02:03.900> much<00:02:04.020> there<00:02:04.200> for<00:02:04.229> anybody<00:02:04.650> to

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
so it's pretty much there for anybody to

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.100 
so it's pretty much there for anybody to
take<00:02:04.920> it's<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.030> very<00:02:06.240> good<00:02:06.360> alternative<00:02:06.510> to<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
take it's a very good alternative to the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.300 
take it's a very good alternative to the
insanity<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.620> think<00:02:07.920> it's<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.129> best

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
insanity I think it's the best

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.039 
insanity I think it's the best
alternative<00:02:08.879> for<00:02:08.909> the<00:02:09.090> insanity<00:02:09.539> so

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
alternative for the insanity so

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.240 
alternative for the insanity so
hopefully<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.560> guys<00:02:10.619> took<00:02:10.860> something<00:02:11.129> away

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
hopefully you guys took something away

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.770 
hopefully you guys took something away
from<00:02:11.519> this<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.819> hopefully<00:02:12.150> you'll<00:02:12.299> implement

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
from this and hopefully you'll implement

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.839
