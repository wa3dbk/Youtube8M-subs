what's<00:02:11.260> this<00:02:11.409> turn<00:02:11.560> on<00:02:11.680> when<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.099> make<00:02:12.220> that

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
what's this turn on when I make that

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.339 
what's this turn on when I make that
little<00:02:12.549> bit<00:02:12.730> smaller<00:02:12.939> actually<00:02:13.120> okay<00:02:13.599> right

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
little bit smaller actually okay right

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.470 
little bit smaller actually okay right
and<00:02:14.500> I'm<00:02:14.560> gonna<00:02:14.680> copy<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.099> paste<00:02:15.280> that

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
and I'm gonna copy and paste that

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.500 
and I'm gonna copy and paste that

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
and put one here now for a little bit

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.240 
and put one here now for a little bit
more<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:19.959> highlight<00:02:20.230> we're<00:02:20.560> gonna<00:02:20.650> grab<00:02:21.040> a

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
more of a highlight we're gonna grab a

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.479 
more of a highlight we're gonna grab a
circle<00:02:22.379> again<00:02:23.379> and<00:02:23.680> we're<00:02:23.769> gonna<00:02:23.860> stick<00:02:24.220> it<00:02:24.370> in

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
circle again and we're gonna stick it in

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.920 
circle again and we're gonna stick it in
the<00:02:24.610> top<00:02:24.849> right<00:02:25.180> hand<00:02:25.390> corner<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:25.989> pupil

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
the top right hand corner of the pupil

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.920 
the top right hand corner of the pupil
think<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.260> looks<00:02:29.440> pretty<00:02:29.769> cool<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:31.090> copy

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
think that looks pretty cool that copy

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.920 
think that looks pretty cool that copy
and<00:02:32.080> paste<00:02:32.409> that<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.430> move<00:02:33.790> one<00:02:34.209> over<00:02:34.390> here<00:02:34.750> as

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
and paste that and move one over here as

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.680 
and paste that and move one over here as
well<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:36.280> make<00:02:36.430> it<00:02:36.459> matching<00:02:37.150> obviously<00:02:37.540> or

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
well to make it matching obviously or

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.229 
well to make it matching obviously or
does<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:37.900> look<00:02:37.989> pretty<00:02:38.140> freakin<00:02:38.920> weird<00:02:39.400> right

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
does it look pretty freakin weird right

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.150 
does it look pretty freakin weird right
so<00:02:40.450> that's<00:02:40.629> good<00:02:40.900> now<00:02:41.080> we<00:02:41.140> just<00:02:41.379> need<00:02:41.470> a<00:02:41.769> nose

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
so that's good now we just need a nose

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.699 
so that's good now we just need a nose
I'm<00:02:42.579> gonna<00:02:42.819> use<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.299> circle<00:02:44.049> again<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.500> could

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
I'm gonna use a circle again you could

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.199 
I'm gonna use a circle again you could
use<00:02:44.890> another<00:02:45.040> shape<00:02:45.370> if<00:02:45.519> you<00:02:45.610> want<00:02:45.819> it<00:02:45.970> but

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.210 
use another shape if you want it but
let's<00:02:46.870> use<00:02:47.019> a<00:02:47.049> circle<00:02:47.530> because<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.739> makes<00:02:47.980> the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
let's use a circle because it makes the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.670 
let's use a circle because it makes the
easier<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.329> put<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.720> bit<00:02:49.900> shading<00:02:50.290> on<00:02:50.379> it<00:02:50.500> make

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
easier to put a bit shading on it make

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.509 
easier to put a bit shading on it make
it<00:02:50.709> look<00:02:50.860> cool<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:51.849> I'm<00:02:52.090> gonna<00:02:52.299> make<00:02:52.720> this

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
black and then add some shading again so

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.380 
black and then add some shading again so

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
which is great for making circles look a

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.420 
which is great for making circles look a
bit<00:03:03.250> 3d<00:03:03.879> ish<00:03:04.590> we'll<00:03:05.590> just<00:03:05.799> stick<00:03:05.950> it<00:03:06.069> there<00:03:06.099> and

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
bit 3d ish we'll just stick it there and

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.210 
bit 3d ish we'll just stick it there and
make<00:03:06.549> it<00:03:06.579> a<00:03:06.700> little<00:03:06.760> bit<00:03:06.970> longer<00:03:07.890> by<00:03:08.890> pressing

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
make it a little bit longer by pressing

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.330 
make it a little bit longer by pressing
right<00:03:09.250> stick<00:03:09.910> I'm<00:03:10.269> gonna<00:03:10.359> make<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:11.190> not<00:03:12.190> as

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
right stick I'm gonna make that not as

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.710 
right stick I'm gonna make that not as
intense<00:03:12.730> needs<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.030> be<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.150> bit<00:03:13.299> more<00:03:13.420> subtle

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
intense needs to be a bit more subtle

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.809 
intense needs to be a bit more subtle
there<00:03:13.959> we<00:03:14.049> go<00:03:14.200> that<00:03:14.470> looks<00:03:14.500> pretty<00:03:14.890> cool<00:03:15.190> right

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
I'm gonna flip it and the spin-around

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.620 
I'm gonna flip it and the spin-around
and<00:03:29.790> as<00:03:30.790> you<00:03:30.910> can<00:03:31.000> see<00:03:31.150> I<00:03:31.180> mean<00:03:31.389> this<00:03:31.480> looks

and then make that a bit smaller and she
just<00:04:14.680> gives<00:04:14.889> a<00:04:15.010> bit<00:04:15.190> vert<00:04:15.609> we<00:04:16.539> have<00:04:16.660> an<00:04:16.750> outline

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
just gives a bit vert we have an outline

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:18.839 
just gives a bit vert we have an outline
to<00:04:17.199> the<00:04:17.380> tongue<00:04:17.680> makes<00:04:17.859> it<00:04:18.070> look<00:04:18.190> pretty<00:04:18.220> cool

to the tongue makes it look pretty cool

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.150 
to the tongue makes it look pretty cool
right<00:04:19.539> so<00:04:19.810> now<00:04:20.139> we<00:04:20.199> are<00:04:20.380> practically<00:04:20.799> done<00:04:21.070> as

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
right so now we are practically done as

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.800 
right so now we are practically done as
you<00:04:21.250> can<00:04:21.370> see<00:04:21.579> now<00:04:21.880> just<00:04:21.910> for<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.330> last<00:04:22.570> bits

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
you can see now just for the last bits

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.560 
you can see now just for the last bits
of<00:04:22.930> shading<00:04:23.380> to<00:04:23.889> give<00:04:24.070> it<00:04:24.190> that<00:04:24.220> throw<00:04:24.940> kind<00:04:25.390> of

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
of shading to give it that throw kind of

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.230 
of shading to give it that throw kind of
a<00:04:25.719> 3d<00:04:26.289> look<00:04:26.469> we're<00:04:26.919> going<00:04:27.039> to

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
a 3d look we're going to

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.960 
a 3d look we're going to
rabble<00:04:27.539> the<00:04:27.630> Gulf<00:04:27.900> flag<00:04:28.319> gonna<00:04:29.160> stick<00:04:29.819> it

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
rabble the Gulf flag gonna stick it

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.390 
rabble the Gulf flag gonna stick it
along<00:04:30.630> this<00:04:31.169> side<00:04:31.590> here<00:04:33.710> if<00:04:34.710> you<00:04:34.919> press<00:04:35.069> right

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
along this side here if you press right

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.120 
along this side here if you press right
stick<00:04:35.819> you<00:04:36.000> can<00:04:36.210> adjust<00:04:36.690> how<00:04:37.319> curved<00:04:37.740> it<00:04:37.979> is

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
stick you can adjust how curved it is

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.080 
stick you can adjust how curved it is
and<00:04:38.870> it<00:04:39.870> kind<00:04:40.259> of<00:04:40.319> helps<00:04:40.620> you<00:04:40.800> when<00:04:41.000> trying<00:04:42.000> to

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
and it kind of helps you when trying to

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.480 
and it kind of helps you when trying to
get<00:04:42.300> it<00:04:42.389> to<00:04:42.539> match<00:04:42.810> along<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.620> side<00:04:43.919> here<00:04:43.949> but

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
get it to match along the side here but

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.339 
get it to match along the side here but
that<00:04:44.880> there<00:04:45.210> will<00:04:45.630> probably<00:04:45.750> pretty<00:04:46.199> good

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
that there will probably pretty good

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.469 
that there will probably pretty good
we're<00:04:46.500> just<00:04:46.650> gonna<00:04:46.740> change<00:04:47.729> the<00:04:47.880> opacity<00:04:48.120> of

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
we're just gonna change the opacity of

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.820 
we're just gonna change the opacity of
that<00:04:48.509> right<00:04:49.080> down<00:04:50.330> to<00:04:51.330> about<00:04:51.720> there<00:04:52.530> I<00:04:52.560> think

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
that right down to about there I think

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.100 
that right down to about there I think
looks<00:04:53.220> pretty<00:04:53.520> good<00:04:53.669> around<00:04:53.759> the<00:04:53.970> 20s<00:04:54.449> I'll

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
looks pretty good around the 20s I'll

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.950 
looks pretty good around the 20s I'll
make<00:04:55.380> it<00:04:55.500> 23<00:04:55.979> because<00:04:56.250> I<00:04:56.370> am<00:04:56.520> Jake's<00:04:56.789> 93<00:04:57.180> so<00:04:57.509> and

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
make it 23 because I am Jake's 93 so and

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.820 
make it 23 because I am Jake's 93 so and
then<00:04:58.080> we'll<00:04:58.259> push<00:04:58.560> this<00:04:58.770> down<00:04:59.160> to<00:05:00.000> just<00:05:00.240> above

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
then we'll push this down to just above

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.290 
then we'll push this down to just above
there<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:02.130> then<00:05:02.520> what<00:05:02.639> we<00:05:02.699> want<00:05:02.880> is<00:05:03.030> another

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
there and then what we want is another

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.520 
there and then what we want is another
one<00:05:03.449> of<00:05:03.539> those<00:05:03.690> so<00:05:03.810> we're<00:05:03.900> gonna<00:05:03.990> copy<00:05:04.259> that

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
one of those so we're gonna copy that

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.219 
one of those so we're gonna copy that
I'm<00:05:05.310> gonna<00:05:05.490> paste<00:05:05.819> it<00:05:06.060> over<00:05:06.240> hold<00:05:06.900> a<00:05:06.930> space

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
I'm gonna paste it over hold a space

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.920 
I'm gonna paste it over hold a space
here<00:05:07.580> here<00:05:08.960> flip<00:05:09.960> it<00:05:10.080> around<00:05:10.199> and<00:05:11.569> same<00:05:12.569> this

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
here here flip it around and same this

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.089 
here here flip it around and same this
side<00:05:13.460> make<00:05:14.460> this<00:05:14.580> one<00:05:14.759> a<00:05:14.789> little<00:05:14.849> bit<00:05:14.970> smaller

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
side make this one a little bit smaller

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.040 
side make this one a little bit smaller
give<00:05:17.099> a<00:05:17.159> little<00:05:17.280> bit<00:05:17.430> of<00:05:17.490> difference<00:05:18.060> and<00:05:18.449> then

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
give a little bit of difference and then

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.589 
give a little bit of difference and then
I<00:05:19.590> suppose<00:05:20.190> we<00:05:20.400> are<00:05:20.430> done<00:05:20.819> there<00:05:21.030> that<00:05:21.210> is<00:05:21.330> done

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
I suppose we are done there that is done

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.270 
I suppose we are done there that is done
if<00:05:21.810> you<00:05:21.960> want<00:05:22.139> to<00:05:22.229> change<00:05:22.530> any<00:05:22.830> of<00:05:22.919> this<00:05:23.130> stuff

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
if you want to change any of this stuff

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.920 
if you want to change any of this stuff
it<00:05:23.639> could<00:05:23.759> be<00:05:23.880> changed<00:05:24.300> and<00:05:24.389> it'll<00:05:24.569> look<00:05:24.690> just

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
it could be changed and it'll look just

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.570 
it could be changed and it'll look just
as<00:05:25.500> cool<00:05:25.740> for<00:05:25.979> instance<00:05:26.190> that<00:05:26.280> we<00:05:26.340> can<00:05:26.460> make

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
as cool for instance that we can make

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.370 
as cool for instance that we can make
you<00:05:27.030> can<00:05:27.150> make<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.389> head<00:05:27.539> smaller<00:05:28.080> if<00:05:28.319> you

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
you can make the head smaller if you

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.850 
you can make the head smaller if you
want<00:05:28.470> it<00:05:28.770> and<00:05:28.979> then<00:05:29.330> make<00:05:30.330> that<00:05:30.360> I<00:05:30.810> know<00:05:31.620> about

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
want it and then make that I know about

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.439 
want it and then make that I know about
that<00:05:32.039> size<00:05:32.310> you've<00:05:32.610> changed<00:05:32.940> the<00:05:33.030> sizes<00:05:33.389> of

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
that size you've changed the sizes of

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:35.570 
that size you've changed the sizes of
everything<00:05:33.870> but<00:05:34.080> I<00:05:34.289> quite<00:05:34.770> liked<00:05:35.009> it<00:05:35.219> how<00:05:35.430> it

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
everything but I quite liked it how it

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.610 
everything but I quite liked it how it
was<00:05:35.610> so<00:05:36.919> there<00:05:37.919> and<00:05:38.190> then<00:05:38.280> black<00:05:39.060> out<00:05:39.270> lime<00:05:39.620> if

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
was so there and then black out lime if

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.810 
was so there and then black out lime if
you<00:05:40.770> want<00:05:40.949> to<00:05:41.039> as<00:05:41.190> well<00:05:41.400> you<00:05:41.550> could<00:05:41.639> just

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
you want to as well you could just

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.219 
you want to as well you could just
change<00:05:42.030> the<00:05:42.180> color<00:05:42.389> of<00:05:42.449> this<00:05:42.630> and<00:05:42.840> because<00:05:42.930> we

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
change the color of this and because we

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.409 
change the color of this and because we
made<00:05:43.409> those<00:05:43.620> shadings<00:05:44.099> Wyatt<00:05:44.430> and<00:05:44.729> just<00:05:45.210> made

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
made those shadings Wyatt and just made

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.060 
made those shadings Wyatt and just made
them<00:05:45.449> see-through<00:05:46.199> opacity<00:05:46.680> instead<00:05:46.979> of<00:05:47.039> a

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
them see-through opacity instead of a

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.709 
them see-through opacity instead of a
different<00:05:47.400> shade<00:05:47.580> of<00:05:47.699> blue<00:05:47.880> means<00:05:48.449> we<00:05:48.570> can

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:48.719 
different shade of blue means we can

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:50.029 
different shade of blue means we can
just<00:05:48.750> change<00:05:49.080> the<00:05:49.139> color<00:05:49.380> of<00:05:49.469> this<00:05:49.650> and<00:05:49.979> it

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
just change the color of this and it

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.770 
just change the color of this and it
will<00:05:50.159> make<00:05:50.550> actually<00:05:50.789> kind<00:05:51.060> of<00:05:51.180> go<00:05:51.360> so<00:05:51.659> you<00:05:51.719> can

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
will make actually kind of go so you can

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.680 
will make actually kind of go so you can
have<00:05:52.020> any<00:05:52.259> color<00:05:52.590> you<00:05:52.740> want<00:05:53.479> obviously<00:05:54.479> if<00:05:54.599> you

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
have any color you want obviously if you

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.059 
have any color you want obviously if you
go<00:05:54.810> too<00:05:54.870> bright<00:05:55.320> you<00:05:55.469> can't<00:05:55.680> really<00:05:55.800> see<00:05:55.949> the

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:56.069 
go too bright you can't really see the

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:58.100 
go too bright you can't really see the
shading<00:05:56.460> so<00:05:56.699> the<00:05:56.880> darker<00:05:57.240> colors<00:05:57.569> tend<00:05:57.960> to

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
shading so the darker colors tend to

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.260 
shading so the darker colors tend to
work<00:05:58.259> best<00:05:58.590> I<00:05:58.949> quite<00:05:59.819> like<00:05:59.969> that<00:06:00.120> blue

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
work best I quite like that blue

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.629 
work best I quite like that blue
actually<00:06:00.449> looks<00:06:00.780> quite<00:06:00.960> nice<00:06:01.199> so<00:06:01.530> but<00:06:02.219> I<00:06:02.370> think

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 
actually looks quite nice so but I think

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.939 
actually looks quite nice so but I think
that<00:06:02.909> when<00:06:03.120> I<00:06:03.210> go<00:06:03.389> for<00:06:03.539> that<00:06:03.599> blue<00:06:03.990> this<00:06:04.710> is<00:06:04.919> a

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:04.949 
that when I go for that blue this is a

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:06.709 
that when I go for that blue this is a
bit<00:06:05.219> too<00:06:05.639> bright<00:06:05.849> so<00:06:06.000> I'm<00:06:06.300> going<00:06:06.509> to<00:06:06.569> lower

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:06.719 
bit too bright so I'm going to lower

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:09.800 
bit too bright so I'm going to lower
that<00:06:06.780> down<00:06:06.930> a<00:06:07.169> bit<00:06:07.469> so<00:06:08.370> it's<00:06:08.580> like<00:06:09.090> that<00:06:09.509> which

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
that down a bit so it's like that which

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.180 
that down a bit so it's like that which
is<00:06:09.840> cool<00:06:10.319> and<00:06:10.469> then<00:06:10.590> I'm<00:06:10.650> gonna<00:06:10.770> change<00:06:10.860> that

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
is cool and then I'm gonna change that

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.580 
is cool and then I'm gonna change that
other<00:06:11.370> one<00:06:11.550> as<00:06:11.669> well<00:06:11.849> actually<00:06:12.030> and<00:06:12.569> make<00:06:13.259> that

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
other one as well actually and make that

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.219 
other one as well actually and make that
a<00:06:13.830> little<00:06:14.699> bit<00:06:14.849> more<00:06:15.090> see-through<00:06:15.389> then<00:06:16.110> if

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
a little bit more see-through then if

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:17.600 
a little bit more see-through then if
you<00:06:16.319> want<00:06:16.500> it<00:06:16.560> maybe<00:06:16.770> a<00:06:16.889> little<00:06:17.219> bit<00:06:17.340> of<00:06:17.430> extra

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
you want it maybe a little bit of extra

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.249 
you want it maybe a little bit of extra
detail<00:06:17.849> just<00:06:18.509> for<00:06:18.719> the<00:06:18.780> lulz

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
detail just for the lulz

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.879 
detail just for the lulz
you<00:06:19.409> could<00:06:19.650> grab<00:06:20.039> maybe<00:06:20.370> a<00:06:21.469> rectangle<00:06:22.469> and

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
you could grab maybe a rectangle and

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:25.939 
you could grab maybe a rectangle and
make<00:06:23.280> it<00:06:23.490> red<00:06:23.909> perhaps<00:06:24.270> or<00:06:25.110> maybe<00:06:25.380> black

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:25.949 
make it red perhaps or maybe black

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:29.120 
make it red perhaps or maybe black
outline<00:06:26.550> like<00:06:27.259> this<00:06:28.259> and<00:06:28.650> then<00:06:28.740> copy<00:06:28.979> and

outline like this and then copy and
paste<00:06:29.370> there<00:06:30.090> make<00:06:30.750> this<00:06:30.990> one<00:06:31.289> red<00:06:32.180> make<00:06:33.180> it<00:06:33.330> a

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:33.389 
paste there make this one red make it a

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:36.050 
paste there make this one red make it a
nice<00:06:33.539> bright<00:06:33.900> red<00:06:34.490> make<00:06:35.490> that<00:06:35.699> a<00:06:35.729> little<00:06:35.969> bit

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
nice bright red make that a little bit

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.959 
nice bright red make that a little bit
smaller<00:06:36.419> and<00:06:36.690> then<00:06:36.810> move<00:06:37.050> these<00:06:37.639> down<00:06:38.639> to<00:06:38.880> the

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:38.969 
smaller and then move these down to the

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:40.519 
smaller and then move these down to the
bottom<00:06:39.300> of<00:06:39.330> these<00:06:39.750> ones<00:06:39.960> don't

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:40.529 
bottom of these ones don't

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:44.779 
bottom of these ones don't
right<00:06:40.739> down<00:06:40.979> and<00:06:41.429> then<00:06:41.609> the<00:06:42.419> red<00:06:43.549> all<00:06:44.549> the<00:06:44.699> way
