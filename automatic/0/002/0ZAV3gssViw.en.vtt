00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
using something like rapid fire and fire

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.030 
using something like rapid fire and fire
from<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.200> hip<00:02:06.350> you<00:02:06.590> don't<00:02:06.740> stand<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:07.009> chance

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
from the hip you don't stand a chance

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.639 
from the hip you don't stand a chance
cuz<00:02:07.460> that's<00:02:07.640> what<00:02:07.820> those<00:02:07.969> guns<00:02:08.209> shine<00:02:08.509> it<00:02:08.690> but

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
cuz that's what those guns shine it but

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.060 
cuz that's what those guns shine it but
this<00:02:10.190> gun<00:02:10.429> versus<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:10.880> ACR<00:02:11.420> I<00:02:11.890> would<00:02:12.890> pick

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
this gun versus the ACR I would pick

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.860 
this gun versus the ACR I would pick
this<00:02:13.190> gun<00:02:13.400> over<00:02:13.579> the<00:02:13.670> ACR<00:02:14.090> all<00:02:14.329> day<00:02:14.510> I<00:02:14.660> don't

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
this gun over the ACR all day I don't

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.500 
this gun over the ACR all day I don't
even<00:02:14.959> like<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.380> HDR<00:02:15.769> but<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:17.180> big<00:02:17.480> thing

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
even like the HDR but the big thing

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.020 
even like the HDR but the big thing
that's<00:02:18.049> good<00:02:18.230> about<00:02:18.260> ACR<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.310> can<00:02:19.430> spam<00:02:19.820> it

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
that's good about ACR is you can spam it

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.150 
that's good about ACR is you can spam it
out<00:02:20.180> if<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.870> put<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.140> silencer<00:02:21.350> and<00:02:21.769> extended

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
out if you put a silencer and extended

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.190 
out if you put a silencer and extended
mag<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.549> can<00:02:22.700> spam<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.390> out<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.720> has<00:02:23.870> low

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
mag you can spam it out it has low

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.670 
mag you can spam it out it has low
recoil<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:25.870> that's<00:02:26.870> what<00:02:27.079> you<00:02:27.200> can't<00:02:27.470> do<00:02:27.650> with

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
recoil and that's what you can't do with

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.380 
recoil and that's what you can't do with
this<00:02:27.920> gun<00:02:28.100> that's<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.489> only<00:02:28.760> downside<00:02:28.970> to

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
this gun that's the only downside to

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.930 
this gun that's the only downside to
this<00:02:29.510> gun<00:02:29.720> is<00:02:30.019> it<00:02:30.650> runs<00:02:30.980> out<00:02:31.160> of<00:02:31.220> ammo

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
this gun is it runs out of ammo

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.120 
this gun is it runs out of ammo
we<00:02:32.120> fast<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.600> can<00:02:32.720> acquire<00:02:33.020> one<00:02:33.410> target<00:02:33.800> two

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
we fast you can acquire one target two

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.220 
we fast you can acquire one target two
targets<00:02:34.520> then<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:34.790> need<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.030> reload<00:02:35.360> however

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
targets then you need to reload however

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.470 
targets then you need to reload however
with<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.530> ACR<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.430> can<00:02:37.580> run<00:02:37.790> into<00:02:37.940> a<00:02:38.060> crowd<00:02:38.450> of

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
with the ACR you can run into a crowd of

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.140 
with the ACR you can run into a crowd of
two<00:02:38.930> three<00:02:39.230> four<00:02:39.620> people<00:02:40.070> and<00:02:40.340> just<00:02:40.550> spray<00:02:40.880> and

two three four people and just spray and

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.210 
two three four people and just spray and
hold<00:02:41.390> down<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.780> trigger<00:02:41.930> that's<00:02:42.890> why<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.160> lot

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
hold down the trigger that's why a lot

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.800 
hold down the trigger that's why a lot
of<00:02:43.430> people<00:02:43.670> like<00:02:43.850> using<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.300> in<00:02:44.390> ground<00:02:44.600> war

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.780 
of people like using it in ground war
that's<00:02:45.020> why<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:45.170> see<00:02:45.380> so<00:02:45.680> much<00:02:45.860> ACR<00:02:46.370> gameplay

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
that's why you see so much ACR gameplay

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.820 
that's why you see so much ACR gameplay
because<00:02:46.940> you<00:02:47.270> can<00:02:47.420> go<00:02:47.600> ham<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.170> can<00:02:48.200> run<00:02:48.590> into

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
enemies so yeah as far as one-on-one

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.330 
enemies so yeah as far as one-on-one
gunfights<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:59.450> being<00:03:00.020> more<00:03:00.230> more<00:03:00.860> efficient

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
gunfights and being more more efficient

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.920 
gunfights and being more more efficient

this is probably my favorite gun for

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.630 
this is probably my favorite gun for
rushing<00:03:09.260> around<00:03:09.350> I<00:03:09.650> like<00:03:09.770> the<00:03:09.920> scar<00:03:10.220> on<00:03:10.250> some

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
maps because the scar has like I said

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.410 
maps because the scar has like I said
great<00:03:12.980> iron<00:03:13.250> sights<00:03:13.550> you<00:03:13.760> can<00:03:13.880> put<00:03:14.030> silencer

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
great iron sights you can put silencer

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.420 
great iron sights you can put silencer
and<00:03:14.570> extended<00:03:14.900> mag<00:03:15.080> and<00:03:15.440> it's<00:03:16.070> kind<00:03:16.250> of<00:03:16.280> like

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.010 
and extended mag and it's kind of like
the<00:03:16.520> ACR<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.150> can<00:03:17.300> kind<00:03:17.480> of<00:03:17.510> spam<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:17.900> out<00:03:17.990> a

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
the ACR you can kind of spam it out a

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.840 
the ACR you can kind of spam it out a
bit<00:03:18.260> but<00:03:18.470> I'm<00:03:18.800> I<00:03:19.010> tend<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.370> be<00:03:19.460> a<00:03:19.490> little<00:03:19.730> more

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
bit but I'm I tend to be a little more

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.700 
bit but I'm I tend to be a little more
precise<00:03:20.210> oh<00:03:20.480> how<00:03:20.720> did<00:03:20.840> that<00:03:20.870> guy<00:03:21.110> not<00:03:21.350> kill<00:03:21.530> me

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
precise oh how did that guy not kill me

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.620 
precise oh how did that guy not kill me
I<00:03:21.890> tend<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.370> be<00:03:22.490> a<00:03:22.520> little<00:03:22.640> more<00:03:22.850> precise<00:03:23.180> with

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
I tend to be a little more precise with

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.100 
I tend to be a little more precise with
the<00:03:23.720> scar<00:03:23.960> over<00:03:24.140> ACR<00:03:25.060> but<00:03:26.060> I<00:03:26.330> think<00:03:26.870> if<00:03:26.990> you

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
the scar over ACR but I think if you

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.840 
the scar over ACR but I think if you
were<00:03:27.230> able<00:03:27.380> to<00:03:27.560> have<00:03:27.800> more<00:03:28.010> ammo<00:03:28.340> in<00:03:28.490> this<00:03:28.640> gun
