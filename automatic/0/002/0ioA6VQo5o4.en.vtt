00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.110
 Juan Pablo Pochettino is the preparer 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.910
 Chacarita physicist in the three 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.980
 JUAN JUAN FOOTBALL categories 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.170
 He spoke the last instances of the 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.960
 preseason a moment in which the 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.790
 your work is fundamental not for 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.130
 yes already the preseason in soccer 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.670
 children do not have the capacity to 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.410
 strong that one knows the professionals 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.660
 that you work more on ideas than after 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.820
 you will be using in the year and we try 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.320
 to put a lot of emphasis on what is the 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.050
 physical work as a ball whenever 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.150
 you can have and have this child stage 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.380
 it is the work of resistance work 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.380
 speed here is that you can get the 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.940
 ball is is a job is necessary 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.950
 different than the one that was later 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.890
 discover they are discarded juveniles after 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.290
 one has to stimulate or train 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.660
 different why because it is what is 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.400
 you need in that kids still 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.960
 We are in a stage where where 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.790
 luck you can do many things with 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.340
 ball and the guys I like more 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.439
 fun and also salt you realize 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.860
 they leave everything entering with ball in 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.689
 games run do not get tired anymore train 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.360
 other than if it were simple to 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.380
 young people like you also this is 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.670
 a beginning of a 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:28.090
 since he has the perspective for the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.880
 guys let's say you have to think that they are not 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.310
 small adults let's say a great 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.000
 race to arrive and for that too 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.579
 coaches that we started forming 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.289
 in football they do it with the idea of 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.289
 get to professionals but good ones 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.420
 mistakes the experience for you 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.970
 speaks or is thinking seriously to 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.409
 through pipes to start playing with 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.210
 smaller spaces in what is the 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.179
 football makes it exactly a Europe of 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.670
 how you see it as prepared are ideas 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:00.900
 they have a foundation because 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.990
 let's say it's not just a fad 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.490
 I think we need to say these are 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.620
 these babies here is a playground 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.259
 professional a huge ball a bow 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.050
 which measures 244 with arquerito 140 are measured 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.340
 it's crazy what football is like 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.980
 illogical it is as if you want to play a 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.690
 match in four courts along in 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.210
 professionals with bow of I do not know what I 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.160
 they give a building then hopefully wish 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.560
 it just has to be gradual there 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.020
 much prejudice people who always play 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.570
 well and that's why he refuses hopefully I wish 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.380
 that can be implemented and we will see 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.380
 what happens
