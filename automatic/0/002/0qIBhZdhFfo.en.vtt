00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
model in a while I got that geez

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.619 
model in a while I got that geez
this<00:02:06.009> side<00:02:06.219> is<00:02:06.399> that<00:02:06.610> I<00:02:06.969> need<00:02:07.119> to<00:02:07.329> build<00:02:07.479> a

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:07.629 
this side is that I need to build a

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:08.960 
this side is that I need to build a
booster<00:02:07.989> for<00:02:08.019> it

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
booster for it

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.550 
booster for it
but<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:10.149> all<00:02:10.299> depends<00:02:10.629> on<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:10.869> can<00:02:11.200> put<00:02:11.379> the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
but that all depends on I can put the

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.039 
but that all depends on I can put the
fourth<00:02:11.829> axle<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.579> fourth<00:02:12.879> flip<00:02:13.209> back<00:02:13.450> on<00:02:13.690> if<00:02:13.900> I

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
fourth axle the fourth flip back on if I

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:22.920 
fourth axle the fourth flip back on if I
want<00:02:18.959> get<00:02:19.959> some<00:02:20.230> more<00:02:20.410> details<00:02:20.890> up<00:02:21.250> here<00:02:21.930> and

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.920 
want get some more details up here and
they<00:02:25.590> flip<00:02:26.590> on<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:26.859> gooseneck<00:02:27.930> extension

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
they flip on the gooseneck extension

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.110 
they flip on the gooseneck extension
there

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.839 

well<00:02:34.130> matches<00:02:35.270> otherwise<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.660> stuff<00:02:37.849> and

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
well matches otherwise and stuff and

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.660 
well matches otherwise and stuff and
your<00:02:39.000> Airlines<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.950> just<00:02:40.950> take<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.340> bend<00:02:41.520> them

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
your Airlines I just take and bend them

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.610 
your Airlines I just take and bend them
over<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.239> push<00:02:42.840> them<00:02:42.959> through<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.200> hole<00:02:43.290> and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
over and push them through the hole and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.830 
over and push them through the hole and
they<00:02:43.680> hold<00:02:43.890> themselves<00:02:44.069> in<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.819> think<00:02:45.720> they

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
they hold themselves in I think they

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.760 
they hold themselves in I think they
look<00:02:46.050> pretty<00:02:46.260> good

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770

here<00:02:50.900> off<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:51.930> truck<00:02:56.269> so<00:02:58.550> that<00:02:59.550> is<00:02:59.730> the<00:03:00.150> string

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
here off the truck so that is the string

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:11.360 
here off the truck so that is the string
I<00:03:04.910> figure<00:03:05.910> out<00:03:06.030> my<00:03:06.239> gross<00:03:08.989> yeah<00:03:10.100> 200<00:03:11.100> some<00:03:11.280> odd
