hi<00:00:00.900> and<00:00:01.110> welcome<00:00:01.260> and<00:00:01.650> complex<00:00:02.399> consultant

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.020 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.160 

our<00:00:09.020> active<00:00:09.680> noise<00:00:09.889> cancellation<00:00:10.430> technology

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
our active noise cancellation technology

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.860 
our active noise cancellation technology
basically<00:00:13.070> a<00:00:13.240> principle<00:00:14.240> behind<00:00:14.390> active

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
basically a principle behind active

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.140 
basically a principle behind active
noise<00:00:15.050> cancellation<00:00:15.590> is<00:00:15.950> to<00:00:16.160> use<00:00:16.340> one<00:00:16.820> sound

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
noise cancellation is to use one sound

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.060 
noise cancellation is to use one sound
wave<00:00:17.420> to<00:00:17.720> cancel<00:00:18.170> out<00:00:18.290> another<00:00:18.619> software

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
wave to cancel out another software

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.950 
wave to cancel out another software
another<00:00:19.910> reason<00:00:20.300> why<00:00:20.390> this<00:00:20.450> hasn't<00:00:20.779> been

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
another reason why this hasn't been

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.320 
another reason why this hasn't been
applied<00:00:21.290> to<00:00:21.320> fan<00:00:21.680> technology<00:00:22.310> so<00:00:22.520> far<00:00:22.790> is<00:00:23.150> that

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
applied to fan technology so far is that

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.839 
applied to fan technology so far is that
the<00:00:23.660> way<00:00:23.840> fans<00:00:24.260> amid<00:00:24.590> noise<00:00:24.830> is<00:00:25.160> so<00:00:25.340> complex

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
the way fans amid noise is so complex

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.870 
the way fans amid noise is so complex
plans<00:00:26.750> put<00:00:27.020> out<00:00:27.200> these<00:00:27.529> rotating<00:00:28.190> fashion

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880

this<00:00:46.670> works<00:00:46.820> is<00:00:47.420> that<00:00:47.540> we<00:00:48.079> have<00:00:48.260> a<00:00:48.590> coil<00:00:49.520> inside

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
this works is that we have a coil inside

slightly and then we switch it off again
they<00:01:01.850> will<00:01:02.000> go<00:01:02.150> back<00:01:02.390> out<00:01:02.510> now<00:01:03.320> when<00:01:03.470> we<00:01:03.589> do

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
they will go back out now when we do

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.190 
they will go back out now when we do

this at a high speed the fan in Hell

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.550 
this at a high speed the fan in Hell
itself<00:01:06.430> emits<00:01:07.430> an<00:01:07.729> extra<00:01:08.210> sounds<00:01:08.780> if<00:01:08.930> this<00:01:09.409> is

itself emits an extra sounds if this is
the<00:01:09.590> sound<00:01:09.890> signal<00:01:10.159> that<00:01:10.759> we<00:01:10.909> use<00:01:11.090> as<00:01:11.540> an<00:01:11.720> anti

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
the sound signal that we use as an anti

the sound signal that we use as an anti
noise<00:01:12.170> signal<00:01:12.619> now<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.550> advantage<00:01:13.880> of<00:01:14.210> this

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
noise signal now the advantage of this

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.300 
noise signal now the advantage of this
technology<00:01:15.050> is<00:01:15.110> that<00:01:15.649> this<00:01:15.770> anti<00:01:16.160> noise

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
technology is that this anti noise

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.279 
technology is that this anti noise
signal<00:01:16.759> will<00:01:17.030> have<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.360> same<00:01:17.600> rotational

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
signal will have the same rotational

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.200 
signal will have the same rotational
pattern<00:01:18.560> as<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:18.950> original<00:01:19.580> noise<00:01:19.789> signal

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
pattern as the original noise signal

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.719 
pattern as the original noise signal
from<00:01:20.390> of<00:01:20.899> the<00:01:21.080> fan<00:01:21.320> and<00:01:21.800> it<00:01:21.979> came<00:01:22.340> from<00:01:22.399> the

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
from of the fan and it came from the

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.460 
from of the fan and it came from the
same<00:01:22.880> it<00:01:23.600> will<00:01:23.750> come<00:01:23.930> from<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.259> same<00:01:24.410> source

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
same it will come from the same source

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.740 
same it will come from the same source
so<00:01:25.460> it<00:01:25.850> will<00:01:26.090> behave<00:01:26.600> very<00:01:26.840> similar<00:01:27.380> when<00:01:27.830> it

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
so it will behave very similar when it

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.200 
so it will behave very similar when it
hits<00:01:29.750> for<00:01:30.259> example<00:01:30.649> a<00:01:30.740> heat<00:01:30.950> sink<00:01:31.220> or<00:01:31.460> radiator

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
hits for example a heat sink or radiator

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.240 
hits for example a heat sink or radiator
or<00:01:32.570> a<00:01:32.630> fan<00:01:33.050> grill

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250

significant boost in human performance

significant boost in human performance
what<00:02:17.260> I<00:02:17.290> have<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.620> stress<00:02:17.950> is<00:02:18.160> that<00:02:18.190> this

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
what I have to stress is that this

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.120 
what I have to stress is that this
technology<00:02:18.850> is<00:02:19.300> extremely<00:02:19.840> difficult<00:02:20.260> to

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
technology is extremely difficult to

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.280 
technology is extremely difficult to
control<00:02:21.640> in<00:02:21.910> manufacturing<00:02:22.600> so<00:02:22.960> we've<00:02:23.110> got

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
control in manufacturing so we've got

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.110 
control in manufacturing so we've got
still<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.530> couple<00:02:23.770> challenges<00:02:24.460> ahead<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:25.000> that

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
still a couple challenges ahead and that

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.730 
still a couple challenges ahead and that
can't<00:02:25.360> promise<00:02:25.600> that<00:02:25.750> we'll<00:02:26.020> have<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.710> ready

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
can't promise that we'll have it ready

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.070 
can't promise that we'll have it ready
like<00:02:27.520> for<00:02:27.730> Christmas<00:02:28.150> time<00:02:28.420> but<00:02:28.900> we're

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
like for Christmas time but we're

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.770 
like for Christmas time but we're
working<00:02:29.380> hard<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.770> make<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:29.980> happen<00:02:30.100> in<00:02:30.780> 2014

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
working hard to make it happen in 2014

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.690 
working hard to make it happen in 2014
and<00:02:31.810> we'll<00:02:32.170> definitely<00:02:32.290> keep<00:02:32.740> you<00:02:32.800> host<00:02:33.100> thank

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
and we'll definitely keep you host thank

00:02:33.700 --> 00:03:17.250 
and we'll definitely keep you host thank
you<00:02:33.760> very<00:02:33.790> much

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.319
