00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
alien abduction story I know may be hard

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.430 
alien abduction story I know may be hard
for<00:00:14.320> some<00:00:14.619> of<00:00:14.650> you<00:00:14.740> to<00:00:14.860> believe<00:00:15.100> but<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:17.410> I

for some of you to believe but so I
brought<00:00:18.010> some<00:00:18.340> proof<00:00:19.380> some<00:00:20.380> people<00:00:20.710> didn't

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
brought some proof some people didn't

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.140 
brought some proof some people didn't
believe<00:00:21.490> my<00:00:22.000> last<00:00:22.240> video<00:00:22.600> so<00:00:23.520> the<00:00:24.520> aliens<00:00:24.670> gave

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
believe my last video so the aliens gave

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.090 
believe my last video so the aliens gave
me<00:00:25.330> some<00:00:25.600> photographs<00:00:26.230> this<00:00:27.220> is<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:28.980> think<00:00:29.980> you

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
me some photographs this is I think you

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.490 
me some photographs this is I think you
recognize<00:00:30.610> this<00:00:30.820> this<00:00:31.270> is<00:00:31.420> Saturn<00:00:31.990> I'm<00:00:32.379> going

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
recognize this this is Saturn I'm going

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.220 
recognize this this is Saturn I'm going
to<00:00:32.590> hold<00:00:32.770> it<00:00:32.890> up<00:00:33.630> see<00:00:34.630> if<00:00:34.660> I<00:00:34.810> can<00:00:34.900> get<00:00:35.020> a<00:00:35.079> little

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
to hold it up see if I can get a little

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.130 
to hold it up see if I can get a little
closer<00:00:35.590> here<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.880> think<00:00:37.780> when<00:00:37.930> they<00:00:38.079> were

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
closer here I think when they were

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.970 
closer here I think when they were
flying<00:00:38.620> by<00:00:39.300> Saturn<00:00:40.300> on<00:00:40.540> the<00:00:41.260> way<00:00:41.380> in<00:00:41.620> the<00:00:41.739> solar

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
flying by Saturn on the way in the solar

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.139 
flying by Saturn on the way in the solar
system<00:00:42.070> they<00:00:42.610> they<00:00:43.030> took<00:00:43.270> this<00:00:43.480> picture<00:00:43.840> and

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
system they they took this picture and

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.450 
system they they took this picture and
and<00:00:46.230> then<00:00:47.230> this<00:00:47.440> one<00:00:47.500> I<00:00:47.739> think<00:00:48.160> you'll

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
and then this one I think you'll

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.690 
and then this one I think you'll
recognize<00:00:49.170> also<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.770> we<00:00:53.890> hold<00:00:54.130> that<00:00:54.309> up<00:00:54.340> that

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
recognize also and we hold that up that

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.139 
recognize also and we hold that up that
that's<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.450> International<00:00:55.870> Space<00:00:56.620> Station

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
that's the International Space Station

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.310 
that's the International Space Station
know<00:00:58.149> if<00:00:58.239> it's<00:00:58.390> supposed<00:00:58.630> to<00:00:58.690> be<00:00:58.809> this<00:00:58.960> way<00:00:59.020> or

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
know if it's supposed to be this way or

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.840 
know if it's supposed to be this way or
this<00:00:59.500> way<00:00:59.559> oh<00:00:59.950> yeah<00:01:00.190> that<00:01:00.399> looks<00:01:00.430> a<00:01:00.700> little

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
this way oh yeah that looks a little

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:08.719 
this way oh yeah that looks a little
better<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.719> there<00:01:05.019> that<00:01:05.379> that's<00:01:05.710> that<00:01:07.289> that

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
better so there that that's that that

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.660 
better so there that that's that that
gives<00:01:09.729> some<00:01:09.909> proof<00:01:10.240> and<00:01:11.399> actually<00:01:12.399> I<00:01:12.459> thought

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
gives some proof and actually I thought

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.090 
gives some proof and actually I thought
about<00:01:12.880> this<00:01:13.030> over<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.389> last<00:01:13.630> 10<00:01:14.200> years<00:01:14.229> as<00:01:14.920> I

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
about this over the last 10 years as I

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.739 
about this over the last 10 years as I
was<00:01:16.529> mulling<00:01:17.529> over<00:01:17.740> how<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.369> present<00:01:19.179> this<00:01:19.479> to

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:19.749 
was mulling over how to present this to

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:25.169 
was mulling over how to present this to
Planet<00:01:20.259> Earth<00:01:20.380> thank<00:01:21.249> God<00:01:21.520> for<00:01:21.549> YouTube<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.700> I

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
Planet Earth thank God for YouTube and I

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:30.209 
Planet Earth thank God for YouTube and I
realized<00:01:25.569> that<00:01:26.729> at<00:01:27.729> one<00:01:28.029> time<00:01:28.200> only<00:01:29.200> 500<00:01:29.979> years

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
realized that at one time only 500 years

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:35.699 
realized that at one time only 500 years
ago<00:01:31.770> we<00:01:32.770> counted<00:01:33.520> like<00:01:33.909> this<00:01:34.200> most<00:01:35.200> of<00:01:35.380> Europe

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:35.709 
ago we counted like this most of Europe

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:38.099 
ago we counted like this most of Europe
i<00:01:35.859> should<00:01:36.039> say<00:01:36.219> counted<00:01:36.700> like<00:01:36.880> this<00:01:37.119> not<00:01:37.929> that

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
i should say counted like this not that

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.129 
i should say counted like this not that
long<00:01:38.170> ago<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:39.149> today<00:01:40.149> we<00:01:40.450> count<00:01:40.689> like<00:01:40.840> this

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:41.139 
long ago and today we count like this

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:44.399 
long ago and today we count like this
and<00:01:41.700> does<00:01:42.700> that<00:01:42.729> mean<00:01:42.880> that<00:01:43.060> this<00:01:43.420> is<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:44.170> end

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
and does that mean that this is the end

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.099 
and does that mean that this is the end
product<00:01:45.249> that<00:01:45.789> I<00:01:45.939> mean<00:01:46.209> when<00:01:46.359> the<00:01:46.479> aliens<00:01:46.869> told

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
product that I mean when the aliens told

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:48.749 
product that I mean when the aliens told
me<00:01:47.289> that<00:01:47.529> we<00:01:47.649> have<00:01:47.770> a<00:01:47.799> primitive<00:01:48.459> number

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
me that we have a primitive number

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.800 
me that we have a primitive number
system<00:01:49.359> on<00:01:50.200> earth<00:01:50.259> I<00:01:50.859> was<00:01:51.429> I<00:01:51.789> was<00:01:51.909> insulted<00:01:52.389> I

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
system on earth I was I was insulted I

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.339 
system on earth I was I was insulted I
was<00:01:53.079> offended<00:01:53.469> and<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.899> more<00:01:56.079> I<00:01:56.109> thought

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:56.349 
was offended and the more I thought

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:58.319 
was offended and the more I thought
about<00:01:56.409> it<00:01:56.679> though<00:01:56.889> over<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.219> last<00:01:57.490> 10<00:01:57.909> years<00:01:57.939> I

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
about it though over the last 10 years I

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.870 
about it though over the last 10 years I
began<00:01:58.779> to<00:01:58.989> see<00:01:59.319> that<00:01:59.619> this<00:02:00.039> doesn't<00:02:00.459> mean<00:02:00.700> that

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
began to see that this doesn't mean that

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.120 
began to see that this doesn't mean that
this<00:02:01.029> is<00:02:01.209> the<00:02:01.359> best<00:02:01.659> possible<00:02:02.139> number<00:02:02.770> system

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
this is the best possible number system

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.269 
this is the best possible number system
that<00:02:03.279> there<00:02:03.429> could<00:02:03.609> be<00:02:03.639> something<00:02:04.060> better<00:02:04.389> and

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:05.279 
that there could be something better and

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:08.790 
that there could be something better and
so<00:02:06.279> I<00:02:06.639> began<00:02:06.759> to<00:02:07.450> accept<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.959> fact<00:02:07.989> that<00:02:08.319> that

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
so I began to accept the fact that that

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.690 
so I began to accept the fact that that
maybe<00:02:09.099> these<00:02:09.369> aliens<00:02:09.700> were<00:02:10.180> serious<00:02:10.660> about

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
maybe these aliens were serious about

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.910 
maybe these aliens were serious about
sharing<00:02:13.030> their<00:02:13.150> number<00:02:13.450> system<00:02:13.810> with<00:02:14.709> earth

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
sharing their number system with earth

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.610 
sharing their number system with earth
and<00:02:15.239> as<00:02:16.239> I<00:02:16.390> something<00:02:16.959> you<00:02:17.019> saw<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.319> first

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
and as I something you saw the first

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.979 
and as I something you saw the first
video<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.269> explained<00:02:19.269> the<00:02:20.050> pattern<00:02:21.330> one<00:02:22.330> two

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
video I explained the pattern one two

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.140 
video I explained the pattern one two
three<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:25.239> so<00:02:25.269> on<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:27.610> refer<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.000> to

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
three and and so on and I refer you to

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.229 
three and and so on and I refer you to
that<00:02:28.330> video<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:28.959> if<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.560> haven't<00:02:29.739> seen<00:02:30.010> it

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
that video of you if you haven't seen it

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.240 
that video of you if you haven't seen it
they<00:02:31.239> actually<00:02:32.110> also<00:02:32.319> explained<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.099> me<00:02:33.220> that

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
they actually also explained to me that

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.160 
they actually also explained to me that
that<00:02:33.700> with<00:02:34.269> 12<00:02:36.150> when<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.239> count<00:02:37.450> by<00:02:37.569> 12s<00:02:38.019> it's

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
that with 12 when you count by 12s it's

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
that with 12 when you count by 12s it's
easier<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.620> share<00:02:38.890> so<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:40.690> can<00:02:40.840> share<00:02:41.190> 12

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
easier to share so you can share 12

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.539 
easier to share so you can share 12
things<00:02:42.810> evenly<00:02:43.810> with<00:02:44.200> two<00:02:44.530> people<00:02:44.980> three

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
things evenly with two people three

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.470 
things evenly with two people three
people<00:02:45.670> for<00:02:46.660> people<00:02:47.170> or<00:02:47.440> six<00:02:47.860> people<00:02:48.480> whereas

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
people for people or six people whereas

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.479 
people for people or six people whereas
ten<00:02:49.810> things<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.200> can<00:02:50.380> only<00:02:50.650> share<00:02:50.950> equally

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
ten things you can only share equally

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.470 
ten things you can only share equally
with<00:02:51.880> two<00:02:52.540> people<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:53.230> five<00:02:53.530> people<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.480> it

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
with two people and five people so it

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.839 
with two people and five people so it
has<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.690> lot<00:02:55.959> to<00:02:56.110> do<00:02:56.260> with<00:02:56.290> this<00:02:56.620> i<00:02:56.920> think<00:02:57.250> is<00:02:57.519> why

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
has a lot to do with this i think is why

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.270 
has a lot to do with this i think is why
they<00:02:58.209> they<00:02:58.780> use<00:02:59.079> this<00:02:59.290> number<00:02:59.620> system<00:03:00.069> this<00:03:00.220> is

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
they they use this number system this is

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.650 
they they use this number system this is
coming<00:03:01.209> by<00:03:01.329> 12<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:03.180> they<00:03:04.180> have<00:03:04.329> a<00:03:04.360> very

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
coming by 12 and and they have a very

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.620 
coming by 12 and and they have a very
old<00:03:05.099> civilization<00:03:06.120> like<00:03:07.120> ours<00:03:07.299> is

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
old civilization like ours is

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.250 
old civilization like ours is
civilizations<00:03:08.590> about<00:03:09.510> 10,000<00:03:10.510> years<00:03:10.540> old

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
civilizations about 10,000 years old

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.880 
civilizations about 10,000 years old
since<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:12.040> beginning<00:03:12.370> of<00:03:12.400> agriculture<00:03:13.269> and

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
since the beginning of agriculture and

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.930 
since the beginning of agriculture and
writing<00:03:14.890> maybe<00:03:15.340> 5,000<00:03:16.269> years<00:03:17.170> ago<00:03:17.760> but<00:03:18.760> their

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
writing maybe 5,000 years ago but their

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.930 
writing maybe 5,000 years ago but their
their<00:03:19.209> civilization<00:03:19.900> is<00:03:20.200> like<00:03:20.579> 50,000<00:03:21.579> years

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
their civilization is like 50,000 years

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.789 
their civilization is like 50,000 years
old<00:03:22.299> so<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:22.660> they've<00:03:23.019> had<00:03:23.049> a<00:03:23.230> lot<00:03:23.380> of<00:03:23.440> time<00:03:23.680> to

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
old so that they've had a lot of time to

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.750 
old so that they've had a lot of time to
think<00:03:23.829> about<00:03:24.040> this<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:25.030> I<00:03:25.359> think<00:03:25.630> we<00:03:25.870> ought<00:03:25.930> to

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
think about this and I think we ought to

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.129 
think about this and I think we ought to
give<00:03:27.760> them<00:03:27.850> some<00:03:28.030> credit<00:03:28.239> for<00:03:28.420> that<00:03:28.859> so<00:03:31.139> so

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
give them some credit for that so so

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.890 
give them some credit for that so so
anyway<00:03:32.440> they<00:03:32.859> count<00:03:33.400> by<00:03:33.519> 12<00:03:33.819> and<00:03:34.209> part<00:03:34.780> of<00:03:34.810> the

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
anyway they count by 12 and part of the

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.800 
anyway they count by 12 and part of the
reason<00:03:34.930> is<00:03:35.260> that<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:35.799> part<00:03:36.130> of<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.280> reason

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
reason is that and part of the reason

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.780 
reason is that and part of the reason
there's<00:03:37.810> sort<00:03:38.440> of<00:03:38.560> geometrical<00:03:39.340> reason<00:03:39.700> they

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
there's sort of geometrical reason they

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.740 
there's sort of geometrical reason they
explained<00:03:40.209> to<00:03:40.389> me<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:41.489> it<00:03:42.489> has<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.209> do<00:03:43.359> if<00:03:43.600> you

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
explained to me and it has to do if you

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.670 
explained to me and it has to do if you
put<00:03:43.959> like<00:03:44.139> a<00:03:44.549> coin<00:03:45.549> like<00:03:45.850> a<00:03:45.910> any<00:03:46.780> coin<00:03:47.170> a<00:03:47.200> penny

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
put like a coin like a any coin a penny

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.830 
put like a coin like a any coin a penny
and<00:03:48.579> then<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:48.880> surround<00:03:49.329> it<00:03:49.540> with<00:03:49.569> other

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
and then you surround it with other

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.330 
and then you surround it with other
pennies<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:54.489> always<00:03:54.850> get<00:03:55.030> six<00:03:56.040> six<00:03:57.040> pennies

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
pennies you always get six six pennies

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.970 
pennies you always get six six pennies
in<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:58.180> pattern<00:03:58.630> and<00:03:58.870> notice<00:03:59.170> that's<00:03:59.470> similar

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
in the pattern and notice that's similar

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.300 
in the pattern and notice that's similar
to<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.400> pattern<00:04:00.849> they<00:04:01.209> use<00:04:01.480> for<00:04:01.889> their<00:04:02.889> number

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
to the pattern they use for their number

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:11.260 
to the pattern they use for their number
system

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.460 

you

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.330 

and<00:04:15.079> then<00:04:16.079> if<00:04:16.230> you<00:04:16.350> fill<00:04:16.560> in<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.769> next<00:04:17.070> row

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
and then if you fill in the next row

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.400 
and then if you fill in the next row
with<00:04:17.700> more<00:04:17.940> pennies<00:04:18.390> you<00:04:18.870> get<00:04:19.049> your<00:04:19.230> going<00:04:19.350> to

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
with more pennies you get your going to

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:28.650 
with more pennies you get your going to
get<00:04:19.530> 12<00:04:19.950> in<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.549> next<00:04:20.730> row

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.990 

you

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.700 

so<00:04:32.000> six<00:04:32.449> in<00:04:32.629> this<00:04:32.750> row<00:04:33.020> 12<00:04:33.379> and<00:04:33.860> then<00:04:33.919> 18<00:04:34.400> so<00:04:34.970> I

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
so six in this row 12 and then 18 so I

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.930 
so six in this row 12 and then 18 so I
think<00:04:36.710> it<00:04:36.800> what<00:04:37.340> they<00:04:37.430> were<00:04:37.490> trying<00:04:37.669> to<00:04:37.819> tell

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
think it what they were trying to tell

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.409 
think it what they were trying to tell
me<00:04:38.060> is<00:04:38.090> nature<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:39.229> way<00:04:39.379> nature<00:04:40.150> puts<00:04:41.150> things

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
me is nature the way nature puts things

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.430 
me is nature the way nature puts things
together<00:04:41.629> is<00:04:42.199> is<00:04:42.530> more<00:04:43.069> in<00:04:43.159> a<00:04:43.250> pattern<00:04:43.610> of

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
together is is more in a pattern of

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.360 
together is is more in a pattern of
using<00:04:45.440> sixes<00:04:46.159> and<00:04:46.310> 12s<00:04:46.849> rather<00:04:47.060> than<00:04:47.330> tens<00:04:47.720> and

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
using sixes and 12s rather than tens and

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.240 
using sixes and 12s rather than tens and
I'm<00:04:49.370> not<00:04:49.580> very<00:04:50.150> good<00:04:50.300> with<00:04:50.780> video<00:04:51.470> cameras<00:04:52.069> and

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
I'm not very good with video cameras and

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.499 
I'm not very good with video cameras and
stuff<00:04:52.340> like<00:04:52.580> that<00:04:52.639> but<00:04:52.879> I<00:04:52.970> have<00:04:53.330> some

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
stuff like that but I have some

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.629 
stuff like that but I have some
photographs<00:04:54.229> so<00:04:54.319> I'm<00:04:54.409> going<00:04:54.530> to<00:04:54.590> try<00:04:54.770> to<00:04:54.830> put

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
photographs so I'm going to try to put

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.580 
photographs so I'm going to try to put
here<00:04:55.940> in<00:04:56.060> this<00:04:56.180> segment<00:04:56.629> of<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:57.020> video<00:04:57.289> if<00:04:57.470> I

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
here in this segment of the video if I

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.879 
here in this segment of the video if I
can<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:59.180> show<00:04:59.389> this<00:04:59.599> better<00:05:00.169> but<00:05:00.470> if<00:05:00.560> I<00:05:00.650> can't

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
can to show this better but if I can't

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.520 
can to show this better but if I can't
well<00:05:01.389> you<00:05:02.389> know<00:05:02.479> then<00:05:02.720> then<00:05:03.050> you'll<00:05:03.199> just<00:05:03.319> have

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
well you know then then you'll just have

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.770 
well you know then then you'll just have
to<00:05:03.650> look<00:05:04.370> at<00:05:04.490> this<00:05:06.879> so<00:05:07.879> that's<00:05:08.090> another<00:05:08.509> reason

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
to look at this so that's another reason

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.700 
to look at this so that's another reason
and<00:05:09.199> and<00:05:09.409> then<00:05:10.270> also<00:05:11.270> if<00:05:11.659> you<00:05:11.780> if<00:05:12.110> you<00:05:12.500> take

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
and and then also if you if you take

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.909 
and and then also if you if you take
like<00:05:12.860> ping-pong<00:05:13.159> balls<00:05:13.669> and<00:05:14.030> you<00:05:14.800> glue<00:05:15.800> them

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
like ping-pong balls and you glue them

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.100 
like ping-pong balls and you glue them
together<00:05:16.129> you<00:05:16.940> get<00:05:17.090> a<00:05:17.150> put<00:05:17.479> one<00:05:17.659> in<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:17.900> center

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
together you get a put one in the center

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.610 
together you get a put one in the center
you<00:05:18.379> get<00:05:18.530> exactly<00:05:19.389> you<00:05:20.389> can<00:05:20.569> fit<00:05:20.840> exactly<00:05:20.960> 12

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
you get exactly you can fit exactly 12

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:28.910 
you get exactly you can fit exactly 12
around<00:05:22.340> that<00:05:22.610> and

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.710 

so<00:05:29.400> that's<00:05:29.580> another<00:05:30.470> way<00:05:31.700> nature<00:05:32.700> is<00:05:32.730> using<00:05:33.300> 12

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
so that's another way nature is using 12

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.750 
so that's another way nature is using 12
rather<00:05:34.290> than<00:05:35.660> 10<00:05:36.660> and<00:05:37.490> there's<00:05:38.490> some<00:05:38.640> other

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
rather than 10 and there's some other

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.000 
rather than 10 and there's some other
shapes<00:05:39.450> i'm<00:05:39.660> going<00:05:39.810> to<00:05:39.900> put<00:05:40.530> in<00:05:40.650> here<00:05:40.680> in<00:05:40.920> the

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
shapes i'm going to put in here in the

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:50.570 
shapes i'm going to put in here in the
video<00:05:41.250> if<00:05:41.400> I<00:05:41.520> can<00:05:41.730> figure<00:05:42.090> out<00:05:42.210> how<00:05:42.390> to<00:05:42.450> do<00:05:42.630> that

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.300 

you

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.140 

oh<00:05:53.630> yeah<00:05:54.800> when<00:05:55.800> you<00:05:55.890> use<00:05:56.010> a<00:05:56.040> base<00:05:56.370> 12<00:05:56.730> system

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
oh yeah when you use a base 12 system

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.330 
oh yeah when you use a base 12 system
you<00:05:57.300> get<00:05:57.420> less<00:05:57.690> of<00:05:57.720> these<00:05:57.990> repeating<00:05:58.740> decimals

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
you get less of these repeating decimals

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:06.950 
you get less of these repeating decimals
so<00:06:00.950> like<00:06:01.950> we<00:06:02.190> are<00:06:02.700> one-third<00:06:03.390> is<00:06:03.780> point<00:06:04.230> 3<00:06:05.960> 3333

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
so like we are one-third is point 3 3333

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.870 
so like we are one-third is point 3 3333
and<00:06:07.530> they<00:06:07.710> don't<00:06:07.920> they<00:06:08.520> don't<00:06:08.550> have<00:06:08.850> that

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
and they don't they don't have that

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.720 
and they don't they don't have that
problem<00:06:09.920> so<00:06:10.920> they<00:06:11.040> have<00:06:11.160> less<00:06:11.460> of<00:06:11.670> these

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.730 
problem so they have less of these

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:17.510 
problem so they have less of these
repeating<00:06:12.720> decimals<00:06:13.460> with<00:06:14.460> the<00:06:14.610> 12<00:06:15.680> and<00:06:16.680> then

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
repeating decimals with the 12 and then

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.190 
repeating decimals with the 12 and then
let's<00:06:18.150> see<00:06:18.360> maybe<00:06:18.570> I'll<00:06:18.780> tell<00:06:18.960> you<00:06:19.020> a<00:06:19.050> little

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
let's see maybe I'll tell you a little

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.480 
let's see maybe I'll tell you a little
bit<00:06:19.320> more<00:06:19.560> because<00:06:19.800> most<00:06:20.130> people<00:06:20.400> are

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
bit more because most people are

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.830 
bit more because most people are
interested<00:06:20.940> in<00:06:21.060> what<00:06:21.180> the<00:06:21.270> aliens<00:06:21.390> look<00:06:21.780> like

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
interested in what the aliens look like

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.340 
interested in what the aliens look like
as<00:06:22.140> I<00:06:22.230> said<00:06:22.440> last<00:06:22.470> time<00:06:22.890> and<00:06:23.630> they<00:06:24.630> they're

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.350 
as I said last time and they they're

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.190 
as I said last time and they they're
short<00:06:25.710> but<00:06:25.980> they<00:06:26.160> there's<00:06:27.090> I<00:06:27.570> think<00:06:27.810> there's

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
short but they there's I think there's

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.610 
short but they there's I think there's
two<00:06:28.640> two<00:06:29.640> types<00:06:29.970> of<00:06:30.210> them<00:06:30.480> there's<00:06:31.110> the<00:06:31.230> short

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
two two types of them there's the short

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.650 
two two types of them there's the short
big-headed<00:06:32.430> ones<00:06:32.670> and<00:06:33.030> then<00:06:33.180> there's<00:06:33.360> ones

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 
big-headed ones and then there's ones

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.690 
big-headed ones and then there's ones
that<00:06:33.840> look<00:06:34.020> more<00:06:34.530> like<00:06:34.650> us<00:06:34.890> with<00:06:35.130> the<00:06:35.250> big<00:06:35.430> legs

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700 
that look more like us with the big legs

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.640 
that look more like us with the big legs
there<00:06:36.030> they're<00:06:36.240> the<00:06:36.360> ones<00:06:36.540> that<00:06:36.660> work

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
there they're the ones that work

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.550 
there they're the ones that work
primarily<00:06:37.980> and<00:06:38.580> the<00:06:38.880> gravitational<00:06:40.940> 1g<00:06:41.940> or

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
primarily and the gravitational 1g or

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.710 
primarily and the gravitational 1g or
gravitational<00:06:43.560> heavy<00:06:44.130> gravity<00:06:44.430> and<00:06:44.850> then<00:06:45.000> the

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 
gravitational heavy gravity and then the

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.730 
gravitational heavy gravity and then the
big-headed<00:06:46.140> aliens<00:06:46.980> work<00:06:47.310> more<00:06:47.760> in<00:06:47.970> the<00:06:48.740> zero

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
big-headed aliens work more in the zero

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.100 
big-headed aliens work more in the zero
g<00:06:49.830> and<00:06:52.370> and<00:06:53.370> people<00:06:54.180> always<00:06:54.420> ask<00:06:54.750> me<00:06:54.900> about

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
g and and people always ask me about

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.700 
g and and people always ask me about
them<00:06:55.530> I<00:06:56.540> you<00:06:57.540> know<00:06:57.570> I<00:06:57.660> don't<00:06:57.990> think<00:06:58.170> they<00:06:58.290> they

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
them I you know I don't think they they

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.030 
them I you know I don't think they they
didn't<00:06:58.950> reveal<00:06:59.430> their<00:06:59.730> whole<00:07:01.040> civilization

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.040 
didn't reveal their whole civilization

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.330 
didn't reveal their whole civilization
to<00:07:02.310> me<00:07:02.840> that's<00:07:03.840> all<00:07:03.990> I<00:07:04.080> have<00:07:04.200> to<00:07:04.350> say<00:07:04.490> right<00:07:05.490> now

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
to me that's all I have to say right now
