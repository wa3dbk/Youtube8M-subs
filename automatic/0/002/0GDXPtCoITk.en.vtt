all<00:00:21.980> right<00:00:22.130> everyone<00:00:22.900> so<00:00:23.900> as<00:00:24.109> you<00:00:24.230> can<00:00:24.349> see

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
all right everyone so as you can see

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.640 
all right everyone so as you can see
there's<00:00:25.130> a<00:00:25.310> crack<00:00:25.820> right<00:00:26.029> there<00:00:26.090> in<00:00:26.539> my<00:00:27.109> math

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
there's a crack right there in my math

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.510 
there's a crack right there in my math
book<00:00:27.680> and<00:00:29.230> this<00:00:30.230> is<00:00:30.289> the<00:00:30.500> piece<00:00:30.829> that<00:00:30.859> used<00:00:31.399> to

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
book and this is the piece that used to

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.290 
book and this is the piece that used to
fit<00:00:31.759> in<00:00:31.910> there<00:00:32.590> but<00:00:33.590> it<00:00:34.280> just<00:00:34.699> chipped<00:00:35.090> off

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
fit in there but it just chipped off

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.920 
fit in there but it just chipped off
went<00:00:36.019> away<00:00:37.089> and<00:00:38.089> now<00:00:38.269> it's<00:00:38.420> no<00:00:38.540> good<00:00:38.690> to<00:00:38.809> me

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
went away and now it's no good to me

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.130 
went away and now it's no good to me
anymore<00:00:39.170> so<00:00:40.239> this<00:00:41.239> is<00:00:41.390> going<00:00:41.660> back<00:00:41.839> to<00:00:42.019> the

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
anymore so this is going back to the

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.069 
anymore so this is going back to the
Apple<00:00:42.409> store<00:00:42.460> again<00:00:43.460> and<00:00:43.790> this<00:00:44.420> is<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.600> second

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
Apple store again and this is the second

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.590 
Apple store again and this is the second
time<00:00:45.230> I'm<00:00:45.379> repairing<00:00:45.710> this<00:00:46.010> this<00:00:46.970> exact<00:00:47.390> same

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
time I'm repairing this this exact same

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.639 
time I'm repairing this this exact same
problem<00:00:49.540> so<00:00:50.540> just<00:00:50.570> to<00:00:50.930> give<00:00:51.079> you<00:00:51.199> a<00:00:51.230> bit<00:00:51.470> of<00:00:51.559> a

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
problem so just to give you a bit of a

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.720 
problem so just to give you a bit of a
background<00:00:52.129> as<00:00:52.280> to<00:00:52.309> what<00:00:53.120> happens<00:00:54.730> currently

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
background as to what happens currently

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.340 
background as to what happens currently
all<00:00:55.879> MacBooks<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:56.600> MacBook<00:00:56.989> Airs

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
all MacBooks and MacBook Airs

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.939 
all MacBooks and MacBook Airs
employ<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.219> magnetic<00:00:58.730> latch<00:00:58.910> system<00:00:59.449> in<00:01:00.140> theory

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
employ a magnetic latch system in theory

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.520 
employ a magnetic latch system in theory
it's<00:01:01.219> a<00:01:01.789> good<00:01:02.269> idea<00:01:02.570> because<00:01:02.989> that<00:01:03.230> means

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
it's a good idea because that means

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.320 
it's a good idea because that means
there's<00:01:03.829> no<00:01:04.039> physical<00:01:04.399> latches<00:01:04.940> to<00:01:05.119> break

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
there's no physical latches to break

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.190 
there's no physical latches to break
nothing<00:01:05.720> to<00:01:05.840> get<00:01:05.960> snagged<00:01:06.259> on<00:01:06.350> your<00:01:06.530> clothes

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
nothing to get snagged on your clothes

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.419 
nothing to get snagged on your clothes
there<00:01:09.200> should<00:01:09.380> be<00:01:09.500> a<00:01:09.530> more<00:01:09.770> reliable<00:01:09.920> way<00:01:10.399> of

00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:10.429 
there should be a more reliable way of

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:13.210 
there should be a more reliable way of
closing<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:11.210> lid<00:01:11.360> on<00:01:11.539> your<00:01:11.660> laptop<00:01:12.100> so<00:01:13.100> what

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
closing the lid on your laptop so what

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.700 
closing the lid on your laptop so what
Apple<00:01:13.520> did<00:01:13.640> is<00:01:13.850> that<00:01:13.970> they<00:01:14.240> designed<00:01:14.929> a<00:01:15.110> set<00:01:15.590> of

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
Apple did is that they designed a set of

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.850 
Apple did is that they designed a set of
magnets<00:01:15.830> behind<00:01:16.520> or<00:01:17.000> inside<00:01:17.479> the<00:01:17.710> upper<00:01:18.710> lid

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
magnets behind or inside the upper lid

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.700 
magnets behind or inside the upper lid
up<00:01:19.009> here<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:20.119> once<00:01:20.300> the<00:01:20.509> magnets<00:01:20.869> up<00:01:20.990> here<00:01:21.259> and

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
up here so once the magnets up here and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.789 
up here so once the magnets up here and
they<00:01:22.700> have<00:01:22.750> seconds<00:01:23.750> of<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.930> magnets<00:01:24.350> in<00:01:24.619> the

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
they have seconds of the magnets in the

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.160 
they have seconds of the magnets in the
bottom<00:01:25.159> portion<00:01:25.880> of<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.299> casing<00:01:28.450> so<00:01:29.450> they<00:01:30.020> use

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
bottom portion of the casing so they use

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.240 
bottom portion of the casing so they use
the<00:01:30.939> magnetic<00:01:31.939> properties<00:01:33.250> different

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
the magnetic properties different

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.649 
the magnetic properties different
polarities<00:01:36.130> as<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.310> close<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.759> lid<00:01:37.970> magnets

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
polarities as you close the lid magnets

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.139 
polarities as you close the lid magnets
get<00:01:38.810> closer<00:01:39.049> to<00:01:39.290> each<00:01:39.409> other<00:01:39.820> pull<00:01:40.820> each<00:01:40.939> other

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
get closer to each other pull each other

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.800 
get closer to each other pull each other
in<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:41.600> that's<00:01:42.409> how<00:01:42.590> your<00:01:42.740> lid<00:01:43.220> is<00:01:43.659> kept<00:01:44.659> in

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
in and that's how your lid is kept in

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.280 
in and that's how your lid is kept in
place<00:01:45.880> so<00:01:46.880> they<00:01:47.270> just<00:01:47.450> set<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:47.780> concept<00:01:48.200> of

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
place so they just set the concept of

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.550 
place so they just set the concept of
the<00:01:48.439> MagSafe<00:01:48.649> connector<00:01:49.869> and<00:01:50.869> extended<00:01:51.409> it

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
the MagSafe connector and extended it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.219 
the MagSafe connector and extended it
for<00:01:52.130> lids<00:01:52.570> which<00:01:53.570> is<00:01:53.719> actually<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.049> pretty

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
for lids which is actually a pretty

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.679 
for lids which is actually a pretty
smart<00:01:54.530> idea<00:01:55.119> it<00:01:56.119> is<00:01:56.329> a<00:01:56.509> I<00:01:57.759> mean<00:01:58.759> it<00:01:58.939> should<00:01:59.479> work

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
smart idea it is a I mean it should work

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.870 
smart idea it is a I mean it should work
well<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.170> it<00:02:00.649> does<00:02:00.829> work<00:02:01.009> well<00:02:01.250> because<00:02:01.670> the

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
well and it does work well because the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.109 
well and it does work well because the
lid<00:02:02.060> stays<00:02:02.329> in<00:02:02.539> place<00:02:02.750> stays<00:02:03.530> intact

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
lid stays in place stays intact

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.139 
lid stays in place stays intact
problem<00:02:05.119> is<00:02:05.270> is<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.479> on<00:02:06.520> Apple<00:02:07.520> also<00:02:07.759> felt<00:02:07.969> it

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
problem is is that on Apple also felt it

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.690 
problem is is that on Apple also felt it
was<00:02:08.269> necessary<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:09.190> include<00:02:10.190> these<00:02:10.429> little

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
was necessary to include these little

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.670 
was necessary to include these little
stubs<00:02:11.120> on<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.750> upper<00:02:11.930> portion<00:02:12.320> of<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.500> lid

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
stubs on the upper portion of the lid

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.979 
stubs on the upper portion of the lid
right<00:02:12.920> here<00:02:13.130> now<00:02:14.060> what<00:02:14.239> these<00:02:14.360> little<00:02:14.690> stubs

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
right here now what these little stubs

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.680 
right here now what these little stubs
do<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.560> creates<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:16.220> gap<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.030> separation

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
do is it creates a gap the separation

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.670 
do is it creates a gap the separation
between<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.410> keyboard<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.340> screen<00:02:19.370> and

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
between the keyboard and the screen and

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.990 
between the keyboard and the screen and
as<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:21.769> can<00:02:21.920> tell<00:02:22.100> my<00:02:22.130> keyboard<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:22.820> pretty

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
as you can tell my keyboard is pretty

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.539 
as you can tell my keyboard is pretty
dirty<00:02:23.780> right<00:02:24.049> here

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
dirty right here

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.940 
dirty right here
so<00:02:25.690> what<00:02:26.690> they<00:02:26.900> don't<00:02:27.140> want<00:02:27.350> happening<00:02:27.530> is

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
so what they don't want happening is

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.170 
so what they don't want happening is
that<00:02:28.099> they<00:02:28.220> don't<00:02:28.340> want<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.640> keyboard<00:02:29.060> to

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
that they don't want the keyboard to

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.770 
that they don't want the keyboard to
come<00:02:29.330> into<00:02:29.480> direct<00:02:29.930> contact<00:02:30.140> screen

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
come into direct contact screen

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.250 
come into direct contact screen
um<00:02:32.430> call<00:02:33.430> MacBooks<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.360> MacBook<00:02:34.540> Airs<00:02:34.990> come

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
um call MacBooks and MacBook Airs come

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.960 
um call MacBooks and MacBook Airs come
with<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.470> glossy<00:02:35.680> screen<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:36.730> what<00:02:36.880> can

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
with the glossy screen so what can

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.570 
with the glossy screen so what can
happen<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.450> over<00:02:37.630> time<00:02:37.810> is<00:02:37.990> that<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.350> oil<00:02:39.220> from

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
happen to over time is that the oil from

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.420 
happen to over time is that the oil from
your<00:02:39.760> fingerprints<00:02:40.420> can<00:02:40.990> transfer<00:02:41.530> onto<00:02:42.250> the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
your fingerprints can transfer onto the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.610 
your fingerprints can transfer onto the
keyboard<00:02:42.730> onto<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.750> screen<00:02:44.050> and<00:02:44.290> it's<00:02:44.560> going

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
keyboard onto the screen and it's going

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.980 
keyboard onto the screen and it's going
to<00:02:44.709> eat<00:02:44.830> away<00:02:44.950> at<00:02:45.069> the<00:02:45.190> glossy<00:02:45.430> cold<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.300> that

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
to eat away at the glossy cold and that

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.690 
to eat away at the glossy cold and that
happens<00:02:47.530> too<00:02:48.209> so<00:02:49.209> what<00:02:49.870> Apple<00:02:50.170> thought<00:02:50.700> of

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
happens too so what Apple thought of

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.030 
happens too so what Apple thought of
doing<00:02:51.880> was<00:02:52.470> just<00:02:53.470> putting<00:02:53.680> through<00:02:53.950> these

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
doing was just putting through these

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.490 
doing was just putting through these
little<00:02:54.430> stubs<00:02:54.760> on<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.060> top<00:02:55.270> of<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.480> lid<00:02:55.690> to

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
little stubs on the top of the lid to

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.680 
little stubs on the top of the lid to
try<00:02:56.739> and<00:02:56.920> give<00:02:57.190> you<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.370> bit<00:02:57.640> of<00:02:57.670> space<00:02:59.160> now

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
try and give you a bit of space now

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.270 
try and give you a bit of space now
technically<00:03:01.690> it<00:03:01.930> kind<00:03:02.230> of<00:03:02.290> does<00:03:02.530> work<00:03:02.800> there

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
technically it kind of does work there

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.090 
technically it kind of does work there
are<00:03:03.640> still<00:03:03.970> ways<00:03:04.180> that<00:03:04.600> of<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:05.560> can<00:03:05.739> bend

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
are still ways that of you can bend

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.650 
are still ways that of you can bend
right<00:03:06.310> in<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.580> middle<00:03:06.790> of<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.060> screen<00:03:07.269> and

right in the middle of the screen and

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.229 
right in the middle of the screen and
it's<00:03:08.350> going<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.530> affect<00:03:08.830> you<00:03:09.070> over<00:03:09.580> here<00:03:09.790> in

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
it's going to affect you over here in

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
the middle of the keyboard and there are

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.710 
the middle of the keyboard and there are
ways<00:03:12.550> you<00:03:12.670> can<00:03:12.820> get<00:03:12.940> marks<00:03:13.239> in<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.420> middle<00:03:13.540> of

ways you can get marks in the middle of

ways you can get marks in the middle of
the<00:03:13.810> screen<00:03:14.130> but<00:03:15.130> it<00:03:16.060> is<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.239> sound<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.050> valid

the screen but it is a sound and valid
idea<00:03:18.160> and<00:03:18.640> I<00:03:18.940> can<00:03:19.090> see<00:03:19.239> why<00:03:19.390> they<00:03:19.510> wanted<00:03:19.780> to

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
idea and I can see why they wanted to

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.290 
idea and I can see why they wanted to
try<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.290> do<00:03:20.380> this<00:03:20.530> up<00:03:20.590> here<00:03:20.970> problem<00:03:21.970> is<00:03:22.120> is

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
try and do this up here problem is is

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.420 
try and do this up here problem is is
that<00:03:22.330> over<00:03:22.750> time<00:03:22.780> as<00:03:23.019> you<00:03:23.440> repeatedly<00:03:24.010> open

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
because apparently the little stubs

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.890 
because apparently the little stubs
going<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.280> come<00:03:45.910> into<00:03:46.060> contact<00:03:46.360> with<00:03:46.720> the

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
casing with the keyboard so like I said

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.880 
casing with the keyboard so like I said
this<00:03:55.600> is<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.930> second<00:03:56.260> time<00:03:56.410> that<00:03:56.560> this<00:03:56.709> is

going to be an in-house repair they

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.350 
going to be an in-house repair they
usually<00:04:34.180> turn<00:04:34.539> it<00:04:34.690> around<00:04:34.840> in<00:04:35.169> the<00:04:35.289> bowel

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
usually turn it around in the bowel

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.450 
usually turn it around in the bowel
let's<00:04:37.360> see<00:04:37.539> how<00:04:37.630> many<00:04:37.810> days<00:04:38.050> in<00:04:38.830> about<00:04:39.220> a<00:04:39.250> day

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
let's see how many days in about a day

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.060 
let's see how many days in about a day
or<00:04:39.610> two<00:04:39.820> and<00:04:40.320> theoretically<00:04:41.320> this<00:04:41.560> is<00:04:41.710> a<00:04:41.740> 10<00:04:42.039> or

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
or two and theoretically this is a 10 or

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.820 
or two and theoretically this is a 10 or
15<00:04:42.280> minute<00:04:42.520> fit<00:04:42.970> because

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
15 minute fit because

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.049 
15 minute fit because
they<00:04:44.830> really<00:04:45.099> know<00:04:45.219> how<00:04:45.309> to<00:04:45.339> take<00:04:45.610> apart<00:04:45.909> I

00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:46.059 
they really know how to take apart I

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:48.059 
they really know how to take apart I
mean<00:04:46.179> this<00:04:46.299> is<00:04:46.479> this<00:04:47.289> is<00:04:47.499> pretty<00:04:47.649> easy<00:04:47.769> to

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.069 
mean this is this is pretty easy to

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:50.249 
mean this is this is pretty easy to
actually<00:04:48.459> take<00:04:49.119> the<00:04:49.209> whole<00:04:49.299> top<00:04:49.539> casing<00:04:49.929> off<00:04:50.080> I

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
actually take the whole top casing off I

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:51.509 
actually take the whole top casing off I
mean<00:04:50.379> I<00:04:50.469> could<00:04:50.619> probably<00:04:50.709> do<00:04:51.159> it

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:51.519 
mean I could probably do it

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:54.929 
mean I could probably do it
I<00:04:51.549> would<00:04:52.329> void<00:04:52.479> my<00:04:52.659> warranty<00:04:52.689> but<00:04:53.639> it's<00:04:54.639> simple

00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:54.939 
I would void my warranty but it's simple

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:56.699 
I would void my warranty but it's simple
enough<00:04:54.999> I<00:04:55.299> should<00:04:56.110> be<00:04:56.199> able<00:04:56.289> to<00:04:56.439> know<00:04:56.559> how<00:04:56.589> to

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:56.709 
enough I should be able to know how to

00:04:56.709 --> 00:05:00.089 
enough I should be able to know how to
do<00:04:56.949> it<00:04:57.099> but<00:04:57.909> I<00:04:58.439> paid<00:04:59.439> for<00:04:59.649> the<00:04:59.739> warranty

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
do it but I paid for the warranty

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.159 
do it but I paid for the warranty
they're<00:05:00.519> going<00:05:00.639> to<00:05:00.699> do<00:05:00.849> the<00:05:00.939> work<00:05:01.119> replace<00:05:01.899> the

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
they're going to do the work replace the

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.109 
they're going to do the work replace the
part<00:05:02.379> and<00:05:03.189> give<00:05:03.369> it<00:05:03.519> back<00:05:03.639> to<00:05:03.849> me

00:05:04.109 --> 00:05:04.119 
part and give it back to me

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:07.469 
part and give it back to me
it's<00:05:04.929> just<00:05:05.969> disconcerting<00:05:06.969> because<00:05:07.269> I'm

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
it's just disconcerting because I'm

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.419 
it's just disconcerting because I'm
going<00:05:07.599> to<00:05:07.689> be<00:05:07.779> without<00:05:07.959> my<00:05:08.169> Mac<00:05:08.379> for<00:05:08.619> about<00:05:08.829> dr2

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:09.429 
going to be without my Mac for about dr2

00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:12.539 
going to be without my Mac for about dr2
and<00:05:09.959> it's<00:05:10.959> also<00:05:11.139> because<00:05:11.559> this<00:05:11.769> is<00:05:11.829> the<00:05:11.979> second

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:12.549 
and it's also because this is the second

00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:14.279 
and it's also because this is the second
time<00:05:12.729> I'm<00:05:13.029> bringing<00:05:13.419> this<00:05:13.509> in<00:05:13.689> for<00:05:13.899> the<00:05:13.989> exact

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
time I'm bringing this in for the exact

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.729 
time I'm bringing this in for the exact
same<00:05:14.529> problem<00:05:15.069> so<00:05:16.349> that's<00:05:17.349> just<00:05:17.829> one<00:05:18.129> thing<00:05:18.159> to

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:19.739 
same problem so that's just one thing to

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:23.129 
same problem so that's just one thing to
kind<00:05:20.739> of<00:05:20.829> see<00:05:21.309> rotating<00:05:21.699> so<00:05:22.599> hopefully<00:05:22.959> they

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
kind of see rotating so hopefully they

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.919 
kind of see rotating so hopefully they
have<00:05:23.169> version<00:05:23.709> 3<00:05:23.979> out<00:05:24.189> of<00:05:24.429> the<00:05:24.519> top<00:05:25.389> casing<00:05:25.839> and

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:25.929 
have version 3 out of the top casing and

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:28.889 
have version 3 out of the top casing and
maybe<00:05:26.079> that'll<00:05:26.439> fix<00:05:26.589> it<00:05:26.829> I<00:05:27.009> don't<00:05:27.339> know<00:05:27.899> all

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:28.899 
maybe that'll fix it I don't know all

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:33.360 
maybe that'll fix it I don't know all
right<00:05:28.959> well<00:05:29.860> that's<00:05:30.309> about<00:05:30.579> it<00:05:30.789> peace
