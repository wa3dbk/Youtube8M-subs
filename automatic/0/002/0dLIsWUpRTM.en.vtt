00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
because what you see in isn't just the

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.819 
because what you see in isn't just the
original<00:00:35.600> game<00:00:35.630> I<00:00:35.960> will<00:00:36.020> point<00:00:36.380> out<00:00:36.530> what's

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829

you just have to hit them so on your
launch<00:02:14.330> pad<00:02:14.600> you've<00:02:14.810> got<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.080> analog<00:02:15.530> nod<00:02:15.740> to

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
launch pad you've got the analog nod to

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.860 
launch pad you've got the analog nod to
pull<00:02:16.130> back<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.550> likes<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.060> then<00:02:17.630> you<00:02:17.690> just

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
pull back and likes and then you just

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.250 
pull back and likes and then you just
try<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.140> hit<00:02:18.350> me<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:19.220> that's<00:02:20.060> up<00:02:20.270> you<00:02:21.110> just

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
try and hit me so that's up you just

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.780 
try and hit me so that's up you just
look<00:02:21.410> what<00:02:21.500> they<00:02:21.590> do<00:02:21.739> that<00:02:21.980> you<00:02:22.220> do<00:02:22.370> as<00:02:22.520> many<00:02:22.640> as

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
look what they do that you do as many as

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.670 
look what they do that you do as many as
you<00:02:22.880> can<00:02:23.030> in<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.239> time<00:02:23.420> limit<00:02:23.630> welcome<00:02:24.440> fair<00:02:24.650> I

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
you can in the time limit welcome fair I

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.380 
you can in the time limit welcome fair I
think<00:02:24.709> you've<00:02:24.980> got<00:02:25.190> 12<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:25.730> do<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.270> have

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
think you've got 12 to do and you have

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.670 
think you've got 12 to do and you have
to<00:02:26.510> do<00:02:26.600> it<00:02:26.720> in<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.870> fastest<00:02:27.260> time<00:02:27.410> than<00:02:27.560> you

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
to do it in the fastest time than you

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.160 
to do it in the fastest time than you
can<00:02:27.830> do<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.370> that's<00:02:28.850> that<00:02:29.090> so<00:02:29.660> I'm<00:02:29.870> just<00:02:30.050> going

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
can do and that's that so I'm just going

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.960 
can do and that's that so I'm just going
to<00:02:30.230> pander<00:02:30.680> cut<00:02:30.860> another<00:02:31.040> normal<00:02:31.430> game<00:02:31.610> the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
to pander cut another normal game the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:40.960 
to pander cut another normal game the
normal<00:02:32.239> game<00:02:32.360> is<00:02:32.600> where<00:02:32.750> is<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:39.670> so<00:02:40.670> we<00:02:40.820> got

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
normal game is where is that so we got

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.120 
normal game is where is that so we got
them<00:02:41.090> this<00:02:41.330> just<00:02:41.600> million<00:02:42.080> poor<00:02:42.410> point<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:42.800> i'd

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
them this just million poor point is i'd

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.340 
them this just million poor point is i'd
say<00:02:43.459> just<00:02:43.489> have<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:44.030> destroy<00:02:44.600> things<00:02:44.870> like<00:02:45.200> the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
say just have to destroy things like the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.930 
say just have to destroy things like the
hotel<00:02:45.680> over<00:02:45.860> they<00:02:45.980> can<00:02:46.250> knock<00:02:46.489> things<00:02:46.730> off

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
hotel over they can knock things off

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.300 
hotel over they can knock things off
it's<00:02:47.600> not<00:02:47.780> like<00:02:47.959> that<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.500> you<00:02:48.830> just<00:02:48.950> destroy

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
it's not like that and you just destroy

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.710 
it's not like that and you just destroy
things<00:02:49.489> four<00:02:49.700> bytes<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.239> then<00:02:50.390> you<00:02:50.480> go<00:02:50.569> for

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
things four bytes and then you go for

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.500 
things four bytes and then you go for
your<00:02:50.780> best<00:02:50.959> buns<00:02:51.700> soon<00:02:52.700> as<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.880> launch<00:02:53.060> if<00:02:53.360> you

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
your best buns soon as you launch if you

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.479 
your best buns soon as you launch if you
hold<00:02:53.660> up<00:02:53.959> you'll<00:02:54.260> get<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.470> lot<00:02:54.860> of<00:02:54.920> hype<00:02:55.280> behind

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
hold up you'll get a lot of hype behind

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.309 
hold up you'll get a lot of hype behind
you<00:02:55.910> so<00:02:56.120> you'll<00:02:56.269> be<00:02:56.390> able<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.569> travel<00:02:57.019> much

now some key hits a link if you shake
the<00:04:04.500> ps3<00:04:04.980> pad<00:04:05.219> the<00:04:05.370> sixaxis<00:04:05.730> then<00:04:06.269> you<00:04:06.390> get
