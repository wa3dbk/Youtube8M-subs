00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:20.659
 every resource is boring 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.069
 part of these resources 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:25.449
 it is only necessary to have two meters 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.149
 with the new line 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.429
 for safety at the same limit 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.810
 what took the case 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.849
 rd 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.849
 the artifact 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.340
 with this we just need to open the find 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.550
 obine to ba himself 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.010
 traditional 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.010
 west - the view of computer owners 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.660
 and that the computers connected to our network in this case is the doctor 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.870
 for city test 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.519
 we will download the file and it is not 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:00:59.690
 and out 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.690
 weighing about 415 megabytes 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.630
 so just log in now 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.630
 select the desired file the case in court 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.740
 and drag it on the computer we wish it was 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.190
 after you accepted the shipping terms 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.310
 the person your mac book 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.010
 will receive the terms of receipt 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.250
 I already have 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.250
 initiate the file transfer you wish to 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.090
 let's see how I go if I leave in the Kyoto transfer 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.910
 using 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.910
 he entered 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.470
 apparently is the proposal is very well he said that the state its competitor 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.110
 it was a little better 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.830
 even with the delay 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.280
 in the introduction device removal 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.049
 the pdt did much better than the referee 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.820
 on request the city 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.090
 which demonstrates 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.860
 here the feature is still something very new to be compared with devices 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.559
 which are already available in the market 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:14.729
 the basis of this year 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:16.979
 even with the active wives 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:20.059
 the side has its peculiarities and advantages 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:21.129
 or for example 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.050
 we can connect 2 the older few 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.379
 the years if people are 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.749
 then transferred from and here you want 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:31.760
 he wants to appear 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.559
 because every two cities 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:36.599
 using personal iphone wings 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.010
 are less punctuated last year as in person 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.379
 what we have done yet some factors can be improved 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.649
 and improved 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:49.249
 I do not listen to gusmÃ£o. 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:51.709
 this was a fiasco hypothesis as 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.349
