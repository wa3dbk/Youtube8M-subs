still<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> lot<00:01:21.869> bigger<00:01:22.400> so<00:01:24.500> size-wise<00:01:25.500> he<00:01:25.950> is

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040

they<00:01:32.100> bumped<00:01:32.430> down<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.759> price<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.210> guy

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
they bumped down the price on this guy

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.690 
they bumped down the price on this guy
since<00:01:33.659> he's<00:01:33.810> kind<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.290> small<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:34.920> not<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> big

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
since he's kind of small but not a big

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.730 
since he's kind of small but not a big
deal<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.180> he's<00:01:36.810> definitely<00:01:36.960> still<00:01:37.439> worth<00:01:37.619> it

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
deal but he's definitely still worth it

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.490 
deal but he's definitely still worth it
he's<00:01:38.400> 22<00:01:38.850> moving<00:01:39.150> parts<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.840> he<00:01:40.259> has<00:01:40.350> good

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
he's 22 moving parts so he has good

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.319 
he's 22 moving parts so he has good
articulation<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:41.340> obviously<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.970> fact<00:01:42.180> that

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
articulation but obviously the fact that

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.539 
articulation but obviously the fact that
he<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.689> really<00:01:43.200> different<00:01:43.470> figure<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.250> that

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
he is a really different figure and that

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.910 
he is a really different figure and that
he<00:01:45.479> doesn't<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.720> improved<00:01:46.259> joints<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
he doesn't have improved joints and

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.170 
he doesn't have improved joints and
since<00:01:47.130> he's<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> grunt<00:01:47.579> has<00:01:47.729> really<00:01:48.060> really

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
since he's a grunt has really really

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.030 
since he's a grunt has really really
small<00:01:48.630> legs<00:01:48.960> everything<00:01:49.320> he's<00:01:49.649> prone<00:01:50.009> to

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
small legs everything he's prone to

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.679 
small legs everything he's prone to
breaking<00:01:50.610> mine<00:01:51.390> hasn't<00:01:51.860> but<00:01:53.360> something<00:01:54.360> some

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
breaking mine hasn't but something some

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.060 
breaking mine hasn't but something some
things<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.990> could<00:01:55.079> do<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.560> would<00:01:55.740> cause

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
things that I could do that would cause

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.600 
things that I could do that would cause
it<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.880> fact<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.210> right<00:01:57.719> here<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.610> so

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
it in the fact that right here is so

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.700 
it in the fact that right here is so
stiff<00:01:59.909> and<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.119> won't<00:02:00.270> Bend<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:00.899> if<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.380> tried

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
stiff and it won't Bend so if I I tried

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.980 
stiff and it won't Bend so if I I tried
to<00:02:01.799> bending<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.159> it'll<00:02:02.369> bill<00:02:02.700> snap<00:02:03.000> his

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
to bending it and it'll bill snap his

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.399 
to bending it and it'll bill snap his
knee<00:02:04.579> was<00:02:05.579> really<00:02:06.180> really<00:02:06.450> having<00:02:06.960> problems

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
knee was really really having problems

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.869 
knee was really really having problems
and<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.619> wasn't<00:02:07.950> bending<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.429> felt<00:02:08.610> like<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.759> was

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
and it wasn't bending I felt like it was

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.490 
and it wasn't bending I felt like it was
in<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.030> snap<00:02:09.270> but<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.509> kind<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.020> forced<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.410> was

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
in a snap but I kind of forced it was

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.930 
in a snap but I kind of forced it was
approached<00:02:10.920> have<00:02:11.220> done<00:02:11.400> because<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.640> kind<00:02:11.849> of

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
approached have done because I kind of

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.010 
approached have done because I kind of
strained<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.569> and

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
strained it and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.570 
strained it and
kind<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.500> twisted<00:02:13.980> up<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.190> little<00:02:14.400> bit<00:02:14.490> of

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
kind of twisted up a little bit of

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.750 
kind of twisted up a little bit of
plastic<00:02:14.790> but<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.240> still<00:02:15.570> works<00:02:15.840> fine<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.640> was

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
plastic but it still works fine so I was

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.890 
plastic but it still works fine so I was
having<00:02:17.970> those<00:02:18.090> two<00:02:18.270> problems<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.780> that's

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
having those two problems and that's

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.480 
having those two problems and that's
really<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.230> other<00:02:19.620> than<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:19.860> he<00:02:20.130> that<00:02:20.280> he's

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
really it other than that he that he's

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.920 
really it other than that he that he's
just<00:02:20.730> he's<00:02:20.970> fine<00:02:21.180> he's<00:02:21.510> good<00:02:21.660> articulation

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
just he's fine he's good articulation

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.520 
just he's fine he's good articulation
otherwise<00:02:23.570> he<00:02:24.570> can<00:02:24.720> stand<00:02:24.930> up<00:02:25.140> pretty<00:02:25.380> well

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
otherwise he can stand up pretty well

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.100 
otherwise he can stand up pretty well
you<00:02:26.160> just<00:02:26.340> have<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.520> kind<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.760> find<00:02:26.940> him<00:02:27.210> hippos

only hold it with one hand due to the

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.469 
only hold it with one hand due to the
articulation<00:04:50.800> it<00:04:51.099> lacks<00:04:51.400> so<00:04:52.210> we<00:04:52.300> kind<00:04:52.449> of

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
articulation it lacks so we kind of

this hand is more open and meant to kind
of<00:04:57.490> wrap<00:04:57.639> around<00:04:57.699> that<00:04:58.240> but<00:04:58.449> it<00:04:58.569> can't<00:04:58.960> happen

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
of wrap around that but it can't happen

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.709 
of wrap around that but it can't happen
but<00:05:00.430> otherwise<00:05:00.669> it's<00:05:00.999> still<00:05:01.180> really<00:05:01.509> really
