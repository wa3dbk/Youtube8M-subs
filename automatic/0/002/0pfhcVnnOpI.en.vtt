to shut shape system now in the event of
this<00:00:13.590> machine<00:00:13.949> is<00:00:13.980> it's<00:00:14.400> great<00:00:14.639> for<00:00:15.800> studios

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
this machine is it's great for studios

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.749 
this machine is it's great for studios
Ireland<00:00:17.880> or<00:00:18.539> even<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.020> commercial<00:00:19.529> juice

great<00:00:20.759> thing<00:00:20.939> about<00:00:21.089> this<00:00:21.240> machine<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.660> that

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
great thing about this machine is that

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.620 
great thing about this machine is that
it<00:00:22.320> has<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.500> small<00:00:22.919> footprint<00:00:24.500> and<00:00:25.849> you<00:00:26.849> may<00:00:27.060> be

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
it has a small footprint and you may be

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.480 
it has a small footprint and you may be
looking<00:00:27.749> at<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.080> thinking<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:29.310> looks

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
looking at it thinking that it looks

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.939 
looking at it thinking that it looks
very<00:00:29.579> similar<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.179> cable<00:00:30.660> crossover<00:00:30.859> but<00:00:31.859> it

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
very similar to a cable crossover but it

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.700 
very similar to a cable crossover but it
has<00:00:32.099> much<00:00:32.759> more<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.329> offer<00:00:33.480> than<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.320> cable

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
has much more to offer than a cable

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.529 
has much more to offer than a cable
crossover<00:00:34.940> meaning<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.120> we<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.420> an

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539 
crossover meaning that we have an

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.630 
crossover meaning that we have an
optional<00:00:36.989> bench<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.770> can<00:00:37.980> use<00:00:38.190> for

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
optional bench that you can use for

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.819 
optional bench that you can use for
chess<00:00:39.270> pressing<00:00:39.690> movements<00:00:40.140> shoulder

or backup movements now most people

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.000 
or backup movements now most people
think<00:00:48.030> because<00:00:48.269> the<00:00:48.539> compact<00:00:49.019> range<00:00:49.289> or<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
think because the compact range or the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.920 
think because the compact range or the
compact<00:00:50.460> foot<00:00:50.609> play<00:00:50.820> via<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.629> cable

compact foot play via the cable

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.119 
compact foot play via the cable
crossover<00:00:53.269> is<00:00:54.269> a<00:00:54.359> disadvantage<00:00:55.140> here<00:00:55.170> most

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
crossover is a disadvantage here most

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.790 
crossover is a disadvantage here most
people<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:57.059> clubs<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.230> gyms<00:00:58.469> are<00:00:58.649> used

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
people that have clubs and gyms are used

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.549 
people that have clubs and gyms are used
to<00:00:58.949> using<00:00:59.129> cable<00:00:59.609> crossovers<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.320> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
to using cable crossovers that have a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.590 
to using cable crossovers that have a
wide<00:01:01.890> foot<00:01:02.780> play<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:05.060> the<00:01:06.060> tables<00:01:06.450> are

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
wide foot play and the tables are

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.210 
wide foot play and the tables are
located<00:01:07.350> out<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> side<00:01:09.290> it's<00:01:10.290> true<00:01:11.190> that

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
located out to the side it's true that

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.450 
located out to the side it's true that
maybe<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.170> easier<00:01:13.440> to<00:01:13.800> do<00:01:13.980> the<00:01:14.310> position

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
maybe it is easier to do the position

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.890 
maybe it is easier to do the position
because<00:01:14.790> you're<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.150> pushing<00:01:15.360> through<00:01:15.660> a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
because you're just pushing through a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.620 
because you're just pushing through a
straight<00:01:16.170> line<00:01:16.380> line<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.100> motion<00:01:17.510> well<00:01:18.510> this

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
straight line line of motion well this

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.070 
straight line line of motion well this
machine<00:01:18.960> here

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
machine here

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.510 
machine here
we've<00:01:22.080> actually<00:01:22.260> gets<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.770> movement<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.340> just

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
we've actually gets a movement we just

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.150 
we've actually gets a movement we just
have<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.760> change<00:01:24.000> hand<00:01:24.480> positions<00:01:24.980> so<00:01:25.980> it's

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
have to change hand positions so it's

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.890 
have to change hand positions so it's
still<00:01:26.370> a<00:01:26.400> regulate<00:01:27.000> because<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.510> wave<00:01:27.660> is<00:01:27.810> it

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
still a regulate because the wave is it

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.480 
still a regulate because the wave is it
placed<00:01:28.140> out<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:28.530> side<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.890> us<00:01:29.010> we<00:01:29.190> cannot

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
placed out to the side of us we cannot

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.690 
placed out to the side of us we cannot
push<00:01:29.760> it<00:01:29.940> down<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.510> manner<00:01:31.610> get<00:01:32.610> an

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
push it down in this manner get an

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.780 
push it down in this manner get an
effective<00:01:33.060> chest<00:01:33.300> travel<00:01:34.430> what<00:01:35.430> we<00:01:35.520> need<00:01:35.700> to

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
effective chest travel what we need to

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.440 
effective chest travel what we need to
do<00:01:35.910> is<00:01:36.030> work<00:01:36.300> back<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.410> this<00:01:37.530> position<00:01:37.950> here

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
do is work back in this position here

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.650 
do is work back in this position here
and<00:01:39.450> bring<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.870> hands<00:01:40.260> forward<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:41.010> such<00:01:44.660> now

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
and bring the hands forward as such now

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
and bring the hands forward as such now
in<00:01:45.840> effect<00:01:48.530> this<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.680> more<00:01:51.080> isolating<00:01:52.080> for<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
in effect this is more isolating for the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.320 
in effect this is more isolating for the
chest<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.190> a<00:01:53.250> normal<00:01:53.460> cable<00:01:53.759> crossover

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
chest and a normal cable crossover

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.210 
chest and a normal cable crossover
because<00:01:54.450> when<00:01:54.750> I'm<00:01:55.170> able<00:01:55.440> to<00:01:55.680> bring<00:01:55.830> the

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
because when I'm able to bring the

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.980 
because when I'm able to bring the
deltoid<00:01:56.759> trap<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.320> lats<00:01:59.220> push<00:01:59.729> there<00:02:00.000> so

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
deltoid trap in and lats push there so

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.109 
deltoid trap in and lats push there so
you're<00:02:01.140> fine<00:02:01.350> with<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.590> movement<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.940> won't

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
you're fine with this movement you won't

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.290 
you're fine with this movement you won't
be<00:02:03.270> able<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.570> use<00:02:03.690> as<00:02:03.900> much<00:02:04.290> weight<00:02:04.940> with<00:02:05.940> a

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
be able to use as much weight with a

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.630 
be able to use as much weight with a
cable<00:02:06.750> crossover<00:02:07.070> so<00:02:08.070> the<00:02:08.190> advantages<00:02:08.580> here

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
cable crossover so the advantages here

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.219 
cable crossover so the advantages here
is<00:02:08.850> that<00:02:08.970> we<00:02:09.060> don't<00:02:09.149> need<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.479> overspend<00:02:09.959> on

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
is that we don't need to overspend on

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.530 
is that we don't need to overspend on
putting<00:02:10.739> too<00:02:10.920> much<00:02:11.070> weight<00:02:11.130> or<00:02:11.790> spending
