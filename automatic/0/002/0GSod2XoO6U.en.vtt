I'm making in my right now it's the

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.970 
I'm making in my right now it's the
beginning<00:00:06.180> of<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.420> helmet<00:00:06.750> as<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:07.470> can<00:00:07.620> see<00:00:07.830> we

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
beginning of a helmet as you can see we

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.980 
beginning of a helmet as you can see we
started<00:00:08.370> with<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.550> jaw<00:00:08.760> line<00:00:08.940> here<00:00:09.269> can<00:00:09.960> i

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
started with the jaw line here can i

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.089 
started with the jaw line here can i
connect<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.440> two<00:00:10.590> pieces<00:00:11.040> together<00:00:11.690> and

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
connect the two pieces together and

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.530 
connect the two pieces together and
merge<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.309> into<00:00:14.370> one<00:00:14.639> helmet<00:00:14.820> make<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.389> all

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
merge that into one helmet make it all

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.660 
merge that into one helmet make it all
nice<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.080> pretty

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
nice and pretty

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.359 
nice and pretty
then<00:00:18.090> you're<00:00:18.180> gonna<00:00:18.270> duplicate<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:18.960> over<00:00:19.369> so

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
then you're gonna duplicate this over so

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.820 
then you're gonna duplicate this over so
you<00:00:20.430> have<00:00:20.640> two<00:00:20.850> pieces<00:00:21.109> get<00:00:22.109> duplicates<00:00:22.350> you

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
you have two pieces get duplicates you

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.070 
you have two pieces get duplicates you
end<00:00:22.980> up<00:00:23.100> with<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> nice<00:00:23.970> looking<00:00:24.150> helmet<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.960> be

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
end up with a nice looking helmet to be

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.759 
end up with a nice looking helmet to be
combining<00:00:25.769> these<00:00:26.220> two<00:00:26.670> together<00:00:27.680> we're<00:00:28.680> gonna

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
combining these two together we're gonna

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.849 
combining these two together we're gonna
go<00:00:28.920> up<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.099> mesh<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.760> then<00:00:30.240> go<00:00:30.449> combine<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.740> now

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
go up to mesh and then go combine so now

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.500 
go up to mesh and then go combine so now
if<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.009> select<00:00:32.430> one<00:00:32.610> or<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.820> other<00:00:32.940> no<00:00:33.329> matter

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
if we select one or the other no matter

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.620 
if we select one or the other no matter
what<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.350> be<00:00:34.469> selected<00:00:35.329> the<00:00:36.329> next

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
what it's going to be selected the next

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.450 
what it's going to be selected the next
part<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.079> we're<00:00:37.170> gonna<00:00:37.290> be<00:00:37.440> adding<00:00:37.590> some<00:00:37.800> edges

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
part is we're gonna be adding some edges

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.940 
part is we're gonna be adding some edges
along<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.940> side<00:00:39.180> here<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.710> we're<00:00:40.710> just<00:00:40.739> gonna

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
along the side here so we're just gonna

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.150 
along the side here so we're just gonna
go<00:00:41.219> over<00:00:41.370> there<00:00:41.489> select<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> edge<00:00:42.239> tool<00:00:43.160> draw

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
go over there select the edge tool draw

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.810 
go over there select the edge tool draw
one<00:00:44.430> right<00:00:44.670> there<00:00:45.680> draw<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.520> are<00:00:47.640> now

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
one right there draw one so we are now

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.319 
one right there draw one so we are now
adding<00:00:49.370> this<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> other<00:00:50.879> one<00:00:51.120> we're<00:00:51.239> going

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
adding this to the other one we're going

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.479 
adding this to the other one we're going
to<00:00:51.390> go<00:00:51.480> select<00:00:51.989> border<00:00:52.379> edge<00:00:52.590> tool<00:00:52.949> select

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
to go select border edge tool select

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.750 
to go select border edge tool select
this<00:00:53.730> one<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.510> one<00:00:55.460> there<00:00:59.239> oops

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
this one this one there oops

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.310 
this one this one there oops
as<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.090> all<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.270> these<00:01:03.629> all<00:01:03.780> correlate

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
as you can all see these all correlate

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.990 
as you can all see these all correlate
to<00:01:04.530> each<00:01:04.650> other<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.250> one<00:01:05.489> here<00:01:05.729> will<00:01:05.880> be

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
to each other so this one here will be

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.020 
to each other so this one here will be
connecting<00:01:06.420> up<00:01:06.570> there<00:01:06.950> so<00:01:07.950> on<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.460> forth<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
connecting up there so on so forth the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.190 
connecting up there so on so forth the
bottoms<00:01:09.390> will<00:01:09.540> be<00:01:09.659> connecting<00:01:10.049> with<00:01:10.080> each

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
bottoms will be connecting with each

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.249 
bottoms will be connecting with each
other<00:01:11.030> so<00:01:12.030> there<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.780> all<00:01:13.110> that

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
other so there you have all that

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:19.100 
other so there you have all that
connected<00:01:14.030> just<00:01:15.030> go<00:01:15.240> up<00:01:15.420> here<00:01:15.979> mesh<00:01:18.110> bridge

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
connected just go up here mesh bridge

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.420 
connected just go up here mesh bridge
and<00:01:19.970> there<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.330> it

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
and there you have it

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.130 
and there you have it
voila<00:01:23.430> oh<00:01:23.790> I'm<00:01:24.360> actually<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.110> different

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
voila oh I'm actually in a different

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.399 
voila oh I'm actually in a different
view<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.710> changed<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.490> there<00:01:26.909> was<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.360> few<00:01:28.110> too

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
view I changed that there was a few too

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.320 
view I changed that there was a few too
many<00:01:31.159> bridges<00:01:32.159> going<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.640> there<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.149> that<00:01:33.180> it

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
many bridges going on there so that it

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.919 
many bridges going on there so that it
was<00:01:33.509> actually<00:01:33.929> going<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.289> be<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:35.210> little<00:01:36.210> too

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
was actually going to be a little too

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.400 
was actually going to be a little too
much<00:01:37.259> detail<00:01:37.830> I<00:01:38.070> didn't<00:01:38.340> want<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.729> many<00:01:39.410> in

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
much detail I didn't want that many in

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.180 
much detail I didn't want that many in
there<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.310> I'm<00:01:41.399> just<00:01:41.700> gonna<00:01:41.820> go<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.179> to<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
there so I'm just gonna go in to the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.680 
there so I'm just gonna go in to the
vertices<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:44.610> kind<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.970> modify<00:01:45.479> those<00:01:45.660> a

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
vertices and kind of modify those a

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.290 
vertices and kind of modify those a
little<00:01:45.869> bit<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.380> they<00:01:46.500> aren't<00:01:46.679> so<00:01:48.619> well

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
little bit so they aren't so well

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.160 
little bit so they aren't so well
detailed<00:01:51.300> that<00:01:51.390> was<00:01:51.509> gonna<00:01:51.630> be<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.810> little<00:01:52.020> too

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
detailed that was gonna be a little too

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.200 
detailed that was gonna be a little too
scrunched<00:01:52.649> looking<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.789> would<00:01:53.880> kind<00:01:54.030> of

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
scrunched looking and it would kind of

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.200 
scrunched looking and it would kind of
give<00:01:54.330> it<00:01:54.420> an<00:01:54.539> odd<00:01:54.750> exhalation<00:01:55.970> when<00:01:56.970> you<00:01:57.090> got

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
give it an odd exhalation when you got

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.130 
give it an odd exhalation when you got
to<00:01:57.300> render<00:01:57.569> it<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.990> here<00:01:58.319> is<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:58.649> correct

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
to render it so here is the correct

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.480 
to render it so here is the correct
connected<00:02:01.140> looks<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.069> that<00:02:02.220> way<00:02:02.310> it's

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
connected looks so that way it's

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.580 
connected looks so that way it's
actually<00:02:02.670> bridged<00:02:03.450> correctly<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.350> not

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
actually bridged correctly and it's not

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.719 
actually bridged correctly and it's not
all<00:02:04.770> funky<00:02:05.190> like<00:02:06.090> ninety<00:02:07.310> edges<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.429> between

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
all funky like ninety edges in between

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.520 
all funky like ninety edges in between
there<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.090> for<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:09.810> next<00:02:09.869> part<00:02:10.170> we're<00:02:10.440> gonna

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
there so for this next part we're gonna

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.140 
there so for this next part we're gonna

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
be using the append polygon tool to make

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.070 
be using the append polygon tool to make
the<00:02:15.330> faceplate<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.599> I'm<00:02:18.599> gonna<00:02:18.810> start

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
the faceplate of this so I'm gonna start

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:29.309 
the faceplate of this so I'm gonna start
up<00:02:19.230> here<00:02:20.810> drag<00:02:21.810> down

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.489 

all<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.129> way<00:02:30.219> around<00:02:30.340> touching<00:02:30.849> all<00:02:31.180> the

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:31.499 
all the way around touching all the

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:35.520 
all the way around touching all the
different<00:02:32.499> edges<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.329> realizes<00:02:35.319> where

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
different edges and it realizes where

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.110 
different edges and it realizes where
we're<00:02:35.709> trying<00:02:35.859> to<00:02:36.129> go<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:36.609> it's<00:02:36.700> gonna<00:02:36.819> start

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
we're trying to go so it's gonna start

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.300 
we're trying to go so it's gonna start
to<00:02:37.299> connect<00:02:37.629> all<00:02:37.780> those<00:02:37.959> together<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.680> end<00:02:39.129> up

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
to connect all those together you end up

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.449 
to connect all those together you end up
with<00:02:39.370> this<00:02:39.579> I<00:02:39.909> press<00:02:40.329> ENTER<00:02:40.629> to<00:02:40.780> finish<00:02:40.810> that

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
with this I press ENTER to finish that

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.470 
with this I press ENTER to finish that
and<00:02:42.459> voila<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:44.049> have<00:02:44.260> yourself<00:02:44.379> a<00:02:45.480> pretty

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
and voila you have yourself a pretty

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.300 
and voila you have yourself a pretty
much<00:02:46.900> finished<00:02:47.379> helmet<00:02:47.739> all<00:02:47.829> I<00:02:47.859> have<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.129> do<00:02:48.250> is

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
much finished helmet all I have to do is

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.129 
much finished helmet all I have to do is
duplicate<00:02:48.819> londo<00:02:49.180> right<00:02:49.329> so<00:02:49.719> we're<00:02:49.959> going<00:02:50.049> to

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:50.139 
duplicate londo right so we're going to

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.599 
duplicate londo right so we're going to
be<00:02:50.230> actually<00:02:50.530> splitting<00:02:50.859> this<00:02:51.040> here<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.430> make

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
be actually splitting this here to make

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:57.869 
be actually splitting this here to make
a<00:02:53.040> few<00:02:54.040> extra<00:02:54.280> little<00:02:55.030> details<00:02:55.659> in<00:02:55.959> here<00:02:56.879> just

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
a few extra little details in here just

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.610 
a few extra little details in here just
kind<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.239> give<00:02:58.359> it<00:02:58.389> a<00:02:58.540> little<00:02:58.719> more<00:02:58.959> touched<00:02:59.349> up

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
kind of give it a little more touched up

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.050 
kind of give it a little more touched up
look<00:03:00.099> so<00:03:00.519> it<00:03:00.639> looks<00:03:00.849> a<00:03:00.939> little<00:03:01.030> bit<00:03:01.239> nicer

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
look so it looks a little bit nicer

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.420 
look so it looks a little bit nicer
gives<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.329> just<00:03:04.569> a<00:03:05.469> little<00:03:05.650> more<00:03:05.799> detail<00:03:06.250> so

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
gives it just a little more detail so

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.860 
gives it just a little more detail so
you<00:03:06.459> can<00:03:06.549> modify<00:03:06.969> this<00:03:07.150> a<00:03:07.329> little<00:03:07.510> bit<00:03:07.689> better

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
you can modify this a little bit better

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.990 
you can modify this a little bit better
so<00:03:08.109> you<00:03:08.199> don't<00:03:08.349> have<00:03:08.500> no<00:03:09.099> so<00:03:09.340> that's<00:03:09.519> real<00:03:09.730> far

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
so you don't have no so that's real far

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.879 
so you don't have no so that's real far
and<00:03:10.209> we<00:03:10.419> can<00:03:10.569> edit<00:03:10.719> that<00:03:10.959> and<00:03:11.169> whatnot<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:11.799> it

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
and we can edit that and whatnot so it

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.339 
and we can edit that and whatnot so it
doesn't<00:03:12.129> look<00:03:12.250> funky<00:03:12.719> so<00:03:13.719> here<00:03:13.930> we've<00:03:14.079> just

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
doesn't look funky so here we've just

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.740 
doesn't look funky so here we've just
added<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.709> grills<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.489> front<00:03:15.790> you<00:03:16.719> can

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
added the grills to the front you can

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.379 
added the grills to the front you can
see<00:03:16.930> right<00:03:17.260> there<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:19.209> this<00:03:19.480> is<00:03:19.629> going<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.139> be<00:03:20.319> a

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
see right there so this is going to be a

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.879 
see right there so this is going to be a
little<00:03:22.389> more<00:03:22.569> like<00:03:22.719> that<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:23.199> actually<00:03:23.500> make

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
little more like that I actually make

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.770 
little more like that I actually make
this<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.099> little<00:03:24.250> bit<00:03:24.430> better<00:03:24.609> I'm<00:03:25.480> gonna<00:03:25.629> go

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
this a little bit better I'm gonna go

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.129 
this a little bit better I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.109> do<00:03:26.230> this<00:03:27.449> so<00:03:28.449> you<00:03:28.510> guys<00:03:28.689> can<00:03:28.870> see<00:03:29.049> it

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
ahead and do this so you guys can see it

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:30.929 
ahead and do this so you guys can see it
better<00:03:29.319> kind<00:03:29.769> of<00:03:29.829> rendered<00:03:30.219> for<00:03:30.370> you<00:03:30.519> what<00:03:30.849> it

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:30.939 
better kind of rendered for you what it

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:32.490 
better kind of rendered for you what it
looks<00:03:31.120> like<00:03:31.299> it's<00:03:31.629> tougher<00:03:31.989> this<00:03:32.139> far<00:03:32.319> that's

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
looks like it's tougher this far that's

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.619 
looks like it's tougher this far that's
kind<00:03:32.739> of<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.889> fun<00:03:33.040> finishing<00:03:33.699> part<00:03:34.000> we<00:03:34.209> mean

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
kind of the fun finishing part we mean

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.119 
kind of the fun finishing part we mean
there's<00:03:34.840> still<00:03:35.019> tons<00:03:35.229> of<00:03:35.470> work<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.799> do<00:03:35.919> but

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
there's still tons of work to do but

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.129 
there's still tons of work to do but
this<00:03:36.250> is<00:03:36.370> going<00:03:36.549> to<00:03:36.609> be<00:03:36.729> the<00:03:36.970> final<00:03:37.689> part<00:03:37.930> is

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
this is going to be the final part is

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.599 
this is going to be the final part is
mirroring<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:38.650> over<00:03:39.269> so<00:03:40.269> we<00:03:40.359> have<00:03:40.569> our

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
mirroring that over so we have our

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.929 
mirroring that over so we have our
finalized<00:03:42.609> helmet<00:03:44.099> there's<00:03:45.099> obviously<00:03:45.519> a<00:03:45.639> few

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:45.939 
finalized helmet there's obviously a few

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.929 
finalized helmet there's obviously a few
more<00:03:46.150> steps<00:03:46.659> to<00:03:46.930> go<00:03:46.959> but<00:03:47.470> this<00:03:48.159> is<00:03:48.340> you<00:03:48.819> know

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:48.939 
more steps to go but this is you know

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:50.550 
more steps to go but this is you know
for<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.239> most<00:03:49.419> part<00:03:49.569> what<00:03:50.079> its<00:03:50.229> gonna<00:03:50.439> look

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
for the most part what its gonna look

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.619 
for the most part what its gonna look
like<00:03:50.739> there's<00:03:51.549> gonna<00:03:51.669> be<00:03:51.819> few<00:03:51.970> other<00:03:52.090> steps<00:03:52.359> so

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
like there's gonna be few other steps so

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.539 
like there's gonna be few other steps so
obviously<00:03:52.989> modifying<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:54.509> center<00:03:55.509> there<00:03:55.720> so

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
obviously modifying the center there so

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.270 
obviously modifying the center there so
that<00:03:57.549> it's<00:03:57.879> transparent<00:03:58.540> what<00:03:58.870> not<00:03:59.280> texturing

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
that it's transparent what not texturing

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.559 
that it's transparent what not texturing
and<00:04:00.340> so<00:04:00.579> forth<00:04:00.849> but<00:04:01.030> that's<00:04:01.239> kind<00:04:01.479> of<00:04:01.509> the

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
and so forth but that's kind of the

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.810 
and so forth but that's kind of the
basics<00:04:02.500> of<00:04:02.620> making<00:04:02.829> a<00:04:03.280> helmet<00:04:03.699> and<00:04:03.790> Maya<00:04:03.909> there
