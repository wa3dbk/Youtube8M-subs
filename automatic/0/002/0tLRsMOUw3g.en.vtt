00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:13.519
 the fifth and the mayor 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.240
 you have become a style of play 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.439
 the conflict is raging 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.439
 reminds me more of how he started 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.949
 I know that we have on one side and life 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.949
 and on the other side the colonial fleet 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.289
 we had been told that this would be the ultimate battle that it would lead to our 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:35.980
 freedom 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.720
 it was not the truth 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.140
 it's not a lie either 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.950
 it was crazy 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.950
 arranged something 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.350
 my name is val-de-marne 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.570
 and my story starts here in the majority system 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.300
 a system and darkness 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.470
 governed by a consuming ambition 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.860
 immorality 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.870
 a mixture for the least dangerous 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.600
 at the time I had really hit the bottom 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.320
 I was working in this damn mines one to extract dynamite 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.960
 I was at the bottom 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.380
 that's why at the end of the day 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.380
 I prayed that my dreams would be pleasant 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.160
 this night 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
 my prayers were not that soccer 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.230
 the dream starts apart from a guided tour of the system 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.020
 organized by afp 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.020
 first the star of margerie 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.170
 that's when he appears above 9 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.210
 the biggest ship we've ever seen 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.210
 preparing for his first trip 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.290
 and attention 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.290
 hackers can be dangerous to health 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.030
 You see what I mean 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.420
 in a moment 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.240
 our final destination 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.240
 also our starting point 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.600
 Something 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.600
 reborn right on me 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.099
 I did not know what had happened here 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.949
 but nothing had survived 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:21.939
 absolutely nothing 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.149
 near the body 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:27.089
 classical 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:28.609
 who are you 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.519
 confidential 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.629
 tschÃ¼tscher at what is rare 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.879
 v his twitter account 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.209
 follow here 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.369
 I think I am very happy 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.319
 logical victory 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.809
 forever 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:53.809
 henry 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:12.479
 after that I lived every second like it was my last 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:14.889
 I was awake 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.859
 she is well awake 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.259
 I resigned it was time to get to work
