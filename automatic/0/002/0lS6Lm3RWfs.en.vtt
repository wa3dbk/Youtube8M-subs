00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.659
 Navigator company represents 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.599
 turning point in tactics 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.210
 fighting was the emergence of thermal imaging 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.580
 technology in the hands of a soldier no less 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.619
 Thermal imaging devices have had an effect 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.689
 to prepare and conduct a hunt for 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.439
 large beast 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.269
 certainly high cost 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.730
 thermal imagers were natural 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.070
 limiting their massive use and 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.030
 today we are seeing a new milestone in 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.920
 the history of the creation of thermal sights 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.100
 thermal imaging hunting apex xd 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.559
 50 new product from pulsar total in 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.230
 apex family of sights four models and 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.360
 models where 50 among them is 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.390
 flagship and has all the inherent 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.170
 thermal sight advantage he 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.510
 perfectly sees the goal always afternoon by day 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.730
 fog in a completely dark cave or 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.489
 through the smoke screen the truth of dust 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.909
 and then the rule works see the goal 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.290
 can shoot 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.920
 object detection range 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.260
 person for models xd 50 is 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.210
 1200 meters that exceeds all imaginable 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.580
 capabilities of traditional devices 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.159
 night vision and in this case 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.409
 comparison is more than the correct price for 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.850
 sight apex compete directly with 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.280
 traditional pnv 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.530
 usually the characteristic of thermal imaging 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.270
 sight start with micro bolo parameters 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.400
 underground 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.720
 matrix resolution and apex x2 50 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.659
 is 384 by 288 pixels at 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.150
 refresh rate 50 hertz that 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.430
 Provides high quality and smoothly and 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.680
 display of visual information that in 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.689
 case with scopes is paramount 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.280
 value to produce accurate 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.280
 shot and further observation 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.620
 [music] 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.880
 except those that have already become standard for all 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.180
 thermal imaging sights function type 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.310

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.120
 adjust brightness and contrast 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.730
 pictures must be highlighted 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.690
 several unique apex features 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.989
 x 350 mode pio pip picture in picture 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.400
 in this mode the top of the display 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.120
 displays the central part of the total 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.780
 Pictures 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.640
 and in a twofold increase 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.890
 practical meaning is to have 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.049
 possibility of careful aiming without 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.130
 loss of opportunity to observe total 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.910
 action pictures 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.860
 the second innovation is the engineers of the pulsar 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.890
 zeroing frieze allowing technology 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.299
 to target the sight with one cartridge 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.880
 guided by the saved image 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.250
 targets with a hit point 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.690
 ignore a set of a dozen 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.060
 various aiming nets 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.360
 three parameter settings for monitoring 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.680

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.579
 various including silent mode and 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.980
 matrix calibration and the ability 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.290
 connecting external power and shooting 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.700
 video simultaneously and entering 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.709
 bundled wireless remote 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.900
 management allows 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.180
 basic operations without resorting to 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.130
 use of basic controls 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.280
 also one of the most important indicators 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.140
 quality and reliability of apex sights 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.359
 is the manufacturer's warranty 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:32.299
 3 years thermal imaging 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:34.010
 the apex x2 50 has high 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.410
 characteristics allowing 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.980
 detect objects as large as humans 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.959
 at distances up to 1250 meters it 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.450
 multifunctionality and low weight in 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.090
 combined with hermetic make sight 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.519
 truly universal admitting 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.609
 application in any situation and with any 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.609
 weather 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.340
 use of thermal sights 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.040
 goes back to the constant confrontation 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.260
 human being like that completely 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.990
 justified by the possibilities of this 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.580
 technology but with increased availability 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.040
 thermal sights 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.480
 they are already quite familiar 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.480
 part of hunting gear 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.730
 [applause] 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.920
 use of sight apex x2 50 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.840
 ensures safety and high 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.840
 hunter efficiency 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.620
