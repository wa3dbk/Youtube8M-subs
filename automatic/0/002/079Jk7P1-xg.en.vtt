discharge on the Chicago River for a
while<00:05:35.550> I'd<00:05:36.210> say<00:05:36.449> the<00:05:36.509> majority<00:05:36.659> of<00:05:36.960> the<00:05:37.050> time

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
while I'd say the majority of the time

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.399 
while I'd say the majority of the time
and<00:05:38.389> things<00:05:39.389> didn't<00:05:39.659> look<00:05:39.689> too<00:05:39.900> good<00:05:40.050> I<00:05:40.110> mean<00:05:40.349> I

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409 
and things didn't look too good I mean I

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:41.929 
and things didn't look too good I mean I
had<00:05:40.770> an<00:05:40.889> idea<00:05:40.979> of<00:05:41.189> what<00:05:41.370> I<00:05:41.400> wanted<00:05:41.639> to<00:05:41.729> do<00:05:41.909> i

00:05:41.929 --> 00:05:41.939 
had an idea of what I wanted to do i

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:43.730 
had an idea of what I wanted to do i
thought<00:05:42.270> i<00:05:42.300> had<00:05:42.479> a<00:05:42.539> pattern<00:05:42.930> figured<00:05:43.289> out<00:05:43.439> I

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
thought i had a pattern figured out I

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.070 
thought i had a pattern figured out I
thought<00:05:44.550> I<00:05:44.580> think<00:05:44.939> I<00:05:45.120> thought<00:05:45.360> I<00:05:45.389> had<00:05:45.659> an<00:05:45.960> idea

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
thought I think I thought I had an idea

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.480 
thought I think I thought I had an idea
of<00:05:46.469> where<00:05:46.770> the<00:05:46.889> fish<00:05:47.099> are<00:05:47.189> going<00:05:47.339> to<00:05:47.399> be

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
of where the fish are going to be

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.540 
of where the fish are going to be
positioned<00:05:48.110> I<00:05:49.110> really<00:05:49.860> believe<00:05:50.189> that<00:05:50.219> the

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
positioned I really believe that the

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.739 
positioned I really believe that the
fish<00:05:50.729> are<00:05:50.819> going<00:05:50.909> to<00:05:50.969> be<00:05:51.089> in<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:51.270> weeds<00:05:51.479> today

00:05:51.739 --> 00:05:51.749 
fish are going to be in the weeds today

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:53.659 
fish are going to be in the weeds today
so<00:05:51.899> that's<00:05:52.080> why<00:05:52.289> I<00:05:52.319> stuck<00:05:52.889> strictly<00:05:53.399> to<00:05:53.550> that

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
so that's why I stuck strictly to that

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.799 
so that's why I stuck strictly to that
one<00:05:53.879> area<00:05:55.999> couldn't<00:05:56.999> get<00:05:57.089> any<00:05:57.240> takers<00:05:57.449> there

00:05:57.799 --> 00:05:57.809 
one area couldn't get any takers there

00:05:57.809 --> 00:06:00.139 
one area couldn't get any takers there
so<00:05:58.139> we<00:05:59.039> tried<00:05:59.249> for<00:05:59.460> carp<00:05:59.639> for<00:05:59.819> a<00:05:59.879> little<00:05:59.999> while

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:00.149 
so we tried for carp for a little while

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:03.139 
so we tried for carp for a little while
we<00:06:00.389> did<00:06:00.839> get<00:06:00.990> a<00:06:01.050> few<00:06:01.110> taps<00:06:01.909> we<00:06:02.909> definitely

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:03.149 
we did get a few taps we definitely

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:04.429
