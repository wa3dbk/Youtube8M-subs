with<00:00:26.460> striker<00:00:26.730> because<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.210> think<00:00:27.500> strikers<00:00:28.500> a

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
with striker because I think strikers a

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.109

little bit too overpowered and they

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.510 
little bit too overpowered and they
