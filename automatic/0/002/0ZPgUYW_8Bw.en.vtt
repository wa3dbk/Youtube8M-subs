00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.740
 he 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.230
 actually betray your dog first there is 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.730
 the look when you're walking in 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.980
 leave there is the place where you look at this 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.420
 that you want where you look is 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.760
 the place mainly where god tone 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.530
 dog be okay your voice 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.280
 it only serves three things to give the 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.650
 command before satan gently 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:05.930
 encourage or congratulate a very very 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:08.869
 well super g is not there to make a 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.660
 say no your voice is there only for 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.430
 to make advance for example after 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.160
 ap ap ap ap ap and as soon as you have what you 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.479
 want it's there to bravo super and then 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.640
 so now the problem is the 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.369
 hands it's me I have a hand that goes 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.540
 to be on lie to adjust it's to 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.920
 to say that I especially did not want to try 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.700
 to bring him back to force him to put himself 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.170
 to stop 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.520
 I absolutely have to adjust 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.500
 so that at the moment it does shine 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.270
 not to my tree and ben I'm going to create a 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.979
 imbalance that lasted a quarter of jose 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.590
 especially not too much to hold the dog so if 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:40.850
 I do before an amp here is my dear 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.960
 that's ok yeah so go along it 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.530
 must be adjusted 1 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.920
 here it is you have to put the 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.880
 in time this is very very well puffy and 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.890
 so 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.680
 so when you are with the dog he 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.030
 is imperative that he feels is 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.890
 not retained but then you will tell me 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.970
 yes but then my kind of thing for 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.530
 bring back dog I do not bring back the dog 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.960
 he chooses either 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.460
 stop bravo my son that's great either 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.380
 he's moving and hyper balanced 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.200
 it's comfortable to stop 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.910
 uncomfortable to continue agreeing so 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.190
 if you pull it backwards that 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.760
 becomes uncomfortable to stop see 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.680
 what I mean 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.970
 if you recognize it race is 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.860
 uncomfortable to stop so you have to 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.040
 imperative that you understand that I 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.180
 must not hold him back before Sufi way very 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.930
 well so he is moving forward 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:31.370

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.549
 to be restrained which I am really 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.170

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:48.880

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:59.230

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.189
 so I invite your cats to be at 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.450

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.310
 well then watch out i'm going to give 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.150
 my release order which means that 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.549
 dogs can gallop 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.030
 so I'm going to do go it's over they 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.030
 have the right to die 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.020
 in the walk we go in the woods 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.220
 to be having a dog that will move forward when 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.670
 we ask him to stop when we 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.280
 request 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.390
 and then come to a standstill see clear when 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.900
 I do not want him to eat something 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.900
 alarm 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.300
 if we ever after after walking in 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.100
 foot walk or go with it or do it there 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.230
 that's going to be our moors and to his 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.640
 dog to tell him the horror 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.030
 comfortable is pasted next to my 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.590
 leg in an academic way of 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.910
 academic way really it's going to be 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.220
 to actually have the cat that sticks the 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.120
 head on the hip but I do not 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.800
 do not look for that I just want 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.389
 have a dog that is just level 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.910
 of my foot and who stays at this level 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.740
 so for that the order is very simple what 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.050
 no longer before satan gently the 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.030
 road it's going to be I'm going to tell 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.680
 left from the left as soon as I have to 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.330
 left if he has both legs 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.160
 if he voluntarily has both paws at 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.169
 level of my left leg I am super 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.940
 happy if I stop he has to stop 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.979
 if I leave again by the goal is in 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.300
 no case had to learn to walk on foot 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.190
 in fact the goal is to make him 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.290
 understand that when I'm doing left 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.950
 if he puts his feet there 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.479
 willingly it's super comfortable 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.910
 so when I'm going to be with a ton 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.800
 this is my darling they are arrested 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.380
 that I be arrested at mans rule 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.800
 always the same since if I do a 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.840
 ringworm 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.289
 he must stick next to the leg bravo 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.390
 my darling super if he is not attentive 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.850
 I change direction I stop 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:16.680
 he must stick brown to the you can 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.680
 quite rewarded the dog
