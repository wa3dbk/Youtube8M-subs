games<00:02:14.660> under<00:02:15.290> your<00:02:15.500> belt<00:02:15.739> I<00:02:16.069> believe<00:02:16.700> they

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
games under your belt I believe they

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.030 
games under your belt I believe they
should<00:02:16.910> at<00:02:17.239> least<00:02:17.450> bring<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.410> memory<00:02:18.769> card

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040

now<00:02:24.800> let's<00:02:25.519> talk<00:02:25.730> about<00:02:25.940> those<00:02:26.300> six<00:02:26.660> games

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
now let's talk about those six games

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.539 
now let's talk about those six games
honestly<00:02:29.410> Sony's<00:02:30.410> being<00:02:30.709> cheap<00:02:31.040> in<00:02:31.250> my

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
honestly Sony's being cheap in my

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.380 
honestly Sony's being cheap in my
opinion<00:02:32.000> those<00:02:32.989> games<00:02:33.379> are<00:02:33.680> old<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.700> would

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
opinion those games are old and would

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.110 
opinion those games are old and would
probably<00:02:36.049> only<00:02:36.230> interest<00:02:36.860> real<00:02:37.160> LEGO<00:02:37.760> fans

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
probably only interest real LEGO fans

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.240 
probably only interest real LEGO fans
perhaps<00:02:38.930> they're<00:02:39.200> doing<00:02:39.500> this<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.860> lower<00:02:40.010> the

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
perhaps they're doing this to lower the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.880 
perhaps they're doing this to lower the
price<00:02:40.489> of<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:40.819> bundle<00:02:41.150> but<00:02:41.510> they<00:02:41.720> are<00:02:41.900> only<00:02:42.110> DS

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890

and I think the the Indiana Jones one I

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.940 
and I think the the Indiana Jones one I
think<00:02:55.700> that's<00:02:55.940> also<00:02:56.299> a<00:02:56.690> console<00:02:57.290> port<00:02:57.530> with

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
think that's also a console port with

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.250 
think that's also a console port with
why<00:02:58.190> those<00:02:58.910> games<00:02:59.180> are<00:02:59.360> good<00:02:59.510> like<00:02:59.840> I<00:02:59.989> said

why those games are good like I said

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.490 
why those games are good like I said
they<00:03:00.530> are<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.769> console<00:03:01.400> port<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:02.079> a<00:03:03.079> much

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
they are the console port and a much

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.400 
they are the console port and a much
great<00:03:03.739> experience<00:03:04.280> on<00:03:04.629> would<00:03:05.629> be<00:03:05.660> for<00:03:06.140> the
