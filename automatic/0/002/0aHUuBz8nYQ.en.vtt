00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
gamepad motion controls are driving is

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.300 
gamepad motion controls are driving is
still<00:00:21.510> stupid<00:00:22.350> but<00:00:22.500> they<00:00:22.619> play<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:22.949> set<00:00:23.189> to

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
still stupid but they play that set to

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.790 
still stupid but they play that set to
OFF<00:00:23.490> by<00:00:23.850> default<00:00:24.269> both<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.050> gamepad<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.500> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
OFF by default both the gamepad and the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.009 
OFF by default both the gamepad and the
pro<00:00:26.039> controller<00:00:26.430> work<00:00:26.640> great<00:00:27.119> for<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:27.900> you

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
pro controller work great for it so you

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.330 
pro controller work great for it so you
won't<00:00:28.080> have<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.320> worry<00:00:28.500> about<00:00:28.619> discomfort

updated for Mario Kart 8 I actually

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.000 
updated for Mario Kart 8 I actually
really<00:00:36.870> liked<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> lot<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> new<00:00:37.530> courses

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
really liked a lot of the new courses

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.190 
really liked a lot of the new courses
the<00:00:38.399> important<00:00:38.850> one<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.030> cool<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.629> cloud<00:00:39.899> one

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
the important one is cool the cloud one

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.840 
the important one is cool the cloud one
is<00:00:40.350> cool<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.920> didn't<00:00:41.399> feel<00:00:41.520> like<00:00:41.550> there<00:00:41.730> were

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
is cool I didn't feel like there were

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.479 
is cool I didn't feel like there were
any<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.329> disliked<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.770> classic<00:00:44.160> courses

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
any that I disliked the classic courses

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.549 
any that I disliked the classic courses
don't<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> best<00:00:45.210> selection<00:00:45.690> probably

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
don't have the best selection probably

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.990 
don't have the best selection probably
because<00:00:46.829> they've<00:00:47.039> already<00:00:47.219> used<00:00:47.550> most<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
because they've already used most of the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.389 
because they've already used most of the
good<00:00:48.210> ones<00:00:48.360> for<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.780> previous<00:00:49.170> games<00:00:49.440> plus

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
good ones for the previous games plus

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.160 
good ones for the previous games plus
like<00:00:50.579> three<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.059> them<00:00:51.180> are<00:00:51.270> from<00:00:51.300> Mario<00:00:51.690> Kart<00:00:51.930> 7

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
like three of them are from Mario Kart 7

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.110 
like three of them are from Mario Kart 7
which<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:53.100> got<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> couple<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.789> years<00:00:53.969> ago

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
which we just got a couple of years ago

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.020 
which we just got a couple of years ago
there<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.110> one<00:00:55.559> standout<00:00:56.129> classic<00:00:56.760> course

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
there is one standout classic course

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.479 
there is one standout classic course
returning<00:00:57.539> from<00:00:57.660> Mario<00:00:58.020> Kart<00:00:58.230> 64<00:00:58.410> which<00:00:59.370> I

returning from Mario Kart 64 which I

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.700 
returning from Mario Kart 64 which I
won't<00:00:59.609> spoil<00:00:59.969> what<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.510> but<00:01:01.079> chances<00:01:01.379> are

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
won't spoil what it is but chances are

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.770 
won't spoil what it is but chances are
you'll<00:01:02.039> be<00:01:02.129> disappointed<00:01:03.120> with<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.359> changes

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
you'll be disappointed with the changes

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.469 
you'll be disappointed with the changes
they<00:01:03.930> made<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.680> new<00:01:05.549> antigravity<00:01:05.939> fits

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
they made to it the new antigravity fits

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.570 
they made to it the new antigravity fits
in<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> courses<00:01:07.020> are<00:01:07.170> cool<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.770> do<00:01:08.100> add<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.460> an

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
in the courses are cool and do add in an

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.670 
in the courses are cool and do add in an
extra<00:01:08.880> layer<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.119> strategy<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:10.320> bump<00:01:10.560> it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
extra layer of strategy you can bump it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.870 
extra layer of strategy you can bump it
to<00:01:10.770> other<00:01:10.890> cards<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.310> give<00:01:11.549> each<00:01:11.640> other<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
to other cards to give each other a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.210 
to other cards to give each other a
speed<00:01:12.270> boost<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.200> also<00:01:13.350> use<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.860> speed

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
speed boost you can also use that speed

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.249 
speed boost you can also use that speed
to<00:01:14.250> force<00:01:14.700> them<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.939> shoot<00:01:15.299> off<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.659> track<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
to force them to shoot off the track a

to force them to shoot off the track a
few<00:01:16.619> courses<00:01:17.070> have<00:01:17.369> bumpers<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.180> track

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
few courses have bumpers in the track

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.140 
few courses have bumpers in the track
itself<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.409> use<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.770> spin<00:01:20.009> off<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.820> it

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
itself you can use to spin off of and it

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.899 
itself you can use to spin off of and it
works<00:01:21.330> well<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.900> those<00:01:22.530> brief<00:01:23.040> anti-gravity

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
works well for those brief anti-gravity

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.969 
works well for those brief anti-gravity
moments<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.689> go<00:01:24.810> from<00:01:25.049> avoiding<00:01:25.350> everything

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
moments you go from avoiding everything

there<00:01:30.299> are<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.509> few<00:01:30.810> new<00:01:31.020> ones<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.680> boomerang

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
there are a few new ones the boomerang

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.219 
there are a few new ones the boomerang
is<00:01:32.159> sweet<00:01:32.939> especially<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.689> get<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> double

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
is sweet especially if you get a double

hit off the piranha plant doesn't seem
as<00:01:36.750> useful<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:38.250> usually<00:01:38.610> ends<00:01:38.729> up<00:01:38.790> giving

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
as useful it usually ends up giving
