00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.009
 Selling 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.320
 Hello everyone 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:15.970
 Is the main Aime La makeup artist Kimura, Junichi Akira 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:20.380
 Today you can achieve professional-quality finish for yourself 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:23.460
 I think that I want to introduce such a base makeup method 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:28.050
 The base makeup that Shu Uemura proposes this season is 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:31.199
 It is natural and transparent shiny skin 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.730
 What is major today is uv under base 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.110
 I want to use is and mu speech 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.110
 Have you been crazy 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:47.850
 When you press it like this 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:49.950
 A upper child comes out, and the diameter of about 2 centimeters is one standard 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.780
 This gloss is 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.820
 Very well 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.820
 It will become creamy when put on the skin 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:04.720
 You will feel the feeling of being gradually added to the skin 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:09.910
 Day, for example, pore correction power is also high 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.530
 Especially in the inside of this person It is a place where the pores are easy to notice. 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.310
 That kind of place 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.950
 Prepare the pores 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.950
 It also has the effect of adjusting skin color unevenness 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:29.520
 Also this groundwork is the color of the beach but it is also on the skin 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:35.210
 I think you can see that the reddish color is gradually added 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.210
 Well I feel like going to extend outwardly from the jigger of face 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:45.100
 My eyes are very thin areas where the skin is thin and easy to live in 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.100
 There is also a relief 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.260
 This is the bottom of my eyes 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.250
 I think there are a lot of people who care about bears 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.250
 Well, it is a knack to put on this side gently so that skin does not move as much as possible 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:10.170
 The rest is the reason for this little flower, so it's a place that tends to be quite a shadow 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:14.130
 It may be okay to repeat it after putting it on once 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:18.110
 As gloss was raised in this state , it is foundation 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.110
 I would like to further enhance Izeya 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:28.570
 The next thing to use is the light valve fluid foundation 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:31.660
 It 's about 574. I'm almost pushing the left side of my body . 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.290
 This foundation has a covering power and 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.880
 It is a foundation that makes the fair compatible 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.550
 It is this sponge that is more characteristic 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.500
 Soft like marshmallow 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:49.620
 The application is very good and the shape is not only unique 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:54.480
 For example , the room comes out very much if attached in this aspect 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:57.490
 In this way, for example , you can suppress care around the nose 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.910
 It has become a very functional sports 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:06.150
 It is about half of the sponge first of all 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:11.140
 We entered the wide eyes to tell as the previous professional finish Kedomo is Tan 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:16.150
 What is the feature of the most professional finish ? 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:22.030
 Part 4 is the thickest part of the skin in the face 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.659
 Furthermore , I think it is very easy to come out with the subject of the person's skin if it is a pore and it is a pore 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.160
 Ne 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:30.590
 So here first 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:33.640
 It is the most important point that you put on so as not to slide 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:38.550
 At first it feels like drawing a circle 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.550
 It is said to be a part of the cheek almost tapping 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.150
 Gradually feeling like going to honor the lightly high 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:48.560
 I will extend the range of painting 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:52.540
 I rather I think it can be seen that the pores have been well-equipped 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:56.740
 The foundation has been reduced by 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:02.460
 It does not go to zero, and you can put a strain on the face line. 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.460
 The face line part is less in volume than the cheek part 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:12.709
 Than put to continue Slide in honor doing the same as doing it is part of the shell 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.060
 The ability to cover the pores is very strong 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.090
 Hey 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.000
 If you do 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:23.900
 Connect the face line 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.900
 More mouth around the amount left in foundation sponge 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.789
 And flowers 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:35.430
 It seems like you've already bought it and slipped it except for you 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.430
 I will find 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:44.560
 Especially with this big mendes and will be under the eyes 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.360
 It is a small eyes here in the becomes difficult with 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.289
 Using this 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.020
 As you paint 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.020
 Just this part of the eyes will fit well 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:05.240
 I'd have to tell just also be very fit to this is florets not ne these grooves 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.240
 You can go 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:16.699
 The original gloss of the skin is maintained 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:16.699
 It is such a finish that covering power and luster were compatible 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.689
 To finish the base makeup 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:26.630
 Use dual fit pressed powder 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:29.020
 I think that the right side and the left side look a little different color 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:32.320
 Here on the right side of the powder Ow 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:36.190
 It is a light powder that reduces sebum 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.199
 The powder on the left side gives moisture to the skin 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:42.060
 It is a powder made by one person 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:42.060
 In uses the right side of the powder 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.100
 Because the brush is thin like this 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.249
 It is a ditch of the nose 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:55.489
 Also the broad side is 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:55.489
 It is very easy to put it on a chick 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:05.280
 This brush is a powder 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:10.700
 I so for us diffused allow's not that Connor is too go is Tsukuwake 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.700
 We will seek it will continue to use the left of the powder is now Te 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.649
 play 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:24.510
 It is easy to dry around the eyes here 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:28.900
 We have used the powder with moisturizing force 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:34.030
 A more transparent feeling is added when the color of this purple changes 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.660
 T easily collapse if you finish the will and I in shiny base makeup in such a society 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.620
 zone 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:43.270
 Or when the makeup collapse easily Nemawari stop this alone 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:45.510
 I can enhance the luster 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:49.440
 What did you think 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:53.070
 We want you to realize the finish of this professional grade 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:56.569
 The biggest feature of this base makeup is part 4 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:07:00.340
 Tap the instep part firmly with this sponge 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:03.430
 I raise the cover force this part gives firmly 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:08.979
 The other part is lightly fitted 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:09.969
 The place where it should be suppressed, and the place where it becomes familiar, is the point where this strength to adapt is the largest point 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:15.309
 Will be 

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:18.139
 I think that there are many people who came for the first time how to put on this foundation, but this is everyone 

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:21.520
 It is an easy way to put on practice 

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:27.990
 Practice by all means 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.990
 Please to realize everyone like of base makeup the best ever finish
