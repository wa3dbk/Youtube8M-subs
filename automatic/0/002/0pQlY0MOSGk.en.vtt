00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
but it's okay for a car his overall look

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.060 
but it's okay for a car his overall look
is<00:01:23.810> nice<00:01:24.290> and<00:01:24.800> his<00:01:25.790> weapon<00:01:26.500> which<00:01:27.500> is<00:01:27.710> good<00:01:27.950> the

just<00:01:30.560> Martinelli<00:01:31.250> shield<00:01:31.630> this<00:01:32.630> is<00:01:32.810> a<00:01:32.840> bit

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
just Martinelli shield this is a bit

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.570 
just Martinelli shield this is a bit
lazy<00:01:33.350> because<00:01:33.680> they<00:01:33.860> could<00:01:34.010> have<00:01:34.130> designed<00:01:34.430> an

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
lazy because they could have designed an

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.880 
lazy because they could have designed an
actual<00:01:34.880> weapon<00:01:35.300> they<00:01:35.600> designed<00:01:35.960> a<00:01:36.080> flame<00:01:36.380> but

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
actual weapon they designed a flame but

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.920 
actual weapon they designed a flame but
it<00:01:37.880> would<00:01:38.030> have<00:01:38.090> been<00:01:38.210> better<00:01:38.270> actually<00:01:38.630> just

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
it would have been better actually just

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.380 
it would have been better actually just
putting<00:01:39.200> that<00:01:39.350> as<00:01:39.530> a<00:01:39.560> sword<00:01:39.920> I<00:01:40.190> don't<00:01:41.030> say<00:01:41.180> it's

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
putting that as a sword I don't say it's

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.690 
putting that as a sword I don't say it's
just<00:01:41.540> annoying<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.110> also<00:01:42.380> why<00:01:43.040> is<00:01:43.100> his<00:01:43.370> hands
