00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
this what's with the dead zone there's

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.900 
this what's with the dead zone there's
this<00:03:57.919> horrible<00:03:58.250> dead<00:03:58.669> zone<00:03:58.970> here<00:03:59.299> it's<00:03:59.569> a

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
this horrible dead zone here it's a

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.150 
this horrible dead zone here it's a
10-degree<00:04:01.910> dead<00:04:02.150> zone<00:04:02.419> in<00:04:02.870> kind<00:04:03.590> of<00:04:03.709> where<00:04:03.889> the

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
10-degree dead zone in kind of where the

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.360 
10-degree dead zone in kind of where the
force<00:04:04.519> feedback<00:04:04.790> is<00:04:05.629> kind<00:04:05.989> of<00:04:06.049> loose<00:04:06.290> on<00:04:06.650> the

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
force feedback is kind of loose on the

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.930 
force feedback is kind of loose on the
g27<00:04:07.849> to<00:04:08.329> the<00:04:08.449> centred<00:04:08.840> area<00:04:09.319> how<00:04:10.250> you<00:04:10.310> fix<00:04:10.730> that

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
g27 to the centred area how you fix that

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.119 
g27 to the centred area how you fix that
is<00:04:11.379> essentially<00:04:12.379> this<00:04:12.650> script<00:04:12.949> actually

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
is essentially this script actually

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.250 
is essentially this script actually
isn't<00:04:13.609> running<00:04:13.940> you've<00:04:14.269> only<00:04:14.419> opened<00:04:14.870> it<00:04:14.989> you

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
isn't running you've only opened it you

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.580 
isn't running you've only opened it you
need<00:04:15.500> to<00:04:15.709> go<00:04:16.099> into<00:04:16.430> X<00:04:17.299> aim<00:04:17.840> and<00:04:18.169> go<00:04:18.380> to<00:04:18.440> the

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
need to go into X aim and go to the

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.520 
need to go into X aim and go to the
layout<00:04:18.979> options<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:19.820> hit<00:04:20.180> load<00:04:20.630> GP<00:04:21.200> scripts

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
layout options and hit load GP scripts

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.650 
layout options and hit load GP scripts
and<00:04:22.070> it'll<00:04:22.250> say<00:04:22.340> a<00:04:22.370> bunch<00:04:22.580> of<00:04:22.700> stuff

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
and it'll say a bunch of stuff

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.320 
and it'll say a bunch of stuff
zero<00:04:23.960> warnings<00:04:24.380> awesome<00:04:25.010> and<00:04:25.370> then<00:04:26.090> you<00:04:26.210> go

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
zero warnings awesome and then you go

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.480 
zero warnings awesome and then you go
back<00:04:26.540> to<00:04:26.660> your<00:04:26.780> game<00:04:26.990> and<00:04:27.020> suddenly<00:04:27.410> all<00:04:28.130> my

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
back to your game and suddenly all my

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.880 
back to your game and suddenly all my
goodness<00:04:28.730> it<00:04:29.420> does<00:04:29.960> like<00:04:30.170> my<00:04:30.410> new<00:04:30.650> little

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
goodness it does like my new little

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.880 
goodness it does like my new little
turns<00:04:31.280> when<00:04:31.790> I<00:04:31.820> do<00:04:31.940> that<00:04:32.210> it<00:04:32.660> actually<00:04:33.620> is

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
turns when I do that it actually is

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.610 
turns when I do that it actually is
reacting<00:04:34.490> and<00:04:34.970> I<00:04:35.210> can<00:04:35.420> use<00:04:36.260> the<00:04:36.470> wheel

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
reacting and I can use the wheel

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.870 
reacting and I can use the wheel
completely<00:04:37.280> correctly<00:04:37.910> yay<00:04:39.010> so<00:04:40.010> now<00:04:40.670> you're

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
completely correctly yay so now you're

completely correctly yay so now you're
ready<00:04:41.030> to<00:04:41.150> race<00:04:41.470> so<00:04:42.470> essentially<00:04:43.250> that's<00:04:43.430> all

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
ready to race so essentially that's all

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.760 
ready to race so essentially that's all
that<00:04:44.300> I<00:04:44.510> have<00:04:44.690> figured<00:04:44.900> out<00:04:45.140> I<00:04:45.350> hope<00:04:45.560> that

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
that I have figured out I hope that

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.430 
that I have figured out I hope that
helps<00:04:46.040> people<00:04:46.340> if<00:04:46.610> this<00:04:47.240> is<00:04:47.450> your<00:04:47.810> first<00:04:48.140> time
