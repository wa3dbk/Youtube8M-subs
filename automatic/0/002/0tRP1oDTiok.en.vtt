that let's see how big a hard right we

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.150 
that let's see how big a hard right we
have<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:06.000> exit<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> dose<00:02:06.860> we're<00:02:07.860> going<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.009> do

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
a 10 meg hard drive and that will be an

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.970 
a 10 meg hard drive and that will be an
ide<00:02:21.209> drive<00:02:21.570> because<00:02:21.959> this<00:02:22.290> does<00:02:22.500> not<00:02:22.620> have<00:02:22.830> any

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
ide drive because this does not have any

ide drive because this does not have any
scuzzy<00:02:23.250> connectors<00:02:23.959> so<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.140> will<00:02:25.290> be<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.440> 10

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090
