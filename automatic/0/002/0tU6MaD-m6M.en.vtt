00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
 and the twins are the names of those who created it 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.420
 don't know 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.069
 The government has its own conclusions for the United States, but they 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.389
 don't let anyone else explore this 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.090
 tragedy they said that three thousand 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.899
 man they all died 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:16.059
 but if of course we grieve right away 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.259
 expressed our condolences 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.869
 but it was a pretext for them to carry in 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.619
 ck to the middle east 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.329
 already hundreds of thousands of people died under the slogan 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.489
 fighting terrorism and every day they 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.720
 die and it is not known when it will end 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.859
 oga frost 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.890
 pakistan afghanistan and iraq 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.560
 should die 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.490
 from the moment foreign troops 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.240
 entered our region 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.630
 facts and terrorism have increased the margin 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.130
 operations idea of ​​expansion and 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.300
 colonialism 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.380
 not all terror tournaments 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.930
 Ahmadinejad often 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.620
 postwar dissatisfaction 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.620
 Tehran 43 such Iran 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.010
 among them also wants 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.120
 but what obviously haunts the president 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.120
 Iran This State Creation 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.110
 we often even call ourselves 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.350
 here is net profit 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.990
 our 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.590
 and close states to somewhere north 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.590
 precisely alliance 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.750
 edges and american influence 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.609
 we made a lot of noise at one time made noise 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:28.309
 the statement that the farewell survived 

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:30.139
 the world must be wiped out soon 

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:33.359
 will live without us and israel a percentage in 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.929
 different interpretations 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.210
 President rated as 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.880
 aggressively intend from your country year 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.070
 as explained in the opposition today 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.670
 as soon as we but 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.880
 I think we should go back 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.240
 back and see why this mode was 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.160
 created in the middle east 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.820
 during the second world war and 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.080
 Jews were cruelly persecuted in Europe 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.190
 the war was mainly in Europe during the day she was waged 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.270
 European governments 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.810
 but why compensation for this tragedy and 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.520
 the Jewish people should have gotten 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.659
 on Palestinian lands due to 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:06.990
 Palestinian people 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.429
 what role in the second world war played 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.040
 general Palestinian people 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.560
 how and why now the earth should be 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.880
 occupied in the second question is 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.480
 if this is a historical event why 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.890
 politicians are so sensitive 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.560
 relate to this question was 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.260
 half empty 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.590
 they don't let that already expressed 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.640
 your opinions on this 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.130
 historical event why am we 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.130
 allow questioning postulates 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.599
 religions physics and even mathematics 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.579
 we allow even to doubt that 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.599
 two by two is four 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.420
 but not allowed to study for a long time 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.540
 students of the same historical 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.580
 events means there is some kind of key 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.159
 the question is for understanding 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.909
 post-war device not 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:48.760
 get divorced 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.370
 they created some kind of excuse for playing under 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.709
 this pretext was occupied 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.420
 Palestine 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.970
 rubles over sixty years 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.759
 kill people said Putin 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:58.729
 we will not 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:00.239
 ginger also we say that 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.369
 aggressive thinking thinking destruction 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:04.509
 other people 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:07.059
 here it must be destroyed previously neither 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:10.459
 strange ideology leading to a dead end 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.759
 it will be in favor of humanity 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.649
 but they are interested in 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:16.589
 quote my words to your liking 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.379
 misinterpret her data I said when 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.809
 expansionary thinking will be destroyed 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:24.389
 then everyone will live together their peace is not 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.469
 only in our region and its all 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:27.189
 the world 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:29.379
 and people are starting to realize that size 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.230
 waking up realizing where the truth is and where is the lie 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.980
 buy it is a problem for those who want to rule 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.259
 the old fashioned world 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:37.819
 Bragin 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.509
 after presidential elections tehran 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:42.509
 was like opposition maidan 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:46.029
 Iranian democracy in action 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:49.649
 however dialogue with the opposition 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.269
 the other day one of the opposition leaders 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.379

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.379

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.879
 riots that were on 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.040
 The streets of Iranian cities and capitals in 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.659
 Tehran after presidential 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.299
 election it seemed that the situation in the country 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.309
 destabilized 

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:17.829
 how do you rate now 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.499
 domestic political stability 

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:20.809
 situation in iran 

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:21.720
 and 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.380
 how do you line up run 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.809
 positions 

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:27.649
 lte leaks budargin look and wounds 

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:30.400
 very big country and free country 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.710
 we have different views different 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.520
 aspiration 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.009
 he is on free elections naturally 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.129
 that someone for someone against children and 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.960
 Of course there is always someone 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.409
 broke the law 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:44.229
 but the court of Kiev is engaged in it earlier with us 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:45.179
 and political stability 

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:48.460
 security and independence 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.780
 Artyomov those countries which against us we 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.780
 interested in having questions 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.389
 positions did not leave the front pages 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.110
 they constructed themselves in 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.400
 head development Iranian with gain 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.050
 do not want it to be so 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.440
 so that Iran would be right now 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.569
 split destroyed so far but fortunately it 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:08.449
 will not happen 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.509
 by the way iran nowhere outside the country 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.110
 Armenia sending a car vaz with us 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.779
 there is no one hundred percent anywhere 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:16.770
 Our neighboring countries are 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.349
 troops of other states 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:20.830

 their defeats and the collapse in afghanistan and in 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.589
