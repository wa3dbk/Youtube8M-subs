guns here much more powerful and I was

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.890 
guns here much more powerful and I was
suspect<00:00:20.760> as<00:00:20.939> probably<00:00:21.210> because<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.660> maps

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.140 
suspect as probably because of the maps
here<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:22.830> confined<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.490> everything<00:00:23.820> they

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
here and so confined and everything they

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.849 
here and so confined and everything they
have<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.449> bump<00:00:24.689> up<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> power<00:00:25.170> on<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.590> because

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
have to bump up the power on it because

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.620 
have to bump up the power on it because
it's<00:00:26.609> really<00:00:26.820> hard<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.150> get<00:00:27.269> any<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.539> these

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.740 
up nosed here but look how my
killstreaks<00:01:01.530> already<00:01:02.129> setting<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.789> where<00:01:03.719> I

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
killstreaks already setting I where I

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.299 
killstreaks already setting I where I
went<00:01:03.870> through<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> malts<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.589> out<00:01:04.769> resets<00:01:05.220> and

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
went through a malts and out resets and

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.830 
went through a malts and out resets and
even<00:01:05.580> when<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.729> take<00:01:05.909> positions<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.630> get

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
even when you take positions you get

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.440 
even when you take positions you get
basically<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.350> kill<00:01:07.680> credit<00:01:08.250> take<00:01:09.000> position

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
basically a kill credit take position

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.390

can<00:01:09.570> see<00:01:09.780> here<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.380> get<00:01:10.590> another<00:01:11.100> kill

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
can see here and I get another kill

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.330 
can see here and I get another kill
credit<00:01:11.729> for<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.659> that's<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.960> new<00:01:13.340> new

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340
