00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
from the dollar store and it's a light

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.440 
from the dollar store and it's a light
grade<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.379> Steel<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.760> all<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.090> did<00:02:37.180> was<00:02:37.329> use

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
grade of Steel and all I did was use

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.009 
grade of Steel and all I did was use
some<00:02:38.079> of<00:02:38.230> these<00:02:38.760> wire<00:02:39.760> ties<00:02:40.090> from<00:02:40.569> sandwich

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
some of these wire ties from sandwich

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.930 
some of these wire ties from sandwich
bags<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.650> some<00:02:42.430> construction<00:02:43.299> or<00:02:43.720> mason<00:02:44.079> line

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
bags and some construction or mason line

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.420 
bags and some construction or mason line
so<00:02:45.940> we<00:02:46.750> had<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.930> 5<00:02:47.200> pound<00:02:47.409> weight<00:02:47.560> on<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.190> held

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
so we had a 5 pound weight on it it held

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.740 
so we had a 5 pound weight on it it held
the<00:02:48.519> weight<00:02:48.610> no<00:02:48.790> problem<00:02:49.239> there<00:02:49.390> was<00:02:49.450> a<00:02:49.510> little

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
the weight no problem there was a little

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.140 
the weight no problem there was a little
spring<00:02:50.049> but<00:02:50.560> this<00:02:50.709> is<00:02:50.890> very<00:02:51.400> durable<00:02:51.730> and

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
spring but this is very durable and

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.000 
spring but this is very durable and
what's<00:02:52.930> very<00:02:53.019> nice<00:02:53.319> is<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.829> dual

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
what's very nice is that the dual

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.309 
what's very nice is that the dual
function<00:02:54.430> on<00:02:54.549> this<00:02:54.730> is<00:02:55.659> that<00:02:55.900> this<00:02:56.019> can<00:02:56.200> be

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
function on this is that this can be

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.369 
function on this is that this can be
used<00:02:56.500> on<00:02:56.680> top<00:02:56.950> of<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.280> wood<00:02:57.489> fire<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:58.180> cook<00:02:58.450> so

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
used on top of a wood fire to cook so

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.410 
used on top of a wood fire to cook so
not<00:02:59.920> only<00:03:00.069> you<00:03:00.190> carrying<00:03:00.760> this<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.269> know<00:03:01.359> to

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
not only you carrying this you know to

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.199
