00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 Hello everybody and today I will tell 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.509
 about the firmware from cyanogenmod 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.230
 android 500 and under on sony 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:19.590
 xperia z 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:21.480
 so let's go for a start tell you about 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.760
 interface firmware think legs bunny 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.619
 looks google nexus 5 here is the same 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.170
 the case is the same google android without any 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.539
 chip company about the viewer smooth and 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.710
 ease of operation 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.189
 nothing superfluous but basically it's on 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.840
 amateur 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.300
 some like white background some 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.040
 don't like so some black since 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.170
 he looks more elegant but i think 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.200
 that soon there will be such 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.100
 function to change the background by the following paragraph 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.649
 consider the interface on the screen 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.219
 lock here like sydney when all 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.960
 simply 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.379
 Yes, and it seems well decorated 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.120
 there is if you look at the center of the screen 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.399
 we have a big clock in front of us 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.400
 font that is very convenient for quite a lot 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:11.430
 use the lower left corner located 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:13.189
 phone application widget so not immediately 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.850
 he manages to catch everything 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:19.850
 left to right bend 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.310
 and in the lower right is 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.500
 quick access widget for the world well yes i 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.049
 I think everything is clear on the upper side 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.810
 the screen is the status bar as 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.759
 In principle, here in ordinary smartphones 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.530
 android smartphone if you have 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.159
 graphic password then it will be 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.470
 located 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.970
 no official firmware in mind 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.200
 like that is for starters you must 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.640
 svapnut bottom up that is how 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.640
 Unlock only then it will appear and 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.020
 only then will he demand you 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:03.610
 graphic password 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.709
 but here everything seems to be considered further and 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.899
 home crane 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:09.700
 but in principle here everything is as in 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.500
 normal andrade only if you click on 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.150
 screen and hold then we will appear 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.250
 additional menu that allows 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.989
 change you line add you line 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.610
 search 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:27.370
 change grid size change icons 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:31.500
 which in turn is very convenient for 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:35.170
 also for using a smartphone i.e. 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.319
 more settings it allows more 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.620
 customize 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:44.220
 Well, for this, this is very fond of android and 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.220
 very big plus 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.549
 the menu itself is nothing special just 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.700
 Here I think not only I do not like this 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.050
 white background but 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.970
 it used to be some kind of transparent 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.170
 gave more sweep firmware then 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.840
 eat when it was 44 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.410
 that is, that leg from the concat company 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.370
 cyanogenmod commands cyanogenmod 44 there 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.349
 it was more or less beautiful 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.080
 settings menu added a lot of different 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.940
 functions such as wake-up 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.160
 volume and shutdown screen double 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.470
 Tap the track by hold 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.660
 volume keys and many different 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:29.680
 We do not have other functions of the camera. 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.180
 changed that is but gone 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.329
 numerous settings 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:38.220
 we have cameras now 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:41.190
 front camera chores to the back here 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:46.060
 numerous quantities are missing 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:50.250
 settings as I said, then I think not 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.599
 I like everyone I think that's all 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.190
 if this video has 30 likes then i 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.709
 lay out detailed instructions how to sew 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.390
