assuming by their time because they're

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.539 
assuming by their time because they're
actually<00:03:39.880> based<00:03:40.180> in<00:03:40.450> Malaysia<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:42.040> they<00:03:42.400> got

a deal where if you bought two contacts

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.010 
a deal where if you bought two contacts
you<00:03:44.590> would<00:03:44.739> get
