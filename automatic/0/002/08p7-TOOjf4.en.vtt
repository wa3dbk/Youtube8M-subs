00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.820
 2175 meters 14 14 starters good no 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.529
 difficulties compared to the non 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.289
 Here there is room for flit in 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.130
 Well it's still a big track 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.140
 in the world should not be 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.579
 worry that's fourteen at the same pole must 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.040
 always pay a little attention 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.360
 for sure there is a little bit 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.160
 not sleep too much in rubber bands at 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.239
 world here this is his nerves normally he 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.730
 there's enough room for everything to happen 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.160
 well in the beginning and the 2008 d'enghien 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.180
 it's often selective races and 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.399
 here are the good horses express themselves 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.989
 okay we were talking about sleeping you 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.140
 did not sleep for your selection on 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.250
 will see right away your favorite hui of 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.609
 the race then tops the halderman's 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.760
 then the nine 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.100
 alex the winner i then spent the 14th 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.040
 at 16 goutier this visor already 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.080
 what is the saying to both of the 1st 13 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.080
 african leucate flowers hahnemann 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.540
 terrines and the 3 act of love ok good the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.130
 of logical halderman he won site 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.080
 forgive his last seven outings 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.799
 have the choice of goals enghien but not 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.240
 worry to have 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.770
 no he won on the small track at 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.750
 vincennes it shocks in big delay of 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.369
 gains so here I think it's 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.780
 squarely the scarecrow of the race has 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.280
 not a canton every time he wins 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.270
 it's head and rope it takes 30 meters 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.470
 advanced to anyone who can follow him 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.630
 because they send a train of madness 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.049
 so here's so trotting in the middle 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.700
 not run 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.310
 there's no race we're still going there 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.810
 contrast the number 9 alex of winner 75% 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.369
 of success in enghien he comes from 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.939
 win the prize the jonquère on this 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.590
 same course 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.689
 well we expect a confirmation it's 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.640
 a horse in full progress here he has 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.049
 been just once second but 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.700
 far slab hermann on the small track 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.810
 an equal post here it comes from 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.979
 stand on the common course and 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.750
 to say it was really in a very 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.590
 good style and he also finds it 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.259
 there are a lot of choices that run 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.430
 the test of today that has dominated 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.960
 I do not see how they can take 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.310
 their revenge so he imposes himself with 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.969
 of the margin certainly gain from a 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.799
 half length 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.570
 but jean etienne dubois we had under 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.130
 the pedal 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.170
 we feel what the horse is really there 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.270
 align with halderman hilal aptitude to 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.680
 course it is in full bloom 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.090
 it's a first song all fires 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.030
 are green in third position 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.940
 number 14 to 16 of the goutier then very 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.190
 well committed 3000 euros of elimination 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.560
 six wins and this accessit in 18 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.940
 outputs so since its inception the oci 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.500
 investment logic and receives a paper 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.360
 integral and one of the best shows 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.670
 of the stable of jacques bruneau 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.980
 the other day he ran to prepare he 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.840
 was making 50 meters halderman by being 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.000
 shod here it is at equal post it is 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.430
 deferré of the four so even if I think 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.390
 albert mann still has room 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.790
 it's a very first chance when 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.780
 they recalled Eric raffin that's it 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.580
 a horse that is very complicated there 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.930
 estimated he has he has titles to do 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.130
 particularly vincennes in 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.020
 lots of high quality 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.100
 this is a great commitment for him 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.930
 must not go out the first three 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.190
 okay but just bruno ranc ur 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.300
 talk about jacques bonneau was at his 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.750
 meet and talk about the chances 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.950
 of the chubby alceste listening to him I 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.750
 know that jacques benoix prepare 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.760
 precisely his horse alceste du goutier 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.950
 for this made-to-measure commitment he has 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.930
 By the way, eric raffin is 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.640
 lead his pupil who will be barefooted 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.470
 four feet but be careful excess 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.360
 winner who just made a sensation here 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.860
 even on this track will be for him a 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.120
 dangerous rival for that matter he does not come 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.760
 bad coaches from this quinté 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.070
 who make the resident of jean etienne 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.190
 dubois the real scarecrow of this 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.200
 quinté more nothing to say everything was said 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.430
 or almost already in advance our life 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.530
 bruno with a head with the rods of arms in nkon 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.970
 yes it's true that in the badly classified it 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.079
 be wary it's really it's the 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.690
 must-have base 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.549
 we will go to the fourth set vizier 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.320
 already that is already placed on the course 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.549
 good it's a small attractive outsider 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.900
 yeah that's behind the three bases 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.940
 had to make choices there are a lot of 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.799
 read what opportunities halls so 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.910
 So there he faces the youngest 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.110
 but it's a horse that's still 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.090
 there he comes running sacred water 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.530
 on the enghien course and if we look 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.190
 well his lap times he walked to 14.6 on 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.540
 the course is races 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.920
 halderman the first three are 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.330
 able to do this train but the 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.560
 others I 'm not sure here it will be 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.060
 déferré posterior contrary to 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.800
 the last time he was shod he 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.420
 would have taken a place without his fault where 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.280
 they were 3 4th but it was very good 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.590
 in a running race that was working 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.060
 13.8 so he was a little tired 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.950
 having a parent had an easy journey 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.210
 there we are indeed red is posterior 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.620
 I think he has every right to 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.910
 finish in the quinté okay we're going 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.310
 wary we will have understood in fifth 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.290
 position the number 10 has all of the air 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.780
 so he, too, like the eur 75 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.340
 % success in enghien and precisely 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.870
 it was his dauphin in the prelate 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.800
 jean-pierre good bah logic non papa 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.780
 the gap for there he came looking for 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.490
 the other day it was the race 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.900
 referred to it franck year had it 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.310
 four feet unshod he came 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.530
 look for second place on the pole 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.550
 at the price of a nice final effort but there is 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.930
 still had my journey along the 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.190
 rope so he did not do too much 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.980
 of efforts he came looking for the 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.460
 second place of a nose so here is so 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.500
 it was good 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.520
 now here I am telling you to be 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.960
 to fight for the first three 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.370
 places it can be complicated but good 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.450
 the horse was his second race in 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.260
 last place he can still have 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.150
 progressed on it 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.350
 that's it, if the goods look like 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.000
 be careful because of refer 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.300
 sometimes d caps ilan and some small 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.430
 failures 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.410
 yes here but so normally do this 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.940
 their life is a very good luck 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.140
 to be four five also agree 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.520
 before concluding this show we will 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.410
 do a little focus on number 13 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.520
 African flower because I know 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.570
 you have long hesitated instead and 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.980
 a little bit higher up yeah that's a 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.270
 quality mare that is highly esteemed 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.340
 she is the sister of a love girl on 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.860
 know well this is a girl from 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.050
 lanzac which is very marked because 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.180
 jacques 100 french so that led to 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.590
 very well aging she estimated in 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.150
 last place she is on the course 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.820
 it was taken in making 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.320
 speed since beaten here but david 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.060
 thomain we really talk to the goods are 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.590
 de rigueur the entourage there but in the 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.210
 cotton it will be déferrée hinds 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.410
 if she has the right course really 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.820
 be careful this class mare 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.320
 no we will have understood that it can be the 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.720
 little outsider fun of the race 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.400
 thank you mathieu for all info everything is 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.500
