00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.929 
waiting for it to download I'm on a 3G
network<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.740> takes<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.040> bit<00:01:47.189> time<00:01:47.460> but<00:01:47.729> not

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
network so it takes a bit time but not

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.399 
network so it takes a bit time but not
much<00:01:49.640> here<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.670> go<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.180> loading<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.780> I'm

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
much here we go it's loading and I'm

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.340

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
using an iPhone 3GS so the install time

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.859 
using an iPhone 3GS so the install time
should<00:01:55.710> be<00:01:55.740> two<00:01:56.640> times<00:01:56.820> faster<00:01:57.090> than<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.450> 3G

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
should be two times faster than a 3G

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
don't want to do that you can just set

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.460 
don't want to do that you can just set
it<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.489> never<00:03:45.760> so<00:03:46.120> that<00:03:46.269> you<00:03:46.569> always<00:03:46.870> see<00:03:47.350> the

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
it to never so that you always see the

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.410 
it to never so that you always see the
phone<00:03:47.799> but<00:03:48.100> it's<00:03:48.280> not<00:03:48.489> advice<00:03:48.880> because<00:03:49.120> it

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
phone but it's not advice because it

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.400 
phone but it's not advice because it
consumes<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.959> lot<00:03:50.109> of<00:03:50.230> battery<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:52.000> let's<00:03:52.870> say

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
consumes a lot of battery so let's say

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.680 
consumes a lot of battery so let's say
like<00:03:53.650> after<00:03:54.639> five<00:03:54.849> minutes<00:03:54.970> it's<00:03:55.269> good<00:03:55.450> for

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
like after five minutes it's good for

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.039 
like after five minutes it's good for
now

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
now

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.910 
now
so<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:56.650> go<00:03:56.920> for<00:03:56.950> settings<00:03:57.459> again<00:03:57.609> and<00:03:58.349> I<00:03:59.349> go<00:03:59.739> for

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
so I go for settings again and I go for

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.990 
so I go for settings again and I go for
a<00:04:00.099> Donilon<00:04:01.410> so<00:04:02.410> right<00:04:02.620> now<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:02.799> time<00:04:03.130> is<00:04:03.160> 951

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
a Donilon so right now the time is 951

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.900 
a Donilon so right now the time is 951
so<00:04:04.840> let's<00:04:05.170> go<00:04:05.349> quickly<00:04:05.680> and<00:04:05.889> change<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.700> time

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
so let's go quickly and change the time

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.289 
so let's go quickly and change the time
it's<00:04:07.359> a<00:04:07.450> pretty<00:04:07.660> slick<00:04:07.930> that's<00:04:08.139> a<00:04:08.230> real<00:04:09.299> 53
