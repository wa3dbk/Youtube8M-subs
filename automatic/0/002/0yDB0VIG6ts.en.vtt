00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.809
 hello friends we are here command is placed 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.150
 events managers because not of gt 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.379
 to present the main news 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:20.490
 of the 2014 gt range are the strength or the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.199
 150 mouse and 130 direction both 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.850
 compared with previous year they have in common 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.800
 in fact, only the name changes 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.330
 completely the general setup 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.849
 of the dc 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.219
 we have three main innovations that are 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.860
 inside wheels 27 and a half or 6 50 of 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.670
 suspension that an evolution 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.760
 very important of the drive that yes 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.870
 call au s and geometries completely 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.789
 revisited 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.360
 let's start from the audio holm force 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.730
 from 150 mm corrupt 6 50 b but two parish priests 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.680
 of the race thanks pestano hello greeting 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.480
 to Libyan friends live and now we have here 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.239
 the force new model precisely for the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.699
 2014 model that among other things already been 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.949
 used both by aden gave that 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.539
 martin corn in the last races of 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.909
 superenduro tragic this weekend with 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.220
 success also from martin mayes who has 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.689
 used the third place 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.090
 maybe this year there are three 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.259
 fittings all in carbon precisely 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.080
 150 mm discussion front back 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.270
 wheel diameter the new standard 27 e 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.970
 means totally different from 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.850
 the one that was there until last year e 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.229
 the heart as we have said 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.560
 previously the new system 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.119
 called eos is quite an evolution 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.640
 drive boost that always 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.079
 characterized gt suspension 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.299
 interesting to know was 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.040
 designed and developed by peter dente e 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.079
 from his intervention team that he is 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.840
 already already part of the family that 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.970
 this connecting rod is not the heart 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.079
 forged that we see here is called the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.590
 pet link 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.689
 in practice it keeps the suspension separate 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.079
 and the transmission one of the ease in 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:01.560
 so that both can give the 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.740
 maximum efficiency is beautiful 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.439
 precisely forged worked on the cnt and then 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.750
 welded together to give the best of both 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.050
 of stiffness strength but also 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.960
 keeping the weight low at the level of 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.880
 suspension there is always the heart we say 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.630
 and not always a fulcrum other seems a 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.280
 single pivot then extreme extreme 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.440
 the first part of the race follows 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.959
 the trend moves back slightly and then 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.030
 anyway thanks precisely this connecting rod yes 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.100
 avoid the king's speech from the beak steve 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.050
 of the tour chain therefore precisely for having 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.950
 however a suspension a ride 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:44.489
 however efficient and it was anyway 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.950
 lowered the whole let 's say the fulcrum 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.020
 always wins the pivot high tomlin fulcrum 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.470
 has been lowered compared to years 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.470
 precedents therefore this for how much 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.000
 regards the suspension has changed 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.980
 precisely also from the point of view e 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.520
 geometric was mainly 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.720
 stretched and shortened doc cube 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.959
 the stem then precisely with 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.270
 a much more aggressive position for 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.390
 the descent mainly the corners 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.370
 have been opened we have 67 degrees for 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.140
 what the force was 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.600
 lowered the bottom bracket 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.030
 we are at 350 then precisely in the 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.220
 geometry that then follows the new canons 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.690
 that the new industry standards comes 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.060
 just a little bit lower instead. stable 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.080
 a little longer than even for the high ones 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.540
 speed 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.350
 maybe we have three set ups as I have 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.660
 said all three with a fork of 34 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.610
 at the front of course 10 speeds per 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.790
 rear all with outfitting 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.769
 shimano all three models with nets 6 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.190
 the telescopic with internal passage 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:49.200
 said costanzo we have seen precisely 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.549
 three productions for maybe all e 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.290
 three in carbon 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.000
 obviously being a used bike 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.280
 also deny me superenduro e 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.739
 endivivist dan atherton a 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.200
 martin marques we wonder there will be the 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.239
 future specialized investment for 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.370
 this emerging discipline then the 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.840
 moment is still a little bit already 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.329
 also become because they have just 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.700
 started using it let's say with 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.040
 success and then they will probably go 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.930
 then to develop that choir and leave a 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.350
 little 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.930
 but the surprise is the suspense and one thing 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.150
 immediate to say by force and we are 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.600
 on the 13 pounds and a half as a top model of 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:30.460
 range starts from 3,999 euros as 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.460
 price to the public, however, that magoni
