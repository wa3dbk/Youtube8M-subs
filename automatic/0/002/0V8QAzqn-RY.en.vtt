00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.090
 and hello to all dear friends with you about 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.889
 spoons today continue to consider 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.389
 syoss cream paint module just about 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.940
 convincing about by which you 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.480
 You can add two items that 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.930
 can make boxes from your house 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.359
 awesome manufacturing plant 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.580
 any raw material let it be 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.470
 any wheat why not and 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.300
 I also want to add something that this mod 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.579
 adds to the game nothing more than round 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.410
 animated items yes i know what 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.000
 round animated objects no way 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.230
 get on with square minecraft where 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.390
 all square 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.430
 but still you look what 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.350
 beauty suggests this mod on a maikraft 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.940
 just bring such beauty 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.910
 and now imagine without these two 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.690
 items my home here I am now not even 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.120
 I want to represent 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.739
 and he will look like a hundred pounds god 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.629
 and let me tell you right now how 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.989
 craft these items how they work 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.059
 and what they are based on actually want 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.920
 add the fact that these two subjects only 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.960
 for decoration but further author 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.689
 wants to add something to these items 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.960
 only worked from the diet and also to 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.450
 they filed or transmitted time and 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.330
 In general, I also want to add something 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.140
 this wheel can only spin on 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.390
 water flow 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.090
 I mean, if we would not have been here 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.640
 This flow of water it would not cool but 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.890
 if we put this wheel somewhere 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.600
 here on earth it will not be either 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.939
 spin if we put it where nick 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.490
 just water then again it won't be 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.829
 spinning and yes it is a little logical and 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.140
 I can even say that the mod has 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.909
 some kind of physics and in general then let us 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.380
 place this wheel somewhere here 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.619
 so she kept spinning 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.600
 I donâ€™t know this machine 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.630
 as if honest is called but if you 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.090
 know then write in the comments and he 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.799
 spinning itself meaning it turns from 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.570
 wind does not need to connect anything to it 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.180
 that is, no redstone no 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.490
 signal he just turns his main 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.189
 do not place water and everything he will 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.689
 work like a simple decoration and let's 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.030
 right now look at crafting these 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.129
 two items first we look at 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.959
 Kraft Here it is wheels Kraft it 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.230
 as follows we will need 4 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.569
 plates as well as one stick at the very 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.250
 or is it not a wheel in fact it is that 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.260
 the thing I don't know is called 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.940
 and the wheel is crafted as follows 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.560
 we need to have four plates 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.690
 add four more plates sorry i 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.670
 just craft mixed up and proper 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.799
 I can't do anything more about this mod 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.110
 say craft is pretty heavy that is 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.000
 one plate is made from one stick 6 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.799
 boards that is, we will have to cut down as 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.040
 at least 5 trees to make at least 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.170
 one wheel well or carcass which 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.849
 I do not know what is called and in general, then 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.010
 this we end up hope you mod 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.239
 Liked but if here for the first time you 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.370

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.870
 Like bring your friends and you had a spoon 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.870
 good luck everyone all bye
