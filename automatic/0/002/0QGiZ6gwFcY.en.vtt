00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
each other so you have to do a

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.419

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
too much noise you have to do a

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.120 
too much noise you have to do a
different<00:00:31.349> type<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.529> take<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.859> know<00:00:31.949> it

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
different type of take you know it

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.470 
different type of take you know it
stopped<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.550> being<00:00:32.730> able<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.969> do<00:00:33.059> other<00:00:33.210> take

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.299 
stopped you being able to do other take
down<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.680> really<00:00:34.860> becomes<00:00:35.070> like<00:00:35.280> a

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
down so it really becomes like a

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.860 
down so it really becomes like a
strategy<00:00:35.760> games<00:00:35.969> you'll<00:00:36.210> decide<00:00:36.420> on<00:00:36.570> who<00:00:36.660> to

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
strategy games you'll decide on who to

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.319 
strategy games you'll decide on who to
pick<00:00:36.989> off<00:00:37.170> but<00:00:37.440> not<00:00:37.559> only<00:00:37.680> who<00:00:37.890> but<00:00:38.219> how<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:39.180> it

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
pick off but not only who but how so it

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.700 
pick off but not only who but how so it
brings<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.690> whole<00:00:39.719> new<00:00:39.989> element<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.500> again

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
brings in a whole new element and again

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.010 
brings in a whole new element and again
the<00:00:41.390> hopefully<00:00:42.390> you'll<00:00:42.780> take<00:00:42.989> it

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
the hopefully you'll take it

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.660

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
yeah I mean one of the things we didn't

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.420 
yeah I mean one of the things we didn't
want<00:02:04.060> to<00:02:04.120> do<00:02:04.210> with<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.450> combat<00:02:04.810> was<00:02:04.840> have<00:02:05.770> just

a sort of normal weak weak strong combat

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.230 
a sort of normal weak weak strong combat
system<00:02:08.770> and<00:02:08.920> you've<00:02:09.010> got<00:02:09.100> to<00:02:09.220> learn<00:02:09.369> all<00:02:10.030> these

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
system and you've got to learn all these

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.030 
system and you've got to learn all these
different<00:02:10.479> combos<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.380> get<00:02:11.500> through<00:02:11.710> the<00:02:11.860> game

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
different combos to get through the game

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.950 
different combos to get through the game
because<00:02:12.820> to<00:02:12.910> be<00:02:13.000> honest<00:02:13.240> in<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.480> game<00:02:13.660> you'll

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
because to be honest in the game you'll

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.420 
because to be honest in the game you'll
be<00:02:14.050> doing<00:02:14.260> some<00:02:14.470> combat<00:02:14.860> but<00:02:15.070> then<00:02:15.190> you'll<00:02:15.310> be

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
be doing some combat but then you'll be

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.770 
be doing some combat but then you'll be
doing<00:02:15.640> lots<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.910> exploration<00:02:16.630> and

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
doing lots of exploration and

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.990 
doing lots of exploration and
puzzle-solving<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:18.280> detective<00:02:18.850> and

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
puzzle-solving and detective and

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.460 
puzzle-solving and detective and
forensics<00:02:19.450> work<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:19.840> we<00:02:19.930> needed<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.290> system

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
forensics work so we needed a system

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.230 
forensics work so we needed a system
which<00:02:20.800> you<00:02:20.950> could<00:02:21.130> kind<00:02:21.700> of<00:02:21.760> playing<00:02:21.970> like<00:02:22.210> a

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
which you could kind of playing like a

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.970 
which you could kind of playing like a
staccato<00:02:22.660> manner<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.320> know<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.680> didn't

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
staccato manner you know so you didn't

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.770 
staccato manner you know so you didn't
have<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.310> spend<00:02:24.700> hours<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.360> hours<00:02:25.450> learning

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
have to spend hours and hours learning

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.050 
have to spend hours and hours learning
it<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.740> could<00:02:26.890> jump<00:02:27.130> right<00:02:27.280> in<00:02:27.490> but<00:02:27.940> the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
it you could jump right in but the

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.760 
it you could jump right in but the
better<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.420> get<00:02:28.540> at<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.810> figure<00:02:29.170> combos<00:02:29.590> you

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
better you get at the figure combos you

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.220 
better you get at the figure combos you
can<00:02:29.950> rack<00:02:30.100> up<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:30.610> can<00:02:31.270> see<00:02:31.510> Stan<00:02:31.780> can<00:02:31.960> put<00:02:32.140> off

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
can rack up so can see Stan can put off

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.900 
can rack up so can see Stan can put off
some<00:02:32.410> of<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.620> bigger<00:02:33.160> moves<00:02:33.460> and<00:02:33.700> do<00:02:33.790> the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
some of the bigger moves and do the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.090 
some of the bigger moves and do the
longer<00:02:34.180> combos<00:02:34.600> and<00:02:34.870> let<00:02:35.350> you<00:02:35.440> see<00:02:35.560> that<00:02:35.770> the

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
longer combos and let you see that the

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.800 
longer combos and let you see that the
lovely<00:02:36.400> context-sensitive<00:02:36.940> counter<00:02:37.570> moves

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
lovely context-sensitive counter moves

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.300 
lovely context-sensitive counter moves
so<00:02:38.320> if<00:02:38.380> someone's<00:02:38.680> kicking<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.040> from<00:02:39.190> behind

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
so if someone's kicking you from behind

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.160 
so if someone's kicking you from behind

an<00:07:11.340> action-adventure<00:07:11.940> counter<00:07:12.210> I<00:07:12.450> think

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 
an action-adventure counter I think

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.030 
an action-adventure counter I think
that's<00:07:12.870> really<00:07:13.200> difficult<00:07:13.350> because<00:07:13.740> of<00:07:13.950> who

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:14.040 
that's really difficult because of who

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.920 
that's really difficult because of who
Batman<00:07:14.250> is<00:07:14.460> and<00:07:14.820> how<00:07:14.910> multifaceted<00:07:15.450> he<00:07:15.780> is<00:07:15.900> i

Batman is and how multifaceted he is i
mean<00:07:16.290> i<00:07:16.380> think<00:07:16.440> that<00:07:16.710> sounds<00:07:16.740> a<00:07:17.070> bit<00:07:17.160> corny<00:07:17.430> but

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:17.730 
mean i think that sounds a bit corny but

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.060 
mean i think that sounds a bit corny but
