ago<00:00:07.170> valve<00:00:07.680> just<00:00:08.099> announced<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:09.210> last<00:00:09.510> bit<00:00:09.870> of

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
ago valve just announced the last bit of

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.589 
ago valve just announced the last bit of
their<00:00:10.679> steam<00:00:11.160> goodness<00:00:11.670> first<00:00:12.300> it<00:00:12.450> was<00:00:12.570> the

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
their steam goodness first it was the

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.690 
their steam goodness first it was the
steam<00:00:12.900> OS<00:00:13.049> which<00:00:13.650> was<00:00:13.830> followed<00:00:14.040> by<00:00:14.340> steam

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
steam OS which was followed by steam

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.580 
steam OS which was followed by steam
machines<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.480> then<00:00:15.809> we<00:00:15.929> thought<00:00:16.080> half-life<00:00:16.560> 3

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
machines and then we thought half-life 3

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.349 
machines and then we thought half-life 3
was<00:00:16.980> coming<00:00:17.279> but<00:00:17.520> they<00:00:17.820> fooled<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.330> again

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
was coming but they fooled you again

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.310 
was coming but they fooled you again
guys<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.369> steam<00:00:20.850> controller<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.840> my

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
guys it is the steam controller and my

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.269 
guys it is the steam controller and my
what<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.580> hell<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.859> okay<00:00:25.859> all<00:00:26.010> jokes

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
what the hell is that okay all jokes

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.480 
what the hell is that okay all jokes
aside<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:27.300> controller<00:00:27.840> looks<00:00:28.289> super<00:00:29.250> weird

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
aside this controller looks super weird

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.910 
aside this controller looks super weird
I<00:00:29.760> mean<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.150> understand<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.260> logic<00:00:31.619> behind

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
I mean I understand the logic behind

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.530 
I mean I understand the logic behind
trying<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.430> be<00:00:32.579> different<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.120> they<00:00:33.270> felt

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
trying to be different and they felt

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.410 
trying to be different and they felt
that<00:00:33.780> having<00:00:34.200> analog<00:00:34.890> buttons<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.670> things<00:00:36.120> on

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
that having analog buttons and things on

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.850 
that having analog buttons and things on
the<00:00:36.570> controller<00:00:36.899> itself<00:00:37.170> like<00:00:37.350> sticks<00:00:37.680> and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
the controller itself like sticks and

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.040 
the controller itself like sticks and
whatnot<00:00:38.160> will<00:00:38.550> not<00:00:39.180> give<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.660> precise

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
whatnot will not give you that precise

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.110 
whatnot will not give you that precise
feel<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:41.040> have<00:00:41.309> not<00:00:41.489> had<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> chance<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.090> use

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
feel and we have not had a chance to use

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.540 
feel and we have not had a chance to use
this<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.690> obviously<00:00:43.230> there<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.739> not<00:00:44.040> much<00:00:44.370> so

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
this so obviously there is not much so

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.310 
this so obviously there is not much so
we<00:00:44.670> could<00:00:44.850> say<00:00:45.000> about<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.390> but<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:46.020> fact

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
we could say about it but the fact

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.619 
we could say about it but the fact
remains<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.309> looks<00:00:47.700> freaking<00:00:48.300> weird

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
remains that this looks freaking weird

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.690 
remains that this looks freaking weird
the<00:00:48.930> controller<00:00:49.410> itself<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.190> controlled<00:00:50.610> by

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
the controller itself is controlled by

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.020 
the controller itself is controlled by
two<00:00:50.879> dual<00:00:51.570> trackpads<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:53.039> has<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> certain

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
two dual trackpads and it has a certain

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.810 
two dual trackpads and it has a certain
preciseness<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.410> or<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.770> valve<00:00:56.100> claims<00:00:56.550> of

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
preciseness to it or so valve claims of

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.310 
preciseness to it or so valve claims of
course<00:00:57.059> we<00:00:57.210> haven't<00:00:57.539> used<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.780> controller<00:00:58.109> so

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
course we haven't used a controller so

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.260 
course we haven't used a controller so
we<00:00:58.440> don't<00:00:58.649> know<00:00:58.770> yet<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.760> other<00:00:59.940> cool

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
we don't know yet and the other cool

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.180 
we don't know yet and the other cool
part<00:01:00.510> about<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.530> controller

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
part about this is that the controller

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.340 
part about this is that the controller
itself<00:01:02.640> has<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> touchscreen<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> middle

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
itself has a touchscreen in the middle

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.440 
itself has a touchscreen in the middle
so<00:01:04.799> think<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.430> little<00:01:05.549> bit<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.880> your<00:01:06.060> dreamcast

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
so think a little bit of your dreamcast

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.230 
so think a little bit of your dreamcast
vm<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.350> accept<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.189> might<00:01:08.340> actually<00:01:08.610> work<00:01:09.000> and

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
vm you accept it might actually work and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.300 
vm you accept it might actually work and
do<00:01:09.450> something<00:01:09.869> cool<00:01:10.080> even<00:01:10.409> though<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.770> vm<00:01:11.100> you

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
do something cool even though the vm you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.520 
do something cool even though the vm you
was<00:01:11.670> kind<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.360> cool<00:01:12.630> every<00:01:13.110> button<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
was kind of cool every button on the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.560 
was kind of cool every button on the
controller<00:01:13.860> has<00:01:14.100> been<00:01:14.400> designed<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.299> reflect

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
controller has been designed to reflect

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.200 
controller has been designed to reflect
where<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.380> place<00:01:16.650> our<00:01:16.860> hands<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.400> controller

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
where we place our hands on a controller

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.910 
where we place our hands on a controller
so<00:01:18.540> when<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.020> grabbed<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> controller<00:01:19.710> my

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
so when I grabbed the controller my

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.800 
so when I grabbed the controller my
thumb's<00:01:20.159> usually<00:01:20.610> rest<00:01:20.880> immediately<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
thumb's usually rest immediately on the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.719 
thumb's usually rest immediately on the
thumbsticks<00:01:22.259> they<00:01:22.439> created<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.100> area<00:01:23.520> for

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
thumbsticks they created the area for

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.249 
thumbsticks they created the area for
that<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.060> buttons<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.750> all<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.080> it

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
that the buttons and all that it

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.530 
that the buttons and all that it
basically<00:01:25.470> makes<00:01:26.159> sure<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.549> when<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.299> hold

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
basically makes sure that when you hold

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.969 
basically makes sure that when you hold
the<00:01:27.689> controller<00:01:28.049> your<00:01:28.380> hands<00:01:28.799> are<00:01:28.920> perfectly

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the controller your hands are perfectly

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.969 
the controller your hands are perfectly
molded<00:01:29.759> onto<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.810> device<00:01:31.170> one<00:01:31.590> thing<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.950> I

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
molded onto this device one thing that I

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.950 
molded onto this device one thing that I
found<00:01:32.159> particularly<00:01:32.670> cool<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.689> seam

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
found particularly cool is the seam

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.020 
found particularly cool is the seam
configuration<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:34.890> now<00:01:35.009> keep<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.520> mind<00:01:35.579> folks

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
configuration so now keep in mind folks

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.149 
configuration so now keep in mind folks
that<00:01:36.360> these<00:01:36.810> games<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.500> have<00:01:37.619> come<00:01:37.799> out<00:01:37.860> on

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
that these games that have come out on

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.710 
that these games that have come out on
Steam<00:01:38.430> they<00:01:38.610> weren't<00:01:38.790> designed<00:01:39.180> with<00:01:39.479> this

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
Steam they weren't designed with this

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.109 
Steam they weren't designed with this
controller<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.380> mind<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:40.890> they<00:01:41.340> designed<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
controller in mind so they designed the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.120 
controller in mind so they designed the
steam<00:01:42.360> controller<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.409> can<00:01:43.619> pretty

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
steam controller so that you can pretty

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.249 
steam controller so that you can pretty
much<00:01:44.220> put<00:01:44.700> whatever<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.210> want<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.899> and

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
much put whatever you want on it and

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.530 
much put whatever you want on it and
configure<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.159> way<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.340> feel<00:01:47.790> fit<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.479> I

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
configure it the way you feel fit and I

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.510 
configure it the way you feel fit and I
think<00:01:48.780> that's<00:01:48.960> pretty<00:01:49.259> cool<00:01:49.560> considering

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
think that's pretty cool considering

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.620 
think that's pretty cool considering
that<00:01:50.549> there<00:01:50.820> are<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> lot<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.119> people<00:01:51.479> who

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
that there are a lot of people who

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.630 
that there are a lot of people who
really<00:01:51.869> enjoy<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.680> extra<00:01:53.310> level<00:01:53.460> of

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
really enjoy that extra level of

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.249 
really enjoy that extra level of
customization<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.720> other<00:01:54.869> cool<00:01:55.020> part

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
customization and the other cool part

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.359 
customization and the other cool part
about<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.009> steam<00:01:56.219> controller

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
about this is that the steam controller

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.700 
about this is that the steam controller
will<00:01:56.969> be<00:01:57.119> completely<00:01:57.719> hackable<00:01:58.380> which<00:01:58.560> is

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
will be completely hackable which is

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.620 
will be completely hackable which is
something<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.340> valve<00:01:59.729> has<00:02:00.030> really<00:02:00.450> been

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
something that valve has really been

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.660 
something that valve has really been
pushing<00:02:00.840> out<00:02:01.110> there<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.740> their<00:02:01.950> devices<00:02:02.310> are

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
pushing out there that their devices are

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.429 
pushing out there that their devices are
open<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.360> people<00:02:03.719> can<00:02:03.899> do<00:02:04.020> whatever<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
open and that people can do whatever the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.840 
open and that people can do whatever the
hell<00:02:04.469> they<00:02:04.619> want<00:02:04.770> with<00:02:05.159> them<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.610> steam

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
hell they want with them the steam

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.819 
hell they want with them the steam
controller<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.540> no<00:02:06.960> different<00:02:07.649> another

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
controller is no different another

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.169 
controller is no different another
interesting<00:02:08.310> thing<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.520> note<00:02:08.670> here<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:09.030> that

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
interesting thing to note here is that

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.960 
interesting thing to note here is that
the<00:02:09.420> first<00:02:09.599> 300<00:02:10.050> people<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.220> do<00:02:11.550> manage<00:02:11.940> to

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
the first 300 people that do manage to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.580 
the first 300 people that do manage to
get<00:02:12.270> their<00:02:12.450> very<00:02:12.690> own<00:02:12.780> steam<00:02:13.230> machine

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
get their very own steam machine

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.070 
get their very own steam machine
and<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:14.069> steam<00:02:14.280> controller<00:02:14.730> will<00:02:15.180> not<00:02:15.510> have<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
and a steam controller will not have the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.900 
and a steam controller will not have the
touch<00:02:16.319> screen<00:02:16.500> functionality<00:02:16.890> on<00:02:17.610> the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
touch screen functionality on the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.820 
touch screen functionality on the
controller<00:02:18.390> instead<00:02:19.050> they<00:02:19.230> will<00:02:19.379> have<00:02:19.500> four

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
controller instead they will have four

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.130 
controller instead they will have four
buttons<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.489> they<00:02:20.910> will<00:02:21.090> be<00:02:21.239> wired<00:02:21.540> as<00:02:21.900> well

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
buttons and they will be wired as well

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.199 
buttons and they will be wired as well
through<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.500> USB<00:02:22.890> cable<00:02:23.550> now<00:02:23.670> it's<00:02:23.849> time<00:02:24.060> for

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209
