exciting<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.040> me<00:01:20.130> about<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.210> we're

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
exciting to me about that is that we're

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.530 
exciting to me about that is that we're

that a lot of the things we'd expect to

sometimes<00:04:24.520> I've<00:04:25.180> opened<00:04:25.390> my<00:04:25.660> refrigerator<00:04:25.720> to

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
sometimes I've opened my refrigerator to

sometimes I've opened my refrigerator to
get<00:04:26.590> something<00:04:27.100> shut<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.550> door<00:04:27.730> opened<00:04:28.180> it

again<00:04:28.570> a<00:04:28.600> few<00:04:28.720> minutes<00:04:29.200> later<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:29.710> found<00:04:30.340> a

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
again a few minutes later and found a

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.430 
again a few minutes later and found a
jar<00:04:30.670> had<00:04:30.850> vanished<00:04:31.090> and<00:04:31.510> we<00:04:31.750> appeared<00:04:32.170> in<00:04:32.320> that

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
jar had vanished and we appeared in that

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.690 
jar had vanished and we appeared in that
short<00:04:32.650> space<00:04:32.950> of<00:04:33.010> time<00:04:33.750> and<00:04:34.890> that<00:04:35.890> really

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
short space of time and that really

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.550 
short space of time and that really
gives<00:04:36.970> you<00:04:37.150> a<00:04:37.180> sense<00:04:37.480> of<00:04:37.690> how<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.080> feel<00:04:38.440> about

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
gives you a sense of how I feel about

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.290 
gives you a sense of how I feel about
reality<00:04:39.070> shifts<00:04:39.400> and<00:04:39.550> travelling<00:04:40.180> between

reality shifts and travelling between

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.110 
reality shifts and travelling between
parallel<00:04:40.780> universes<00:04:41.550> but<00:04:42.550> I'd<00:04:42.640> like<00:04:42.790> you<00:04:42.970> to

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
parallel universes but I'd like you to

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.670 
parallel universes but I'd like you to
start<00:04:43.330> thinking<00:04:43.480> about<00:04:43.750> it<00:04:44.110> as<00:04:44.230> well

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
start thinking about it as well

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.680 
start thinking about it as well
and<00:04:44.770> recognizing<00:04:45.400> that<00:04:45.970> this<00:04:46.120> is<00:04:46.180> the<00:04:46.360> sort<00:04:46.570> of

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
and recognizing that this is the sort of

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.240 
and recognizing that this is the sort of
thing<00:04:46.930> that<00:04:47.380> could<00:04:47.560> be<00:04:47.680> happening<00:04:48.040> all<00:04:48.220> the

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
thing that could be happening all the

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.090 
thing that could be happening all the
time<00:04:48.400> we're<00:04:49.150> getting<00:04:49.270> a<00:04:49.480> lot<00:04:49.690> more<00:04:50.050> of<00:04:50.350> a<00:04:50.830> hint

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
time we're getting a lot more of a hint

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.850 
time we're getting a lot more of a hint
from<00:04:51.400> current<00:04:52.210> studies<00:04:52.570> in<00:04:52.750> science<00:04:53.020> such<00:04:53.830> as

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
from current studies in science such as

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.650 
from current studies in science such as
the<00:04:54.070> ones<00:04:54.250> I<00:04:54.400> mentioned<00:04:54.460> earlier<00:04:55.390> this<00:04:55.600> year

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
the ones I mentioned earlier this year

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.030 
the ones I mentioned earlier this year
about<00:04:57.360> entangled<00:04:58.360> diamonds<00:04:58.900> and<00:04:59.140> altruistic

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
about entangled diamonds and altruistic

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.940 
about entangled diamonds and altruistic
rats<00:05:00.520> and<00:05:00.880> when<00:05:01.660> you<00:05:01.750> consider<00:05:02.320> that<00:05:02.650> we're

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
rats and when you consider that we're

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.340 
rats and when you consider that we're
getting<00:05:03.040> all<00:05:03.400> of<00:05:03.460> these<00:05:03.820> indicators<00:05:04.720> that<00:05:05.080> are

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
getting all of these indicators that are

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.380 
getting all of these indicators that are
showing<00:05:05.770> us<00:05:05.950> this<00:05:06.550> is<00:05:06.730> what<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:07.030> might<00:05:07.210> look

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
showing us this is what it might look

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.000 
showing us this is what it might look
like<00:05:07.450> when<00:05:07.870> you<00:05:07.960> do<00:05:08.140> travel<00:05:08.410> between<00:05:08.770> parallel

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
like when you do travel between parallel

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.520 
like when you do travel between parallel
universes<00:05:09.910> you<00:05:10.270> might<00:05:10.840> not<00:05:11.020> notice<00:05:11.200> that<00:05:11.410> the

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
universes you might not notice that the

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.380 
universes you might not notice that the
whole<00:05:11.680> universe<00:05:11.860> is<00:05:12.280> different<00:05:12.730> you<00:05:13.210> might

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
whole universe is different you might

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.120 
whole universe is different you might
just<00:05:13.570> see<00:05:13.780> one<00:05:13.960> or<00:05:14.080> two<00:05:14.260> small<00:05:14.590> things<00:05:14.890> that

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
just see one or two small things that

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.400 
just see one or two small things that
are<00:05:15.250> different<00:05:15.430> and<00:05:15.760> you<00:05:15.850> can<00:05:16.390> sometimes<00:05:17.200> go

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
are different and you can sometimes go

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.820 
are different and you can sometimes go
back<00:05:17.590> and<00:05:17.800> forth<00:05:18.040> between<00:05:18.280> them<00:05:18.780> so<00:05:19.780> with<00:05:20.650> all

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
back and forth between them so with all

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.470 
back and forth between them so with all
of<00:05:20.860> that<00:05:21.100> in<00:05:21.280> mind<00:05:21.460> I'd<00:05:21.640> like<00:05:21.760> to<00:05:21.820> ask<00:05:22.150> my

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
of that in mind I'd like to ask my

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.060 
of that in mind I'd like to ask my

mind as well and that is how good can it
get<00:05:27.750> when<00:05:28.750> you<00:05:28.840> travel<00:05:29.200> between<00:05:29.350> parallel

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
get when you travel between parallel

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.090 
get when you travel between parallel
