00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:21.300
 the extractor leftovers are not thrown away 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.789
 off we go today we use to do 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.330
 the cereal bars with the forward 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.699
 of the rector we need 400 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:35.030
 grams of leftover fruit and vegetables 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:38.910
 from the extractor 80 g of oat flakes 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.280
 25 grams of sunflower seeds 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.820
 we need 10 grams of sesame 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.170
 white puffed rice events 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.780
 let's put the extractor residues if 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.390
 you want to make it as sweet as you can 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.809
 add a little syrup from gaber e 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.640
 then we add these oil seeds 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.550
 they do so well because they give me a 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.369
 sack of omega 6 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:11.659
 the flakes of having puffed rice 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:15.979
 and then a bit of sesame 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.530
 we mix everything well for this 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.350
 recipe we will use the troublemaker 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.869
 we take a plate and lie down 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:29.979
 on top of a paper sheet for dryer 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:32.899
 and we start preparing tiles 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.970
 take your tiles in fate and 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.670
 as many as you have left you can do 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.429
 even more than aster and then open the 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.789
 bore the plate 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:46.429
 inside you close it set one 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.929
 of programs if you need a program from 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.619
 40 degrees 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:55.490
 in this case our teaters then 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:59.420
 you can select them this way and then 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:03.140
 start it I dried it at 40 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.479
 degrees for 24 hours and after 12 hours i 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.630
 night out the tile and the 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.540
 portioned so that it does not crumble e 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:15.620
 both half dry 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:19.580
 the result will be this I have 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:24.050
 portioned and these bars came out 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:28.190
 they are extremely crunchy 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:31.600
 you have seen and even hear it in your mouth 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.500
 their very frankly 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.520
 interesting from the point of view 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.160
 theological and above all do 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.000
 extremely good to ours 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.000
 for their challenge
