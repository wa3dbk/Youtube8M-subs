00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.220
 Hello dear friends with you already in 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.950
 19 times I grew blah lighting the most 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.440
 stable outgoing transmission team ss 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.340
 and let's get started faster so 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.340
 go 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.510
 friends I decided a few issues 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.849
 experiment with words i remember 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.390
 that once upon a time when i'm with my 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.730
 mate 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.220
 played company battles and sometimes against us 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.050
 straight across the mouth, and that it was necessary to 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.600
 just to feed them they were ready 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.390
 play their main task was to inflict 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.760
 a little bit of damage and get silver and 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.940
 I was wondering what if to collect 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.330
 command right from and now you find out what 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.000
 from this we will begin with a choice 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.549
 tanks type a team of the same type 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.260
 a really melting problem and my first 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:04.830
 the composition had several t- 34,112,112 lions and 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.960
 a couple of t1 solution of course something else but on 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.549
 actually straight segment choice is wrong 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.590
 is great 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.590
 t-34 became my main shock fist 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.500
 honestly manages such a composition 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.690
 extremely unusually american pretty 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.369
 slow tank and if it sits 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.770
 a man who is not alone 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.680
 characterized by high processor frequencies 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.020
 then it is a disaster to win 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.380
 composition can be in my general 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.950
 it turned out won somewhere in 10 1 out of 16 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.680
 but if it makes sense to collect such compounds 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.150
 let's start with the main problem exactly 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.830
 universality in city maps we 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.570
 quite well hold by 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.900
 proper location of the tanks for 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.510
 shelters but here on the field maps we have 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.100
 problems begin especially if 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.560
 there are several enemy teams 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.570
 drummers but several times managed 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.760
 and win for example on lasville 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.190
 opponents just drowned while we 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.920
 tried to drive on their heavy 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.770
 tanks on the first line and they stayed 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.780
 one square-5 which is probably stuck too 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.330
 and just did not have time to get to the water 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.780
 I also caught myself thinking that 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.300
 I lacked 50100 or 1390 at prem 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.549
 tanks simply some and replace the other 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.810
 the question is which frenchman will want to go to 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.810
 such a crazy composition 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.450
 in the end we get pretty slow 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.609
 composition which is good to use for 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.859
 DEFA although several times I have 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:32.319
 it turned out to make rush maneuvers and 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:34.510
 capture the bases but still manage 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.760
 I didnâ€™t like this team too much 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.370
 maybe there was a problem in the people themselves 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.799
 guys frankly a lot of stupid and not 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.230
 always obey commands is probably 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:51.730
 straight technology so affected them not 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:53.739
 I know in general, but we are 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.200
 take in order to farm and get 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.230
 silver on an unprecedented scale and 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.139
 In this case, it is absolutely not yourself 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.409
 justifies the net income for the battle from 30 to 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:07.659
 60 thousand silver on t-34 is 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.549
 really very little besides 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.310
 between fights someone can walk in 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.590
 smoke or leave the team altogether and 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.900
 I spent a large part of my playing time 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.909
 it is in the hangar so prim the team doesn't 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.680
 can be used for its intended purpose and 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:23.379
 to collect such a composition is only that 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.419
 If you are really bored and you 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:28.979
 want to try something unusual and 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:31.209
 forbidden but you understand what I mean 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:33.340
 friends can't start talking yet 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.349
 full about average setup 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.720
 so that you understand those practices that 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.569
 were featured in past issues gone 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.269
 baptism of fire and sword and a couple thousand 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.759
 fights and take and say a certain 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.979
 tactics for team combat without big 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:50.290
 the number of cap on it, I simply do not 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:52.299
 I can, so most likely coming 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.609
 a few weeks the releases will pass 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.769
 slightly in a different format I suggest you 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.549
 write interesting compositions on which 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.799
 you can play 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.049
 and I will tell you relatively briefly 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.909
 to you about your gaming experience and 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.009
 in addition, I will also create 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:07.689
 medium fast composition and tactics for 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:10.090
 him postscript 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:11.919
 guys gave me a new account so 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.570
 everyone who has the technique for fast 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:18.639
 composition in the face t69 50100 1390 and pershing 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.259
 You can write your nickname in the comments and 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.289
 when i go next team 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:25.719
 fight will surely call everyone well and 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.190
 last saturday last you all 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:29.860
 know i was in the world 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.880
 at the meeting of the authors of wot fan and at the final 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.130
 golden leagues 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.410
 about how it was possible to look at 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.690
 me on the channel link to somewhere 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.060
 in the description well from your subscription I

 funny moments and yes guys i know what 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.830
 there is a big delay here and a lot of it 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.990
 I haven't come yet I honestly give all the lists 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.660
 to get gold, well then everything 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.120
 delay the guys from the yard but if u 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.070
 something funny happened to you 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.680
 team fight then send you a replay 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.080
 to the address you see in the description I
