00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.559 
computer monitor but be kind of weird on
a<00:01:59.280> big-screen<00:01:59.490> TV<00:01:59.759> because<00:02:00.179> it'd<00:02:00.299> just<00:02:00.389> be

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
a big-screen TV because it'd just be

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:02.359 
a big-screen TV because it'd just be
kind<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.840> dangling<00:02:01.229> down<00:02:01.530> anyways<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.189> nice

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
kind of dangling down anyways it's nice

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.819 
kind of dangling down anyways it's nice
that<00:02:02.609> it's<00:02:02.759> there<00:02:03.259> so<00:02:04.259> let's<00:02:04.560> go<00:02:04.619> ahead<00:02:04.740> and

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
that it's there so let's go ahead and

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.779 
that it's there so let's go ahead and
take<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.039> look<00:02:05.249> at<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.609> the<00:02:05.999> software<00:02:06.359> on<00:02:06.600> here

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
take a look at the the software on here

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.889 
take a look at the the software on here
here's<00:02:08.789> what<00:02:09.060> you'll<00:02:09.179> see<00:02:09.360> when<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.630> boot<00:02:09.810> up

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
here's what you'll see when you boot up

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.320 
here's what you'll see when you boot up
the<00:02:10.080> amido<00:02:10.500> for<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.890> first<00:02:11.100> time<00:02:11.430> I've<00:02:12.090> went

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
the amido for the first time I've went

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.790 
the amido for the first time I've went
through<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.720> installed<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.230> few<00:02:13.410> programs

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
through and installed a few programs

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.950 
through and installed a few programs
already<00:02:14.040> but<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.850> basically<00:02:15.510> what<00:02:15.780> this

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
already but this is basically what this

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.570 
already but this is basically what this
the<00:02:16.350> stock<00:02:16.590> launcher<00:02:16.860> looks<00:02:17.190> like<00:02:17.280> x

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
the stock launcher looks like x

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.980 
the stock launcher looks like x
comes<00:02:17.790> with<00:02:17.940> two<00:02:18.180> launchers<00:02:18.570> there's<00:02:18.780> another

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
comes with two launchers there's another

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.240 
comes with two launchers there's another
one<00:02:19.140> that's<00:02:19.290> made<00:02:19.530> for<00:02:19.800> being<00:02:19.920> easy<00:02:20.130> to

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
one that's made for being easy to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.940 
one that's made for being easy to
navigate<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.630> we'll<00:02:21.840> run<00:02:21.990> Linpack<00:02:22.500> on<00:02:22.710> here

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
navigate so we'll run Linpack on here

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.700 
navigate so we'll run Linpack on here
and<00:02:23.070> see<00:02:23.190> out<00:02:23.280> benchmarks<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:25.290> comes<00:02:25.530> in

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
and see out benchmarks and it comes in

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.520 
and see out benchmarks and it comes in
actually<00:02:26.160> really<00:02:26.520> good<00:02:26.670> 769<00:02:27.630> we<00:02:28.320> somewhere

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
actually really good 769 we somewhere

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.620 
actually really good 769 we somewhere
between<00:02:28.680> 65<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.490> 69<00:02:29.820> usually<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.390> what<00:02:30.510> it

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
between 65 and 69 usually is what it

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.150 
between 65 and 69 usually is what it
came<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:30.930> at<00:02:31.110> if<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.320> wasn't<00:02:31.590> doing<00:02:31.800> something

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
came in at if it wasn't doing something

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.560 
came in at if it wasn't doing something
else<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:32.430> that's<00:02:32.640> really<00:02:32.940> good<00:02:33.210> that<00:02:33.240> beats

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
else so that's really good that beats

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.740 
else so that's really good that beats

speakers as far as the good quality ones
go<00:03:20.640> but<00:03:21.360> this<00:03:21.690> thing<00:03:21.959> I'd<00:03:22.170> say<00:03:22.380> is<00:03:22.410> one<00:03:22.739> of<00:03:22.830> my

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
go but this thing I'd say is one of my

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.100 
go but this thing I'd say is one of my
most<00:03:23.160> used<00:03:23.370> devices<00:03:23.970> that<00:03:24.300> I've<00:03:24.420> got<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:24.660> use<00:03:24.959> it

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
most used devices that I've got I use it

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.840 
most used devices that I've got I use it
all<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.320> time<00:03:25.470> take<00:03:25.890> it<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.100> work<00:03:26.370> take<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:26.790> on

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
all the time take it to work take it on

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.449 
all the time take it to work take it on
trips<00:03:27.239> everything<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.140> it's<00:03:28.950> definitely

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
trips everything so it's definitely

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.280 
trips everything so it's definitely
worth<00:03:29.730> taking<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.300> look<00:03:30.330> if<00:03:30.660> you<00:03:30.810> need<00:03:31.019> to<00:03:31.140> get

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
worth taking a look if you need to get

some tasks that I know make my phone a
little<00:04:38.120> warm<00:04:38.330> like<00:04:38.630> when<00:04:38.780> you're<00:04:38.900> adding

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
little warm like when you're adding

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.960 
little warm like when you're adding
icons<00:04:39.740> and<00:04:40.310> playing<00:04:40.550> with<00:04:40.730> the<00:04:40.790> live

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
icons and playing with the live

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
wallpaper and things like that

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.470 
wallpaper and things like that
I<00:04:42.500> couldn't<00:04:43.130> make<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:43.400> MX<00:04:43.610> one<00:04:43.820> lock<00:04:44.150> up<00:04:44.330> at

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
I couldn't make the MX one lock up at

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.810 
I couldn't make the MX one lock up at
all<00:04:44.600> or<00:04:44.900> even<00:04:44.930> slow<00:04:45.590> down<00:04:45.620> so<00:04:46.460> I<00:04:46.490> thought<00:04:46.700> the

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
all or even slow down so I thought the

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.190 
all or even slow down so I thought the
best<00:04:46.970> thing<00:04:47.060> to<00:04:47.210> do<00:04:47.420> would<00:04:47.600> be<00:04:47.720> to<00:04:47.750> run<00:04:47.930> a<00:04:47.990> live

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
best thing to do would be to run a live

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.620 
best thing to do would be to run a live
wallpaper<00:04:48.350> along<00:04:49.010> with<00:04:49.250> 1080p<00:04:49.910> video<00:04:50.270> running

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.480 
over the top of it in a window and it
now<00:04:53.360> plays<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:53.900> 1080p<00:04:54.350> video<00:04:54.650> just<00:04:54.980> fine<00:04:55.250> by

now plays the 1080p video just fine by
the<00:04:55.580> way<00:04:55.760> over<00:04:56.240> better<00:04:56.450> than<00:04:56.660> the<00:04:56.780> Mk<00:04:57.170> 808<00:04:57.710> it

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
the way over better than the Mk 808 it
