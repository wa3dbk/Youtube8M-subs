00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.600
It's first time for manic trip

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.680
Did you see me? So when? what hour? minute? and second?

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.320
Only time is shattered, my mental is fine

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.900
I already win this fight, but let's do more for fun

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.260
I'm sorry, I expected all variables

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.340
I saw your future, I watched your crushed face

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.920
I will come back after some thinking

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:06.423
Death Motion

00:02:15.057 --> 00:02:17.057
Homeguard Effect

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:29.501
Passive: Z-Drive Resonance

00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:34.660
Ekko's damaging spells and attacks build up Resonance stacks on his enemies.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.900
Every third attack against the same target triggers Ekko’s passive, dealing bonus damage and slowing his enemy.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.020
If he triggers his passive on an enemy champion, Ekko also gains a strong movement speed buff.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.020
Q: Timewinder

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.260
Ekko throws a device in a target direction, damaging all enemies along its path.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.920
Once it reaches max distance or hits an enemy champion, the device expands, creating a field that slows all enemy and neutral units.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.300
After a moment, the device contracts and rushes back to Ekko, dealing extra damage to all enemies in its path.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.300
W: Parallel Convergence

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.880
Passive: Ekko’s basic attacks deal bonus damage to low health targets.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.840
Active: Ekko opens a time rift, creating an alternate reality copy of him that tosses a device to a target location.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.920
After a delay, the device expands into a broad slowing zone. If Ekko enters the sphere, it detonates, granting him a shield while stunning all enemies inside.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.920
E: Phase Dive

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.980
Ekko dashes a fixed distance towards a target area.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.960
Once his initial dash has ended, Ekko gains greatly increased range on his next basic attack, and blinks to his target to deal damage and apply on-hit and spell effects.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.625
R: Chronobreak

00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:30.900
Ekko rewinds time, briefly turning untargetable and invulnerable before reappearing wherever he was 4 seconds ago.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:39.760
Once he reappears, Ekko recovers a portion of the health he lost over those few seconds while dealing tons of damage to all nearby enemies.
