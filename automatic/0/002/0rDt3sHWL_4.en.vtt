00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.130
 Of the 7 5 7 living animals in this place, they hardly found 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:17.210
 both when I finally get the best years 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.210
 after one year abstinence 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.279
 with Dr 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.119
 around and net Nils Barça and the nut 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.180
 two very experienced players 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.690
 and also 2 young wild more or less Aldi after his 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.780
 Biennial Moosheimer Regal relegation play 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.870
 and last year with percent freeman on whom have created everything good 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.210
 occupied fourth place 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.630
 on 1 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.020
 Fourth place nevertheless played very well 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.980
 and now he did not have such a good year with WDR last year so had to envy 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.370
 the speech questions 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.489
 He has never really worked out with him 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.030
 and each one narrowly missed Reds with the finals 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.210
 and that's why my decision is over 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.720
 the four players liked 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.000
 why I get ready »Hairing is not something else then prosecution 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.050
 has decided to 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.970
 with just there 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.790
 the Tiber hint 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.740
 Leader or the people who are percent 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.700
 with Skibbe h 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.920
 outing 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.100
 are just a bit intrusive events the fanbase is already there 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.150
 the flags shreds are very crazy percent you have to go on it 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.430
 and percent 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.690
 There are just people you can get so you feel and the team will be there 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.120
 a lot of minded posts a what is with other clans maybe 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.480
 not the case 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.350
 and you look around 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.180
 Tabea Harrer also works for a lot of good and and there is always 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.990
 better 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.590
 continue ahead and percent 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.390
 Mareike has done quite a good job over the years 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.000
 I think outside the tooth pull very very good developed the ps-number 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:09.969
 we are ready for this year 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:13.159
 no real goal set 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:17.090
 we want to get the maximum as a try 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.749
 very very much 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:22.009
 to play on teamplay that is 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:23.789
 we want 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:27.549
 this year our again with her Bahar on the finals percent establish 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.809
 or is it not at all the users keep the relegation 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.589
 a disaster for the Werra so I see that 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:38.679
 and that's why we try to get hold of him primitive final place 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:41.999
 around has practical 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.909
 next year still completely different in 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.619
 to attack as a super great topic 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:50.209
 because I think you need a certain amount of time 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.470
 Unna TBH just to bring back up and with too 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:59.120
 tumbled heaps percent to succeed and also internationally 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.930
 Now let's give up the Unnaer set the first accents next week
