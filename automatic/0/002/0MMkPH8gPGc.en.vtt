talking<00:00:10.360> about<00:00:10.900> backwards<00:00:11.709> compatibility

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
talking about backwards compatibility

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.390 
talking about backwards compatibility
for<00:00:12.969> the<00:00:13.119> xbox<00:00:13.750> one<00:00:14.139> and<00:00:14.350> how<00:00:14.859> I<00:00:14.889> believe<00:00:15.369> that

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400 
for the xbox one and how I believe that

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.970 
for the xbox one and how I believe that
it's<00:00:15.789> coming<00:00:16.029> sooner<00:00:16.600> than<00:00:16.779> later<00:00:17.140> I<00:00:17.500> think

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
it's coming sooner than later I think

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.929 
it's coming sooner than later I think
they<00:00:18.130> might<00:00:18.340> just<00:00:18.670> announce<00:00:19.060> this<00:00:19.269> at<00:00:19.480> e3<00:00:19.740> 2015

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
they might just announce this at e3 2015

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.269 
they might just announce this at e3 2015
and<00:00:22.019> here<00:00:23.019> is<00:00:23.140> my<00:00:23.320> reasoning<00:00:23.859> for<00:00:23.980> thinking

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
and here is my reasoning for thinking

eighty percent of needing an eighty

percent less bandwidth now it already

percent less bandwidth now it already
takes<00:00:48.340> a<00:00:48.580> tiny<00:00:49.330> bit<00:00:49.690> of<00:00:49.870> internet<00:00:50.140> to<00:00:50.770> use<00:00:51.250> the

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
takes a tiny bit of internet to use the

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.780 
takes a tiny bit of internet to use the
cloud<00:00:51.910> streaming<00:00:52.720> services<00:00:53.440> so<00:00:54.010> eighty

cloud streaming services so eighty

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.120 
cloud streaming services so eighty
percent<00:00:55.090> is<00:00:55.510> a<00:00:55.540> huge<00:00:56.020> chunk<00:00:56.410> of<00:00:56.560> that<00:00:56.620> so<00:00:56.980> now

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
percent is a huge chunk of that so now

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.770 
percent is a huge chunk of that so now
even<00:00:57.460> people<00:00:57.850> with<00:00:57.970> really<00:00:58.210> really<00:00:58.570> bad

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
even people with really really bad

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.690 
even people with really really bad
english<00:00:59.260> she'll<00:00:59.710> be<00:00:59.830> up<00:00:59.950> in<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.130> stream<00:01:00.430> games

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
english she'll be up in the stream games

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.960 
english she'll be up in the stream games
and<00:01:01.030> still<00:01:01.450> get<00:01:01.720> a<00:01:01.750> very<00:01:02.170> good<00:01:02.520> connection<00:01:03.520> now

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
and still get a very good connection now

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.210 
and still get a very good connection now
why<00:01:04.390> I<00:01:04.420> think<00:01:04.600> this<00:01:04.809> is<00:01:04.930> meaning<00:01:05.379> that<00:01:05.799> that

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
why I think this is meaning that that

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.330 
why I think this is meaning that that
variability<00:01:06.759> is<00:01:07.180> coming<00:01:07.540> is<00:01:08.439> because<00:01:08.710> it

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
variability is coming is because it

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.880 
variability is coming is because it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
says that gang streaming is a lot harder

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.260 
says that gang streaming is a lot harder
than<00:01:13.870> video<00:01:14.170> streamer<00:01:14.680> and<00:01:15.060> when<00:01:16.060> they

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
than video streamer and when they

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.320 
than video streamer and when they
actually<00:01:16.600> strain<00:01:17.230> these<00:01:17.409> games<00:01:17.800> that<00:01:18.700> um

actually strain these games that um

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.990 
actually strain these games that um
there<00:01:20.080> was<00:01:20.230> barely<00:01:20.650> any<00:01:21.010> lag<00:01:21.370> and<00:01:21.729> this<00:01:21.850> is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
there was barely any lag and this is

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.570

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
from people who actually play games for

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.640 
from people who actually play games for

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
hardcore gamers were playing it's and

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.390 
hardcore gamers were playing it's and
saying<00:01:28.450> these<00:01:28.630> things<00:01:28.690> so<00:01:29.590> what<00:01:30.220> does<00:01:30.340> that

mean<00:01:30.790> for<00:01:31.090> us<00:01:31.510> I<00:01:31.870> feel<00:01:32.320> like<00:01:32.470> I<00:01:32.800> know<00:01:33.040> that

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
mean for us I feel like I know that

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.980 
mean for us I feel like I know that
they're<00:01:33.460> gonna<00:01:33.580> probably<00:01:33.880> use<00:01:34.120> this<00:01:34.360> for<00:01:34.870> the

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
they're gonna probably use this for the

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.620 
they're gonna probably use this for the
pc<00:01:35.470> gaming<00:01:35.770> thing<00:01:36.190> to<00:01:36.520> you<00:01:37.030> know<00:01:37.150> to<00:01:37.210> go<00:01:37.420> back

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
pc gaming thing to you know to go back

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.870

and<00:01:37.659> forth<00:01:38.020> between<00:01:38.290> the<00:01:38.620> two<00:01:38.830> but<00:01:39.430> I<00:01:39.640> also

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
and forth between the two but I also

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.200 
and forth between the two but I also
believe<00:01:40.120> that<00:01:40.420> xbox<00:01:41.290> one<00:01:41.650> will<00:01:41.890> now<00:01:42.370> beginning

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
believe that xbox one will now beginning

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.140 
believe that xbox one will now beginning
the<00:01:43.450> same<00:01:43.720> type<00:01:44.020> of<00:01:44.049> service<00:01:44.710> as<00:01:44.920> Sony<00:01:45.610> like

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
the same type of service as Sony like

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.330 
the same type of service as Sony like
the<00:01:46.299> PlayStation<00:01:46.900> now<00:01:47.049> service

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
the PlayStation now service

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.459 
the PlayStation now service
and<00:01:48.579> i'm<00:01:49.270> not<00:01:49.450> sure<00:01:49.509> what<00:01:49.780> their<00:01:49.960> motto<00:01:50.200> will

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:50.469 
and i'm not sure what their motto will

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:52.499 
and i'm not sure what their motto will
be<00:01:50.619> if<00:01:51.100> it'll<00:01:51.340> be<00:01:51.369> free<00:01:51.759> they<00:01:52.090> probably<00:01:52.299> have

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
be if it'll be free they probably have

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.300 
be if it'll be free they probably have
it<00:01:52.630> like<00:01:52.750> thirty<00:01:53.259> dollars<00:01:53.619> a<00:01:53.679> month<00:01:53.710> or<00:01:54.039> twenty

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
it like thirty dollars a month or twenty

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.099 
it like thirty dollars a month or twenty
dollars<00:01:54.549> months<00:01:54.880> something<00:01:55.060> like<00:01:55.149> that<00:01:55.479> try

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
dollars months something like that try

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:57.840 
dollars months something like that try
and<00:01:56.170> keep<00:01:56.320> it<00:01:56.439> at<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.590> subscription<00:01:57.310> make<00:01:57.700> it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
and keep it at a subscription make it

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.319 
and keep it at a subscription make it
easier<00:01:58.270> on<00:01:58.359> people<00:01:59.069> swalot<00:02:00.069> but<00:02:00.759> this<00:02:01.060> just

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
easier on people swalot but this just

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.749 
easier on people swalot but this just
makes<00:02:01.630> me<00:02:01.840> think<00:02:02.079> that<00:02:02.280> these<00:02:03.280> things<00:02:03.579> are

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
makes me think that these things are

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.359 
makes me think that these things are
coming<00:02:04.119> like<00:02:04.569> really<00:02:05.140> fast<00:02:05.560> I<00:02:05.799> feel<00:02:06.069> like<00:02:06.130> this

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
coming like really fast I feel like this

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.369 
coming like really fast I feel like this
could<00:02:06.399> be<00:02:06.909> announced<00:02:07.329> at<00:02:07.420> e3<00:02:07.539> that<00:02:07.959> could<00:02:08.110> tell

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
could be announced at e3 that could tell

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:09.630 
could be announced at e3 that could tell
us<00:02:08.410> how<00:02:08.679> they're<00:02:08.890> gonna<00:02:09.009> do<00:02:09.220> backwards

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
us how they're gonna do backwards

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.119 
us how they're gonna do backwards
compatibility<00:02:10.539> and<00:02:11.019> with<00:02:11.590> this<00:02:11.769> cloud

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
compatibility and with this cloud

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:13.800 
compatibility and with this cloud
streaming<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.670> can<00:02:12.819> do<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:12.940> lot<00:02:13.239> more<00:02:13.269> than

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
streaming you can do a lot more than

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.009 
streaming you can do a lot more than
just<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:14.410> because<00:02:15.099> as<00:02:15.400> no<00:02:15.849> crackdown<00:02:16.660> it's

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
just that because as no crackdown it's

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.120 
just that because as no crackdown it's
also<00:02:17.290> supposed<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.860> be<00:02:17.980> using<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.780> cloud

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
also supposed to be using the cloud

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.729 
also supposed to be using the cloud
gaming<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.610> going<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.660> be<00:02:22.870> able<00:02:23.079> to<00:02:23.170> make<00:02:23.260> like

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
gaming and going to be able to make like

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.440 
gaming and going to be able to make like
the<00:02:23.890> whole<00:02:24.069> city<00:02:24.400> will<00:02:24.549> be<00:02:24.700> destructible

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
the whole city will be destructible

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.539 
the whole city will be destructible
basically<00:02:26.019> and<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.829> don't<00:02:27.099> know<00:02:27.220> if<00:02:27.340> that's

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
basically and I don't know if that's

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.479 
basically and I don't know if that's
exactly<00:02:28.090> how<00:02:28.329> it'll<00:02:28.540> be<00:02:28.890> but<00:02:29.890> that's<00:02:30.099> what

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
exactly how it'll be but that's what

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:31.979 
exactly how it'll be but that's what
they're<00:02:30.760> making<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.209> seem<00:02:31.480> like<00:02:31.510> that's

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
they're making it seem like that's

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.530 
they're making it seem like that's
what's<00:02:32.200> gonna<00:02:32.319> be<00:02:32.500> going<00:02:32.530> on<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.220> if<00:02:33.940> this<00:02:34.329> is

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
what's gonna be going on and if this is

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.229

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
if you guys think that this is actually

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.320

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
because I'm actually thinking III now

already out they already are behind by a

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.560 
already out they already are behind by a
small<00:04:18.100> amount<00:04:18.130> with<00:04:18.760> it<00:04:18.940> comes<00:04:19.209> backwards

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
small amount with it comes backwards

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.040 
small amount with it comes backwards
compatibility<00:04:20.459> but<00:04:21.459> we're<00:04:22.090> question<00:04:22.600> lies<00:04:22.780> is

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
compatibility but we're question lies is

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.900 
compatibility but we're question lies is
it<00:04:23.200> they're<00:04:23.740> going<00:04:23.889> to<00:04:23.979> be<00:04:24.100> able<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.370> match

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
it they're going to be able to match

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.900 
it they're going to be able to match
Sony's<00:04:26.040> streaming<00:04:27.040> service<00:04:27.340> I'm<00:04:27.490> sure<00:04:27.760> it'll

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
Sony's streaming service I'm sure it'll

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.690 
Sony's streaming service I'm sure it'll
probably<00:04:28.150> be<00:04:28.389> better<00:04:29.080> than<00:04:29.680> their<00:04:29.950> just

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
probably be better than their just

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.350 
probably be better than their just
because<00:04:30.970> they<00:04:31.210> are<00:04:32.020> like<00:04:32.440> one<00:04:32.680> of<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:32.889> biggest

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
because they are like one of the biggest

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.150 
because they are like one of the biggest
cloud<00:04:34.360> gaming<00:04:34.660> text<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:35.650> they<00:04:35.860> probably

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
cloud gaming text and they probably

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.010 
cloud gaming text and they probably
putting<00:04:36.400> millions<00:04:36.760> of<00:04:37.120> dollars<00:04:37.479> just

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
putting millions of dollars just

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.310 
putting millions of dollars just
researching<00:04:38.530> just<00:04:39.130> cloud<00:04:39.760> gaming<00:04:40.090> alone<00:04:40.630> you

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
researching just cloud gaming alone you

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.690 
researching just cloud gaming alone you
know<00:04:41.440> what<00:04:41.560> I<00:04:41.590> mean<00:04:41.770> so<00:04:42.070> I<00:04:42.100> feel<00:04:42.370> like<00:04:42.400> there's

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.029 
know what I mean so I feel like there's
are<00:04:42.850> probably<00:04:43.090> better<00:04:43.419> but<00:04:44.110> it's<00:04:44.560> really<00:04:44.770> all

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
are probably better but it's really all

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.490 
are probably better but it's really all
