the jelly texture in the and the
washcloth<00:01:06.080> but<00:01:06.320> it<00:01:06.409> washes<00:01:06.770> out<00:01:06.920> very<00:01:07.760> quickly

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
washcloth but it washes out very quickly

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.149 
washcloth but it washes out very quickly
that's<00:01:09.140> something<00:01:09.500> I<00:01:09.590> found<00:01:09.710> out<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.010> hard

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
that's something I found out the hard

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.220 
that's something I found out the hard
way<00:01:10.280> is<00:01:10.670> at<00:01:10.790> first<00:01:11.030> I<00:01:11.150> was<00:01:11.299> trying<00:01:11.510> to<00:01:11.600> scrub<00:01:12.050> it

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
way is at first I was trying to scrub it

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.960 
way is at first I was trying to scrub it
off<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:12.680> that<00:01:12.800> I<00:01:13.040> didn't<00:01:13.430> really<00:01:13.640> work<00:01:13.790> out<00:01:13.910> so

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
off and that I didn't really work out so

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.030 
off and that I didn't really work out so
well<00:01:14.240> then<00:01:14.720> logic<00:01:15.260> kicked<00:01:15.560> in<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:15.920> I

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
well then logic kicked in and I

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.670 
well then logic kicked in and I
remembered<00:01:16.490> that<00:01:16.870> just<00:01:17.870> softened<00:01:18.260> it<00:01:18.320> back<00:01:18.470> up

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
remembered that just softened it back up

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.860 
remembered that just softened it back up
it<00:01:18.890> would<00:01:19.010> come<00:01:19.160> off<00:01:19.190> and<00:01:19.610> right<00:01:20.480> after<00:01:20.750> I<00:01:20.780> did

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
it would come off and right after I did

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.440 
it would come off and right after I did
that<00:01:21.140> it<00:01:21.530> came<00:01:22.070> off<00:01:22.250> like<00:01:22.490> a<00:01:22.520> charm<00:01:22.820> good<00:01:23.270> thing

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
that it came off like a charm good thing

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.130 
that it came off like a charm good thing
now<00:01:23.690> so<00:01:23.930> this<00:01:24.470> is<00:01:24.760> the<00:01:25.760> chia<00:01:26.680> seed<00:01:27.680> base<00:01:28.670> mask

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
now so this is the chia seed base mask

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.840 
now so this is the chia seed base mask
I'm<00:01:30.140> gonna<00:01:30.470> keep<00:01:30.680> doing<00:01:31.040> it<00:01:31.190> because<00:01:31.490> I<00:01:31.640> like

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
I'm gonna keep doing it because I like

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.020 
I'm gonna keep doing it because I like
the<00:01:32.030> results<00:01:32.450> I<00:01:32.540> like<00:01:32.930> how<00:01:33.170> my<00:01:33.200> skin<00:01:33.770> feels<00:01:34.130> go

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
the results I like how my skin feels go

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.020 
the results I like how my skin feels go
ahead<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:35.600> and<00:01:35.930> be<00:01:36.140> creative<00:01:36.470> and<00:01:37.040> you

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
know if there's something you really

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
like in your face max addict

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.240 
like in your face max addict
the<00:01:42.890> end<00:01:43.250> result<00:01:43.610> I<00:01:43.790> wound<00:01:44.120> up<00:01:44.270> using<00:01:45.250> two

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
the end result I wound up using two

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.300 
the end result I wound up using two
teaspoons<00:01:46.880> of<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.870> chia<00:01:48.080> powder<00:01:48.440> that<00:01:49.010> I<00:01:49.070> had

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
teaspoons of the chia powder that I had

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.399 
teaspoons of the chia powder that I had
ground<00:01:49.580> into<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.090> fine<00:01:50.390> powder<00:01:50.659> with<00:01:50.990> my<00:01:51.140> coffee

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
ground into a fine powder with my coffee

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.960 
ground into a fine powder with my coffee
grinder<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:52.880> seven<00:01:53.630> teaspoons<00:01:53.840> of<00:01:54.320> water<00:01:54.650> and

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
grinder to seven teaspoons of water and

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.040 
grinder to seven teaspoons of water and
that<00:01:55.970> worked<00:01:56.240> pretty<00:01:56.479> well

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
that worked pretty well

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.570 
that worked pretty well
it's<00:01:57.409> a<00:01:57.500> little<00:01:57.680> bit<00:01:57.770> tricky<00:01:58.070> getting<00:01:58.220> it<00:01:58.460> on

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
it's a little bit tricky getting it on

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.320 
it's a little bit tricky getting it on
if<00:01:58.850> you<00:01:59.150> want<00:01:59.390> like<00:01:59.720> the<00:02:00.280> pulp<00:02:01.280> in<00:02:01.640> there<00:02:02.030> and

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
if you want like the pulp in there and

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.760 
if you want like the pulp in there and
there's<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:03.050> lot<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.229> better<00:02:03.440> word<00:02:03.620> to<00:02:03.740> describe

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
there's a lot a better word to describe

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.490 
there's a lot a better word to describe
it<00:02:04.340> you<00:02:04.909> can<00:02:05.090> bury<00:02:05.299> your<00:02:05.390> ratios<00:02:05.960> if<00:02:06.229> you<00:02:06.320> like

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
it you can bury your ratios if you like

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.800 
it you can bury your ratios if you like
a<00:02:06.530> thinner<00:02:06.830> mask<00:02:07.100> you<00:02:07.549> know<00:02:07.700> obviously<00:02:08.659> use

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
a thinner mask you know obviously use

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.440 
a thinner mask you know obviously use
more<00:02:09.019> water<00:02:09.200> if<00:02:09.470> you<00:02:09.590> like<00:02:09.739> a<00:02:09.769> thicker<00:02:10.069> mask

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
more water if you like a thicker mask

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.070 
more water if you like a thicker mask
then<00:02:12.280> use<00:02:13.280> less<00:02:13.519> water<00:02:13.700> it's<00:02:14.569> pretty<00:02:14.780> simple

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
then use less water it's pretty simple

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.790 
then use less water it's pretty simple
just<00:02:15.379> I<00:02:16.340> let<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.330> chia<00:02:17.930> seed<00:02:18.260> or<00:02:18.530> powder

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
just I let the the chia seed or powder

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.600 
just I let the the chia seed or powder
observe<00:02:19.250> the

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
observe the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.850 
observe the
