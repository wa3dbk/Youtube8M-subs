and I'm just gonna go to that right so

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.760 
and I'm just gonna go to that right so
that's<00:05:25.370> that's<00:05:25.849> really<00:05:26.030> all<00:05:26.720> that<00:05:26.960> there<00:05:27.020> is

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
I mean see it has like all the

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.930
