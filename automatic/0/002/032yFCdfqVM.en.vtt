00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:11.580
 I intend to build a road 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:19.260
 but I need a nice pylon by chance one 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:22.080

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.970

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.039
 of the settlers of Catan and colonize 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.510

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.099

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.030

 pelliccetta ok as a state no there is one 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.350
 most important question is why it 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.850
 do and are you talking remember what has you 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.320

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.230
 violated the purity of my sister for 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.399
 take off the devastated expression not 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.440

 I can not wait 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:11.400
 there was sarcasm no good then the reason 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.740
 so you're obsessed with a free-range 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.180
 as simple as penny and who she is 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.830
 exactly the opposite of yours 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.049
 your very first romantic interest 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.299
 brilliant though threatening mother from 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.619
 where the hell she got this from 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.040

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.040
 covetous 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.689
 does not mean that it is the truth yes 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:35.180
 called non-fiction literature for a 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:36.619
 reason see you if they had to do a 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.380
 movie from that book you know who it should 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:45.909
 make his mother sandra bullock for whom 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.909
 because perfect whatever it does 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.720
 then where we had stayed dry 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.539
 some of you have a pillar I have 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:02.840

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.630
 enormous pleasure I will begin to erect 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:14.319
 I do not believe in my settlement 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.319

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.220
 eight and a half two penalties you have 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.750
 decided to give you the most peaceful joy 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.750
 at 30 and still lives with your mother 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.290
 I would say that it did not go well 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.760
 this we can not know not with 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.260
 absolute certainty all that 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.260

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.280
 now we know it again I am not there 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.580
 evidence as far as we know could 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.580
 having killed him 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.700
 now gentlemen we return to our game 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.700

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.090
