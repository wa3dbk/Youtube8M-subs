to<00:00:09.150> warm<00:00:09.360> up<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.660> bike<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:10.170> operating

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
to warm up the bike to operating

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.780 
to warm up the bike to operating
temperature<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:11.160> way<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.519> the

temperature that way the the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.730 
temperature that way the the
transmission<00:00:12.360> fluid<00:00:12.509> flows<00:00:12.929> out<00:00:13.139> easier<00:00:13.530> and

and also any contaminants in there were

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.080 
and also any contaminants in there were
more<00:00:16.170> likely<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.470> come<00:00:16.710> out<00:00:16.890> with<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.220> used

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
more likely to come out with the used

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.330 
more likely to come out with the used

right<00:00:31.410> here

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
right here

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.150 
right here
there's<00:00:33.510> an<00:00:33.660> easy<00:00:33.840> easy<00:00:34.530> way<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.739> found<00:00:35.040> to

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
there's an easy easy way I found to

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.799 
there's an easy easy way I found to
clean<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.820> take<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.030> soft<00:00:36.360> bristled

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
clean it is to take a soft bristled

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.040 
clean it is to take a soft bristled
toothbrush<00:00:37.730> scrub<00:00:38.730> around<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.180> area<00:00:39.510> loosen

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
toothbrush scrub around the area loosen

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.369 
toothbrush scrub around the area loosen
up<00:00:40.170> any<00:00:40.290> loose<00:00:40.590> dirt<00:00:40.950> debris<00:00:41.960> then<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.230> got

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
up any loose dirt debris then if you got

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.549 
up any loose dirt debris then if you got
an<00:00:43.500> air<00:00:43.680> hose<00:00:43.920> take<00:00:44.280> your<00:00:45.079> compressed<00:00:46.079> air<00:00:46.320> and

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
an air hose take your compressed air and

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.830 
an air hose take your compressed air and
then<00:00:46.649> blow<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.309> area<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:48.030> blow<00:00:48.510> away<00:00:48.629> any

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
then blow the area to blow away any

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.560 
then blow the area to blow away any
debris<00:00:48.989> that's<00:00:49.350> there<00:00:49.590> or<00:00:49.710> loose<00:00:49.890> debris<00:00:53.570> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
debris that's there or loose debris the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.990 
debris that's there or loose debris the
first<00:00:54.840> step<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.320> changing<00:00:56.039> your<00:00:56.280> transmission

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
first step in changing your transmission

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.990 
first step in changing your transmission
fluid<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.899> remove<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.800> oil<00:00:59.520> filler<00:00:59.910> cap

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
fluid is to remove this oil filler cap

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.700 
fluid is to remove this oil filler cap
and<00:01:01.399> then<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.640> next<00:01:03.090> step<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:04.439> go

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
and then the next step is to go

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.730 
and then the next step is to go
underneath<00:01:04.979> here<00:01:09.200> we<00:01:10.200> move<00:01:10.380> your

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
underneath here we move your

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.620 
underneath here we move your
transmission<00:01:11.490> drain<00:01:11.880> plug<00:01:12.180> which<00:01:12.390> would<00:01:12.510> be

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
transmission drain plug which would be

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.710 
transmission drain plug which would be
right<00:01:12.810> here<00:01:13.310> right<00:01:14.310> here<00:01:14.420> kind<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.540> hard<00:01:15.659> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
right here right here kind of hard to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.859 
right here right here kind of hard to
see<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:15.930> don't<00:01:16.110> know<00:01:16.170> if<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.619> focus<00:01:17.869> but

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
see I don't know if this is in focus but

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.109 
see I don't know if this is in focus but
anyway<00:01:19.170> let's<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:19.710> started<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:23.759> first<00:01:23.909> thing

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
anyway let's get started the first thing

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.039 
anyway let's get started the first thing
you<00:01:24.240> want<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.479> do<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.720> change<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
you want to do to change the

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.780 
you want to do to change the
transmission<00:01:25.619> fluid<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.130> loosen<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:26.580> this

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
transmission fluid is to loosen up this

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.530 
transmission fluid is to loosen up this
oil<00:01:27.540> filler<00:01:27.900> dipstick<00:01:28.770> cap<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:30.180> takes<00:01:30.390> a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
oil filler dipstick cap and that takes a

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.850 
oil filler dipstick cap and that takes a
3/8<00:01:31.079> inch<00:01:31.400> allen<00:01:32.400> wrench<00:01:36.439> and<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.500> want<00:01:37.799> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
3/8 inch allen wrench and you want to

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:49.930 
3/8 inch allen wrench and you want to
sum<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.250> up<00:01:38.310> all<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.759> way

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.670 

and<00:01:50.940> come<00:01:51.330> down<00:01:51.510> to<00:01:51.660> your<00:01:51.780> drain<00:01:52.140> plug<00:01:52.380> at<00:01:52.620> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
and come down to your drain plug at the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.330 
and come down to your drain plug at the
bottom<00:01:52.770> here<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:54.590> don't<00:01:55.590> know<00:01:55.800> if<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.220> get

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
bottom here I don't know if I can get

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.600 
bottom here I don't know if I can get
their<00:01:57.920> camera<00:01:58.920> down<00:01:59.100> going<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.370> show<00:01:59.550> you

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
their camera down going to show you

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:26.680 
their camera down going to show you
they'll<00:01:59.970> try<00:02:04.370> it<00:02:05.370> takes<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.820> 5/8<00:02:06.240> inch<00:02:06.650> socket

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.970 

it's<00:02:27.690> kind<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:28.050> hot<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:28.260> I'm<00:02:28.590> probably<00:02:28.770> gonna

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
it's kind of hot so I'm probably gonna

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:48.140 
it's kind of hot so I'm probably gonna
have<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.390> drop<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.600> in<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.930> oil<00:02:31.560> pan<00:02:47.000> not<00:02:48.000> too

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
have to drop this in the oil pan not too

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.830 
have to drop this in the oil pan not too
bad

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.080 

after<00:02:55.709> you<00:02:55.800> get<00:02:55.920> your<00:02:56.040> oil<00:02:56.099> drain<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.880> want<00:02:57.030> to

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
after you get your oil drain you want to

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.059 
after you get your oil drain you want to
take<00:02:57.270> your<00:02:57.480> oil<00:02:57.569> drain<00:02:58.170> plug<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.620> check<00:02:58.800> this

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
take your oil drain plug and check this

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.960 
take your oil drain plug and check this
oil<00:02:59.400> seal<00:02:59.790> check<00:03:00.209> for<00:03:00.360> any<00:03:00.510> cracks<00:03:01.760> this<00:03:02.760> is
