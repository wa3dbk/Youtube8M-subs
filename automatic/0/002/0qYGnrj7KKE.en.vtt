 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix It 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.050
 probably something like that 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.520
 autobiographical treatise from his 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.770

 or in the fireclaw or in the 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:49.189
 half-blood prince sneaky game in 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:52.300
 a movie scene becomes a good looking one 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:52.300
 and athletic corp 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:01.190
 Harry Potter's world is very suggestive 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.950
 of magical reality and real magic 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:09.260
 such as the authors 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:10.550
 protected so that I'm already fat 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.870
 nobody will notice that writing 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.750
 I do not know how the author with 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.340
 Last name means 140 enthralling minutes 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.830
 promise tension without the end 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:24.290
 quilitzsch wm premiere and the return 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:25.820
 by lord voldemort but Harry does not want 

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.320
 stay idle and call a secret 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.790
 troupe in the life on possible 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.800

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.420
 minions do not prepare a second 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.360
 So early on we have to get on the 

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:37.280
 preparing for the arrival of lord voldemort 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.380
 I drive for a long time you say you always have like that 

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.110
 I'm not afraid of his name 

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.280
 mispronounce is in front of a name 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.810
 makes even more afraid of the thing 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.910
 even because I'm not afraid 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.910
 lord voldemort
