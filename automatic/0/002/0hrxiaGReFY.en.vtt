eyeglasses halo three hints are going to
tell<00:00:02.340> you<00:00:02.460> how<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.639> make<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:03.000> floating<00:00:03.510> base

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:03.799 
tell you how to make a floating base

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:05.990 
tell you how to make a floating base
okay<00:00:04.799> so<00:00:04.859> what<00:00:05.220> you<00:00:05.310> want<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.549> do<00:00:05.670> is<00:00:05.790> go<00:00:05.940> to

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
forge do this on send trip because it's

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.600 
forge do this on send trip because it's
the<00:00:09.000> biggest<00:00:09.300> map<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.809> it<00:00:10.769> has<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:10.980> good<00:00:11.340> point

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
the biggest map and it has a good point

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.379 
the biggest map and it has a good point
um<00:00:12.540> area<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.349> do<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.620> on<00:00:13.880> what<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:15.000> want<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.210> do

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
is just like in the video on how to make

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.429 
is just like in the video on how to make
a<00:00:19.050> bomb<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:20.250> do<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.910> same<00:00:21.119> thing<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.570> get<00:00:21.810> on

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
a bomb and do the same thing you get on

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.810 
a bomb and do the same thing you get on
my<00:00:22.500> radio<00:00:22.830> antenna<00:00:23.420> put<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.600> nod<00:00:25.490> on<00:00:26.490> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
my radio antenna put on nod on the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:35.060 
my radio antenna put on nod on the
receiver<00:00:27.240> not<00:00:27.420> on<00:00:27.599> on<00:00:27.960> top<00:00:31.070> okay<00:00:33.710> and<00:00:34.710> see<00:00:34.950> it's

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
receiver not on on top okay and see it's

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.850 
receiver not on on top okay and see it's
just<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.640> um<00:00:35.880> that's<00:00:36.649> just<00:00:37.649> her

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
just like this um that's just her

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.250 
just like this um that's just her
there's<00:00:38.790> your<00:00:39.000> cell<00:00:39.270> keep<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:40.250> keep<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.430> there

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.380 

you<00:00:46.260> place<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> cord<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.399> top<00:00:49.610> and<00:00:50.610> then<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.940> of

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
you place a cord on top and then you of

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.680 
you place a cord on top and then you of
course<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.660> leave<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.230> antenna<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.489> is

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
course to leave the antenna so now it is

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.069 
course to leave the antenna so now it is
floating<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.260> air<00:00:55.879> then<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.059> can<00:00:57.329> even

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
floating in the air then you can even

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.989 
floating in the air then you can even
see<00:00:58.260> that

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:00.999 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:05.139 

that<00:01:01.999> is<00:01:02.179> them<00:01:03.079> staffer<00:01:03.679> unless<00:01:04.580> you<00:01:04.820> meet<00:01:05.030> up

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
that is them staffer unless you meet up

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.280 
that is them staffer unless you meet up
with<00:01:05.269> lockers<00:01:07.149> they<00:01:08.149> want<00:01:08.420> to<00:01:08.540> do<00:01:08.689> is<00:01:08.840> get<00:01:09.110> like

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
with lockers they want to do is get like

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.330 
with lockers they want to do is get like
a<00:01:09.320> active<00:01:10.100> cook<00:01:10.399> at<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:11.360> funeral<00:01:11.950> put<00:01:12.950> it<00:01:13.070> down

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
a active cook at the funeral put it down

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.800 
a active cook at the funeral put it down
10<00:01:14.330> seconds<00:01:15.049> and<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:17.450> runtime<00:01:17.990> 21<00:01:19.149> and<00:01:20.149> then

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
10 seconds and the runtime 21 and then

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.690 
10 seconds and the runtime 21 and then
you<00:01:20.960> want<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:21.229> put<00:01:21.470> like<00:01:21.740> a<00:01:21.770> sniper<00:01:22.100> rifle<00:01:22.310> or

whatever there and put it for 10 seconds
also<00:01:26.649> right<00:01:27.649> there<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.549> then<00:01:28.700> there<00:01:28.939> you<00:01:29.060> go

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
also right there and then there you go

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.620 
also right there and then there you go
you<00:01:30.320> are<00:01:30.560> like<00:01:31.130> invisible<00:01:31.729> basically

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
you are like invisible basically

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.250 
you are like invisible basically
invisible

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.250 

because<00:01:37.830> every<00:01:38.580> time<00:01:38.610> they<00:01:39.000> assure<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.750> shows

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
because every time they assure the shows

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.230 
because every time they assure the shows
you<00:01:40.470> then<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.310> disappeared<00:01:41.850> because<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
you then you disappeared because the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.570

active<00:01:42.570> camera<00:01:43.160> constantly<00:01:44.160> cooking<00:01:44.340> yet

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
active camera constantly cooking yet

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:54.120 
active camera constantly cooking yet
pick<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.000> up

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.440 

um

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.069 

well<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.170> pretty<00:01:58.530> good<00:01:58.680> like<00:01:59.630> see<00:02:00.630> how<00:02:00.659> it

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
well this is pretty good like see how it

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:10.050 
well this is pretty good like see how it
I<00:02:01.229> wish<00:02:01.530> let's<00:02:01.979> pick<00:02:02.369> up<00:02:02.520> an<00:02:02.670> active<00:02:02.969> panel

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.760 

it<00:02:11.060> doesn't<00:02:11.450> have<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.569> channel<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.290> decrement

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
it doesn't have to channel the decrement

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:31.530 
it doesn't have to channel the decrement
panel

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.190 

and<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:33.480> child<00:02:34.480> today<00:02:35.519> before<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.879> base<00:02:37.200> to

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
and a child today before the base to

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.420 
and a child today before the base to
forge<00:02:38.530> so<00:02:39.069> please<00:02:39.640> rate<00:02:39.879> comment<00:02:40.180> subscribe
