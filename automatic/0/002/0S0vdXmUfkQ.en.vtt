00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.080
 despite the bad weather 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.150
 the cold weather and the freezing water there they are in search of the perfect wave 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:14.419

 how is that osmar gonçalves was the first brazilian surfer at the beginning 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:26.099
 of the 1930's phone obama magazine when I saw a report on how 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.199
 make a board then the challenge he and two friends decided to make the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.610
 first Brazilian board the wooden longboard 'that weighed 40 kilos of there 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.440
 here a lot has changed to 70 years have passed is technology has evolved a lot 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.100
 now in 2007 we can for example see valdemir perera belt catching wave 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.580
 the visually impaired the first of the country that was able to develop a board 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:59.360
 exclusive the only one that exists in the world that weighs only seven kilos at 24 years 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.339
 missing in robot known as raul by friends 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.469
 vision as a result of a rare syndrome over 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:07.410
 worse root 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.470
 he had never climbed up on a backboard before 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.290
 out of reading 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.250
 a lot ought 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.250
 Socrates players platoon 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.150
 Jose de Alencar 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.120
 everything you can imagine jorge hage 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.730
 March a cree rap gospel and I with peter pan in operation in its practice 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.310
 when I listened 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.400
 a cisco interview on a radio 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.430
 where he said he had worked with 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.550
 who would like to work with the disabled as well. 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.570
 visual 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.159
 there I saw my opportunity among the physical persons of the public school of 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.020
 Santos was a challenge 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.830
 gradually the difficulties of anyone in this third cisco decided then 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.630
 make a special fringe the first in the world to be adapted for a handicapped 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.730
 visual 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.750
 result of three years of work 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.680
 the first thing she has material 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.160
 luck the material should air 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.109
 involving and borja maciel 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.759
 is a thriving tide because some visually impaired 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:14.929
 perception 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:17.319
 from the dark with a little more light 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.599
 It's not his case but it was made for other people too. 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.930
 and has some high-relief adaptations, then, as well as 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.519
 perception through tact 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.799
 and also additive tapirs or start from the main point which was the center of 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:35.149
 reference to vertical position and it is through the feet always gravity 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:38.989
 balance it fits right foot here on the patient earth here to feel 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.319
 who is in holy faith is arrested has a better balance after we have 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.389
 a velcro connection too 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.229
 it is a relationship that the date 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:48.969
 through tad to the height of the person 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.400
 and you have to lie down to establish a balanced weight balance of the 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:54.099
 mkm brake so good 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.769
 so I'm just going to find a goal 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.709
 changes according to the height of the person né 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.899
 Another important point is the auditory perception when he was the one who had the 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:04.499
 board 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:08.869
 we have two of them on the tip at the ends on the bike at the tail 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:13.219
 and thus does not facilitate orientation and perception of harvests at slaughter 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:17.569
 marmorini cordial but the barueri came alive the main thing that we are the 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.669
 who finds insurance back on another date are so interesting she 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.589
 the daughter who is a material that comes 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:27.439
 it usually hurts too hard from Latvia also done in iva nine 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.229
 material plus a daughter 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:32.989
 and you realize that it works very well and served very well because the people 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.329
 I wanted 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.180
 in the Baltic Sea according to the author of the assault and the movement of the waves 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.209
 and still has procedures to be part of this list 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:46.539
 I'm one of the cases passing here on this avenue here. 

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:50.469
 it is perfectly possible to listen there in the 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:55.339
 There are a lot of things here that favor me that favor my good 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:58.529
 views are the dedication of teacher cisco has been 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:01.760
 fundamental for the growth and improvement of the stage 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.519
 and he acknowledges I will learn constantly 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:10.289
 Uncle constantly researching whether or not to escape challenges 

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:13.399
 It was something that cissokho did because that 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:17.219
 of the class for whom the collection was a challenge 

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:22.460
 he accepted so much he accepted that later he went to tell me that he 

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:25.459
 took a board and the water bed inside the eyes 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.450
 know how it was stopped on the internet 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.920
 he picks up foul and in this and that he is also surfer the son the example of 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.720
 courage and overcoming she says she called home hit him he reached the age of 24 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.900
 So 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.699
 he saw the world and saw the thing he saw everything and then he suddenly move to 20 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:46.499
 thousand 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:51.299
 without a vision of limeira then the adaptation of it until it was not so 

00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:56.339
 very difficult not he faces the different life and that was the fight and then 

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:59.339
 that he lost his sight I know he started surfing 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.680
 and he is a person people have in mind today when feeling fulfilled 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.930
 kpc twitter and probes 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.650
 because I know he has returned the most precious of human sensations 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:13.759
 freedom 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.400
 why in most sports for the blind 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.180
 I always depend on someone 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.389
 one thing is making them different constancy 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:25.909
 I get my board 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:27.419
 in all in all water 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:32.620
 I've decided not to depend on anything or anyone, but I still want more. 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.089
 we arrive there 

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:36.169
 and you know that the most important 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.349
 is an example that will deal with future generations 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:41.770
 children 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.960
 the 10 12 years coitus are growing with another image in the head 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.480
 was the leader of that image of her brain so I ran well from the white line 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:52.939
 walking around 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:56.400
 they should imply a collection with a low forehead of the arm 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.770
 going surfing 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.970
 I then are growing up with a more open minded it means 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.449
 what if in the future 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:07.610
 fone teachers entrepreneurs the scenes and liberals I believe that I will not have 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.139
 both prejudice the units councilor 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:13.139
 here in mozambique 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.229
 many times I come 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:22.839
 image on wheel head wheel wheel wheel coming 

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:25.729
 I imagine a wave in my mind. 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:26.550
 with maicon and elano
