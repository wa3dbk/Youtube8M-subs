 I want to trade with you! 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.480
 Okay, what do you want? 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.620
 A dead body. 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.600
 I said a few TNT. :D 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.900

 There's some land. :D 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.820
 What are you doing?! I asked for diamonds, not earth !!! 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.220
 But the earth and the deadblade are the best items of Minecraft. 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.060
 No, they're not! 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.660
 Now I have my diamond, or I will make you regret!

 The land is better than them, but I want to know how to dig it. 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.760
 The last time I did the mining with shovel wood did not work. 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.660
 It can work with strange new substance.
