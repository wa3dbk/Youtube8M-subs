played<00:03:17.930> really<00:03:18.500> really<00:03:19.070> slowly<00:03:19.340> so<00:03:19.730> you<00:03:20.270> can

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
played really really slowly so you can

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.590 
played really really slowly so you can
pretty<00:03:20.930> much<00:03:21.020> follow<00:03:22.010> on<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.670> keyboard<00:03:23.150> or

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
pretty much follow on the keyboard or

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.650 
pretty much follow on the keyboard or
whatever<00:03:24.050> you<00:03:24.260> play<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:25.330> yeah<00:03:26.330> and<00:03:26.450> then<00:03:26.540> I'll

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
whatever you play and yeah and then I'll

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.050 
whatever you play and yeah and then I'll
get<00:03:26.840> faster<00:03:27.320> and<00:03:27.380> faster<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:28.010> you'll<00:03:28.730> also

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
get faster and faster and you'll also

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.760 
get faster and faster and you'll also
get<00:03:29.300> faster<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:29.840> faster<00:03:29.900> that's<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.560> thing

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
get faster and faster that's the thing

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:54.640 
get faster and faster that's the thing
that<00:03:31.250> works<00:03:31.460> all<00:03:32.450> right<00:03:32.600> so<00:03:32.840> let's<00:03:33.080> start

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:44.710 

you

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.180 

so<00:04:45.720> as<00:04:45.840> you<00:04:45.960> can<00:04:46.080> see<00:04:46.139> it<00:04:46.530> gets<00:04:46.740> even<00:04:47.010> more

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
so as you can see it gets even more

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.219 
so as you can see it gets even more
difficult<00:04:47.669> if<00:04:47.910> we<00:04:47.970> play<00:04:48.210> it<00:04:48.240> slowly<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:49.080> if

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
difficult if we play it slowly and if

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.490 
difficult if we play it slowly and if
you<00:04:49.320> play<00:04:49.500> it<00:04:49.560> fast<00:04:49.910> so<00:04:50.910> do<00:04:51.840> whatever<00:04:51.990> you<00:04:52.229> can

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
you play it fast so do whatever you can

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.680 
you play it fast so do whatever you can
do<00:04:52.740> better<00:04:52.949> and<00:04:53.699> you<00:04:53.760> can<00:04:54.000> even<00:04:54.180> stop<00:04:54.510> the

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
do better and you can even stop the

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.600 
do better and you can even stop the
video<00:04:54.930> and<00:04:55.199> see<00:04:55.380> exactly<00:04:55.740> which<00:04:56.100> notes<00:04:56.400> I'm

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
video and see exactly which notes I'm

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.920 
video and see exactly which notes I'm
playing<00:04:56.880> on<00:04:57.090> which<00:04:57.810> end<00:04:58.280> simultaneously<00:04:59.280> and

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
playing on which end simultaneously and

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.770 
playing on which end simultaneously and
yeah<00:05:00.930> so<00:05:01.350> let's<00:05:01.560> get<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:01.919> next<00:05:02.070> part

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
yeah so let's get to the next part

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.420 
yeah so let's get to the next part
alright<00:05:03.780> so<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:04.470> second<00:05:04.919> part<00:05:05.040> of<00:05:05.160> the<00:05:05.280> course

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
alright so the second part of the course

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:29.909 
alright so the second part of the course
sounds<00:05:05.880> like<00:05:06.030> this

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.179 

all<00:05:30.610> right<00:05:31.259> so<00:05:32.259> it's<00:05:32.499> like<00:05:32.680> back<00:05:32.919> and<00:05:33.099> forth

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:33.189 
all right so it's like back and forth

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:35.610 
all right so it's like back and forth
with<00:05:33.729> let's<00:05:33.939> see<00:05:34.150> in<00:05:34.300> between<00:05:34.629> like<00:05:35.319> I<00:05:35.349> learned

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
with let's see in between like I learned

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.159 
with let's see in between like I learned
in<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:35.860> last<00:05:36.069> part<00:05:36.509> so<00:05:37.509> they<00:05:37.659> said<00:05:37.870> that<00:05:37.900> is

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
in the last part so they said that is

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.739 
in the last part so they said that is
basically<00:05:38.469> I<00:05:38.590> put<00:05:38.889> it<00:05:39.009> together<00:05:39.129> so<00:05:39.879> let's

00:05:40.739 --> 00:05:40.749 
basically I put it together so let's

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:43.200 
basically I put it together so let's
hear<00:05:40.840> that<00:05:40.960> once<00:05:41.289> more<00:05:41.590> maybe<00:05:42.310> a<00:05:42.430> little<00:05:42.819> bit

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
hear that once more maybe a little bit

00:05:43.210 --> 00:06:25.750 
hear that once more maybe a little bit
faster<00:05:43.990> and<00:05:44.289> the<00:05:44.620> whole<00:05:44.770> course

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.279 

ah

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:45.219 

you

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:45.229 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:47.359 

yeah<00:06:46.229> so<00:06:46.529> as<00:06:46.649> you<00:06:46.769> can<00:06:46.919> see<00:06:47.129> it's<00:06:47.279> very

00:06:47.359 --> 00:06:47.369 
yeah so as you can see it's very

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:48.769 
yeah so as you can see it's very
difficult<00:06:47.849> for<00:06:47.999> me<00:06:48.119> to<00:06:48.239> play<00:06:48.419> it<00:06:48.539> really

00:06:48.769 --> 00:06:48.779 
difficult for me to play it really

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:51.109 
difficult for me to play it really
slowly<00:06:49.199> because<00:06:50.039> you<00:06:50.129> got<00:06:50.279> a<00:06:50.309> really<00:06:50.819> fast

00:06:51.109 --> 00:06:51.119 
slowly because you got a really fast

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:54.139 
slowly because you got a really fast
already<00:06:51.979> but<00:06:52.979> yeah<00:06:53.159> you<00:06:53.219> just<00:06:53.429> practice<00:06:53.939> that

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:54.149 
already but yeah you just practice that

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:56.469 
already but yeah you just practice that
over<00:06:54.419> and<00:06:55.229> over<00:06:55.319> and<00:06:55.649> over<00:06:55.799> and<00:06:56.099> over<00:06:56.189> again

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 
over and over and over and over again

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:58.639 
over and over and over and over again
until<00:06:57.479> you<00:06:57.539> can<00:06:57.569> play<00:06:57.839> it<00:06:58.079> with<00:06:58.349> your<00:06:58.499> eyes

00:06:58.639 --> 00:06:58.649 
until you can play it with your eyes

00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:01.639 
until you can play it with your eyes
closed<00:06:59.069> and<00:06:59.479> if<00:07:00.479> you<00:07:00.599> did<00:07:00.779> that<00:07:00.809> then<00:07:01.349> you<00:07:01.469> can

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:01.649 
closed and if you did that then you can

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:04.039 
closed and if you did that then you can
go<00:07:01.769> to<00:07:01.829> the<00:07:01.979> next<00:07:02.159> port<00:07:02.489> in<00:07:02.809> which<00:07:03.809> I'm<00:07:03.959> going

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:04.049 
go to the next port in which I'm going

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:27.140 
go to the next port in which I'm going
to<00:07:04.110> teach<00:07:04.319> you<00:07:04.349> this

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.150 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.870 

so<00:07:28.150> yeah<00:07:28.300> that's<00:07:28.570> going<00:07:28.690> to<00:07:28.780> be<00:07:28.870> the<00:07:28.990> next<00:07:29.200> part

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:29.880 
so yeah that's going to be the next part

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.220 
so yeah that's going to be the next part
until<00:07:30.880> then<00:07:31.060> you<00:07:31.180> just<00:07:31.360> practice<00:07:31.810> this<00:07:31.960> part

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:32.230 
until then you just practice this part

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.400
