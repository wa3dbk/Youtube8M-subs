so<00:02:18.630> let's<00:02:18.780> jump<00:02:18.960> over<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.230> take<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.710> look<00:02:19.950> at<00:02:20.220> the

so let's jump over to take a look at the
foot<00:02:20.610> soldier<00:02:20.970> because<00:02:21.120> he's<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.450> new<00:02:21.600> guy

think the style translated perfectly to

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.280 
think the style translated perfectly to
the<00:02:27.060> half-shell<00:02:27.390> Heroes<00:02:27.690> line<00:02:27.870> cuz<00:02:28.050> he<00:02:28.110> looks

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
on to a katana sword it's non removable

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.500 
on to a katana sword it's non removable
just<00:02:44.160> like<00:02:44.280> all<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.760> other<00:02:44.880> weapons<00:02:45.090> in<00:02:45.420> this

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
just like all the other weapons in this

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.150 
just like all the other weapons in this
line<00:02:45.750> because<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.230> would<00:02:46.560> be<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.710> choking

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
line because that would be a choking

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.340 
line because that would be a choking
hazard<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.610> course<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.120> it's<00:02:48.510> also<00:02:48.840> rounded

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
hazard of course and it's also rounded

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.990 
hazard of course and it's also rounded
off<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:49.920> way<00:02:50.190> kids<00:02:50.490> won't<00:02:50.730> poke

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
off so that way kids won't poke

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.790 
off so that way kids won't poke
themselves<00:02:51.630> or<00:02:51.750> stab<00:02:51.960> themselves<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.650> might

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
themselves or stab themselves that might

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.450 
themselves or stab themselves that might
be<00:02:52.920> playing<00:02:53.190> along<00:02:53.490> with<00:02:53.520> it<00:02:53.820> so<00:02:55.460> the

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
be playing along with it so the

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.160 
be playing along with it so the
articulation<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.300> very<00:02:57.630> similar<00:02:57.870> on<00:02:57.990> these

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
articulation is very similar on these

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.210 
articulation is very similar on these
that<00:02:58.320> we've<00:02:58.470> seen<00:02:58.620> with<00:02:58.740> all<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.100> other

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
that we've seen with all the other

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.010 
that we've seen with all the other
figures<00:02:59.670> with<00:03:00.210> the<00:03:00.300> foot<00:03:00.480> soldier<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.900> head

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
figures with the foot soldier the head

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.750 
figures with the foot soldier the head
could<00:03:01.170> look<00:03:01.320> left<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.740> right<00:03:01.950> he's<00:03:02.490> got<00:03:02.640> the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
could look left and right he's got the

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.010 
could look left and right he's got the
hinge<00:03:02.940> joints<00:03:03.270> at<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.450> shoulders<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.990> arms

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
hinge joints at the shoulders the arms

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.420 
hinge joints at the shoulders the arms
can<00:03:04.260> go<00:03:04.350> outwards<00:03:04.740> forwards<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.220> backwards

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
can go outwards forwards and backwards

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.610 
can go outwards forwards and backwards
and<00:03:05.880> then<00:03:06.270> both<00:03:06.510> legs<00:03:06.540> just<00:03:07.080> move<00:03:07.230> forwards

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
and then both legs just move forwards

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.220 
and then both legs just move forwards
and<00:03:07.710> backwards<00:03:07.920> in<00:03:08.280> unison<00:03:08.990> shredder<00:03:09.990> is

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
and backwards in unison shredder is

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.050 
and backwards in unison shredder is
pretty<00:03:10.530> much<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.890> same<00:03:11.070> with<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.520> exception

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
pretty much the same with the exception

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.760 
pretty much the same with the exception
of<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.210> fact<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.720> head<00:03:12.960> is<00:03:13.170> attached<00:03:13.590> to

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
of the fact that the head is attached to

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.390 
of the fact that the head is attached to
the<00:03:13.890> cape

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
the cape

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.100 
the cape
so<00:03:14.760> that<00:03:14.880> greatly<00:03:15.330> hinders<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.780> movement

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
so that greatly hinders the movement

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.690 
so that greatly hinders the movement
with<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.230> head<00:03:16.410> you<00:03:16.560> can<00:03:16.680> only<00:03:16.800> barely<00:03:17.340> move

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
with the head you can only barely move

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.670 
with the head you can only barely move
that<00:03:17.850> left<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.270> right<00:03:18.450> but<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.350> does<00:03:19.530> get

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
that left and right but it does get

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.500 
that left and right but it does get
blocked<00:03:20.070> because<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.580> cape<00:03:20.790> hits<00:03:21.060> parts<00:03:21.420> of

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
blocked because the cape hits parts of

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.950 
blocked because the cape hits parts of
his<00:03:21.630> back<00:03:24.710> all<00:03:25.710> right<00:03:26.190> guys<00:03:26.400> it's<00:03:27.150> comparison

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
his back all right guys it's comparison

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.080 
his back all right guys it's comparison
time<00:03:28.170> here's<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.950> look<00:03:29.100> at<00:03:29.220> both<00:03:29.430> shredder<00:03:29.880> and

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
time here's a look at both shredder and

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.570 
time here's a look at both shredder and
the<00:03:30.450> foot<00:03:30.660> soldier<00:03:31.050> standing<00:03:31.740> alongside<00:03:32.100> the

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
the foot soldier standing alongside the

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.880 
the foot soldier standing alongside the
basic<00:03:33.090> figure<00:03:33.360> action<00:03:33.960> figure<00:03:34.230> counterparts

that<00:03:35.460> way<00:03:35.550> you<00:03:35.610> can<00:03:35.730> get<00:03:35.820> a<00:03:35.880> look<00:03:36.030> at<00:03:36.180> the

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
that way you can get a look at the

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.970 
that way you can get a look at the
difference<00:03:36.720> between<00:03:36.900> both<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.410> style<00:03:37.740> and

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
difference between both the style and

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:45.020 
difference between both the style and
the<00:03:38.370> scale<00:03:38.670> of<00:03:38.910> these<00:03:39.360> two<00:03:39.600> figures<00:03:43.910> so<00:03:44.910> there

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
the scale of these two figures so there

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.430 
the scale of these two figures so there
you<00:03:45.090> go<00:03:45.180> my<00:03:45.360> friends<00:03:45.690> there's<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.990> look<00:03:46.200> at

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
you go my friends there's a look at

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.380 
you go my friends there's a look at
shredder<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.430> foot<00:03:47.610> soldier<00:03:48.000> from<00:03:48.270> the

really<00:03:50.910> great<00:03:51.030> little<00:03:51.240> 2-pack<00:03:51.750> however<00:03:52.410> I

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
really great little 2-pack however I

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.590 
really great little 2-pack however I
will<00:03:52.770> say<00:03:52.800> that<00:03:53.220> since<00:03:53.580> shredder<00:03:53.880> also<00:03:54.210> comes

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
will say that since shredder also comes

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.660 
will say that since shredder also comes
packaged<00:03:55.050> with<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.320> shred<00:03:55.560> shred<00:03:55.740> I<00:03:56.010> kind<00:03:56.640> of

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
packaged with the shred shred I kind of

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.130 
packaged with the shred shred I kind of
would<00:03:56.820> have<00:03:56.850> liked<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.060> see<00:03:57.300> this<00:03:57.420> be<00:03:57.600> just<00:03:57.870> two

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
would have liked to see this be just two

would have liked to see this be just two
foot<00:03:58.350> soldiers<00:03:58.740> in<00:03:58.770> a<00:03:58.890> pack<00:03:59.100> together<00:03:59.400> those

understand<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.690> decision<00:04:10.050> of<00:04:10.140> putting

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
understand the decision of putting

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.290 
understand the decision of putting
shredder<00:04:10.680> with<00:04:10.860> them<00:04:11.010> because<00:04:11.190> not<00:04:11.760> everybody

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
shredder with them because not everybody

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.850 
shredder with them because not everybody
may<00:04:12.480> want<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.720> buy<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:13.020> vehicle<00:04:13.440> but<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.680> lot

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
may want to buy that vehicle but a lot

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.230 
may want to buy that vehicle but a lot
of<00:04:13.980> people<00:04:14.160> will<00:04:14.460> probably<00:04:14.700> want<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.060> have<00:04:15.180> a

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
of people will probably want to have a

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.060 
of people will probably want to have a
shredder<00:04:15.510> so<00:04:16.200> if<00:04:16.290> you<00:04:16.410> want<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.590> army<00:04:16.890> build

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
shredder so if you want to army build

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.440 
shredder so if you want to army build
this<00:04:17.220> you'll<00:04:17.549> just<00:04:17.730> end<00:04:18.030> up<00:04:18.120> with<00:04:18.180> a<00:04:18.330> whole

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
this you'll just end up with a whole

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.700 
this you'll just end up with a whole
bunch<00:04:18.570> of<00:04:18.720> shredders<00:04:19.020> to<00:04:19.170> go<00:04:19.260> along<00:04:19.530> with<00:04:19.680> all

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:19.710 
bunch of shredders to go along with all

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.500 
bunch of shredders to go along with all
the<00:04:19.950> foot<00:04:20.160> soldiers<00:04:20.549> but<00:04:21.060> there<00:04:21.210> are<00:04:21.299> very

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
the foot soldiers but there are very

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.210 
the foot soldiers but there are very
nice-looking<00:04:21.750> figures<00:04:22.380> both<00:04:22.770> characters

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
nice-looking figures both characters

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.130 
nice-looking figures both characters
translate<00:04:23.730> really<00:04:24.120> well<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.600> this<00:04:24.720> half<00:04:24.930> shell

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
translate really well to this half shell

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.500 
translate really well to this half shell
hero<00:04:25.350> style<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:26.190> we<00:04:26.669> can<00:04:26.850> really<00:04:27.210> kind<00:04:27.450> of

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
hero style and we can really kind of

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.659 
hero style and we can really kind of
create<00:04:27.870> these<00:04:28.020> two<00:04:28.320> different<00:04:29.100> factions<00:04:29.550> of

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
create these two different factions of

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:30.279 
create these two different factions of
the<00:04:29.730> bad<00:04:29.970> guy

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289

line will continue and we'll get even

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.100 
line will continue and we'll get even
more<00:04:38.029> characters<00:04:38.479> to<00:04:38.599> add<00:04:38.749> to<00:04:38.839> the<00:04:38.930> line
