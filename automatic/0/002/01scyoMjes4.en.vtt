00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:20.509
 The house 24 in the district of Salzburg 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:25.070
 leopoldskron a modern villa in 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:27.590
 bauhausstil family pickelhart lives here 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.840
 since 2010 she has the building 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.840
 completely remodeled from the 70s 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.039
 That was my parents house in the old house 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.350
 the band were also the rooms 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.909
 not so small but of course now 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.339
 much smaller and not by light 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:46.859
 flooded today and that was 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.290
 actually the main reason that you have one 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.519
 change and on top of that 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.320
 I just did not want to go back to mine 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.579
 nursery move in but just stop 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.710
 the family in their own space 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.089
 The entire building now has 330 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.670
 square meters of living space 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.670
 the ground floor alone 140 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.060
 an open steel staircase leads into the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.060
 first floor 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.340
 this shot did not exist before 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.619
 The builder has completely removed the roof 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.860
 leave and the walls with glass upwards 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.860
 relocated 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.810
 For us, the whole decision was that 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.070
 become 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.200
 get high spaces and that is also 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:43.289
 now the room with the highest heights 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:46.179
 just 55 and that's just one 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.159
 dull mood like today you have that 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.640
 Feeling that you are with nature outside 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.640
 lives 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.760
 On the first floor were a bath and 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.280
 a bedroom accommodated 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.680
 for a generous living has the 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.690
 family renounces doors and so on 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.050
 flowing transitions between the rooms 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.050
 created 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.290
 this is actually our sanctuary 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.290
 rest for reading 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.700
 summer co go out on the terrace like that 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:23.110
 that is there more or less children free 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:25.900
 area everything plays out anyway 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.099
 downstairs on the ground floor from oskar pink and 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.810
 max have enough space to play here 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.810
 all pictures here are from the children 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.860
 that's the area where, so to speak 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:42.000
 It has changed the most 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.470
 here the partition was taken away to 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.900
 dining room 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.799
 This gives you a big room 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.200
 living room dining room 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.200
 the kitchen is also new at the place 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.600
 In 1976, the parents of Michael Pickel 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.150
 bought the house 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.580
 It was a typical 70s bungalow 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.350
 the michael and barbara after pickel hard 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.709
 rebuilt to your own ideas 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.709
 to have 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:28.959
 it is not true we are actually 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:31.519
 not such a seaquake very well here 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.010
 the favorite place of the family is the 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.690
 large terrace of the wooden floor undresses 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.090
 from the living room to the outside 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.090
 everything looks like a big room 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.460
 In the summer, everything is on the 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.290
 Terrace off the guests come already 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:04:00.610
 at the main entrance purely but directly 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:04:01.330
 We live on the terrace and in the garden 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.430
 in the countryside 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.780
 in salzburg, the family got pimple hard 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.780
 realized this dream
