00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.359
 hello again welcome to dreams 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.920
 lern.de or this one 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:27.300
 reaction and indeed the first basis 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.429
 Lock call first base skirt profession 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.149
 That's why I call the base called the profession 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.570
 because they really are actually based on 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.379
 determines three-quarters of all modern ones 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.280
 need and make pop pieces and they 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.399
 you actually put the situation too 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.579
 exactly such an approximate number of 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.860
 basic in the base 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.449
 naturally accompany missing missing 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.219
 sled big still gets off or 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.510
 any between beats maybe 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.090
 sometimes a rhythmic change 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.909
 films are all still future topics 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:13.080
 but the basis profession itself are the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.750
 few that I introduce to you 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.150
 or with the parkways there are of course 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.610
 a few more but as I said in 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.350
 the modern north pop music is the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.890
 actually it is very much with five pieces 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:31.130
 I have noted the number to match the number 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.689
 reaction 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.229
 the first two are relative 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.290
 come after that come three more 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.079
 more and of these a total of five 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.060
 i want you 3 in this video 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.689
 imagine 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.390
 then I start also equal and indeed 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:54.659
 with the exercise 1 on the pdf 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.509
 Base call number one is actually 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.390
 the easiest of all I tell you 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.260
 would like to show 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.290
 and indeed it only exists 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:10.209
 Quarter notes and how are actually 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:12.100
 so played that right here 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.600
 So hand gets now of course 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.040
 right -handed is left - handed 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.330
 probably have to stand differently 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.250
 with the right hand playing here on the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:24.820
 row and that every funding area and 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.900
 suitable inverter and more 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.510
 that means consecutive four minutes 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:36.160
 up here in the row and matching 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:39.150
 on at 13 once the bassdrum and on 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:44.830
 the beats 2.4 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:47.980
 so that's with the backbeat of the pulse in the 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.150
 Quarter on the hype and do the whole 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.790
 I you now just before 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.790
 in 90 and 120 minutes 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:44.140
 okay that was base number one now 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:47.040
 Let's get to base number three that is 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:51.370
 so logically on the pdf 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.930
 Exercises 3 here changes 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.500
 not much 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.700
 in contrast to exercise 1 there is 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.560
 actually the essential difference 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.390
 is that we get on up here 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.370
 Eighth game thought through all the time and also 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.890
 back to the one and three in the 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.220
 bass drum and beat 2 and 4 so the 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:17.160
 backbeat disney 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.160
 I'm doing 90 120 minutes ago 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:05:00.720
 So we come to the last video exercise 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:03.360
 that is based on exercise 14 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.980
 callback number 4 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.650
 Here is also an essential 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.470
 This time around, the difference has changed 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.530
 bassdrum changed and that we play 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.250
 continue as in the previous exercise 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:22.690
 continuous eighth as a pulse on the 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:30.040
 play home this time on beat 1 once 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:34.830
 the world on wii 2 on beat 3 and on 3 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:39.310
 and the bassdrum and then on 4 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:45.010
 Again, there is more and that is how it is 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:50.170
 again with 1 better like 23 and 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.830
 3 point the bass drum and how much again 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.890
 nothing more 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:57.400
 she just pretends that is always 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:06:00.150
 Much easier again has 90 120 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.150
 mio 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:37.310
 that's it, that's it 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:39.250
 again at the video and thus at the end 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.740
 this lesson 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.560
 grab the other two 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:49.789
 So ps's exercises recorded the base 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:53.630
 two and five and work that 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:56.770
 Just look it yourself and I would 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:59.500
 say once again much fun while practicing 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:02.620
 and see you resist fears 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.620
 See you
