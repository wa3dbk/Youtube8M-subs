00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.839
 hello everyone with you lech 4w 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.340
 and today we'll talk about the tank 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.279
 amx 50100 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.130
 why exactly did I choose this tank 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.099
 decided to make such a small introductory 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.320
 rating of tanks of level 8 why exactly 8 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.510
 because for many it is considered 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.079
 benchmark is level 10 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.800
 but do not forget that def on tenths 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.770
 levels there 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.730
 imba tanks are not imba tanks but on 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.160
 eighth level 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.860
 also there is a bit but imbovye 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.079
 level eight now in this game 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.670
 the most balanced so to speak 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.989
 the only negative thing is that 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.600
 very often cast aside the tenth level but 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:58.710
 cars of the eighth level in their level 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.620
 battles to where they are thrown ie 8 9 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.860
 10 of course, yes, he feels well 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.990
 as the eighth levels of course in the top 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.630
 they feel themselves magnificently in the ninth 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.590
 levels a little bit worse but at level 9 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.540
 don't forget about three 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.820
 Nines for example and the rest 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.369
 eight that is, the principle is also the same 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.500
 and on tens already it is obvious at tanks 8 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.250
 level there are some problems but 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.229
 it all depends on the playerâ€™s skill 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.280
 such players who are on the eighth level 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.990
 do much more than the same 10 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.450
 levels in the same battle 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.829
 that is, it is all connected, of course, from 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.259
 skill and it turns out that there is any tank 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.030
 imba you in this game only of course 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.390
 need hands for him 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.130
 so back to the tank m x 50 100 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.939
 this machine is at its level 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.100
 Imba why she has a drum for 6 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.810
 shells 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.090
 1800 average damage in this 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.710
 the drum is located what does that mean it 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.640
 means that this machine can 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.220
 destroy any car of the eighth level 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.929
 that is, if we hit the top then with 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.240
 drum we can absolutely destroy 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.020
 Luke 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.800
 car but some here appear 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.580
 nuances 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.650
 Firstly it is a very cardboard mx machine 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.750
 50100 defense has almost no 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.970
 and unless there are any 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.410
 bounce and non-penetration then only by the will 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:32.370
 wbi and i.e. if everything flies into the target then 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.620
 you anyway punch everything 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.180
 very often it even happens that 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.520
 board to stern 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.340
 very often fulda mages fly that is 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.970
 from artillery this machine suffer so 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.030
 here it is the minuses of this car plus again 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.100
 it is a drum but in this plus there is 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.860
 called and minus we have recharge 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.900
 total drum takes forty six 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.520
 seconds is a 100 percent type 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.170
 this ventilation is of course all on 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.830
 mixing and accuracy because the same 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.750
 this instrument is not a good time 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.670
 information and accuracy and if fully 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.130
 come down it's somewhere around three seconds 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.350
 we boil down to come down completely 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:19.030
 shells fly in principle at the crosshairs 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:23.110
 but here again there is the following 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.390
 problem we shot out the drum 1800 ba 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.380
 speaking there plus minus one projectile 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.960
 flew missed one shell hit 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.120
 somewhere in the armor where it is not struck here 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.850
 the question is, what did you shoot? 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.960
 six shells and 46 seconds you drive 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:44.170
 just on the map that is what it does 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.320
 This tanks precisely vulnerable before tanks 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.840
 see if your opponent is leaving 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.240
 the same there are one and a half thousand 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.930
 hit points then every shot needs 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.270
 aiming 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.520
 every shot you shoot yes no 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.320
 I deny you can catch one houses 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.840
 be even 2 everything will depend on 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.790
 what enemy are you driving out here 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.490
 in battle as you see a good example i 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.590
 went to the tank t-34 he shot me 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.840
 his long cooldown ie 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.550
 anyone this guy has already played like you 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.430
 see shoot aiming each 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.070
 shot and still get one 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.600
 projectile in the reserve this projectile remained in 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.950
 stock due to the fact that he has 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.020
 it was not complete hp and if he had 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.870
 a full one and a half thousand is not a fact that 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.300
 Alpha went through all the shots because 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.520
 now in the game world of tanks 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.050
 very often the last 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.350
 a shot from you and you with this shot 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.300
 shoot from wear there minimum 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.000
 the number of hit points will give the enemy and 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.760
 he has 12 10 hit points left 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.050
 there is something that principle 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.330
 alpha could have been taken away 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.970
 caved in alpha but nothing with it 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.150
 can you do that? so 46 seconds you drive 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.710
 absolutely helpless that is nothing you 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.380
 you can not make a lot of weight 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.360
 ram you and no one will be able to it 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.910
 hints so to speak your own 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.410
 gameplay meaning you go to one 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.130
 maximum two enemy tanks 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.280
 shoot it off 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.830
 and then immediately quickly take away the good 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.680
 the dynamics of this machine allows it 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.650
 do and you can quickly slip away 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.110
 but don't forget that they can 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.360
 also chase and need to choose here 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.800
 exactly the right goal so on 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.690
 eighth level I consider amx 50100 tank 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.290
 pretty imba machine he's nice 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.760
 can show itself and against 9 and against 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.520
 tenths of levels against tenths 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:44.160
 certainly not so good but 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:48.310
 armor penetration guns in 232 232 units 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:51.610
 allows pretty good whole thing 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:54.580
 realize that is you can in 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.040
 vulnerable points punch tanks level 10 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.500
 Of course the mouse so to say in the face you 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.600
 will not punch but thanks 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.030
 speakers you can go to the board to 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.100
 these enemy tanks up to level 10 and 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.350
 Of course they disassemble but here you 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:12.010
 need some support, of course 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:14.380
 because otherwise you will be dismantled 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:17.260
 you can not give a maximum 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:20.020
 home of the year then there are still 800 issued and all 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:22.600
 tanks of the tenth level are more than 1800 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.300
 there constantly for 2000 hit points 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:28.510
 tanks of the tenth level and of course a little 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.130
 less than two thousand in tanks with t chic 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.620
 that's why you need to act extremely 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:36.640
 neat and these cars are in charge just 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:40.150
 can bend as you can see the fight came 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.010
 the end of 6 frags 33,100 damage was valid 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.790
 quite aggressive was on aggressive 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:48.310
 flank and because opponents 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.350
 not flooded that is i had been 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.480
 some allies here who 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.430
 of course they took all the damage on 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.350
 tank 50 mx 50 100 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.300
 in no case can not take on 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:01.170
 take all the damage that is yes I understand 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.060
 if you have 1400 hit points there yes 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.770
 in front of you is a tank for a tank 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.450
 the enemy here you can go 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.880
 get houses of course only for 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:13.450
 to get this tank off the drum 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.250
 so the car say so little 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.780
 equivalent exchange because you 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:22.030
 get one at home 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:24.160
 and in return you give 6 plus 320 average 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.350
 alpha so imbo car 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.290
 and I plan to do a review after all 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:32.980
 tanks level 8 and decided to still start 

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:35.500
 from this machine mx 50100 on this our 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.030
 today's video brings to the end if
