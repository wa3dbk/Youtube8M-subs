but if you learn a 2d and Fiona and the
middle<00:04:03.540> ones<00:04:03.690> that<00:04:03.990> I<00:04:04.050> put<00:04:04.260> have<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:04.650> G<00:04:04.890> on<00:04:05.730> the

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
middle ones that I put have to G on the

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:13.400 
middle ones that I put have to G on the
3G<00:04:10.670> think<00:04:11.670> it's<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.060> big<00:04:12.330> if<00:04:12.630> it's<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.260> one

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
3G think it's the big if it's the one

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.520 
3G think it's the big if it's the one
that<00:04:13.590> says<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.920> big<00:04:14.160> a<00:04:14.310> gigabyte<00:04:15.530> absolute

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
that says the big a gigabyte absolute

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.620 
that says the big a gigabyte absolute
that<00:04:17.160> box<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:17.549> smaller<00:04:17.820> it<00:04:18.180> will<00:04:18.269> be<00:04:18.420> that's

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
that box is smaller it will be that's

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:29.960 
that box is smaller it will be that's
the<00:04:18.810> VGA<00:04:19.140> gateway<00:04:23.480> that's<00:04:24.480> not<00:04:24.960> me<00:04:26.660> and<00:04:28.790> in<00:04:29.790> a

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
the VGA gateway that's not me and in a

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.640 
the VGA gateway that's not me and in a
future<00:04:30.180> video<00:04:30.360> maybe<00:04:30.750> on<00:04:31.050> they<00:04:31.200> tell<00:04:31.560> the

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.430 

if<00:05:13.300> you<00:05:13.419> want<00:05:13.599> though<00:05:13.750> if<00:05:13.900> you<00:05:13.990> want<00:05:14.110> that<00:05:14.289> app

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
it's called sleep effects except sleep

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.680 
it's called sleep effects except sleep
affects<00:05:17.280> 1.1.1<00:05:18.310> the<00:05:18.940> real<00:05:19.090> one<00:05:19.240> doesn't<00:05:19.539> work

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
affects 1.1.1 the real one doesn't work

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.020 
affects 1.1.1 the real one doesn't work
I<00:05:19.930> don't<00:05:19.960> know<00:05:20.199> why<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:21.430> asserts<00:05:21.759> the<00:05:21.879> same

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
I don't know why the asserts the same

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.050 
I don't know why the asserts the same
thing<00:05:22.240> about<00:05:22.389> 1.0<00:05:23.110> it<00:05:23.620> works<00:05:23.800> fine<00:05:24.099> the<00:05:24.460> new

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
thing about 1.0 it works fine the new

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.080 
thing about 1.0 it works fine the new
stuff<00:05:25.300> and<00:05:25.650> see<00:05:26.650> the<00:05:26.740> effects<00:05:26.919> 1.1<00:05:27.789> is<00:05:27.940> this

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
stuff and see the effects 1.1 is this

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.980 
stuff and see the effects 1.1 is this
basically<00:05:28.509> you<00:05:28.860> seen<00:05:29.860> that<00:05:30.449> think<00:05:31.449> it<00:05:31.569> sleeps

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
basically you seen that think it sleeps

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.379 
basically you seen that think it sleeps
like<00:05:32.199> that<00:05:32.379> it<00:05:32.949> could<00:05:33.129> just<00:05:33.159> do<00:05:33.520> like<00:05:33.789> that

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
like that it could just do like that

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.059 
like that it could just do like that
over<00:05:34.720> the<00:05:34.870> same<00:05:35.020> thing<00:05:35.199> but<00:05:35.379> -<00:05:35.470> by<00:05:35.590> turning<00:05:35.949> on
