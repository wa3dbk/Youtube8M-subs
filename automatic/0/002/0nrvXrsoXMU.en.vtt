reverse your muscle building abilities
with<00:01:42.630> cortisol<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> main<00:01:44.189> reason

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
with cortisol but the main reason

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.600 
with cortisol but the main reason
cortisol<00:01:45.170> destroys<00:01:46.170> muscle<00:01:46.740> practically<00:01:47.250> is

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
cortisol destroys muscle practically is

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.060 
cortisol destroys muscle practically is
because<00:01:48.000> testosterone<00:01:48.780> cores<00:01:49.350> are<00:01:49.500> made<00:01:49.920> from

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
because testosterone cores are made from

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.760 
because testosterone cores are made from
the<00:01:50.159> same<00:01:50.340> place<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.720> we<00:01:51.869> can't<00:01:52.140> be<00:01:52.259> that

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
the same place and so we can't be that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.389 
the same place and so we can't be that
gland<00:01:53.399> can<00:01:54.090> be<00:01:54.210> producing<00:01:54.810> both<00:01:55.560> at<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.219> same

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
gland can be producing both at the same

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.370 
gland can be producing both at the same
rate<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.729> know<00:01:56.880> fight-or-flight<00:01:57.420> boom<00:01:58.110> that

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
rate you know fight-or-flight boom that

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.020 
rate you know fight-or-flight boom that
guy<00:01:58.500> went<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.770> Kors<00:01:58.950> all<00:01:59.100> out<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.700> can't<00:01:59.909> be

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
guy went to Kors all out you can't be

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.149 
guy went to Kors all out you can't be
producing<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.479> same<00:02:00.659> at<00:02:00.899> testosterone<00:02:01.530> so

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
producing the same at testosterone so

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.859 
producing the same at testosterone so
fight-or-flight<00:02:02.719> testosterone<00:02:03.719> is

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
fight-or-flight testosterone is

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.069 
fight-or-flight testosterone is
obviously<00:02:04.290> gonna<00:02:04.649> go<00:02:04.829> down<00:02:05.090> under<00:02:06.090> stress<00:02:06.450> and

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
obviously gonna go down under stress and

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.359 
obviously gonna go down under stress and
eventually<00:02:07.530> when<00:02:07.619> you're<00:02:07.710> not<00:02:07.860> stressed<00:02:08.129> it's

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
eventually when you're not stressed it's

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.859 
eventually when you're not stressed it's
gonna<00:02:08.520> come<00:02:08.670> back<00:02:08.819> even<00:02:09.179> out<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.599> if<00:02:09.750> you're

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
gonna come back even out and if you're

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.300 
gonna come back even out and if you're
doing<00:02:10.050> things<00:02:10.259> right<00:02:10.560> testosterone<00:02:10.890> levels

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
doing things right testosterone levels

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.920 
doing things right testosterone levels
gonna<00:02:11.459> go<00:02:11.550> up<00:02:11.670> higher<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.420> you're<00:02:12.540> stressing

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
gonna go up higher and you're stressing

gonna go up higher and you're stressing
me<00:02:13.050> down<00:02:13.230> so

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
me down so

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.990 
me down so
got<00:02:13.620> lots<00:02:13.770> of<00:02:13.950> lots<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.220> testosterone<00:02:14.340> which

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
got lots of lots of testosterone which

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.030 
got lots of lots of testosterone which
is<00:02:15.120> good<00:02:15.390> we<00:02:15.630> want<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.020> for<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.350> build<00:02:16.530> muscle

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
is good we want that for to build muscle

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.760 
is good we want that for to build muscle

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
that's why bodybuilders take

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.530 
that's why bodybuilders take
testosterone<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.670> shoot<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.060> stuff<00:02:21.240> into

testosterone and shoot the stuff into

testosterone and shoot the stuff into
