00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.789
 he will not cry 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.600
 how not 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.890
 Y 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.479
 this morning we left thanks to all the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.340
 manny pacquiao's team gives us the 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.750
 opportunity to run with him 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.850
 very much condition very much rise 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.310
 I do not know there is a parameter to run 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.210
 very well in fact we live like three 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.540
 miles up part of your life 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.890
 and apart from that contagion that joy does not 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.320
 you're running it's very happy going 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.990
 talking with all his people and has 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.430
 still time from up there to 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.369
 so take some pictures with the team and 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.750
 keep running this is to applaud 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.750
 all he does is manny pacquiao 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.509
 yes 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.650
 ah 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.520
 and more 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.650
 Sun 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.780
 occasionally 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.460
 I imagine the layer that was at the end 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.580
 of accounts as if he were as if 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.990
 we would have gotten up the ring do you have 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.790
 to imagine a certain transversal I 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.410
 always high rival in it possibly 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.410
 that is going to be the one that is going to be me 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.630
 so then if you're practically 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.550
 you are imagining that you are above the 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.280
 ring with your rival in the wait if he 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.120
 maybe be able to change and be able to use 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.120
 a lot of speed
