map<00:00:15.089> raid<00:00:15.360> as<00:00:15.570> i<00:00:15.630> said<00:00:16.109> using<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.560> vector<00:00:16.890> with

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
map raid as i said using the vector with

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.920 
map raid as i said using the vector with
the<00:00:17.250> silencer<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.940> fast<00:00:18.180> mac<00:00:18.390> combination

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
the silencer in the fast mac combination

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.510 
the silencer in the fast mac combination
which<00:00:19.289> there's<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.560> really<00:00:19.770> good<00:00:19.890> combination

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
which there's a really good combination

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.010 
which there's a really good combination
to<00:00:20.609> be<00:00:20.699> using<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.210> vector<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
to be using with the vector and the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.689 
to be using with the vector and the
vector<00:00:22.140> what<00:00:22.439> i<00:00:22.470> like<00:00:22.650> about<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:23.010> SMG<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.550> it

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
vector what i like about this SMG is it

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.429 
vector what i like about this SMG is it
has<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> really<00:00:24.210> high<00:00:24.300> fire<00:00:24.660> rate<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.320> has<00:00:25.410> a

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
has a really high fire rate but it has a

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.349 
has a really high fire rate but it has a
little<00:00:25.710> recoil<00:00:26.070> as<00:00:26.250> well<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:26.939> can<00:00:27.060> help<00:00:27.210> you

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
little recoil as well so it can help you

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.210 
little recoil as well so it can help you
mow<00:00:27.510> down<00:00:27.630> enemies<00:00:28.080> up<00:00:28.289> close<00:00:28.590> as<00:00:28.800> well<00:00:29.010> and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
mow down enemies up close as well and

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.710 
mow down enemies up close as well and
when<00:00:29.550> you're<00:00:29.640> using<00:00:29.849> suppressor<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.510> really

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
when you're using suppressor it really

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.120 
when you're using suppressor it really
doesn't<00:00:30.990> take<00:00:31.080> away<00:00:31.230> from<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.619> damage<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
doesn't take away from the damage in the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.610 
doesn't take away from the damage in the
range<00:00:32.340> when<00:00:32.969> i<00:00:33.120> see<00:00:33.360> from<00:00:33.840> medium<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.230> far

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
range when i see from medium to far

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.040 
range when i see from medium to far
distance<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.370> still<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.850> very<00:00:36.090> effective<00:00:36.660> it

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
distance is still a very effective it

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.900 
distance is still a very effective it
doesn't<00:00:37.380> get<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.559> ineffective<00:00:37.950> until<00:00:38.700> about

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
doesn't get it ineffective until about

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.790 
doesn't get it ineffective until about
that<00:00:39.149> crossmap<00:00:39.690> range<00:00:39.930> something<00:00:40.379> such<00:00:40.620> as<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
that crossmap range something such as a

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.380 
that crossmap range something such as a
map<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.160> drone<00:00:41.460> where<00:00:41.879> you're<00:00:42.000> shooting<00:00:42.090> from

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
map on drone where you're shooting from

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.060 
map on drone where you're shooting from
be<00:00:42.570> Tom<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.989> like<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> bushes<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.770> see<00:00:43.920> them

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
be Tom to like the bushes and see them

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.889 
be Tom to like the bushes and see them
on<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> map<00:00:44.430> drum<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.270> that's<00:00:45.450> why<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.629> really

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
on the map drum so that's why I really

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.420 
on the map drum so that's why I really
love<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.200> vector<00:00:46.469> k10<00:00:46.649> as<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.129> can<00:00:47.280> see<00:00:47.399> i

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
love the vector k10 as you can see i

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.520 
love the vector k10 as you can see i
mowed<00:00:47.700> down<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:48.059> enemy<00:00:48.360> very<00:00:48.840> easily<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.440> i

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
mowed down that enemy very easily and i

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.690 
mowed down that enemy very easily and i
think<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:49.829> weapon<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.430> become<00:00:50.550> a

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
think this weapon is going to become a

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.090 
think this weapon is going to become a
huge<00:00:51.000> factor<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.570> pro<00:00:51.930> player<00:00:52.230> /<00:00:52.800> players

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
huge factor and pro player / players

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.670 
huge factor and pro player / players
game<00:00:53.399> plays<00:00:53.610> especially<00:00:54.149> gamers<00:00:54.899> like<00:00:55.110> optic

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
game plays especially gamers like optic

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.990 
game plays especially gamers like optic
and<00:00:55.860> things<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.219> nature<00:00:56.340> because<00:00:56.969> i

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
and things of that nature because i

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.040 
and things of that nature because i
think<00:00:57.059> they're<00:00:57.300> going<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.449> catch<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
think they're going to catch on to the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.990 
think they're going to catch on to the
weapon<00:00:58.350> because<00:00:58.710> if<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.949> slows<00:00:59.160> recall<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
weapon because if it slows recall the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.150 
weapon because if it slows recall the
damage<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.170> fire<00:01:01.410> rate<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.800> things<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.129> that

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
damage the fire rate and things of that

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.979 
damage the fire rate and things of that
nature<00:01:02.280> especially<00:01:02.789> when<00:01:03.510> you're<00:01:03.629> playing<00:01:03.809> on

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989

guys in this commentary about is the new
best<00:01:25.140> SMG<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.950> black<00:01:26.369> ops<00:01:26.580> 2<00:01:26.820> now<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.299> SMG<00:01:28.080> of

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
best SMG and black ops 2 now the SMG of

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.870 
best SMG and black ops 2 now the SMG of
my<00:01:28.470> favorite<00:01:28.890> right<00:01:29.100> now<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.430> probably<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
my favorite right now is probably the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.969 
my favorite right now is probably the
vector<00:01:30.210> k10<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:31.049> weapon<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.500> really<00:01:31.829> good

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
vector k10 this weapon is really good

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.830 
vector k10 this weapon is really good
like<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.369> see<00:01:32.549> me<00:01:32.700> hebrew<00:01:33.270> fired<00:01:33.509> me<00:01:33.659> with<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
like you see me hebrew fired me with the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.630 
like you see me hebrew fired me with the
b23r<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.829> just<00:01:35.009> come<00:01:35.159> around<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.490> corner

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
b23r and I just come around the corner

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.399 
b23r and I just come around the corner
and<00:01:35.880> clean<00:01:36.090> them<00:01:36.210> up<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.540> easily<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.049> the

and clean them up so easily and the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.440 
and clean them up so easily and the
vector<00:01:37.680> k10<00:01:37.979> really<00:01:38.490> shines<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.939> those<00:01:39.090> small

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
vector k10 really shines and those small

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.910 
vector k10 really shines and those small
to<00:01:39.720> medium<00:01:40.020> distance<00:01:40.380> engagements

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
especially on a map like raid you can

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.109 
especially on a map like raid you can
use<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.500> weapon<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> map<00:01:44.430> such<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:44.820> slums

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
it on a small map where you can get in

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.420 
it on a small map where you can get in
the<00:01:49.140> enemy's<00:01:49.470> face<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.040> that's<00:01:50.250> what<00:01:50.399> I

swarm is going super ham right now but
yeah<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.119> vector<00:01:54.420> k10<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.259> new<00:01:55.470> best<00:01:55.680> SMG

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
in the description so you can check that

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.990 
in the description so you can check that
out<00:02:01.439> as<00:02:01.649> well<00:02:01.829> but<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.340> post<00:02:02.549> patch<00:02:02.759> they

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
out as well but in the post patch they

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.780 
out as well but in the post patch they
patched<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.450> PDW<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.380> MSMC<00:02:04.950> out<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
patched the PDW and the MSMC out of the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.240 
patched the PDW and the MSMC out of the
two<00:02:06.060> smgs<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.960> they<00:02:07.110> did<00:02:07.350> patch<00:02:07.560> they<00:02:08.039> really

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
two smgs that they did patch they really

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.100 
two smgs that they did patch they really
did<00:02:08.550> nerf<00:02:08.879> them<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.149> think<00:02:09.300> they<00:02:09.479> took<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.780> ton

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
did nerf them I think they took a ton

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.860 
did nerf them I think they took a ton
away<00:02:10.319> from<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.649> MSMC<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.459> PDW<00:02:12.060> especially

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
away from the MSMC in the PDW especially

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.610 
away from the MSMC in the PDW especially
from<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.170> pd

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
from the pd

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.530 
from the pd
be<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.860> recoil<00:02:14.250> nothing<00:02:14.700> just<00:02:14.970> go<00:02:15.120> straight

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
be the recoil nothing just go straight

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.360 
be the recoil nothing just go straight
up<00:02:15.659> and<00:02:15.810> down<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.379> it's<00:02:16.500> not<00:02:16.709> nearly<00:02:17.069> as<00:02:17.190> good

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
up and down and it's not nearly as good

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.890 
up and down and it's not nearly as good
as<00:02:17.519> it<00:02:17.640> used<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:17.909> be<00:02:18.060> where<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.599> could<00:02:18.750> get<00:02:18.870> on

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
as it used to be where you could get on

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.720 
as it used to be where you could get on
the<00:02:18.959> map<00:02:19.200> like<00:02:19.379> a<00:02:19.409> raid<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.890> go<00:02:20.010> absolutely

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
the map like a raid and go absolutely

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.520 
the map like a raid and go absolutely
work<00:02:21.030> with<00:02:21.269> it<00:02:21.420> but<00:02:21.599> now<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.780> can't<00:02:22.110> the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
work with it but now you can't the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.399 
work with it but now you can't the
vector<00:02:22.799> k10<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.610> new<00:02:23.790> best<00:02:24.030> SMG<00:02:24.390> as<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.810> ton

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
vector k10 is the new best SMG as a ton

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.320 
vector k10 is the new best SMG as a ton
of<00:02:25.440> features<00:02:25.620> on<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.010> like<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.340> 36<00:02:26.849> round<00:02:27.060> clip

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
of features on it like the 36 round clip

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.390 
of features on it like the 36 round clip
it's<00:02:27.780> not<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.170> best<00:02:28.379> but<00:02:28.470> it's<00:02:28.769> decent<00:02:29.250> and

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
it's not the best but it's decent and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.300 
it's not the best but it's decent and
it's<00:02:29.519> better<00:02:29.730> than<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.060> MSMC<00:02:30.629> the<00:02:31.319> MSMC<00:02:31.890> packs

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
it's better than the MSMC the MSMC packs

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.520 
it's better than the MSMC the MSMC packs
30<00:02:32.579> bullets<00:02:32.970> in<00:02:33.060> this<00:02:33.180> one<00:02:33.329> packs<00:02:33.510> 36<00:02:34.019> let<00:02:34.440> it

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
30 bullets in this one packs 36 let it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.110 
30 bullets in this one packs 36 let it
get<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.680> easily<00:02:35.159> a<00:02:35.190> killer<00:02:35.459> too<00:02:35.670> if<00:02:35.849> someone's

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
get you easily a killer too if someone's

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.240 
get you easily a killer too if someone's
AFK<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.989> probably<00:02:37.230> can<00:02:37.440> get<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.739> 23<00:02:38.010> kills

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
AFK you probably can get to 23 kills

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.850 
AFK you probably can get to 23 kills
with<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.209> clip<00:02:39.420> i<00:02:39.569> say<00:02:39.900> can<00:02:40.110> get<00:02:40.260> around<00:02:40.470> six

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
with the clip i say can get around six

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.890 
with the clip i say can get around six
to<00:02:41.010> seven<00:02:41.250> kills<00:02:41.489> I<00:02:41.700> average<00:02:42.209> around<00:02:42.420> seven<00:02:42.810> to

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
to seven kills I average around seven to

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.240 
to seven kills I average around seven to
eight<00:02:43.049> clips<00:02:43.319> because<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.769> have<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.069> really

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
eight clips because you have to really

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.920 
eight clips because you have to really
know<00:02:44.459> how<00:02:44.549> to<00:02:44.640> manage<00:02:44.790> your<00:02:44.970> ammo<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.720> right

here you see me in the spawn with the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.069 
here you see me in the spawn with the
vector<00:02:47.519> k10<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.299> like<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.569> said<00:02:48.629> it<00:02:48.870> mows<00:02:49.049> down

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
vector k10 and like I said it mows down

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.050 
vector k10 and like I said it mows down
enemies<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:49.890> guys<00:02:50.040> check<00:02:50.370> out<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.640> recoil

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
enemies and guys check out the recoil

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.420 
enemies and guys check out the recoil
low<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.720> moderate<00:02:52.290> recoil<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:53.069> weapon

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
low to moderate recoil this weapon

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.729 
low to moderate recoil this weapon
doesn't<00:02:53.579> have<00:02:53.790> any<00:02:54.000> recoil<00:02:54.569> in<00:02:54.810> my<00:02:54.989> opinion<00:02:55.319> it

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
doesn't have any recoil in my opinion it

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.349 
doesn't have any recoil in my opinion it
feels<00:02:55.950> like<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.250> ACR<00:02:56.700> for<00:02:56.879> modern<00:02:57.090> warfare<00:02:57.239> 3

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
feels like the ACR for modern warfare 3

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.089 
feels like the ACR for modern warfare 3
and<00:02:57.750> that's<00:02:57.870> why<00:02:58.049> I<00:02:58.079> really<00:02:58.409> love<00:02:58.590> using<00:02:58.829> this

and that's why I really love using this

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.220 
and that's why I really love using this

hardline for your second perk you want
to<00:03:11.730> run<00:03:11.849> toughness<00:03:12.299> that<00:03:12.329> way<00:03:12.569> you<00:03:12.629> really<00:03:12.989> can

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
to run toughness that way you really can

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.559 
to run toughness that way you really can
take<00:03:13.379> advantage<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:13.829> your<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:15.030> your<00:03:15.090> second

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
take advantage of your of your second

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.180 
take advantage of your of your second
park<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.959> get<00:03:16.109> toughness<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.680> way<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.040> can

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
park and get toughness that way you can

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.039 
park and get toughness that way you can
take<00:03:17.370> advantage<00:03:17.489> of<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.000> vector<00:03:18.389> k10<00:03:18.569> slow

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
take advantage of the vector k10 slow

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.720 
take advantage of the vector k10 slow
recoil<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.650> when<00:03:20.099> you're<00:03:20.220> getting<00:03:20.519> hit

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
recoil and when you're getting hit

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.390 
recoil and when you're getting hit
toughness<00:03:21.450> lets<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.900> not<00:03:22.380> flinch<00:03:22.709> as<00:03:22.829> much<00:03:23.040> so

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
toughness lets you not flinch as much so

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.979 
toughness lets you not flinch as much so
it's<00:03:23.549> going<00:03:23.639> to<00:03:23.700> be<00:03:23.790> basically<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.389> laser<00:03:24.720> beam

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
it's going to be basically a laser beam

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.780 
it's going to be basically a laser beam
from<00:03:25.169> up<00:03:25.440> close<00:03:25.500> especially<00:03:26.220> when<00:03:26.669> you're

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
from up close especially when you're

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.400 
from up close especially when you're
getting<00:03:26.910> hit<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.359> it's<00:03:27.720> already<00:03:28.079> a<00:03:28.139> laser

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
getting hit and it's already a laser

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.050 
getting hit and it's already a laser
beam<00:03:28.620> so<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:28.919> toughness<00:03:29.160> park<00:03:29.609> really<00:03:29.819> adds

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
beam so the toughness park really adds

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.729 
beam so the toughness park really adds
to<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.569> in<00:03:30.930> this<00:03:31.049> game<00:03:31.260> i<00:03:31.290> was<00:03:31.560> using

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
to it and in this game i was using

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.589 
to it and in this game i was using
scavenger<00:03:32.340> but<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:32.790> recommend<00:03:33.209> toughness

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
scavenger but I recommend toughness

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.300 
scavenger but I recommend toughness
because<00:03:33.930> like<00:03:34.109> I<00:03:34.200> said<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.590> really<00:03:34.889> helps<00:03:35.129> with

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
because like I said it really helps with

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.530 
because like I said it really helps with
that<00:03:35.370> recoil<00:03:35.760> especially<00:03:36.299> when<00:03:36.419> you're

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
that recoil especially when you're

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.909 
that recoil especially when you're
getting<00:03:36.660> hit<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.109> the<00:03:37.200> next<00:03:37.440> thing<00:03:37.650> if<00:03:37.829> you

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
getting hit and the next thing if you

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.530 
getting hit and the next thing if you
guys<00:03:38.069> do<00:03:38.340> want<00:03:38.519> to<00:03:38.609> run<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.760> secondary<00:03:39.269> I

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
guys do want to run a secondary I

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.509 
guys do want to run a secondary I
recommend<00:03:40.109> you<00:03:40.200> taking<00:03:40.440> off<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.799> EMP<00:03:41.220> grenade

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
recommend you taking off the EMP grenade

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:42.710 
recommend you taking off the EMP grenade
I<00:03:41.669> really<00:03:41.879> feel<00:03:42.060> that<00:03:42.090> tactical<00:03:42.629> grenades

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
I really feel that tactical grenades

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.960 
I really feel that tactical grenades
have<00:03:43.169> fell<00:03:43.440> in<00:03:43.650> black<00:03:43.829> ops<00:03:43.980> 2<00:03:44.099> they're<00:03:44.669> not<00:03:44.819> as

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
have fell in black ops 2 they're not as

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.089 
have fell in black ops 2 they're not as
useful<00:03:45.209> as<00:03:45.599> I<00:03:45.660> want<00:03:46.169> them<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.410> be<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.980> only

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
useful as I want them to be the only

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.710 
useful as I want them to be the only
time<00:03:47.310> they<00:03:47.459> come<00:03:47.639> useful<00:03:48.060> with<00:03:48.180> something<00:03:48.599> in

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
time they come useful with something in

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.439 
time they come useful with something in
like<00:03:48.930> emoji<00:03:49.500> cot<00:03:49.739> or<00:03:49.980> professional<00:03:50.910> gaming<00:03:51.120> or

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
like emoji cot or professional gaming or

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.059 
like emoji cot or professional gaming or
any<00:03:51.720> type<00:03:51.930> of<00:03:51.959> competitive<00:03:52.260> gaming<00:03:52.680> like

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
any type of competitive gaming like

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.379 
any type of competitive gaming like
capture<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.459> flag<00:03:53.579> you<00:03:53.910> can<00:03:54.060> throw<00:03:54.239> in

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
capture the flag you can throw in

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.330 
capture the flag you can throw in
concussion<00:03:54.660> grenade<00:03:55.139> and<00:03:55.470> stop<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.889> flag<00:03:56.129> in

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
concussion grenade and stop the flag in

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.430 
concussion grenade and stop the flag in
a<00:03:56.699> map<00:03:56.910> like<00:03:57.090> this<00:03:57.150> yes<00:03:57.660> see<00:03:57.870> me<00:03:57.989> I<00:03:58.019> barely<00:03:58.319> even

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
a map like this yes see me I barely even

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.289 
a map like this yes see me I barely even
use<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.889> EMP<00:03:59.250> very<00:03:59.459> probably<00:03:59.760> like<00:03:59.910> once<00:04:00.150> or

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
use the EMP very probably like once or

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.030 
use the EMP very probably like once or
twice<00:04:00.419> during<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.989> whole<00:04:01.169> entire<00:04:01.500> game<00:04:01.799> play

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
twice during the whole entire game play

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.409 
twice during the whole entire game play
