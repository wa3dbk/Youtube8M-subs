it<00:02:05.280> worked<00:02:05.790> out<00:02:05.970> perfectly

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
it worked out perfectly

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.109 
it worked out perfectly
now<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.160> gripes<00:02:08.550> for<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:08.879> tank

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
now the gripes for this tank

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.360 
now the gripes for this tank
unfortunately<00:02:09.840> are<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.229> lighting<00:02:11.009> system

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
is this stack filter right here that's

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.530 
is this stack filter right here that's
inside<00:02:17.880> your<00:02:18.000> tank

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.930 
inside your tank
it<00:02:18.900> comes<00:02:19.200> with<00:02:19.380> bio<00:02:19.740> ball<00:02:20.010> section<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.790> is

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
it comes with bio ball section that is

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.240 
it comes with bio ball section that is
on<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.420> bottom<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.050> back<00:02:22.290> which<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.040> only

that<00:02:49.080> unfortunately<00:02:49.920> gets<00:02:50.160> clogs<00:02:50.850> I<00:02:51.270> mean<00:02:51.870> it

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
that unfortunately gets clogs I mean it

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.040 
that unfortunately gets clogs I mean it
it<00:02:52.980> like<00:02:53.280> clogs<00:02:53.610> so<00:02:54.000> much<00:02:54.240> that<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.660> filter

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
it like clogs so much that the filter

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.260 
it like clogs so much that the filter
would<00:02:55.230> lose<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:55.890> much<00:02:56.040> water<00:02:56.280> in<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:57.150> it

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
would lose so much water in it that it

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.510 
would lose so much water in it that it
would<00:02:57.390> stop<00:02:57.660> working<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.770> have<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.040> either

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
would stop working and I have to either

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.510 
would stop working and I have to either
I<00:02:59.640> was<00:03:00.120> either<00:03:00.300> replacing<00:03:01.020> it<00:03:01.140> or<00:03:01.460> trying<00:03:02.460> to

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
I was either replacing it or trying to

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.220 
I was either replacing it or trying to
clean<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:02.940> out<00:03:03.000> as<00:03:03.240> much<00:03:03.270> as<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.630> could<00:03:03.690> but<00:03:04.050> it

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
clean it out as much as I could but it

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.210 
clean it out as much as I could but it
just<00:03:04.470> would<00:03:04.740> not<00:03:05.240> work<00:03:06.240> until<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.500> was<00:03:07.800> able<00:03:08.070> to

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
just would not work until I was able to

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.240 
just would not work until I was able to
put<00:03:08.580> in<00:03:08.670> another<00:03:08.910> filter<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:10.380> seemed<00:03:11.160> to

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
put in another filter and it seemed to

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.800 
put in another filter and it seemed to
help<00:03:11.460> it<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:11.850> way<00:03:12.590> now<00:03:13.590> if<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:15.390> want<00:03:15.630> a

help it that way now if you want a

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.380 
help it that way now if you want a
saltwater<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.590> water<00:03:16.800> tank<00:03:17.130> this<00:03:17.490> is<00:03:17.670> not<00:03:18.120> the

kit for you this filter can only handle
freshwater<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:22.020> mean<00:03:23.030> it<00:03:24.030> has<00:03:24.420> a<00:03:24.450> really<00:03:25.020> cool

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
freshwater I mean it has a really cool

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.510 
freshwater I mean it has a really cool
feature<00:03:25.230> which<00:03:25.860> I'm<00:03:26.010> going<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.220> talk<00:03:26.400> about

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
feature which I'm going to talk about

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.960 
feature which I'm going to talk about
now<00:03:26.820> is<00:03:27.080> it<00:03:28.080> actually<00:03:28.680> has<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.010> siphoning<00:03:29.700> tube

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
now is it actually has a siphoning tube

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.560 
now is it actually has a siphoning tube
that<00:03:30.300> is<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:31.400> water<00:03:32.400> siphoning<00:03:32.910> tube<00:03:33.150> for

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
that is it a water siphoning tube for

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.970 
that is it a water siphoning tube for
your<00:03:33.690> water<00:03:33.870> change<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.290> built<00:03:34.500> into<00:03:34.740> the

your water change is built into the

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.760 
your water change is built into the
filter<00:03:35.370> which<00:03:35.940> allows<00:03:36.270> you<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.810> take<00:03:37.740> the

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
filter which allows you to take the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.560 
filter which allows you to take the
water<00:03:38.070> from<00:03:38.160> your<00:03:38.460> filter<00:03:38.970> while<00:03:39.180> it's<00:03:39.390> still

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
water from your filter while it's still

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.080 
water from your filter while it's still
on<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:40.080> then<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.620> flows<00:03:40.890> back<00:03:41.160> behind<00:03:41.370> in<00:03:42.030> a

on and then it flows back behind in a
tube<00:03:42.360> to<00:03:42.900> this<00:03:43.050> faucet<00:03:43.890> right<00:03:44.040> here<00:03:44.400> which<00:03:45.030> I

it<00:04:14.000> you<00:04:14.300> can't<00:04:14.540> siphon<00:04:14.960> your<00:04:15.440> your<00:04:16.280> gravel

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
it you can't siphon your your gravel

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.270 
it you can't siphon your your gravel
which<00:04:17.090> is<00:04:17.239> a<00:04:17.269> major<00:04:17.510> part<00:04:17.870> of<00:04:18.140> taking<00:04:19.100> care<00:04:19.250> of

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
which is a major part of taking care of

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.770 
which is a major part of taking care of
your<00:04:19.400> aquarium<00:04:19.670> it<00:04:20.200> is<00:04:21.200> not<00:04:21.920> the<00:04:22.100> best<00:04:22.250> option

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
your aquarium it is not the best option

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.860 
your aquarium it is not the best option
you're<00:04:23.780> better<00:04:24.050> off<00:04:24.140> just<00:04:24.710> having<00:04:25.190> a<00:04:25.340> a

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
you're better off just having a a

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.830 
you're better off just having a a
canister<00:04:26.870> filter<00:04:27.290> or<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:28.090> lid<00:04:29.090> filter<00:04:29.510> lid

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
getting a tube system which I ended up

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.740 
getting a tube system which I ended up
having<00:04:35.900> to<00:04:36.110> do<00:04:38.080> now<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.140> lighting<00:04:39.500> system<00:04:39.680> is

this top piece right here it comes with
two<00:04:45.050> other<00:04:45.230> sections<00:04:45.530> that<00:04:45.800> you<00:04:46.040> will<00:04:46.370> end<00:04:46.520> up

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
two other sections that you will end up

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.790 
two other sections that you will end up
completely<00:04:47.360> closing<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:47.900> top<00:04:48.110> of<00:04:48.320> this<00:04:48.440> tank

and when the lights are on it's actually
a<00:04:52.310> really<00:04:52.850> really<00:04:53.270> good<00:04:54.100> lighting<00:04:55.100> system<00:04:55.640> it

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
a really really good lighting system it

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.070

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
soon as it loses power

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.630
