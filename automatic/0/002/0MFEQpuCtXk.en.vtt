would have to disagree with you on this
I<00:00:10.170> think<00:00:10.230> that<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.710> child<00:00:12.500> parents<00:00:13.500> of<00:00:13.590> two

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
I think that a child parents of two

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.890 
I think that a child parents of two
different<00:00:13.980> faiths<00:00:14.509> even<00:00:15.509> two<00:00:15.630> different

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
different faiths even two different

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.480 
different faiths even two different
cultures<00:00:16.230> who<00:00:16.470> possibly<00:00:16.920> even<00:00:17.070> speak<00:00:17.340> two

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
cultures who possibly even speak two

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.760 
cultures who possibly even speak two
different<00:00:17.520> languages<00:00:18.270> completely<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.109> then

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
different languages completely is then

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.060 
different languages completely is then
going<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.039> grow<00:00:20.220> up<00:00:20.689> better<00:00:21.689> informed<00:00:22.230> have<00:00:23.039> a

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
going to grow up better informed have a

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.420 
going to grow up better informed have a
much<00:00:23.850> wider<00:00:24.210> perspective<00:00:24.710> and<00:00:25.710> an

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
much wider perspective and an

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.640 
much wider perspective and an
understanding<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.119> two<00:00:27.420> different<00:00:28.109> cultures

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
understanding of two different cultures

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.019 
understanding of two different cultures
and<00:00:28.769> religions<00:00:29.130> were<00:00:29.340> they<00:00:29.699> would<00:00:29.849> not

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
and religions were they would not

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.150 
and religions were they would not
normally<00:00:30.330> have<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.050> opportunity<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.920> if

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
normally have that opportunity to if

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.040 
normally have that opportunity to if
they're<00:00:32.579> both<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.149> their<00:00:33.270> parents<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.660> were

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
they're both of their parents of were

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.530 
they're both of their parents of were
one<00:00:34.380> background<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.610> think<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:36.030> child<00:00:36.300> in

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
one background so I think that child in

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.389 
one background so I think that child in
long<00:00:36.750> run<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.350> benefit<00:00:37.800> from<00:00:38.250> having

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
long run is going to benefit from having

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.299 
long run is going to benefit from having
parents<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.390> two<00:00:39.660> different<00:00:39.989> things<00:00:40.160> see<00:00:41.160> what

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
parents of two different things see what

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.400 
parents of two different things see what
you're<00:00:41.489> talking<00:00:41.670> about<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.420> religious

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
you're talking about is a religious

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.940 
you're talking about is a religious
museum<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.969> household<00:00:45.450> context<00:00:46.230> where

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
museum in a household context where

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.639 
museum in a household context where
people<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.399> see<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:48.690> they<00:00:48.809> cannot<00:00:49.350> get

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
people can see but they cannot get

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.000 
people can see but they cannot get
imbued<00:00:50.250> with<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.670> ideology<00:00:51.260> see<00:00:52.260> awareness

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
imbued with that ideology see awareness

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.310 
imbued with that ideology see awareness
is<00:00:53.160> one<00:00:53.370> thing<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:54.329> quick<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.050> quite<00:00:55.289> a

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
is one thing be quick but is quite a

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.560 
is one thing be quick but is quite a
different<00:00:55.800> thing<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.670> think<00:00:56.910> every<00:00:57.300> parent

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
different thing and I think every parent

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.349 
different thing and I think every parent
wants<00:00:57.840> their<00:00:58.379> child<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.399> have<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> commitment

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
wants their child to have a commitment

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.260 
wants their child to have a commitment
to<00:01:00.780> whatever<00:01:01.500> value<00:01:01.920> system<00:01:02.670> if<00:01:02.850> somebody<00:01:03.210> is

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
to whatever value system if somebody is

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.210 
to whatever value system if somebody is
born<00:01:03.600> into<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> sea<00:01:04.290> cow<00:01:04.470> soul<00:01:04.739> or<00:01:04.920> somebody's

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
born into a sea cow soul or somebody's

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.550 
born into a sea cow soul or somebody's
