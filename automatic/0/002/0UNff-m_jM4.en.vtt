there<00:01:05.050> is<00:01:05.260> a<00:01:05.290> confusing<00:01:05.890> place<00:01:06.160> if<00:01:06.880> you<00:01:07.120> get<00:01:07.360> a

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
there is a confusing place if you get a

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.030 
there is a confusing place if you get a
loss<00:01:07.750> that<00:01:07.780> all<00:01:08.140> you'll<00:01:08.410> be<00:01:08.440> automatically

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
loss that all you'll be automatically

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.590 
loss that all you'll be automatically
returned<00:01:09.430> to<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:09.970> beginning<00:01:10.270> so<00:01:10.510> the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
returned to to the beginning so the

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.930 
returned to to the beginning so the
first<00:01:10.840> thing<00:01:10.930> we're<00:01:11.230> going<00:01:11.410> to<00:01:11.530> do<00:01:11.800> is<00:01:12.070> I<00:01:12.910> go

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
first thing we're going to do is I go

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.700 
first thing we're going to do is I go
out<00:01:13.210> this<00:01:13.390> way<00:01:13.600> as<00:01:13.870> you<00:01:14.050> can<00:01:14.140> see<00:01:14.350> in<00:01:14.440> front<00:01:14.620> of

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
out this way as you can see in front of

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.410 
out this way as you can see in front of
you<00:01:14.800> there<00:01:15.010> is<00:01:15.190> a<00:01:15.220> bunch<00:01:15.610> of<00:01:15.700> quicksand<00:01:16.180> so

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
you there is a bunch of quicksand so

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.800 
you there is a bunch of quicksand so
we're<00:01:16.570> going<00:01:16.780> to<00:01:16.900> use<00:01:16.930> our<00:01:17.380> long<00:01:17.650> shot<00:01:17.680> too

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
we're going to use our long shot too

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.780 
we're going to use our long shot too
attached<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:20.260> me<00:01:21.130> a<00:01:21.160> little<00:01:21.400> closer<00:01:24.420> come<00:01:25.420> on

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
attached to me a little closer come on

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.370 
attached to me a little closer come on
use<00:01:27.790> a<00:01:27.820> long<00:01:28.060> shot<00:01:28.330> to<00:01:28.540> attach<00:01:28.870> you<00:01:29.050> on<00:01:29.230> the

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
use a long shot to attach you on the

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.540 
use a long shot to attach you on the
crates<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.900> next<00:01:32.650> we<00:01:32.740> need<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:32.980> follow<00:01:33.220> the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
crates and next we need to follow the

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.320 
crates and next we need to follow the
flags<00:01:34.590> what<00:01:35.590> we<00:01:35.740> do<00:01:36.040> is<00:01:36.220> go<00:01:36.430> to<00:01:36.490> one<00:01:36.760> flag<00:01:37.030> and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
flags what we do is go to one flag and

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.870 
flags what we do is go to one flag and
work<00:01:37.479> your<00:01:37.600> way<00:01:37.660> to<00:01:37.810> next<00:01:38.380> it's<00:01:39.370> very<00:01:39.550> hard<00:01:39.850> to

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
work your way to next it's very hard to

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.520 
work your way to next it's very hard to
see<00:01:40.060> in<00:01:40.150> front<00:01:40.330> of<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:40.540> so<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:40.810> want<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.500> just

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.219 
see in front of you so you want to just
go<00:01:41.950> flag<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.460> flag<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:43.120> you<00:01:43.630> cannot<00:01:43.840> see<00:01:44.050> the

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
go flag to flag and you cannot see the

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.540 
go flag to flag and you cannot see the
other<00:01:44.380> one<00:01:44.500> until<00:01:44.890> you're<00:01:45.010> right<00:01:45.190> added

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
other one until you're right added

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.610 
other one until you're right added
because<00:01:45.850> again<00:01:46.300> you<00:01:46.450> cannot<00:01:46.690> see<00:01:46.930> very<00:01:46.960> far<00:01:47.440> in

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
because again you cannot see very far in
