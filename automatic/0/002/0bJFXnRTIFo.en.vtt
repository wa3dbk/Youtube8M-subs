cartel so new for 2012 will be a ton of

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.100 
cartel so new for 2012 will be a ton of
advancements<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> one<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.480> most<00:00:33.570> exciting

advancements the one the most exciting
one<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.320> start<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.829> reflex<00:00:35.820> technology<00:00:36.540> so

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
one to start is reflex technology so

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.270 
one to start is reflex technology so
trickle<00:00:37.290> down<00:00:37.320> from<00:00:37.710> bindings<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
trickle down from bindings like the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.200 
trickle down from bindings like the
prophecy<00:00:38.790> we<00:00:39.600> now<00:00:39.780> have<00:00:40.050> reflex<00:00:41.010> tech<00:00:41.309> going

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
prophecy we now have reflex tech going

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.270 
prophecy we now have reflex tech going
into<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.540> cartel<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.230> split<00:00:43.620> down<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.829> center

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
into the cartel so split down the center

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.279 
into the cartel so split down the center
allowing<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.120> base<00:00:45.270> tray<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:45.960> bonding

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
allowing the base tray of this bonding

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.350

to<00:00:46.379> flex<00:00:46.649> with<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> snowboard<00:00:47.370> your

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
to flex with the snowboard your

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.600 
to flex with the snowboard your
snowboard<00:00:48.809> engineer<00:00:49.289> will<00:00:49.770> spend<00:00:50.070> tons<00:00:50.430> of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
snowboard engineer will spend tons of

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.850 
snowboard engineer will spend tons of
time<00:00:50.670> trying<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.390> engineer<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.350> snowboard

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
time trying to engineer that snowboard

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.650 
time trying to engineer that snowboard
to<00:00:52.949> flex<00:00:53.250> perfectly<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.059> when<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.480> put<00:00:54.629> a

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
to flex perfectly and when you put a

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.450 
to flex perfectly and when you put a
snowboard<00:00:54.750> binding<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.829> board<00:00:56.100> it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
snowboard binding on to that board it

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.369 
snowboard binding on to that board it
interrupts<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.090> flex<00:00:57.360> pattern<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.050> now<00:00:58.170> with

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
interrupts the flex pattern so now with

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.410 
interrupts the flex pattern so now with
free<00:00:58.559> flex<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:59.460> allow<00:00:59.699> these<00:00:59.879> bindings<00:01:00.300> to

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
free flex we allow these bindings to

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.420 
free flex we allow these bindings to
flex<00:01:00.690> with<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.960> snowboard<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.680> give<00:01:02.219> them

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
flex with the snowboard and give them

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.310 
flex with the snowboard and give them
the<00:01:02.609> best<00:01:02.789> possible<00:01:02.910> flex<00:01:03.600> imaginable

new zero lean hi back that's right zero

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.380 
new zero lean hi back that's right zero
lean<00:01:30.299> hi<00:01:30.540> back<00:01:30.780> many<00:01:31.970> riders<00:01:32.970> give<00:01:33.270> us

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
lean hi back many riders give us

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.210 
lean hi back many riders give us
feedback<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.409> forward<00:01:34.829> lean<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
feedback that the forward lean on the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.490 
feedback that the forward lean on the
cartel<00:01:35.579> was<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:36.000> too<00:01:36.150> much<00:01:36.180> too<00:01:36.630> gnarly<00:01:36.869> hurt

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
cartel was just too much too gnarly hurt

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.170 
cartel was just too much too gnarly hurt
their<00:01:37.740> calves<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.759> what<00:01:38.850> we've<00:01:38.970> done<00:01:39.000> is

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
their calves and so what we've done is

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.899 
their calves and so what we've done is
gone<00:01:39.450> ahead<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.750> leaned<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.890> out<00:01:41.009> are<00:01:41.340> backed

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
gone ahead and leaned it out are backed

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.030 
gone ahead and leaned it out are backed
it<00:01:42.090> off<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.450> as<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.780> see<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.649> high<00:01:43.860> back

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
it off so as you can see this high back

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.380 
it off so as you can see this high back
is<00:01:44.250> pretty<00:01:44.490> much<00:01:44.670> straight<00:01:45.030> up<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.329> down

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
is pretty much straight up and down

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.600 
is pretty much straight up and down
still<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.500> all<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.890> adjustments<00:01:47.159> that

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
still you have all the adjustments that

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.399 
still you have all the adjustments that
you<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:48.000> imagine<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.540> add<00:01:48.689> for<00:01:48.990> lean<00:01:49.200> and

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
you can imagine to add for lean and

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.600 
you can imagine to add for lean and
crank<00:01:49.619> up<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.829> for<00:01:50.159> leaving<00:01:50.399> for<00:01:50.490> those

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
crank up that for leaving for those

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.789 
crank up that for leaving for those
riders<00:01:50.820> wanting<00:01:51.540> for<00:01:51.750> lean<00:01:51.960> for<00:01:52.649> those<00:01:52.770> that

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
riders wanting for lean for those that

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.249 
riders wanting for lean for those that
don't<00:01:53.130> want<00:01:53.399> for<00:01:53.640> lean<00:01:53.880> keep<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.750> relaxed<00:01:54.840> and

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
don't want for lean keep it relaxed and

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.050 
don't want for lean keep it relaxed and
you're<00:01:55.380> good<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.560> go<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.159> all<00:01:56.369> new<00:01:56.640> high<00:01:56.820> back
