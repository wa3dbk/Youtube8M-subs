00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.110
 hello kisteleki mena in week in this 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:17.980
 occasion we will show how to root the 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.689
 samsung galaxy s advanced 7 and 90 70 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.119
 it really is a pretty process 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.880
 simple the only thing we have to do 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.859
 is to download a file a zip file 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.460
 that I will leave in the description of 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.470
 video and the only necessary requirement is 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.930
 that we have a sd in what is the 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.180
 cellular because if not it will not be able to 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.790
 operate the permissions correctly 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.010
 root the first thing we have to do is 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.280
 download the file pass it on our 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.329
 sd that is necessarily and what follows 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.820
 continuation 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.180
 we have to turn off the phone 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.400
 we pay it and followed this we have to 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.239
 enter what is the recovery mode that 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.260
 already brings us the phone by factory only 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.260
 we have to wait for it to turn off 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.350
 and it has already turned off to enter the mode 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:17.920
 recovery you have to press volume up 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.920
 home button and power button at the same time 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.070
 it means you can see it has already entered what 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.220
 that is the recovery mode I can make a 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.130
 little zoom so they can see the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.930
 steps that I will follow and remember for 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.780
 move is with the volume keys and 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.430
 is selected with the power key in 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.360
 this occasion what we have to use 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.030
 it's the blue update from stern and storage 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.130
 is the importance that I told them in the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.290
 time to have an SD if you do not have a 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.660
 it's going to be impossible to root this 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.370
 team ok then we choose the third 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.620
 option with the power button and we look for the 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.480
 file that we had already passed that in 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.550
 this case is going to be called root points and 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.350
 down here we have it 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:29.069
 we go down and select it with power 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.769
 and start working to work 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.200
 once you have finished here as well 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:38.609
 finished what we have to do is 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.439
 upload and select with power and 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:44.719
 select the first action the option 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:44.719
 sorry that is reboot system now 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.250
 stay here the phone will reboot and 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.800
 will already show us that we have permits 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.550
 root installed in our galaxy s 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.550
 advance 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.160
 here is correctly reset the 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.160
 team 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.510
 it's a matter of waiting for it to end 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.950
 start since as we surround it then 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.709
 that shows how to have one 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.540
 installation of a new application but 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.540
 the scare is totally normal 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.120
 here already gave its start we are going to 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.180
 unlock it and we search between 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.290
 applications and how can you see here already 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:51.180
 we are super users, that was all 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.489
