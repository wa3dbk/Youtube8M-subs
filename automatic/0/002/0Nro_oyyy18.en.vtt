tomatoes planted up there we've dug
those<00:00:28.680> up<00:00:29.010> several<00:00:29.910> weeks<00:00:30.090> ago<00:00:31.850> cherry<00:00:32.850> tomato

those up several weeks ago cherry tomato
plant<00:00:34.760> pretty<00:00:35.760> much<00:00:35.910> given<00:00:36.270> up<00:00:36.420> on<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.780> one

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
plant pretty much given up on this one

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.119 
plant pretty much given up on this one
one<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.239> things<00:00:39.480> I'd<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:40.140> share<00:00:40.890> with

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
one of the things I'd like to share with

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.540 
one of the things I'd like to share with
you<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:42.649> my<00:00:43.649> experience<00:00:44.250> with<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
you is my experience with the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.500 
you is my experience with the
hydroponics

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
hydroponics

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.490 
hydroponics
things<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.410> would<00:00:47.930> change<00:00:48.930> about<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
things that I would change about the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.930 
things that I would change about the
systemness<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.820> outdoor<00:00:51.300> system<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.940> really

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
systemness the outdoor system I really

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.240 
systemness the outdoor system I really
like<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.300> way<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.870> worked<00:00:55.140> out<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:56.129> only

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
like the way that it worked out the only

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.369 
like the way that it worked out the only
thing<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.699> would<00:00:56.870> two<00:00:57.870> things<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.320> would

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
thing that I would two things I would

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.720 
thing that I would two things I would
change<00:00:58.500> number<00:00:59.190> one<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:01.079> return<00:01:02.010> line<00:01:02.309> I

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
change number one the return line I

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.539 
change number one the return line I
would<00:01:03.300> make<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.870> probably<00:01:04.409> twice<00:01:04.710> as<00:01:05.040> large<00:01:05.220> as

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
would make it probably twice as large as

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.260 
would make it probably twice as large as
a<00:01:05.580> supply<00:01:06.090> line<00:01:06.360> particularly<00:01:07.320> if<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.530> use<00:01:07.740> a

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
a supply line particularly if you use a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.719 
a supply line particularly if you use a
high<00:01:09.270> capacity<00:01:09.479> pump<00:01:10.260> when<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.979> switched<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.400> 12

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
high capacity pump when I switched to 12

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.320 
high capacity pump when I switched to 12
volts<00:01:12.240> went<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> sump<00:01:13.409> pump<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:14.180> went<00:01:15.180> up<00:01:15.299> to

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
volts went to a sump pump I went up to

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.899 
volts went to a sump pump I went up to
350<00:01:16.229> gallons<00:01:16.770> per<00:01:17.189> hour<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.960> found<00:01:19.290> that

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
350 gallons per hour and I found that

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.109 
350 gallons per hour and I found that
that<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.060> would<00:01:21.210> overflow<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.890> had<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.310> get

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
that it would overflow so I had to get

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.320 
that it would overflow so I had to get
the<00:01:24.240> timer<00:01:24.509> set<00:01:24.900> just<00:01:25.080> right<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:26.700> prevent<00:01:27.090> that

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
the timer set just right to prevent that

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.620 
the timer set just right to prevent that
the<00:01:27.740> other<00:01:28.740> issue<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:29.939> built<00:01:30.390> this

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
the other issue is that I built this

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.760 
the other issue is that I built this
thing<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.049> little<00:01:31.170> bit<00:01:31.409> too<00:01:31.590> close<00:01:33.650> to<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
thing a little bit too close to the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.760 
thing a little bit too close to the
greenhouse<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.250> need<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.850> have<00:01:36.200> room<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.500> both

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
greenhouse you need to have room on both

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.399 
greenhouse you need to have room on both
sides<00:01:38.570> particularly<00:01:39.570> if<00:01:39.780> you're<00:01:39.960> growing

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
sides particularly if you're growing

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.319 
sides particularly if you're growing
something<00:01:40.829> that's<00:01:41.189> got<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> buyer<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:42.210> going

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
something that's got a buyer it's going

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.200 
something that's got a buyer it's going
to<00:01:42.390> need<00:01:42.540> support<00:01:43.700> just<00:01:44.700> makes<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.090> lot

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
to need support just makes it a lot

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.069 
to need support just makes it a lot
easier<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:47.880> get<00:01:48.060> around<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.810> now<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
easier to to get around to it now the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.990 
easier to to get around to it now the
other<00:01:49.290> thing<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:50.159> might<00:01:50.310> notice<00:01:50.369> here

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
other thing that you might notice here

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.749 
other thing that you might notice here
is<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.540> pull<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.619> tomato<00:01:53.189> plant<00:01:53.369> out

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
is that I pull this tomato plant out

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.620 
is that I pull this tomato plant out
right<00:01:53.970> here<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.479> had<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> situation<00:01:55.680> with<00:01:56.630> with

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
right here I had a situation with with

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.370 
right here I had a situation with with
some<00:01:57.840> root<00:01:58.049> rot<00:01:58.409> and

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
some root rot and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.450 
some root rot and
some<00:02:00.979> kind<00:02:01.790> of<00:02:01.850> in<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.119> recovery<00:02:02.659> mode<00:02:03.460> right

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
some kind of in the recovery mode right

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.390 
some kind of in the recovery mode right
now<00:02:04.520> with<00:02:05.030> these<00:02:05.680> plants<00:02:06.680> on<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:06.920> outside

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
now with these plants on the outside

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.010 
now with these plants on the outside
I've<00:02:07.700> got<00:02:07.729> been<00:02:08.420> pumping<00:02:08.869> hydrogen<00:02:09.800> peroxide

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
I've got been pumping hydrogen peroxide

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.140 
I've got been pumping hydrogen peroxide
for<00:02:12.020> several<00:02:12.380> days<00:02:12.560> I<00:02:13.160> finally<00:02:13.730> put<00:02:13.970> some

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
for several days I finally put some

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.770 
for several days I finally put some
nutrients<00:02:14.660> in<00:02:14.780> there<00:02:14.959> this<00:02:15.080> morning<00:02:16.600> on<00:02:17.600> the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
nutrients in there this morning on the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.309 
nutrients in there this morning on the
indoor<00:02:18.170> system<00:02:18.709> I<00:02:19.720> don't<00:02:20.720> think<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.080> would

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
indoor system I don't think I would

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.620 
indoor system I don't think I would
build<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.489> header<00:02:22.730> like<00:02:23.030> this<00:02:23.270> anymore<00:02:23.540> I<00:02:25.630> was

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
build a header like this anymore I was

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.510 
build a header like this anymore I was
sort<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:26.959> obsessed<00:02:27.500> when<00:02:27.800> I<00:02:27.860> built<00:02:28.160> this<00:02:28.310> thing

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
sort of obsessed when I built this thing

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.610 
sort of obsessed when I built this thing
with<00:02:28.730> trying<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.180> get<00:02:29.420> all<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.200> liquid<00:02:30.380> to

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
with trying to get all the liquid to

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.990 
with trying to get all the liquid to
drain<00:02:30.920> out<00:02:31.100> of<00:02:31.130> these<00:02:31.340> pipes

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
drain out of these pipes

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.220 
drain out of these pipes
when<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:33.019> system<00:02:33.410> cycled<00:02:34.250> off<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.230> blood

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
but you can see it's the other thing

that<00:03:29.660> I<00:03:29.900> did<00:03:30.109> wrong<00:03:30.350> on<00:03:31.250> this<00:03:32.030> particular<00:03:32.600> one

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
that I did wrong on this particular one

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.199 
that I did wrong on this particular one
is<00:03:33.170> that<00:03:33.380> I<00:03:33.590> put<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:36.400> reservoir<00:03:37.400> right

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
is that I put the the reservoir right

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.860 
is that I put the the reservoir right
underneath<00:03:38.660> these<00:03:38.810> tubes<00:03:39.230> and<00:03:40.630> I'm<00:03:41.630> going<00:03:41.840> to

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
underneath these tubes and I'm going to

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.380 
underneath these tubes and I'm going to
move<00:03:42.109> that<00:03:42.560> remove<00:03:43.250> it<00:03:43.400> some<00:03:44.180> distance

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
move that remove it some distance

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.310 
move that remove it some distance

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
completely away from the system so that

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.780 
completely away from the system so that
it<00:03:48.320> will<00:03:48.410> be<00:03:48.560> easy<00:03:48.769> enough<00:03:49.100> to<00:03:49.160> fill<00:03:49.489> in<00:03:49.670> this

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
it will be easy enough to fill in this

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.479 
it will be easy enough to fill in this
