00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
feel a comfort level with one another

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.200 
feel a comfort level with one another

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.510 
and they've really been welcomed by our
players<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.500> think<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.950> if<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.070> were<00:01:35.310> a

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
players and I think that if you were a

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.550 
players and I think that if you were a
normal<00:01:36.119> college<00:01:36.600> student<00:01:36.630> per<00:01:37.049> se<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.439> you

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
normal college student per se and you

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.460 
normal college student per se and you
started<00:01:37.950> after<00:01:38.790> your<00:01:39.180> your<00:01:39.630> winter<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.439> know

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
started after your your winter you know

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.899 
started after your your winter you know
that<00:01:40.710> would<00:01:40.799> be<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.890> lot<00:01:41.040> more<00:01:41.070> stressful<00:01:41.549> than

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
that would be a lot more stressful than

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.389 
that would be a lot more stressful than
if<00:01:42.509> you're<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> football<00:01:43.259> player<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.009> you

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
if you're a football player and you you

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.160 
if you're a football player and you you
really<00:01:44.549> have<00:01:44.820> 85<00:01:45.240> brothers<00:01:45.659> right<00:01:45.869> off<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
really have 85 brothers right off the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.929 
really have 85 brothers right off the
bat<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.920> think<00:01:47.130> they<00:01:47.220> feel<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.549> family

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
bat and I think they feel the family

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.130 
bat and I think they feel the family
atmosphere<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.600> they<00:01:48.720> feel<00:01:48.869> pretty<00:01:49.049> good

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
atmosphere and they feel pretty good

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.649 
atmosphere and they feel pretty good
about<00:01:49.200> things<00:01:49.500> okay<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.909> bring<00:01:51.329> a
