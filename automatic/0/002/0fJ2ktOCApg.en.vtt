00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.490
 now coming to the news we can 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.230
 certainly to say that the game was not 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.639
 started badly for the Azzurri 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.800
 so much so that the first opportunity to 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.269
 net was just for ours 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.639
 but the gunner proved not to be 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.650
 happy day at this deficiency 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.289
 of our leading sector yes 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.029
 added a certain disorganization 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.619
 midfield where the Swiss wedge 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.500
 of the mat soon emerged 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.750
 imposing itself on the lucidity of maneuver 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.490
 it was these two elements 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.410
 the middle and the middle and the other captain the other 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.790
 to move all actions in order 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.469
 of the Swiss 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.570
 fortunately the Swiss does not have in the 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.399
 his ranks men exceptional goals and 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.559
 therefore the damages to our defense are 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.290
 been quite limited 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.210
 however that wedge bernat as far as not 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.890
 be two very fast athletes have 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.309
 enjoyed almost complete freedom of 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.680
 maneuver 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.960
 often bleckner was added to them 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.399
 the most dangerous of the Swiss who 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.410
 then had to score the first goal of the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.219
 match without needing further 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.750
 details 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.820
 it appears quite obvious that if the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.140
 Swiss midfield could act with 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.430
 so much ease 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.229
 on the other front ie between the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.460
 blue midfielders was not there 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.770
 adequate organization 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.420
 all in all however our door 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.820
 he was not in great danger until 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.010
 sixteenth minute when blatter did 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.479
 center with a great shot from outside the area 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.680
 ball deflected from there was just 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.680
 touched by the virtuous 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.610
 one to zero for the Swiss 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.659
 the Azzurri without giving any sign of 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.979
 reaction continued to play in rhythm 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.380
 slow throughout the first half 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.270
 on one occasion this was seen 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.159
 an action in speed but on the launch of 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.350
 mazzola the con goalkeeper preceded the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.799
 our gori in practice the first time is 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.720
 that's all 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.520
 Italy left the field under the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.140
 whistles of the many emigrants who came to 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.700
 pay tribute to the second team 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.020
 classified at the world championships 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.240
 almost at the beginning of shooting zoff 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.619
 replaced by albertosi continues to one 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.929
 prowess by diverting a great shot of 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.280
 console this averted danger 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.050
 compared on the condition of the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.640
 doorman but did not give rise to many 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.090
 hopes for recovery by the 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.369
 blue 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.440
 among the Italians he had been two 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.269
 replacements since in addition to the graft of 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.310
 zoff of which we see a parade that has 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.950
 made to shout to the goal it was to 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.510
 ferrante and replacement of liliana i 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.880
 fears that the Swiss could 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.049
 continue to impose his game were 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.480
 supported by another incursion 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.140
 continuous blatt leur ending which ended 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.140
 out of little 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.370
 at this point, however, something changed 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.170
 among the blues mazzola moved his 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.060
 field of action later and resulting 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.060
 the whole team is more effective than before 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.680
 moreover, he appeared more willing to do so 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.700
 from a brible raid was born 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.700
 hope to break even 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.780
 the action unfolded through gori that 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.970
 after a good flicker it had something to do with 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.040
 domenghini the wing deviated from the head but the 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.020
 ball was retaken from the pole again 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.940
 the unbalanced puts it back 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.800
 this was the first real action 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:08.880
 dangerous of our team in the 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:10.680
 still mazzola shooting in evidence with 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:18.150
 a shot he found with a light one 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:20.070
 delay also facchetti 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.140
 excellent in defense he was looking for 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.100
 opportunities to make yourself dangerous 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.500
 team even though denouncing 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.330
 technical shortcomings found spirit 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.500
 combative and with the blues in phase 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.690
 of attack everyone's eyes were 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.860
 pointed to rivas it was expected that from 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.780
 one moment our 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.790
 prince gunner found the vein 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.770
 good and instead arrived was 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.660
 systematically canceled by boffi un 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.640
 Ticino that alternates with the profession of 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.230
 postman to that of soccer player and that 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.290
 just yesterday he was in on 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.290
 national 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.240
 while therefore Italy was engaged in the 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.880
 his forcing zoff ran the biggest one 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.890
 danger of his day a great shot 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.110
 on the fly of butler was replied by 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.570
 then he crosses the same zoff and rejects 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.709
 the knee and finally Nicolaus anticipated 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.050
 another goalkeeper intervention 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.450
 sending the ball over the crossbar 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.490
 could be the 2 to 0 a result that 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.040
 would have made a huge fuss and instead 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:16.470
 shortly thereafter it came all 1 to 1 thanks to a 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:19.850
 invention of mazzola we review his 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.850
 plane dribble before shooting 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.590
 el 1 to 1 a result that attenuates 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.420
 only partly the bitterness of ours 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.340
 emigrated and that does not solve the problems 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.340
 current of our national team
