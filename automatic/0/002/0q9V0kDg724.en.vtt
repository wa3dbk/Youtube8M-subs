in inches the simple rule is that you

in inches the simple rule is that you

should measure the distance from your

TVs location to your ideal viewing
location<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.070> then<00:01:20.430> divide<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.939> by<00:01:21.150> two<00:01:21.380> so

location and then divide that by two so
for<00:01:22.619> example<00:01:23.070> say<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.400> set<00:01:23.700> hundred<00:01:24.150> inches
