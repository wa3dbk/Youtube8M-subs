quite<00:01:05.979> different<00:01:06.490> also<00:01:06.880> it's<00:01:07.570> very<00:01:07.630> important

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
quite different also it's very important

quite different also it's very important
the<00:01:08.350> climatic<00:01:08.680> conditions<00:01:09.310> a<00:01:09.460> little<00:01:09.549> bit

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
the climatic conditions a little bit

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.719 
the climatic conditions a little bit
cooler<00:01:10.030> because<00:01:10.570> it's<00:01:10.869> higher<00:01:11.259> and<00:01:11.729> also

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
cooler because it's higher and also

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.779 
cooler because it's higher and also
because<00:01:13.270> it's<00:01:13.659> volcanic<00:01:14.289> soils<00:01:14.859> that<00:01:15.490> makes

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
because it's volcanic soils that makes

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.700 
because it's volcanic soils that makes
the<00:01:16.570> wines<00:01:17.969> certainly<00:01:18.969> more<00:01:19.450> structured<00:01:20.380> in<00:01:20.590> a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
the wines certainly more structured in a

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.209 
the wines certainly more structured in a
way<00:01:20.859> and<00:01:21.189> also<00:01:21.880> more<00:01:22.270> elegant<00:01:22.899> when<00:01:23.799> my<00:01:23.950> father

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
way and also more elegant when my father

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:27.899 
way and also more elegant when my father
went<00:01:24.700> to<00:01:24.960> Antigua<00:01:25.960> more<00:01:26.549> consistently<00:01:27.549> in<00:01:27.789> the

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
went to Antigua more consistently in the

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.219 
went to Antigua more consistently in the
1990s<00:01:28.810> he<00:01:29.500> started<00:01:30.310> to<00:01:30.579> grow<00:01:31.090> also<00:01:31.659> Sangiovese

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
1990s he started to grow also Sangiovese

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.889 
1990s he started to grow also Sangiovese
because<00:01:32.799> we<00:01:33.189> are<00:01:33.369> in<00:01:33.789> love<00:01:34.270> with<00:01:34.479> Sangiovese

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
because we are in love with Sangiovese

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.139 
because we are in love with Sangiovese
since<00:01:35.350> it's<00:01:35.770> our<00:01:36.039> grape<00:01:36.399> variety<00:01:36.880> from

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
since it's our grape variety from

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.330 
since it's our grape variety from
Tuscany<00:01:37.749> from<00:01:37.899> the<00:01:38.020> Chianti<00:01:38.350> Classico<00:01:38.380> the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
Tuscany from the Chianti Classico the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.560 
Tuscany from the Chianti Classico the
results<00:01:39.820> weren't<00:01:40.179> as<00:01:40.390> good<00:01:40.719> as<00:01:41.670> tuscany<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:42.880> i

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
results weren't as good as tuscany and i

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.959 
results weren't as good as tuscany and i
think<00:01:43.810> this<00:01:43.929> is<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.109> good<00:01:44.320> example<00:01:44.469> of<00:01:45.130> what

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
think this is a good example of what

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.419 
think this is a good example of what
grape<00:01:46.359> varieties<00:01:47.249> indigenous<00:01:48.249> grape

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
grape varieties indigenous grape

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.819 
grape varieties indigenous grape
varieties<00:01:48.909> really<00:01:49.600> mean<00:01:49.840> because<00:01:50.439> they<00:01:50.710> give

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
varieties really mean because they give

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.800 
varieties really mean because they give
the<00:01:50.979> best<00:01:51.159> results<00:01:51.729> from<00:01:52.149> where<00:01:52.420> they<00:01:52.600> come

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
the best results from where they come

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.679 
the best results from where they come
from<00:01:52.869> but<00:01:53.740> then<00:01:53.920> after<00:01:54.280> a<00:01:54.310> few<00:01:54.399> years

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
from but then after a few years

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.749 
from but then after a few years
especially<00:01:55.689> with<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:55.990> release<00:01:56.289> of<00:01:56.319> antica<00:01:57.249> we

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
especially with the release of antica we

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.719 
especially with the release of antica we
instead<00:01:58.299> concentrated<00:01:59.200> on<00:01:59.380> Cabernet<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.399> on

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
instead concentrated on Cabernet and on

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.700 
instead concentrated on Cabernet and on
chardonnay<00:02:01.299> so<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.719> two<00:02:01.899> most<00:02:02.200> important

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
chardonnay so the two most important

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.440 
chardonnay so the two most important
grape<00:02:02.829> varieties<00:02:03.369> coming<00:02:03.999> from<00:02:04.149> the<00:02:04.270> Napa

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
grape varieties coming from the Napa

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.599 
grape varieties coming from the Napa
Valley<00:02:04.569> the<00:02:05.530> style<00:02:05.829> that<00:02:06.039> we<00:02:06.159> are<00:02:06.249> looking<00:02:06.369> for

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
Valley the style that we are looking for

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:10.289 
Valley the style that we are looking for
is<00:02:07.679> certainly<00:02:08.679> a<00:02:08.890> California<00:02:09.759> Napa<00:02:10.000> Valley

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
is certainly a California Napa Valley

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:11.820 
is certainly a California Napa Valley
style<00:02:10.720> because

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
style because

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.280 
style because
we<00:02:11.890> are<00:02:12.070> growing<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.700> grapes<00:02:13.090> from<00:02:13.570> that<00:02:13.840> area

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
we are growing the grapes from that area

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.220 
we are growing the grapes from that area
but<00:02:14.800> also<00:02:15.100> I<00:02:15.790> think<00:02:16.000> it's<00:02:16.390> very<00:02:16.540> important<00:02:17.110> to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
but also I think it's very important to

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.180 
but also I think it's very important to
have<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:18.220> philosophy<00:02:18.550> of<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:20.320> old<00:02:20.530> world<00:02:20.800> and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
have the philosophy of the old world and

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.810 
have the philosophy of the old world and
in<00:02:21.700> our<00:02:21.880> case<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:23.020> Italian<00:02:23.620> County<00:02:24.190> classical

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
in our case the Italian County classical

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.890 
in our case the Italian County classical
the<00:02:25.270> new<00:02:25.780> world<00:02:26.050> in<00:02:26.290> this<00:02:26.470> case<00:02:26.820> means<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:28.360> very

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
the new world in this case means a very

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.280 
the new world in this case means a very
powerful<00:02:29.370> wine<00:02:30.600> but<00:02:31.600> it<00:02:31.840> has<00:02:32.050> the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
powerful wine but it has the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.530 
powerful wine but it has the
characteristics<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.310> old<00:02:33.490> world<00:02:33.820> which

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
characteristics of the old world which

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.540 
characteristics of the old world which
is<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.870> finesse<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.590> elegance<00:02:35.980> it's

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
is the finesse and the elegance it's

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.280 
is the finesse and the elegance it's
like<00:02:36.700> an<00:02:36.850> elegant<00:02:37.240> woman<00:02:37.360> it's<00:02:38.110> very

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
like an elegant woman it's very

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.800 
like an elegant woman it's very
difficult<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:39.160> describe<00:02:39.820> her<00:02:39.940> but<00:02:40.270> she<00:02:40.510> can<00:02:40.690> be

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
difficult to describe her but she can be

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.560 
difficult to describe her but she can be
extremely<00:02:41.230> elegant<00:02:41.530> so<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.940> would<00:02:43.360> say

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
extremely elegant so I would say

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.260 
extremely elegant so I would say
structure<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.440> elegance<00:02:44.890> together<00:02:45.310> combined

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
structure and elegance together combined

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.350 
structure and elegance together combined
in<00:02:46.450> one<00:02:46.480> wine<00:02:46.810> for<00:02:47.530> us<00:02:47.590> for<00:02:48.310> my<00:02:48.610> sisters<00:02:49.150> and

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
in one wine for us for my sisters and

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.060 
in one wine for us for my sisters and
for<00:02:49.540> myself<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:50.200> obviously<00:02:50.530> also<00:02:50.680> for<00:02:50.950> my

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
for myself and obviously also for my

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.449 
for myself and obviously also for my
father<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:52.000> have<00:02:52.180> our<00:02:52.540> name<00:02:52.959> on<00:02:52.990> the<00:02:53.410> bottle<00:02:54.280> is

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
father to have our name on the bottle is

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.870 
father to have our name on the bottle is
a<00:02:54.520> big<00:02:55.240> responsibility<00:02:55.860> because<00:02:56.860> it<00:02:57.550> has<00:02:57.700> been

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
a big responsibility because it has been

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.020 
a big responsibility because it has been
built<00:02:58.150> in<00:02:58.420> more<00:02:58.690> than<00:02:58.840> 600<00:02:59.140> years<00:02:59.650> so<00:03:00.340> there's

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
built in more than 600 years so there's

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.420 
built in more than 600 years so there's
a<00:03:01.090> long<00:03:01.330> history<00:03:01.810> behind<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.350> but<00:03:02.830> it's<00:03:03.010> also<00:03:03.250> a

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
a long history behind it but it's also a

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.760 
a long history behind it but it's also a
great<00:03:03.520> challenge<00:03:04.090> because<00:03:04.420> there's<00:03:05.350> a<00:03:05.440> lot<00:03:05.590> to

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
great challenge because there's a lot to

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.610 
great challenge because there's a lot to
do<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.160> maintain<00:03:06.760> what<00:03:07.060> has<00:03:07.209> been<00:03:07.390> done<00:03:07.660> and<00:03:07.930> to
