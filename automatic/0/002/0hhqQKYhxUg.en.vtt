also kind of want to stay where his left
arm<00:02:18.530> is<00:02:18.740> so<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:19.100> can<00:02:19.340> dodge<00:02:19.520> his<00:02:19.880> sword<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:20.780> lot

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
arm is so you can dodge his sword a lot

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.840 
arm is so you can dodge his sword a lot
easier<00:02:21.170> simply<00:02:22.040> because<00:02:22.250> his<00:02:22.430> sword<00:02:22.670> has<00:02:22.820> a

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
easier simply because his sword has a

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.790 
easier simply because his sword has a
huge<00:02:23.240> hit<00:02:23.510> box<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.080> sometimes<00:02:24.500> you'll<00:02:24.680> be

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
huge hit box and sometimes you'll be

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.320 
huge hit box and sometimes you'll be
really<00:02:25.040> surprised<00:02:25.430> about<00:02:25.640> how<00:02:25.700> you<00:02:25.820> got<00:02:26.090> hit

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
really surprised about how you got hit

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.180 
really surprised about how you got hit
you<00:02:27.080> want<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.260> be<00:02:27.350> very<00:02:27.470> careful<00:02:27.740> when<00:02:28.040> you

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
you want to be very careful when you

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.460 
you want to be very careful when you
heal<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.150> take<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.660> sip<00:02:29.900> from<00:02:29.990> your<00:02:30.110> Estus

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
heal it and take a sip from your Estus

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.530 
heal it and take a sip from your Estus
flask<00:02:30.710> because<00:02:31.430> he<00:02:31.550> also<00:02:31.700> has<00:02:31.940> a<00:02:31.970> stomp<00:02:32.270> attack

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
flask because he also has a stomp attack

00:02:32.540 --> 00:03:01.630 
flask because he also has a stomp attack
which<00:02:32.750> is<00:02:32.870> pretty<00:02:33.230> difficult<00:02:33.500> to<00:02:33.800> dodge

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.250
