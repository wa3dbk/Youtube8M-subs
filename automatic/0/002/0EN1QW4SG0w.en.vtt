00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:11.519
 People are feeling a death instinct. 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.599
 here is my kitchen in the course of 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.690
 work 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.779
 Look at this detail 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.699
 today is the day to be installed 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.619
 the bench here and the marble 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.470
 simply did not deliver and said that 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.710
 It would take another three days to deliver 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.160
 I freaked out and canceled now what I 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.090
 I have a kitchen like that. 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.000
 You see, and from now on I'm going 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.210
 start receiving marble works again 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.640
 at home to take the measurements to the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.840
 close some then until I can 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.500
 I have no kitchen, no stove, no sink. 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.149
 neither water nor anything is the situation with 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.809
 the version if of me 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.809
 kiss 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.590
 Hi, I'm going to shoot today, taking advantage of that. 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.250
 works at home even though it is not over 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.620
 still because you already know right here at home 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.390
 the whole installment has been waiting to finish 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.160
 I will not be able to do it in ten years. 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.420
 shoot this for you 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.140
 So here is my workbench. 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.350
 kitchen 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.190
 the bench is ready now the 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.240
 Details 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.040
 so the top cabinet was tapped 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.590
 of the previous kitchen 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.150
 missing the details just to end there 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.660
 on 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.830
 that shelf there on the side will not 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.300
 stay that way but still only before 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.759
 reused from the previous kitchen 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.030
 but it will enter a niche nicely legal 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:55.030
 like when the new ovens come in 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.700
 because in reality I go I go 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.090
 microwave oven I 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.850
 I have today that it is no longer so 100% 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.000
 and I'm going to get rid of the electric 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.350
 I have today I'm going to have a single oven that does 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.470
 the two functions 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.650
 and there's going to be a niche just to have the 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.750
 two things and for the projects 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.860
 domestic appliances that are on top will also 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.850
 be it a mobile only aa bench was 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.880
 like this 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:29.450
 here we have the mirror tiles 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.060
 that stayed like this 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.080
 Ana account you already see that you still have one 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:40.400
 neighbor adjustment to do below is 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.540
 It was really door to run of chain 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.160
 black minimum 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:49.519
 down here the cellar is quiet nothing 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.769
 kitchen type pan plastic containers 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.260
 these things like that 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.700
 It's the dishwasher, it's all going. 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.560
 down here dishwasher not 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.989
 arrived is going to be installed down here 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.150
 will also be hidden and cellar 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.890
 jataÃ­ is already installed but food is 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.370
 ugly I will not show later I 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.650
 an outlet which, for the 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.730
 operation, I'll be fine in the 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.890
 because it will not end 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.610
 appearing because this here really shows 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.720
 fan or my hand and here look at mine 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.849
 hand on the wall 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.849
 see mirror mirror anyway 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.950
 This godmother is very cool. 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:27.799
 so here is a part of the bench in 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.970
 workbench for work 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:34.670
 there is a little gulp on the bench 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.850
 even though there is a little bit of 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.600
 starts from the look of the bench 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:46.100
 There in this wet part I have two 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:50.269
 curves down here has one that is with the 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:54.340
 lid and here is the other one that has crockery 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:58.310
 I already said I was filming today yet 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.190
 so disheveled then did not shoot and then 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.250
 here has been highlighted below is a 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.630
 but I do not 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.769
 I'll never use this, so it's a 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.769
 teaching slalom 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:15.419
 second one that rises and then in that 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.729
 second comes the second part 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:22.150
 that the means 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.740
 cooktops I opted for two 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.259
 one mouth each 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.810
 I found it better than a little top only 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:31.060
 two-burner or a large cooktop I know 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.610
 Well, I thought it was better this way. 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.479
 and these cooktops they they are loose in the 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.900
 so if I saw here, 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:43.720
 I tried to sell are only embedded I 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.479
 Can I take some to burn anything? 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.190
 so I can draw here such an adjustment that 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.940
 I said look, it's missing in the 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:55.720
 wall there at low readjustment of the hand 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.099
 French still has a French here 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.340
 so black here lacked adjustment 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:02.199
 mirror because that part here had 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.190
 that being cut to size then goes 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:11.759
 arrive still need to put this so only 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:17.840
 so did my kitchen counter 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:23.010
 here is a chair, a bench, right? 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:25.620
 for when you're cooking husband 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.630
 stay here on the side drinking wine from him 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:32.360
 or when he is cooking and staying 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:35.520
 waiting for something ready 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.770
 something to get ready to drink wine 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.900
 from him in this bank I opted for the 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.350
 red because the kitchen is all black well 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:46.470
 and white then red will give a 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:50.010
 broken nail and then the doors then 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:54.810
 they stayed in the president is this stayed like this 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:59.550
 so my workbench and I did not have one 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:04.170
 avc in the course of leza people hour 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:06.930
 have everything and literally I 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.880
 I'll show you yours again when 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.430
 have everything installed everything right 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.790
 i show it to you again but at least 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.410
 the less I pay now and if this video that 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.980
 I have owed for months 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.980
 kiss
