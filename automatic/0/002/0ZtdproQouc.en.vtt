00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:07.350
 Hello everyone, today I would like to 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.050
 tell you how to whiten your teeth 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.940
 at home with the help of strips and 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.549
 this method is really very 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.139
 effective and if you are interested in a project 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.510
 listen if you are interested to listen 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.310
 about bleaching, then of course stay 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.619
 because you know what teeth can 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.140
 whiten in the clinic now you can do it all 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.439
 done quickly but i think all the same 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.970
 teeth will be damaged more yes not 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.920
 I know it personally, my some such 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.530
 conviction write me true this or 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.120
 no, maybe someone will dispel my myth 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.500
 or 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.300
 tell me this is a myth or not i know what 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.510
 after whiten your teeth in 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.770
 dentistry and teeth hurt and do it 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.980
 quickly but my teeth hurt after that for a long time 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.780
 I don't know comparatively , I say 1 2 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.090
 probably caught but this pain here 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.219
 it is in the gums because but it is impossible 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.379
 glue strips on the gums can not stick 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.539
 no way if you buy here 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.300
 this is the system and not necessarily this 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.350
 and thought it was all systems 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.689
 spreads all the same two times I 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.850
 touched the odious strip and yes I have 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.580
 principle, constantly sick from the bottom, I do not 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.689
 I know as a tag yes that is at the top 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.670
 parts of the mouth well , my jaw is not my jaw 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.310
 everything was sick individually 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.229
 someone has very, very strong teeth 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.390
 to enamel good everything is good there yes and 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.119
 gums can not hurt at all teeth can 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.159
 it to throw at all and you can do it all 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.119
 calmly move and your teeth will be 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.630
 whites all be well 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.670
 some teeth still have gingival teeth 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.280
 still sensitive yes and of course 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.740
 some discomfort will be after this 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.079
 here are the systems but everything here is individual 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.149
 so I can't tell you guys u 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.250
 your teeth wo n't hurt anyone either 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.200
 guys and the teeth here this system will be 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.180
 I hurt like I do not know that I can not here 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.780
 argue here on my teeth was here 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.119
 so two or three times probably sick 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.520
 it's me how I did I stopped up 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.649
 points just probably 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.200
 Yes, not nearly did these strips and all 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.690
 Everything went away and then I re- started the crit 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.250
 In principle , everything here is just it probably 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.220
 one of the main advantages is that you 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.800
 do it step by step and if you can 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.860
 become wait and this will all pass 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.440
 and you will begin to whiten the effect of 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.420
 of these strips remains for a year that is you 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.549
 be patient if your teeth will still 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.150
 get sick but I don't know 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:31.790
 moms they poboyle I tell you honestly 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.709
 but she just says she got on 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.900
 gums still so small sovetik 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.450
 still when you do bleach 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.650
 any yes that is in dentistry and here 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.190
 by these strips 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.670
 enamel is erased and pray is lost enamel 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.290
 bare as you want it call and 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.720
 Of course, I need to work it out. 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.510
 I advise as all dentists probably 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.269
 I advise you to eat cottage cheese I drink kefir in short 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.090
 I need calcium and I think the best 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.459
 what you can do and so worth it 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.890
 This is very helpful in the first place. I know that 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.780
 many do not like cottage cheese but for the sake of beauty 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.790
 can and by the way tell you very much so 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.670
 interesting thing I heard it in 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.440
 good morning program there i'm lera chkalov 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.049
 turn in that cooks forever and she 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.230
 said such a thing that bold cottage cheese is not 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.989
 so much calcium in the fat free 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.290
 there is yes this is such a fact and I think that 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:27.109
 so there is a little cottage cheese there is little of course 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:31.310
 Fat is high and calcium is less. 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:33.260
 if less fat then more rings and so 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.290
 stripes themselves look like this 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.380
 here comes the top to the part that is 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.480
 upper teeth upper jaw and lower 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.489
 jaw there need smaller i can warehouse 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.340
 that you can use this system 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.859
 let's say two of course if you have teeth 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.109
 I have small teeth, I think that 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.970
 small enjoyed with mom if teeth 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.200
 little then 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.819
 just cut in half and glue 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.760
 halves yes that is half up 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.010
 half for the lower teeth that I 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.159
 said the man who gave me these 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.409
 stripes he said the result 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.569
 persists for a year yes I already said about 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.519
 This said that you should not do before bedtime 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.489
 I can say that the result to me 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.680
 I really, really liked the course 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.359
 that these are just stripes but they 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.709
 work really really cool to me 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.889
 really like my teeth 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.229
 sometimes it seems to me that damn bleaching and 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.400
 Belyaev abundance and the result is generally zero 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:32.710
 finally can finally zero but in fact 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.590
 under different lighting everything is different i 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.020
 I look in the hallway and stand with me 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.060
 teeth damn yellow life of course when I'm in 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.250
 any fittings yes from me 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.620
 just tooth white is it generally it's just 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.500
 the shaft my teeth were never in 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:51.550
 principle yellow because genetics 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.470
 thank you mom thank you dad but I can 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.660
 say that all the same was such a raid and 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.090
 these strips removed it now from me mine 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.940
 teeth really like and I think that they 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.880
 well separated from whiteness 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.979
 well these strips worked advise you 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.960
 if you want to try to whiten your teeth 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:10.120
 I say not necessarily cross on 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.280
 Excuse me I checked so yes thanks 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.280
