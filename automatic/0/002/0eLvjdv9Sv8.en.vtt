one of our ways to make it happen there
is<00:02:54.560> this<00:02:54.740> effect<00:02:55.100> where<00:02:55.340> because<00:02:55.760> the

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
is this effect where because the

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.580 
is this effect where because the
information<00:02:56.180> is<00:02:56.540> getting<00:02:56.750> better<00:02:57.020> as<00:02:57.290> we<00:02:57.440> have

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
information is getting better as we have

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.530 
information is getting better as we have
more<00:02:57.800> users<00:02:58.160> that<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.850> just<00:02:59.030> keeps<00:02:59.240> continuing

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
more users that it just keeps continuing

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.770 
more users that it just keeps continuing
to<00:02:59.900> grow<00:03:00.050> as<00:03:00.410> many<00:03:00.830> ways<00:03:01.160> is<00:03:01.370> that<00:03:01.550> we<00:03:01.700> have<00:03:01.910> the

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
to grow as many ways is that we have the

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
more dismember grows what efficient and

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.500 
more dismember grows what efficient and
more<00:03:05.990> defeat<00:03:06.980> this<00:03:07.190> tool<00:03:07.550> will<00:03:07.790> work<00:03:07.820> for<00:03:08.420> the

better<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.630> data<00:03:14.810> is<00:03:15.050> that<00:03:15.620> means<00:03:15.890> that<00:03:16.160> we

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
better the data is that means that we

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.890 
better the data is that means that we
can<00:03:16.400> not<00:03:16.520> just<00:03:16.700> save<00:03:16.850> each<00:03:17.090> individual<00:03:17.690> time

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
can not just save each individual time

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.570 
can not just save each individual time
but<00:03:18.380> look<00:03:18.500> at<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.710> city<00:03:18.890> as<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.160> whole

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
but look at the city as a whole

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.670 
but look at the city as a whole
and<00:03:19.670> this<00:03:20.120> is<00:03:20.570> already<00:03:20.810> think<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.290> next<00:03:21.500> part

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
and this is already think the next part

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.790 
and this is already think the next part
of<00:03:21.740> our<00:03:21.860> evolution<00:03:22.370> really<00:03:22.490> lies
