00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.330 
she's black with white try and show you
how<00:01:06.990> big<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.740> total<00:01:09.950> so<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.130> pretty

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
how big it is in total so it's a pretty

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.760 
how big it is in total so it's a pretty
decent<00:01:11.549> size<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.320> size<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.650> it

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
decent size I like the size of it

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.510 
decent size I like the size of it
anyways<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.700> fabric<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:16.229> pretty<00:01:17.189> thin

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
anyways the fabric is a pretty thin

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.160 
anyways the fabric is a pretty thin
fabric<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.509> might<00:01:18.659> not<00:01:18.810> think<00:01:18.840> that's<00:01:19.110> a

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
fabric and you might not think that's a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.260 
fabric and you might not think that's a
good<00:01:19.320> thing<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.100> actually<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.670> it's<00:01:21.030> not

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
good thing but it actually is it's not

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.609 
good thing but it actually is it's not
thin<00:01:21.540> enough<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.140> see<00:01:22.320> through<00:01:22.590> it

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
thin enough that you can see through it

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.020 
thin enough that you can see through it
so<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.860> don't<00:01:23.040> need<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.250> worry<00:01:23.400> about<00:01:23.460> that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
so you don't need to worry about that

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.940 
so you don't need to worry about that
but<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:24.840> thin<00:01:25.020> enough<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.740> summer

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
but it's thin enough that in this summer

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.620 
but it's thin enough that in this summer
like<00:01:26.430> obviously<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.850> had<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> child<00:01:27.330> at<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> end

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
like obviously I had a child at the end

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.330

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.690 
that you just link the fabric through
and<00:01:42.180> then<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.570> tighten<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.649> or<00:01:44.159> loosen<00:01:44.189> it

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
and then you can tighten it or loosen it

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.370 
and then you can tighten it or loosen it
depending<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.240> how<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.509> want<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.990> around<00:01:46.140> your

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
depending on how you want it around your

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.859 
depending on how you want it around your
neck<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:48.030> then<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.450> put<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.750> around

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
neck and then you just put it around

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.590 
neck and then you just put it around
your<00:01:49.079> neck<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:50.299> with<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.420> baby

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
your neck like so with the baby

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.240 
your neck like so with the baby
underneath<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.590> then<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.710> can

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
underneath and then you can

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.870 
underneath and then you can
see<00:01:53.640> your<00:01:53.820> baby<00:01:54.030> because<00:01:54.360> there<00:01:54.690> is<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.370> a<00:01:56.370> wire

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
see your baby because there is a a wire

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.810 
see your baby because there is a a wire
like<00:01:57.720> I<00:01:58.140> don't<00:01:58.950> know<00:01:59.010> how<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.220> describe<00:01:59.430> this

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
like I don't know how you describe this

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.630 
like I don't know how you describe this
a<00:02:00.090> bendy<00:02:00.870> wire<00:02:01.080> like<00:02:01.500> it's<00:02:01.650> flexible<00:02:02.160> you<00:02:02.610> can

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
a bendy wire like it's flexible you can

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.910 
a bendy wire like it's flexible you can
bend<00:02:02.940> it<00:02:03.090> how<00:02:03.270> much<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.780> want<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:04.350> there's

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
bend it how much you want but there's

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.100 
bend it how much you want but there's
that<00:02:05.100> within<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.580> collar<00:02:05.790> here<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.960> it

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
that within the collar here so that it

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.930 
that within the collar here so that it
sticks<00:02:07.380> out<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.620> bit<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.430> can<00:02:08.580> see<00:02:08.790> your

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
sticks out a bit so you can see your

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.330 
sticks out a bit so you can see your
baby<00:02:09.090> your<00:02:09.509> baby<00:02:09.540> can<00:02:09.960> see<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.440> while<00:02:11.160> you're

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
baby your baby can see you while you're

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.910 
baby your baby can see you while you're
nursing<00:02:11.490> that's<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.510> idea<00:02:12.810> anyhow<00:02:13.200> so<00:02:13.680> again

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
nursing that's the idea anyhow so again

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.260 
nursing that's the idea anyhow so again
you<00:02:14.070> can<00:02:14.190> tighten<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.610> loosen<00:02:14.760> this<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:16.080> I

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
you can tighten and loosen this so I

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.460 
you can tighten and loosen this so I
think<00:02:18.270> that's<00:02:18.570> pretty<00:02:18.780> much<00:02:18.900> all<00:02:19.170> about<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
think that's pretty much all about the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.140 
think that's pretty much all about the
outer<00:02:19.620> cover<00:02:19.890> it's<00:02:20.160> just<00:02:20.370> one<00:02:20.640> layer<00:02:20.910> of

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
outer cover it's just one layer of

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.600 
outer cover it's just one layer of
fabric<00:02:21.360> there's<00:02:21.870> no<00:02:22.590> other<00:02:22.830> fabric<00:02:23.340> on<00:02:23.490> the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
fabric there's no other fabric on the

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.880 
fabric there's no other fabric on the
back<00:02:23.840> but<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:24.870> really<00:02:25.200> like<00:02:25.410> this<00:02:25.620> cover

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
back but I really like this cover

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.080 
back but I really like this cover
because<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:28.250> boning<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.400> guess<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.730> call<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.030> I

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
because the boning I guess you call it I

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.970 
because the boning I guess you call it I
don't<00:02:30.240> know<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.690> metal<00:02:30.990> part<00:02:31.260> that's<00:02:31.530> inside

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
don't know the metal part that's inside

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
don't know the metal part that's inside
is<00:02:33.800> really<00:02:35.600> rigid<00:02:36.920> yet<00:02:37.920> flexible<00:02:38.190> how<00:02:38.880> do<00:02:38.940> I

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
is really rigid yet flexible how do I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.830 
is really rigid yet flexible how do I
describe<00:02:39.270> this<00:02:39.560> it<00:02:40.560> states<00:02:40.950> out<00:02:41.360> okay<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:42.390> some

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
describe this it states out okay so some

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.090 
describe this it states out okay so some
nursing<00:02:43.230> covers<00:02:43.500> like<00:02:43.650> what<00:02:43.800> I'm<00:02:43.890> going<00:02:44.040> to

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
nursing covers like what I'm going to

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.640 
nursing covers like what I'm going to
show<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:45.120> metal<00:02:45.570> part<00:02:45.870> on<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.080> inside<00:02:46.470> is

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
show you the metal part on the inside is

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.650 
show you the metal part on the inside is
heavier<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.520> tends<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:48.000> fall<00:02:48.270> down<00:02:48.450> like

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
heavier so it tends to fall down like

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.080 
heavier so it tends to fall down like
this<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.380> that's<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.190> problem<00:02:50.370> because<00:02:50.700> then

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
this and that's a problem because then

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.720 
this and that's a problem because then
you<00:02:51.630> can<00:02:51.780> see<00:02:51.900> your<00:02:52.020> boot<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.860> this<00:02:53.340> one's<00:02:53.580> a

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
you can see your boot so this one's a

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.830 
you can see your boot so this one's a
lighter<00:02:54.290> yet<00:02:55.290> stiff<00:02:55.700> metal<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:57.060> really<00:02:57.690> hope

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
lighter yet stiff metal I really hope

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.240 
lighter yet stiff metal I really hope
I'm<00:02:57.959> just<00:02:58.110> grabbing<00:02:58.380> this<00:02:58.500> right<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:58.980> like

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
I'm just grabbing this right so I like

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.759 
I'm just grabbing this right so I like
it<00:02:59.400> cuz<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.730> sticks<00:02:59.970> away<00:03:00.630> from<00:03:00.900> me<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:01.500> nobody

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
it cuz it sticks away from me so nobody

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.160 
it cuz it sticks away from me so nobody
else<00:03:01.950> can<00:03:02.280> see<00:03:02.519> what's<00:03:03.300> going<00:03:03.570> on<00:03:03.660> but<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:03.930> can

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.460 
one I have looks like this was a super
cute<00:03:15.540> print<00:03:16.080> this<00:03:16.500> is<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:17.989> it's<00:03:18.989> C<00:03:19.350> ritzy<00:03:20.420> and

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
the reason I got this although I didn't

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.190 
the reason I got this although I didn't
really<00:03:24.060> need<00:03:24.180> another<00:03:24.299> nursing<00:03:24.900> cover

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200

cover and I don't know if I'm just not
using<00:05:01.120> it<00:05:01.360> right<00:05:01.509> but<00:05:02.380> as<00:05:03.039> you<00:05:03.849> can<00:05:03.970> see<00:05:04.320> it

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.770 
using it right but as you can see it
always<00:05:05.500> tends<00:05:05.830> to<00:05:06.039> fall<00:05:06.280> like<00:05:06.460> this<00:05:06.729> and<00:05:07.330> I<00:05:07.539> try

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
always tends to fall like this and I try

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.529 
always tends to fall like this and I try
and<00:05:07.810> prop<00:05:08.139> it<00:05:08.169> back<00:05:08.470> up<00:05:09.000> but<00:05:10.000> then<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.270> weight

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
and prop it back up but then the weight

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.830 
and prop it back up but then the weight
of<00:05:11.229> this<00:05:11.560> makes<00:05:12.550> it<00:05:12.669> fall<00:05:12.909> back<00:05:13.120> like<00:05:13.150> this<00:05:13.479> and

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
of this makes it fall back like this and

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.529 
of this makes it fall back like this and
obviously<00:05:13.990> I'm<00:05:14.560> nursing<00:05:15.300> you're<00:05:16.300> gonna<00:05:16.389> be

obviously I'm nursing you're gonna be

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:18.439 
obviously I'm nursing you're gonna be
able<00:05:16.690> to<00:05:16.750> see<00:05:16.870> my<00:05:16.990> boob<00:05:17.139> which<00:05:17.860> is<00:05:18.070> not<00:05:18.280> great

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
able to see my boob which is not great

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.659 
able to see my boob which is not great
no<00:05:19.449> what<00:05:19.630> you<00:05:19.780> want<00:05:19.930> even<00:05:20.889> if<00:05:20.979> I<00:05:21.070> tighten<00:05:21.340> it<00:05:21.550> up

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
no what you want even if I tighten it up

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.510 
no what you want even if I tighten it up
it<00:05:22.599> doesn't<00:05:22.840> seem<00:05:22.990> to<00:05:23.169> stay<00:05:23.440> like<00:05:23.740> this<00:05:23.979> class

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
it doesn't seem to stay like this class

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.430 
it doesn't seem to stay like this class
I<00:05:25.000> guess<00:05:25.479> because<00:05:25.659> this<00:05:25.900> is<00:05:25.990> such<00:05:26.110> a<00:05:26.139> soft

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
I guess because this is such a soft

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.909 
I guess because this is such a soft
material<00:05:27.039> it<00:05:27.759> just<00:05:27.820> slides<00:05:28.300> really<00:05:29.199> easy<00:05:29.409> so

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
material it just slides really easy so

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.560 
material it just slides really easy so
it<00:05:30.070> just<00:05:30.250> comes<00:05:30.430> undone<00:05:30.789> again<00:05:30.940> if<00:05:31.210> your<00:05:31.330> child

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
it just comes undone again if your child

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.570 
it just comes undone again if your child
moves<00:05:31.840> this<00:05:32.110> at<00:05:32.289> all<00:05:32.530> they're<00:05:33.490> gonna

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
moves this at all they're gonna

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.180 
moves this at all they're gonna
completely<00:05:34.030> expose<00:05:34.539> you<00:05:34.810> so<00:05:35.590> again<00:05:36.039> I'm

00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:29.189 
basically I'll show you how big it is so

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:31.369 
basically I'll show you how big it is so
it's<00:06:29.759> not<00:06:29.879> quite<00:06:30.150> as<00:06:30.270> wide<00:06:30.569> as<00:06:30.870> the<00:06:30.900> other<00:06:31.110> ones

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:31.379 
it's not quite as wide as the other ones

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:34.999 
it's not quite as wide as the other ones
but<00:06:32.129> it<00:06:32.249> is<00:06:32.400> early<00:06:32.759> darn<00:06:33.089> long<00:06:33.270> I<00:06:33.830> really<00:06:34.830> like

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:35.009 
but it is early darn long I really like

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:36.499 
but it is early darn long I really like
the<00:06:35.129> fabric<00:06:35.550> too<00:06:35.699> that's<00:06:35.909> why<00:06:36.059> I<00:06:36.089> bought<00:06:36.300> it<00:06:36.330> I

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:36.509 
the fabric too that's why I bought it I

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:37.820 
the fabric too that's why I bought it I
think<00:06:36.689> it<00:06:36.779> was<00:06:36.870> like<00:06:37.050> three<00:06:37.349> dollars<00:06:37.680> or

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
think it was like three dollars or

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.829 
think it was like three dollars or
something<00:06:38.129> really<00:06:38.339> really<00:06:38.520> cheap<00:06:38.819> and<00:06:39.599> I<00:06:39.659> just

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:39.839 
something really really cheap and I just

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:41.929 
something really really cheap and I just
thought<00:06:39.930> it<00:06:40.080> could<00:06:40.199> be<00:06:40.289> an<00:06:40.349> extra<00:06:40.680> one<00:06:40.710> for<00:06:40.939> how

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:43.519 
thought it could be an extra one for how
they're<00:06:42.089> at<00:06:42.180> home<00:06:42.360> or<00:06:42.419> my<00:06:42.779> diaper<00:06:42.990> bag<00:06:43.110> or

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:28.040 
don't even know where you can buy this
one<00:07:26.759> but<00:07:26.999> there's<00:07:27.209> a<00:07:27.270> lot<00:07:27.389> of<00:07:27.479> people<00:07:27.629> who<00:07:27.839> make

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.050 
one but there's a lot of people who make

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.019 
one but there's a lot of people who make
them<00:07:28.319> so<00:07:28.589> that's<00:07:28.830> what<00:07:29.009> I<00:07:29.159> look<00:07:29.310> for<00:07:29.550> just<00:07:29.819> one

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:30.029 
them so that's what I look for just one

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:32.959 
them so that's what I look for just one
with<00:07:30.300> like<00:07:30.539> a<00:07:30.569> shorter<00:07:31.139> window<00:07:31.680> I<00:07:31.860> guess<00:07:32.249> not<00:07:32.879> a

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:32.969 
with like a shorter window I guess not a

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:36.379 
with like a shorter window I guess not a
super-heavy<00:07:33.629> nursing<00:07:34.349> cover<00:07:35.180> so<00:07:36.180> that<00:07:36.330> you

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:36.389 
super-heavy nursing cover so that you

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:37.820 
super-heavy nursing cover so that you
don't<00:07:36.569> expose<00:07:36.870> yourself<00:07:37.289> and<00:07:37.529> so<00:07:37.620> that<00:07:37.740> your

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:37.830 
don't expose yourself and so that your

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.549 
don't expose yourself and so that your
child<00:07:38.099> does<00:07:38.339> not<00:07:38.370> cook<00:07:38.819> underneath<00:07:39.449> so<00:07:40.259> those

00:07:40.549 --> 00:07:40.559 
child does not cook underneath so those

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:43.070 
child does not cook underneath so those
are<00:07:40.680> the<00:07:40.740> three<00:07:40.949> I<00:07:40.979> have<00:07:41.249> um<00:07:42.149> if<00:07:42.839> you<00:07:42.930> have<00:07:43.050> any

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.749 
are the three I have um if you have any
