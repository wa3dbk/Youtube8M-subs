ribbons cube OD which increases her
already<00:00:27.119> great<00:00:27.420> mobility<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.140> is

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
already great mobility and this is

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.019 
already great mobility and this is
pretty<00:00:28.560> much<00:00:28.650> letting<00:00:28.980> her<00:00:29.160> jump<00:00:29.460> over<00:00:29.760> walls

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
pretty much letting her jump over walls

here's<00:00:32.610> another<00:00:32.790> interesting<00:00:32.969> one<00:00:33.420> broken

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
here's another interesting one broken

here's another interesting one broken
wings<00:00:34.200> -<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.710> very<00:00:34.950> useful<00:00:35.250> when<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.489> comes<00:00:35.670> to

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
wings - is very useful when it comes to

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.040 
wings - is very useful when it comes to
trying<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.149> speed<00:00:36.420> up<00:00:36.450> your<00:00:36.690> movement<00:00:37.020> speed

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
trying to speed up your movement speed

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.110 
trying to speed up your movement speed
training<00:00:37.559> maybe<00:00:37.680> run<00:00:37.920> away<00:00:38.190> chase<00:00:38.610> someone<00:00:38.879> or

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
training maybe run away chase someone or

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.639 
training maybe run away chase someone or
just<00:00:39.300> get<00:00:39.420> back<00:00:39.570> into<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.899> lane<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:40.410> did<00:00:40.530> you

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
just get back into the lane but did you

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.350 
just get back into the lane but did you
know<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> Q<00:00:41.430> speed<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.910> offers<00:00:42.239> you

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
know that the Q speed that it offers you

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.549 
know that the Q speed that it offers you
in<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.540> movement<00:00:42.840> speed<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.020> pretty<00:00:43.350> much

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
in the movement speed is pretty much

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.490 
in the movement speed is pretty much
worth<00:00:43.829> about<00:00:44.149> 475<00:00:45.149> mu<00:00:45.539> speeds<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.230> means

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
worth about 475 mu speeds this means

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.130 
worth about 475 mu speeds this means
that<00:00:46.620> also<00:00:46.800> if<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.430> are<00:00:47.640> around<00:00:47.969> 550<00:00:48.600> or<00:00:48.780> over

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
that also if you are around 550 or over

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.540 
that also if you are around 550 or over
base<00:00:49.410> movement<00:00:49.710> speed<00:00:49.890> such<00:00:50.160> as<00:00:50.309> maybe

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
base movement speed such as maybe

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.250 
base movement speed such as maybe
getting<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.969> from<00:00:51.210> Home<00:00:51.660> Guard<00:00:51.899> boots<00:00:52.140> or

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
getting it from Home Guard boots or

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.410 
getting it from Home Guard boots or
something<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> sort<00:00:53.100> using<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.940> Q<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.239> try

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
something of the sort using the Q to try

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.150 
something of the sort using the Q to try
and<00:00:54.510> move<00:00:54.629> yourself<00:00:55.050> faster<00:00:55.530> will<00:00:55.680> actually

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
and move yourself faster will actually

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.250 
and move yourself faster will actually
end<00:00:56.309> up<00:00:56.430> slowing<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.850> down<00:00:56.879> instead<00:00:57.449> Riven

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
end up slowing you down instead Riven

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.779 
end up slowing you down instead Riven
has<00:00:58.440> one<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.739> strongest<00:00:58.800> passes<00:00:59.489> when<00:00:59.670> it

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
has one of the strongest passes when it

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.760 
has one of the strongest passes when it
comes<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.180> lane<00:01:00.420> pressure<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.989> being<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.500> bully

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
comes to lane pressure and being a bully

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.590 
comes to lane pressure and being a bully
but<00:01:02.250> did<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.489> know<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.910> passive<00:01:03.329> will

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
but did you know that the passive will

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.420 
but did you know that the passive will
refresh<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.140> timer<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.890> stack<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.339> you

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
refresh the timer on the stack so you

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.550 
refresh the timer on the stack so you
have<00:01:05.640> waiting<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.360> be<00:01:06.479> used<00:01:06.750> such<00:01:07.140> as<00:01:07.170> if<00:01:07.470> you

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
have waiting to be used such as if you

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.620 
have waiting to be used such as if you
gain<00:01:07.740> another<00:01:07.860> one<00:01:08.220> or<00:01:08.430> if<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.820> use<00:01:09.030> one<00:01:09.299> this

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
gain another one or if you use one this

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.940 
gain another one or if you use one this
is<00:01:09.780> important<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> remember<00:01:10.380> because<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.860> will

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950
