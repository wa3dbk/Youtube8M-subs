00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:03.940
 so but here you can and replace the month did 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.940
 standards 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.950
 make a font of up to 72 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:31.020
 such for example what color can 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.020
 do for example 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.270
 such 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.910
 look at the screen, select functions 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:55.470
 what colors can be made 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:55.470
 can make it so 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:10.160
 in russia i don't do it i could 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:20.680
 regenerate regenerate the light themselves 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:22.480
 beech so you can still do here and how 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.630
 lengthen the letters 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.630
 mix them up 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:36.350
 and so the effect can do look 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:41.970
 the very first effect gives both an increase 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:51.690
 brightness and contrast a second color of pain 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:53.489
 increases well here and put it all 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:02.360
 here look confused 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:02.360
 for example on the mountain including saw 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:12.870
 here is the text immediately after 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:16.739
 this text do a video if you 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.489
 I think he saw himself as the very picture 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:24.540
 this very long you can move 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:27.410
 its something less to do and those demand 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.410
 bring about a miracle 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.400
 detect here 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.400
 So 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.120
 Well, for example, the text makes such a fog 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.120
 how quickly went 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:57.180
 he neatly takes the horse 17 where 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:04:00.860
 wants to come back and now the video goes on 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:06.709
 the sound can be tuned here 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:09.570
 sound editor customization program 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:15.090
 here you can insert an example of how it will be 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:22.019
 you can go to the video for example here 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:27.240
 There are different 3d functions and functions. 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:28.220
 still need to make effects specifically who 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:36.720
 fits 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:47.030
 music put but it's all done so 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:47.030
 Now save the video here click 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.070
 push this button 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.120
 choose 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:17.699
 default template will be but you 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:19.270
 You can throw in any folder 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:25.840
 here 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:34.169
 you have branches then choose a format 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:38.770
 video in which you shoot 720 so it was 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:44.580
 here what power do you have here I am you 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:51.900
 I advise you to choose this function later 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:51.900
 you donâ€™t need to change here, press ok and 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:06:00.009
 save well and everything is saving after 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:07.889
 of this when you wait you press 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:07.889
 the experience was still me
