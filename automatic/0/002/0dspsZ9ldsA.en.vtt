in so the great thing about support is

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.299 
in so the great thing about support is
that<00:00:40.929> have<00:00:41.019> so<00:00:41.289> many<00:00:41.409> different<00:00:41.769> brands<00:00:42.010> from

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
that have so many different brands from

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.129 
that have so many different brands from
many<00:00:42.729> different<00:00:42.940> price<00:00:43.269> ranges<00:00:43.420> but<00:00:43.809> a<00:00:43.870> lot<00:00:44.109> of

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:44.139 
many different price ranges but a lot of

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:47.099 
many different price ranges but a lot of
them<00:00:44.319> are<00:00:44.499> kind<00:00:44.799> of<00:00:44.859> higher-end<00:00:45.600> prices<00:00:46.600> so

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
them are kind of higher-end prices so

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:48.869 
them are kind of higher-end prices so
starting<00:00:47.769> off<00:00:47.889> with<00:00:48.100> primer<00:00:48.399> I<00:00:48.609> think<00:00:48.789> the

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
starting off with primer I think the

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.309 
starting off with primer I think the
primary<00:00:49.059> is<00:00:49.299> definitely<00:00:49.600> something<00:00:49.809> that<00:00:49.960> is

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:50.319 
primary is definitely something that is

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:52.049 
primary is definitely something that is
worth<00:00:50.589> the<00:00:50.799> splurge<00:00:51.039> because<00:00:51.489> it<00:00:51.639> is<00:00:51.760> kind<00:00:52.030> of

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
worth the splurge because it is kind of

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.660 
worth the splurge because it is kind of
that<00:00:52.209> base<00:00:52.449> for<00:00:52.719> your<00:00:52.870> makeup<00:00:53.589> and<00:00:53.709> something

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
that base for your makeup and something

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.250 
that base for your makeup and something
that<00:00:54.699> keeps<00:00:54.909> it<00:00:55.120> on<00:00:55.179> for<00:00:55.420> a<00:00:55.479> long<00:00:55.629> time<00:00:55.839> so<00:00:56.019> I

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
that keeps it on for a long time so I

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.629 
that keeps it on for a long time so I
have<00:00:56.589> two<00:00:56.739> primers<00:00:56.979> that<00:00:57.159> I<00:00:57.280> love<00:00:57.459> from

personally like to splurge on and would
prefer<00:01:35.380> to<00:01:35.560> splurge<00:01:35.830> on<00:01:36.070> more<00:01:36.340> than<00:01:36.550> say

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
prefer to splurge on more than say

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.490 
prefer to splurge on more than say
concealers<00:01:37.840> which<00:01:37.990> I<00:01:38.050> will<00:01:38.170> talk<00:01:38.200> about<00:01:38.410> later

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
concealers which I will talk about later

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.200 
concealers which I will talk about later
but<00:01:39.010> I<00:01:39.160> definitely<00:01:39.310> find<00:01:39.640> that<00:01:39.730> foundation<00:01:40.120> is

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
but I definitely find that foundation is

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.030 
but I definitely find that foundation is
something<00:01:40.540> that<00:01:40.630> I<00:01:40.810> prefer<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.620> splurge<00:01:41.890> on

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
something that I prefer to splurge on

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.740 
something that I prefer to splurge on
because<00:01:42.340> it<00:01:42.490> is<00:01:42.610> kind<00:01:42.970> of<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.150> base<00:01:43.510> of<00:01:43.540> your

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
because it is kind of the base of your

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.050 
because it is kind of the base of your
makeup<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.200> kind<00:01:44.409> of<00:01:44.470> what<00:01:44.680> the<00:01:45.310> main<00:01:45.700> part<00:01:45.970> of

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
makeup and kind of what the main part of

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.520 
makeup and kind of what the main part of
your<00:01:46.180> makeup<00:01:46.360> is<00:01:46.570> I<00:01:46.780> guess<00:01:46.930> because<00:01:47.080> it<00:01:47.320> gives

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
your makeup is I guess because it gives

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.500 
your makeup is I guess because it gives
your<00:01:47.710> face<00:01:47.800> a<00:01:47.920> nice<00:01:48.159> clean<00:01:48.430> finish<00:01:48.700> so<00:01:49.240> I<00:01:49.270> have

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
your face a nice clean finish so I have

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.090 
your face a nice clean finish so I have

doing my face makeup right now next up I

doing my face makeup right now next up I
would<00:02:39.190> have<00:02:39.280> concealers<00:02:39.850> for<00:02:40.210> me<00:02:40.300> i<00:02:40.330> don't

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
would have concealers for me i don't

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.940 
would have concealers for me i don't
think<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:40.840> concealers<00:02:41.350> are<00:02:41.500> worth<00:02:41.740> the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
think that concealers are worth the

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.350 
think that concealers are worth the
splurge<00:02:42.130> because<00:02:42.550> i<00:02:42.580> find<00:02:42.880> that<00:02:43.090> i<00:02:43.150> don't

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
splurge because i find that i don't

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.420 
splurge because i find that i don't
really<00:02:43.510> use<00:02:43.810> concealer<00:02:44.350> all<00:02:44.560> that<00:02:44.800> often<00:02:45.010> I

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
really use concealer all that often I

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.430 
really use concealer all that often I
don't<00:02:45.670> necessarily<00:02:46.330> need<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.080> so<00:02:47.200> it's<00:02:47.320> not

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
don't necessarily need it so it's not

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.590 
don't necessarily need it so it's not
something<00:02:47.740> that<00:02:47.770> I'm<00:02:47.920> willing<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.160> spend<00:02:48.600> more
