00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.850
 Hello everyone in this video will tell you 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.610
 the volume of which appeared bearded 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.569
 Halonen update which came out 

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:13.439
 thirty first of october 2010 but 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:17.279
 Marina 6 has the opportunity to get into 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.410
 this biome we are multiplayer and 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.759
 of course i'm talking about the lower world or demand 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.200
 home abate 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.270
 and Tatars separate dimension there 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.810
 huge space but heads 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.979
 mushrooms and generally there scary there 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:30.739
 but quickly what is it 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.899
 to create a portal we need 10 or 14 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.539
 items sit in themselves but it happens when 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:36.540
 in touch 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.450
 fruit and source 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.800
 hence we need on lan and we need 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.980
 water 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.370
 the percentage of ovsepyan mined 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.079
 best diamond pickax on this 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.000
 take 15 seconds 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.289
 but they can 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.629
 obsidian be any other subjects but 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.390
 she will take about fifty seconds 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.530
 in wild obsidian 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.040
 is quite rare that is much 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.559
 more profitable to grow 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:01.530
 we need 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.960
 given last year 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.070
 a pair of buckets 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.430
 we will make of cotton first infinite 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.430
 a source 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.840
 to get herself but her to do 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.470
 small groove 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.900
 in which vadim kulik we put 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.170
 street 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.520
 if he is cold water 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.810
 take this year we have succeeded 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.940
 stone doesn't matter 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.630
 here we have obsidian 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.630
 and mined 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.330
 in this way 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.890
 need to do 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.130
 10 stuff 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.010
 at least 10 dice 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.730
 when creating a portal, we will need 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.150
 I will communicate two dice 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.060
 for this, he will understand why daw 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.170
 Kravets lighter using 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.960
 pieces of iron 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.130
 silicon 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.250
 so we have thousands of obsidian cubes 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.640
 first put two down 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.000
 vacancy 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.580
 2 any others we will build on them 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.699
 side walls 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.849
 put three Kubar top 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.829
 further here 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.229
 1 cube 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:19.229
 and 2 top 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.499
 you can take an example 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:29.079
 for beauty and you can replace these 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.959
 obsidian stone cubes 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.899
 when you need 14 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:36.899
 now you need to set fire to the bottom two 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.290
 so it's time to decide what is 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.149
 take the view of the world 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:43.759
 be sure to take the tools 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.489
 kirkova fee can be mad sign agdam them 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.049
 one thing you can take 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.889
 torches need to take 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.329
 at will it is good to have only 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.349
 start of food in 1 8 food 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:56.279
 OK 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:58.459
 Need Lady David Sciences and Arrows 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.319
 the more because there is flying 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.849
 sixth 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.739
 I will take to useless as 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.670
 if the water flies to the outside world then she 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.219
 evaporate immediately 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.249
 when the outside world dies you will go to 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:12.239
 addresses your respawn version of the world that is to 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:12.529
 street 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:15.369
 speedy beds 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:17.269
 so I built a little resemblance 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.699
 roads to tell you 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:19.980
 little lower world 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.980
 by the way how does the water flow out to the outside world 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:28.079
 most of the time 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.109
 rocks in the lower world takes 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.749
 hell stone 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:33.579
 percentage rink 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.659
 analogue of the army of the land of the upper world itself 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.540
 I wonder what if it is set on fire 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.119
 burn forever 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:43.859
 This is a very good idea for fireplaces in 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.769
 houses the world's top blocks between the rooms 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.939
 can be freely carried 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.109
 all here are huge cottages 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:52.929
 it's quite interesting 

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:56.229
 I wanted to tell it that the blocks that 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:57.589
 the station then he 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:00.989
 this blog is a glowing stone 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.039
 oxen it breaks like glass if u 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:06.209
 getting enough sleep 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.769
 here is this blog 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.489
 glows a little brighter in torches 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.379
 very interesting but this blog 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:14.689
 this 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.789
 sand choked 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.299
 if you start walking on it he will 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.769
 slow you down 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.769
 we will surprise the world very much chapter 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.330
 very many few 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.889
 or quite a lot 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.249
 mushrooms of different 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:34.640
 or the world is populated with just two types of monsters 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.040
 it's a dream messina and not their own 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.480
 examples guys are in the meter group 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.290
 two from 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.029
 up to the logistic age 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:45.629
 you are not beaten, but if you like them 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:47.050
 for critical 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.750
 and she will run the whole group at once 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.159
 10 people that is, they are quite dangerous 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:54.090
 guys if you donâ€™t touch them 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.020
 get rid of your determination and 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.220
 more and cubes 4 4 white with a sad 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.249
 muzzle shout they are called gas tamim 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:04.590
 Now I'm on my way here 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.229
 here he is 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:07.259
 shoots 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:09.219
 burning crap 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:11.089
 which explodes 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:13.349
 I can grow trees with them 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.729
 flowers but I didnâ€™t take the sample with me 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.669
 what could procurement 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.669
 oh that's what I fired up 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:26.510
 by the way in 1 8 is quite a nice deal on par 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.510
 and 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.300
 yes you survive hell 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.300
 a touch of glory is swift 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.300
 you can survive in the same cube put 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:39.719
 beauty comes out
