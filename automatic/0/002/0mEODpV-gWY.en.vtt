00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.090
 thanks to your feedback in the comments 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.040
 from brent falls 16 we dedicate ourselves to this 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.450
 Reflection on the empire of citizens falls here 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.070
 have no idea Verdi are 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.480
 Just click on the TV 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.160
 We want to be here especially with the 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.650
 the main arguments of ideologists 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.000
 deal with claim 1 that 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.060
 The constitution is not democratic 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.410
 legitimizes user group are called the people 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.079
 or its representatives have the 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.240
 constitution not approved moment that 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.560
 That's just not right after the second one 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.210
 world war, the Allies had the 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.980
 and they have one 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.150
 but you can 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.520
 nevertheless of an indirect 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.260
 The legitimation of the speakers is paying attention 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.120
 members of the parliamentary council 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.830
 which these should work out were 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.140
 Delegates of the state parliament and thus 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.720
 democratically elected assertion 2 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.330
 Germany has no constitution as 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.850
 evidence for paragraph 146 from the 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.500
 Grundgesetz quotes this constitution 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.089
 after the completion of the unit and 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.619
 freedom of germany for the whole 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.299
 German people are losing their lives 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.830
 valid on the day at the one 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.030
 constitution enters into force by the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.729
 german people in free decision 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.470
 it has been decided the paragraph says 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.359
 only that the basic law of one 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.679
 other constitution can be replaced 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:20.539
 But he does not say that 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:22.609
 constitution is not a constitution per se 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.380
 The name Grundgesetz was at that time only one 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:26.109
 political concession of the German 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.640
 Prime Minister to the East Zone 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:30.079
 German word was the Allies but 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.359
 no matter because they approved that 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.939
 constitutional constitution what nothing 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:36.469
 other than constitutional means 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.569
 By the way, the American constitution has 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.909
 no title at all and just start with 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.499
 we are the people and the united one 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.359
 Kingdom of Great Britain exists 

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:46.189
 for over 300 years completely without 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:48.380
 written constitution or constitution 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.939
 So goes also assertion 3 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.159
 The Federal Republic of Germany is 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.319
 actually a company the brd gmbh 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.219
 actually is in frankfurter 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:57.719
 trade register a federal republic 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.880
 germany finance agency gmbh 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.619
 The company takes care of loans 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.240
 for the federal budget and is therefore 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.439
 a gmbh so she private 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.000
 can act 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.619
 many services the earlier 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.269
 authorities themselves 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.090
 in the meantime outsourced the company 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:15.480
 this also applies to waste collection water works 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.890
 and therefore s railway not state this world 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.989
 is a company just because he is his 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.170
 functions to companies ceded a clumsy 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.730
 Variant of the argument says the name 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.549
 identity card clearly states that 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.140
 we are all staff of the brd gmbh also 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.640
 nonsense because personal refers 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.370
 here on the personalities on the 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.810
 ID card are documented claim 4 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.480
 we have been since the second world war 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.470
 a peace agreement the argument 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.940
 is also outside again 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.769
 summarize reproduced 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.450
 an explicit peace agreement 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.340
 But the second world war does not exist 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.500
 the Allies have it for each 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.140
 unilateral peace declaration 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.200
 Western Allied 19 51 the Soviet Union 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.329
 19 55 at the latest with the two plus four 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.709
 However, contract from the year 1990 was 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.060
 a separate peace agreement between 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.190
 Germany and the former 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.870
 allied lapsed if you so in 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.380
 future meeting with rice ideologues 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.900
 should 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.450
 do not let werner aim that 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.889
 was bringing up couchman is only 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.780
 in the spring break and we see 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.370
 follow us in may with new brain fed 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.739
 here you will find two cool videos 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.230
 San san pensioners perfect 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.230
