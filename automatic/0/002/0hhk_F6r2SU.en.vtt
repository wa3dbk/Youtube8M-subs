00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210

forget where Eastern Mountain Sports I

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.180

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
think and it's just a synthetic shirt

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.040 
think and it's just a synthetic shirt
you<00:00:50.460> don't<00:00:50.489> want<00:00:50.850> cotton<00:00:51.090> obviously<00:00:51.750> because

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
you don't want cotton obviously because

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.779 
you don't want cotton obviously because
it<00:00:52.199> tends<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.829> hold<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.219> moisture<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:54.739> stink

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
it tends to hold in moisture and stink

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.470 
it tends to hold in moisture and stink
but<00:00:56.789> uh<00:00:57.620> this<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.460> synthetic<00:00:59.789> it's<00:01:00.270> got<00:01:00.449> a

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
but uh this is a synthetic it's got a

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.779 
but uh this is a synthetic it's got a
little<00:01:00.780> bit<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.020> wool<00:01:01.260> mixed<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.430> help<00:01:02.640> it

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
little bit of wool mixed in to help it

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.070 
little bit of wool mixed in to help it
stink<00:01:03.090> less<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.880> guess<00:01:06.080> wicking

time<00:04:48.780> but<00:04:49.050> it<00:04:49.169> doesn't<00:04:49.440> really<00:04:49.590> get<00:04:50.010> you<00:04:50.160> too

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
time but it doesn't really get you too

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.510 
time but it doesn't really get you too
hot<00:04:50.639> which<00:04:50.940> is<00:04:50.970> odd<00:04:51.870> but<00:04:52.199> it<00:04:52.320> works<00:04:52.919> out<00:04:53.160> for

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
hot which is odd but it works out for

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.400 
hot which is odd but it works out for
the<00:04:53.610> better<00:04:55.430> so<00:04:56.510> always<00:04:57.510> had<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.870> rain<00:04:58.020> jacket

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
the better so always had the rain jacket

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.860 
the better so always had the rain jacket
and<00:04:58.530> puffy<00:04:58.770> jacket<00:04:59.160> for<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.090> colder<00:05:00.419> months<00:05:00.630> I

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
and puffy jacket for the colder months I

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.029 
and puffy jacket for the colder months I
had<00:05:01.340> Patagonia<00:05:02.340> long<00:05:02.580> johns<00:05:03.620> for<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.710> warmer

always had a synthetic shirt and a pair

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.930 
always had a synthetic shirt and a pair
of<00:05:12.599> running<00:05:12.780> shorts<00:05:13.169> for<00:05:13.380> my<00:05:13.530> hiking<00:05:13.940> then

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
of running shorts for my hiking then

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.560 
of running shorts for my hiking then
that<00:05:15.180> only<00:05:15.450> leaves<00:05:16.580> the<00:05:17.580> socks<00:05:17.910> to<00:05:18.210> talk<00:05:18.389> about

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
that only leaves the socks to talk about

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.390 
that only leaves the socks to talk about
and<00:05:19.880> for<00:05:20.880> pretty<00:05:21.780> much<00:05:21.870> the<00:05:22.050> entire<00:05:22.229> hike<00:05:23.070> I

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
and for pretty much the entire hike I

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:30.140 
and for pretty much the entire hike I
just<00:05:24.150> had<00:05:24.300> two<00:05:24.570> pairs<00:05:24.900> of<00:05:24.990> socks<00:05:25.320> and<00:05:29.150> that's

just had two pairs of socks and that's

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.969 
just had two pairs of socks and that's
all<00:05:30.330> I<00:05:30.360> needed<00:05:30.630> I<00:05:30.780> had<00:05:30.810> one<00:05:31.200> that<00:05:31.349> I<00:05:31.440> hiked<00:05:31.740> in

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
all I needed I had one that I hiked in

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.890 
all I needed I had one that I hiked in
all<00:05:32.280> day<00:05:32.669> and<00:05:32.880> then<00:05:33.000> at<00:05:33.120> night<00:05:33.150> I<00:05:33.330> would<00:05:33.539> change

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
all day and then at night I would change

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.900 
all day and then at night I would change
into<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:34.289> other<00:05:34.440> pair<00:05:34.740> or<00:05:34.979> just<00:05:35.520> not<00:05:35.669> even

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
into the other pair or just not even

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.050 
into the other pair or just not even
wear<00:05:36.120> a<00:05:36.150> pair<00:05:36.510> to<00:05:36.930> bed<00:05:37.139> and<00:05:37.729> then<00:05:38.729> eventually

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
wear a pair to bed and then eventually

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.180 
wear a pair to bed and then eventually
once<00:05:39.720> you<00:05:39.840> hike<00:05:40.229> in<00:05:40.380> a<00:05:40.440> pair<00:05:40.620> of<00:05:40.650> socks<00:05:40.949> for

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
once you hike in a pair of socks for

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.710 
once you hike in a pair of socks for
long<00:05:41.340> enough<00:05:41.520> they<00:05:41.699> get<00:05:41.849> pretty<00:05:42.000> stiff<00:05:42.449> and

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
long enough they get pretty stiff and

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.770 
long enough they get pretty stiff and
not<00:05:43.250> really<00:05:44.250> comfortable<00:05:44.760> so<00:05:44.820> I<00:05:45.060> would<00:05:45.479> switch

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
not really comfortable so I would switch

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.659 
not really comfortable so I would switch
to<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.919> unused<00:05:47.340> pair<00:05:47.729> of<00:05:47.940> socks<00:05:48.330> and<00:05:49.669> while

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
to the unused pair of socks and while

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.890 
to the unused pair of socks and while
I'm<00:05:50.880> here<00:05:51.330> I<00:05:52.849> this<00:05:53.849> is<00:05:54.000> a<00:05:54.030> pair<00:05:54.270> of<00:05:54.389> smart<00:05:54.660> wool

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
I'm here I this is a pair of smart wool

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.260 
I'm here I this is a pair of smart wool
socks<00:05:55.229> that<00:05:55.470> I<00:05:55.500> used<00:05:55.860> I<00:05:56.160> really<00:05:56.610> like<00:05:56.760> them<00:05:57.060> I

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
socks that I used I really like them I

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.540 
socks that I used I really like them I
think<00:05:58.139> they're<00:05:58.289> the<00:05:58.440> most<00:05:58.470> comfortable<00:05:59.340> pair

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
think they're the most comfortable pair

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.020 
think they're the most comfortable pair
of<00:05:59.729> socks<00:06:00.289> but<00:06:01.289> the<00:06:01.590> other<00:06:01.770> option<00:06:01.860> is<00:06:02.460> darn

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
of socks but the other option is darn

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.350 
of socks but the other option is darn
tough<00:06:03.270> socks<00:06:03.690> right<00:06:04.289> here<00:06:04.650> and<00:06:05.310> you<00:06:06.030> can<00:06:06.180> see

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
tough socks right here and you can see

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.960 
tough socks right here and you can see
the<00:06:06.510> name<00:06:07.199> darn<00:06:07.620> tough<00:06:07.860> I<00:06:08.160> think<00:06:08.699> they're<00:06:08.820> made

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
the name darn tough I think they're made

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.810 
the name darn tough I think they're made
in<00:06:09.120> Vermont<00:06:09.479> these<00:06:10.199> are<00:06:10.650> in<00:06:11.520> my<00:06:11.580> opinion

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
in Vermont these are in my opinion

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.670 
in Vermont these are in my opinion
they're<00:06:12.389> not<00:06:12.539> quite<00:06:12.870> as<00:06:13.020> comfortable<00:06:13.320> as

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
they're not quite as comfortable as

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.100 
they're not quite as comfortable as
smart<00:06:13.979> wool<00:06:14.190> but<00:06:14.490> they<00:06:14.610> last<00:06:14.849> a<00:06:15.120> lot<00:06:15.300> longer

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
smart wool but they last a lot longer

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.890 
smart wool but they last a lot longer
and<00:06:16.350> there<00:06:17.220> I<00:06:17.400> mean<00:06:17.760> the<00:06:17.910> comfort<00:06:18.300> is<00:06:18.450> kind<00:06:18.810> of

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
and there I mean the comfort is kind of

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.810 
and there I mean the comfort is kind of
negligible<00:06:19.440> it's<00:06:19.710> really<00:06:19.980> not<00:06:20.130> that<00:06:20.400> big<00:06:20.610> of<00:06:20.760> a

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
negligible it's really not that big of a

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.130 
negligible it's really not that big of a
difference<00:06:22.160> so<00:06:23.160> I<00:06:23.660> would<00:06:24.660> say<00:06:24.840> if<00:06:24.990> you're

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.140 
difference so I would say if you're

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.280 
difference so I would say if you're
buying<00:06:25.380> socks<00:06:25.800> for<00:06:26.750> thru-hiking<00:06:27.750> or<00:06:28.020> for<00:06:28.200> just

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
buying socks for thru-hiking or for just

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.990 
buying socks for thru-hiking or for just
backpacking<00:06:28.950> in<00:06:29.070> general<00:06:29.370> I'd<00:06:29.520> recommend

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
backpacking in general I'd recommend

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.600 
backpacking in general I'd recommend
darn<00:06:30.210> tough<00:06:30.450> although<00:06:31.290> smart<00:06:31.830> wool<00:06:32.040> is<00:06:32.310> really

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
darn tough although smart wool is really

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.370 
darn tough although smart wool is really
not<00:06:32.760> a<00:06:32.790> bad<00:06:32.970> option<00:06:33.210> it's<00:06:33.960> a<00:06:34.050> little<00:06:34.260> more

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
not a bad option it's a little more

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.950 
not a bad option it's a little more
comfortable

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
comfortable

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.590 
comfortable
anyways<00:06:37.670> normally<00:06:38.670> I<00:06:38.700> would<00:06:38.910> have<00:06:38.940> two<00:06:39.300> pairs

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
anyways normally I would have two pairs

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.040 
anyways normally I would have two pairs
of<00:06:39.660> socks<00:06:39.960> but<00:06:40.380> as<00:06:41.190> it<00:06:41.640> got<00:06:41.820> colder<00:06:42.420> up<00:06:42.450> north

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
of socks but as it got colder up north

of socks but as it got colder up north
especially<00:06:43.620> in<00:06:44.160> Maine<00:06:44.400> I<00:06:44.700> just<00:06:45.390> picked<00:06:45.570> up
