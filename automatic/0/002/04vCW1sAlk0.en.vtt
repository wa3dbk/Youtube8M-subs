we<00:02:00.150> do<00:02:00.300> when<00:02:00.570> we<00:02:00.690> play<00:02:00.869> AC<00:02:01.170> major<00:02:01.200> chord<00:02:01.530> okay

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
we do when we play AC major chord okay

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.150 
we do when we play AC major chord okay
we<00:02:02.790> start<00:02:03.030> with<00:02:03.119> playing<00:02:03.710> middle<00:02:04.710> sleep<00:02:04.979> with

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
we start with playing middle sleep with

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.060 
we start with playing middle sleep with
our<00:02:05.340> thumb<00:02:06.060> now<00:02:06.869> let<00:02:07.259> me<00:02:07.290> tell<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.649> why<00:02:07.800> still

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
our thumb now let me tell you why still

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.960 
our thumb now let me tell you why still
major<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.489> called<00:02:08.759> C<00:02:09.300> major<00:02:09.509> that's<00:02:10.200> because<00:02:10.970> C

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
major is called C major that's because C

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.000 
major is called C major that's because C
is<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.989> lowest<00:02:13.470> note<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.300> chord<00:02:15.680> so<00:02:16.680> it's

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
is the lowest note of the chord so it's

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.000 
is the lowest note of the chord so it's
called<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.400> key<00:02:17.700> note<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:19.560> chord<00:02:19.590> that's

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
called the key note of the chord that's

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.830 
called the key note of the chord that's
why<00:02:20.130> three<00:02:20.340> major<00:02:20.580> we<00:02:20.880> have<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.150> start<00:02:21.390> with<00:02:21.600> C

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
why three major we have to start with C

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.060 
why three major we have to start with C
with<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.970> thumb<00:02:24.320> what<00:02:25.320> we<00:02:25.470> going<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.739> do<00:02:25.860> then

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
with the thumb what we going to do then

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.060 
with the thumb what we going to do then
is<00:02:26.340> skip<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.750> D<00:02:27.989> note<00:02:28.230> which<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.890> next

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
is skip the D note which is the next

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.370 
is skip the D note which is the next
white<00:02:29.489> key<00:02:29.820> in<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.209> family<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.690> three<00:02:31.140> major

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
white key in the family of three major

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.650 
white key in the family of three major
and<00:02:31.739> move<00:02:33.020> to<00:02:34.020> eat<00:02:34.230> with<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.950> third<00:02:35.190> finger<00:02:35.660> so

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
and move to eat with the third finger so

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.770 
and move to eat with the third finger so
basically<00:02:37.110> we<00:02:37.230> play<00:02:37.470> one<00:02:38.010> yes<00:02:38.250> why<00:02:38.850> not<00:02:39.090> one

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
basically we play one yes why not one

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.350 
basically we play one yes why not one
yes<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.320> we're<00:02:41.280> going<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.640> continue<00:02:41.850> in<00:02:42.239> this

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
yes and we're going to continue in this

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.380 
yes and we're going to continue in this
process<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.500> not<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:44.130> f<00:02:44.280> note<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:45.269> we're

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
process so this not the f note and we're

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.130 
process so this not the f note and we're
going<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.600> move<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.810> G<00:02:46.549> so<00:02:47.549> see<00:02:47.790> EG<00:02:48.269> makes<00:02:48.989> a

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
going to move to G so see EG makes a

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.539 
going to move to G so see EG makes a
c-major<00:02:49.530> chord<00:02:49.890> listen<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.880> sound<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.239> it

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
c-major chord listen to the sound of it

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.520 
c-major chord listen to the sound of it
to<00:02:53.549> me<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.760> really<00:02:54.030> sounds<00:02:54.450> happy<00:02:54.630> although

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
to me it really sounds happy although

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.280 
to me it really sounds happy although
music<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.340> based<00:02:56.700> on<00:02:56.820> musical<00:02:57.390> connotations<00:02:58.110> I

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
music is based on musical connotations I

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.470 
music is based on musical connotations I
can<00:02:59.010> really<00:02:59.220> set<00:02:59.459> this<00:02:59.700> sounds<00:03:00.030> better<00:03:00.209> than

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
can really set this sounds better than

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.160 
can really set this sounds better than
this<00:03:01.640> this<00:03:02.640> sounds<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.209> me<00:03:03.299> more<00:03:03.330> melancholic

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
this this sounds to me more melancholic

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.830 
this this sounds to me more melancholic
related<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.100> what<00:03:05.280> I've<00:03:05.459> been<00:03:05.610> raised<00:03:05.910> on<00:03:06.180> but

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
related to what I've been raised on but

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.300 
related to what I've been raised on but
we're<00:03:06.989> going<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.200> touch<00:03:07.350> this<00:03:07.860> chord<00:03:08.160> much

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
we're going to touch this chord much

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.940 
we're going to touch this chord much
later<00:03:08.549> so<00:03:08.910> basically<00:03:09.900> we<00:03:10.110> are<00:03:10.140> now<00:03:10.380> playing<00:03:10.769> a

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
later so basically we are now playing a

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.800 
later so basically we are now playing a
major<00:03:11.100> chord<00:03:11.489> which<00:03:11.670> sounds<00:03:12.060> happy<00:03:12.239> it's

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
major chord which sounds happy it's

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.960 
major chord which sounds happy it's
called<00:03:13.019> three<00:03:13.290> major<00:03:13.500> started<00:03:14.250> from<00:03:14.400> C<00:03:14.670> going

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
called three major started from C going

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.090 
called three major started from C going
to<00:03:15.120> E<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.570> then<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.930> j<00:03:16.170> with<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.470> first<00:03:16.739> third

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
to E and then to j with the first third

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.970 
to E and then to j with the first third
and<00:03:17.280> fifth<00:03:17.340> fingers<00:03:18.440> next<00:03:19.440> let's<00:03:19.680> try<00:03:19.920> to

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
and fifth fingers next let's try to

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.430 
and fifth fingers next let's try to
build<00:03:20.310> an<00:03:20.549> F<00:03:20.760> major<00:03:21.030> chord<00:03:21.269> we're<00:03:22.019> going<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.320> do

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
build an F major chord we're going to do

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.550 
build an F major chord we're going to do
the<00:03:22.560> same<00:03:22.769> F<00:03:23.070> major<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:24.209> means<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.690> key<00:03:25.410> note

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
the same F major it means the key note

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.949 
the same F major it means the key note
of<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:26.070> chord<00:03:26.100> is<00:03:26.459> f<00:03:26.700> which<00:03:27.239> is<00:03:27.269> found<00:03:27.630> here

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
of the chord is f which is found here

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.080 
of the chord is f which is found here
then<00:03:28.680> we're<00:03:28.769> going<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.040> keep<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.370> genome<00:03:29.760> just

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
then we're going to keep the genome just

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.819 
then we're going to keep the genome just
like<00:03:30.269> we<00:03:30.390> did<00:03:30.450> here<00:03:30.840> we're<00:03:31.440> going<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.709> move

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
like we did here we're going to move

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.069 
like we did here we're going to move
through<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.220> we're<00:03:33.120> going<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.329> skip<00:03:33.570> this<00:03:33.780> note

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
through a we're going to skip this note

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.960 
through a we're going to skip this note
B<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:34.980> play<00:03:35.610> on<00:03:35.970> see<00:03:36.840> with<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:37.260> fifth<00:03:38.010> finger

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
B and play on see with the fifth finger

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.920 
B and play on see with the fifth finger
so<00:03:39.120> we<00:03:39.239> have<00:03:39.360> f<00:03:39.630> day<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.590> see

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
so we have f day and see

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.869 
so we have f day and see
play<00:03:41.019> together<00:03:41.230> at<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.650> same<00:03:41.799> time<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.730> this

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
play together at the same time and this

play together at the same time and this
is<00:03:43.120> an<00:03:43.329> F<00:03:43.930> major<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.650> try<00:03:45.159> to<00:03:45.219> listen<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:45.700> the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
is an F major I try to listen to the

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.860 
is an F major I try to listen to the
similarity<00:03:46.540> between<00:03:47.019> a<00:03:47.230> steam<00:03:47.530> major<00:03:47.769> point

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
similarity between a steam major point

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.330 
similarity between a steam major point
to<00:03:49.870> F<00:03:50.019> major<00:03:52.349> so<00:03:53.349> how<00:03:53.530> are<00:03:53.769> we<00:03:53.829> going<00:03:53.920> to<00:03:54.159> play

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
to F major so how are we going to play

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.780 
to F major so how are we going to play
our<00:03:54.640> third<00:03:55.209> major<00:03:55.510> chord<00:03:55.870> G<00:03:56.290> major<00:03:56.530> yeah<00:03:57.519> you

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
our third major chord G major yeah you

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.330 
our third major chord G major yeah you
got<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.030> right<00:03:58.299> so<00:03:58.540> we<00:03:58.659> play<00:03:58.840> G<00:03:59.139> with<00:03:59.920> the<00:04:00.069> thumb

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
got it right so we play G with the thumb

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.129 
got it right so we play G with the thumb
because<00:04:00.519> it's<00:04:00.819> the<00:04:00.969> key<00:04:01.120> note<00:04:01.269> of<00:04:01.450> G<00:04:01.629> major<00:04:01.840> we

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139
