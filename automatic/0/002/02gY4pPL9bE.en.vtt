00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.860
 she put them in these lots and we got 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.260
 found today on the cargo map 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.580
 for a spot and jump but first of all 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.100
 I wanted to thank you we exceeded 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.480
 the more than 5000 subscribers and it's just 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.890
 huge because ben voila I'm not 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.140
 tell you the boat sentence I thought 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.750
 never reach this point I was not sure 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.590
 but here it is to go really 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.570
 very quickly 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.920
 and here I wanted to thank you 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.989
 because it is you who simply 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.110
 live my channel that share 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.580
 comment and his videos and all that is 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.500
 thanks to you so here is a big thank you 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.790
 to the likes of friends then we will attack 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.900
 immediately the capture of the flags 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.250
 then you will see that it is very 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.379
 very simple for the capture will not last 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.760
 we have at home simply here and 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.409
 you capture your flag really 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.420
 very quietly even if an enemy 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.560
 who passes if you will not see you then 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.390
 it's really very very simple 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.220
 capture the flag ensures the same cargo 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.570
 you will see for the flag go down 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.460
 quite random since it's according to 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.870
 it's the container are there or not but 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.420
 otherwise for example there is no account 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.760
 so is not what you do everything 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.320
 simple you lie here and you 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.210
 to approach a little bit of the flag 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.130
 and protect you this area here or even 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.750
 here and that's really a little advice 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.250
 that I can give you in bc was waiting 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.260
 who is allies who captures for 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.760
 come help them because it's true that 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.860
 alone capture bessat long enough 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.480
 reading a flag or pre killed for sale 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.440
 before capturing it so here we go 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.540
 was really waiting for there to be 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.000
 allies who come with us and for the 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.550
 catching the flag if there is no 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.110
 really advice only one board that 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.490
 I can give you just 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.560
 to use the crates that are there to 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.690
 your advantage so you put them in 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.400
 your back and protect you these two these 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.890
 two places where we can finish 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.190
 to kill you and it should be okay 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.960
 pass 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.580
 it's really a case a flag that 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.590
 will kill capture them laid on a piece of furniture 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.310
 cargo here you catch very 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.689
 quiet 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.990
 so here we are going to start right away 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.750
 spoken jump and spots but first of all I 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.429
 wanted to give you warning I 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.630
 not the model for this video it's 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.550
 true that usually I always have a 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.130
 model and who help me all plan 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.720
 show you the effectiveness of the spots but 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.150
 this time on vacation so here we go 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.930
 I have to do without so beaten and 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.910
 a first spot 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.440
 see the canoe shot joy the spawn 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.670
 enemies but that's not very 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.680
 convenient but just you 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.540
 can ride on the yellow kader bar 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.920
 you and there you can spawn that they 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.360
 enemies really very very very 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.250
 easily doubt that they do not 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.049
 you absolutely do not see it because there is the 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.580
 decor right in front of you and you can 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.799
 spawn they the enemies it's really 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.090
 to show very simple again 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.430
 you can ride on the blue box 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.250
 squatting you spy who still a 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.930
 times the enemies very easily even 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.910
 you shift to kill everything that 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.590
 would come from there so that's it 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.110
 again a very good spot 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.849
 I'll show you many more then 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.200
 again here to get on the 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.319
 how are we going to call that a cargo? 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.799
 of beer then go up here so 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.750
 on his crates a little red beige 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.910
 and there you have a clear view of the 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.650
 c flag is that you can spawn 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.620
 again the emmy so that allows 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.180
 to protect the flag b the spawn they 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.120
 the enemies finally brief it's really 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.459
 very very very good spot here we are 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.959
 friends also a spot for research 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.489
 and destruction that's just huge 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.870
 so you get on the car and 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.930
 then you go up on those little ones 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.579
 green electric parts one and you 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.049
 can protect the flag very 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.420
 easily if the enemies come from 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.040
 these and it's really super convenient 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.600
 because you simply ask 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.130
 your good then you put there and you 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.530
 are really quiet to protect 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.480
 if an enemy passes or kill him and 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.700
 here it is really a very good spot 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.629
 for desert search and destruction 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.160
 also another another trick for 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.900
 defend research and destruction you 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.040
 jump on the boats and alabama of his 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.209
 ranks not something I thought 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.739
 because it's very hard to do 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.980
 besides, if I can not do it 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.390
 give up because wayne is left 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.580
 to fall because it's really a spot 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.440
 which is complicated and 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.209
 it's true that in multiplayer is not not 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.680
 really workable but otherwise you 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.810
 could simply climb on the 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.970
 case this is jumped on this bar binds 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.049
 then you see above and you 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.650
 can defend the bomb 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.209
 but this is not it's really 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.930
 it's easy to do in part 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.690
 custom 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.979
 but it's true that we were looking for 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.780
 destruction in multiplayer it's 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.770
 complicated to do so that's tried 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.229
 tried in your corner 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.050
 and if you get there easily ok but 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.340
 if not give up 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.919
 Anyway there are plenty of others 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.720
 spots that are just huge so here 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.820
 you can jump on the trash you 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.590
 get here so the assault does not allow 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.050
 simply to defend the flag has 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.910
 very easily also you squat 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.590
 here to kill all those who would come 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.930
 catch and a weight so still a 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.280
 time it's just huge here to kill 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.300
 everyone who is the planet or even 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.419
 in the building see the 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.539
 ground floor of the building that went 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.780
 so 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.760
 so here is the weight sheet and the must 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.430
 it's really jumped on this account nerves 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.050
 because there you have a view even on 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.060
 the spawn enemies press you see I 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.639
 do not know if we see very well there because 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.139
 that's pretty far away and also in 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.270
 the building you can kill all those 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.100
 who are looking towards point b see in 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.820
 the building there is this window there there 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.650
 has a second 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.450
 and there you can directly kill those 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.750
 who look through the second so that's 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.380
 really super nice also here a 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.510
 little dog 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.550
 but first of all looked at we will have 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.500
 used to use the small car 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.910
 yellow here to ride but the better 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.710
 still used this one because all 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.289
 simply you have an unobstructed view of 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.530
 all the inside of the building before there 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:37.409
 go 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.999
 and so here you see 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.979
 but you were then you wish 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:43.050
 on the car I do not miss you at 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:45.719
 through and here you are here so 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.339
 it's really mansion much more 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:48.419
 reliable that one because it's true 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:49.949
 that these two there we go a little to 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.929
 blindly and if an enemy that we 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.309
 just wait up we're dead then 

00:05:51.929 --> 00:05:55.050
 that here it eliminates it before 

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:57.509
 so it's really a super spot 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.789
 also practice a spot that is just 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:01.229
 at the beginning of the game 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:04.889
 there is a container of the coup it does not work 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:07.800
 not I do not know too much yeah so here I go 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:10.469
 say nonsense at the beginning of the game 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.519
 get you take your sniper had in 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:16.409
 face the whole team will go over there 

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:18.419
 stride aimed at and you make a double or 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:20.159
 so a tripe really very easily 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.189
 it's really a spot that's just 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:24.899
 enormously good the strength doing that 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:26.550
 works much less well but it's a 

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:27.629
 spot that is just enormously great because 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.819
 you doubt that we do not see 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:31.589
 absolutely nothing when we are there and 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:33.989
 since you are protected by the car 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:36.179
 by the steering wheel by all that all 

00:06:33.989 --> 00:06:38.009
 simply and you will chain the 

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:39.659
 that he will enter easily you can 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:41.329
 even stay there a hell of a time 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:43.709
 before you get dislodged 

00:06:41.329 --> 00:06:46.259
 it's really huge it's a spot that 

00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:47.459
 I recommend sorry friends all 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:49.740
 small technical problem 

00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:51.719
 so here's the last spot that's just 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.319
 here again for research and 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:53.879
 destruction 

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:55.829
 you ride on the small car at 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:57.360
 nokia and if you squat and there you 

00:06:55.829 --> 00:06:59.699
 can not see you simply 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.019
 put your bomb or put here and as soon as 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:03.209
 that you hear someone from the primers 

00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:04.439
 or staggered and kill you so that's 

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:06.089
 really super convenient especially that 

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:07.949
 usually there are a lot of people who 

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:09.749
 accumulate here to defend the bomb 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:11.669
 but I think it's really not 

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:14.039
 very useful because it simply 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:16.739
 is ultra known it's here and limit on 

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:19.769
 could shoot and so seniors finally 

00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:20.879
 the allies will be killed even before they 

00:07:19.769 --> 00:07:22.469
 could defend the bomb 

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:24.029
 so the better it is really a spot 

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:25.769
 quite original and little known that is 

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:27.779
 right here you put if you defend 

00:07:25.769 --> 00:07:29.909
 in addition it allows you even on bella 

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:31.090
 door so it's really a spot that I 

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:33.310
 recommend friends 

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.990
 So here we are, I hope these spots 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.940
 agent have made you happy again one 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.669
 once I tell you in a week to 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:43.020
 a spot turrets on this take care of 

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:43.020
 you friends were working
