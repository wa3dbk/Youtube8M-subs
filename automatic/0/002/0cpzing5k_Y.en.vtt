think about output and annotation if I

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.370 
think about output and annotation if I
think<00:05:03.800> of<00:05:03.919> it<00:05:04.040> but<00:05:04.550> it's<00:05:04.790> very<00:05:04.970> similar<00:05:08.380> just

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
think of it but it's very similar just

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.850 
think of it but it's very similar just
going<00:05:09.530> up<00:05:09.590> a<00:05:09.680> little<00:05:09.919> bit<00:05:10.040> on

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.010 

and<00:05:16.669> that<00:05:16.909> is<00:05:17.060> to<00:05:17.210> complete<00:05:17.509> the<00:05:17.599> look<00:05:17.719> I<00:05:17.870> hope

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
and that is to complete the look I hope

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.170
