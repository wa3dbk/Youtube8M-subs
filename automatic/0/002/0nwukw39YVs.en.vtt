our<00:01:52.200> knees<00:01:52.319> up<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.770> then<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.520> as<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.670> get<00:01:53.880> to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
our knees up and then just as you get to

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.309 
our knees up and then just as you get to
the<00:01:54.090> top<00:01:54.270> she's<00:01:54.539> going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.750> twist<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.140> side

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
the top she's going to twist to the side

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:56.929 
the top she's going to twist to the side
you'll<00:01:55.799> see<00:01:55.860> she's<00:01:56.159> squeezing<00:01:56.459> a<00:01:56.640> med<00:01:56.789> ball

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
you'll see she's squeezing a med ball

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.100 
you'll see she's squeezing a med ball
between<00:01:57.119> her<00:01:57.360> feet<00:01:57.539> which<00:01:57.719> makes<00:01:57.929> this

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
between her feet which makes this

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.350 
between her feet which makes this
exercise<00:01:58.649> even<00:01:58.920> harder<00:01:59.340> an<00:01:59.579> earlier

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
exercise even harder an earlier

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.669 
exercise even harder an earlier
progression<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:00.929> to<00:02:00.959> just<00:02:01.259> do<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.530> without

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
progression is to just do this without

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.919 
progression is to just do this without
the<00:02:01.920> med<00:02:02.069> ball<00:02:02.359> focus<00:02:03.359> here<00:02:03.539> is<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.750> building

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
the med ball focus here is on building

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.529 
the med ball focus here is on building
abdominal<00:02:04.530> strength<00:02:04.799> with<00:02:05.789> some<00:02:06.000> rotations

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
abdominal strength with some rotations

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.240 
abdominal strength with some rotations
so<00:02:06.750> trying<00:02:06.959> to<00:02:06.990> mimic<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.380> actions<00:02:07.709> that<00:02:08.039> she

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
so trying to mimic the actions that she

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.639 
so trying to mimic the actions that she
does<00:02:08.399> when<00:02:08.610> she<00:02:08.759> skis<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.989> additional<00:02:10.440> stress

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
does when she skis the additional stress

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.319 
does when she skis the additional stress
that<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:10.950> places<00:02:11.370> on<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.579> obliques<00:02:11.880> is<00:02:12.060> also
