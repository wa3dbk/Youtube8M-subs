that<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.750> put<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.109> there<00:00:28.289> now<00:00:28.410> we<00:00:28.470> used<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.830> two

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
that we put on there now we used a two

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.400 
that we put on there now we used a two
by<00:00:29.220> ten<00:00:29.550> because<00:00:30.420> we<00:00:30.570> wanted<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.869> make<00:00:30.929> sure<00:00:31.199> we

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
by ten because we wanted to make sure we

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.010 
by ten because we wanted to make sure we
had<00:00:31.619> enough<00:00:31.830> room<00:00:32.730> here<00:00:32.759> if<00:00:33.719> we<00:00:33.809> would<00:00:33.960> have

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
had enough room here if we would have

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.270 
had enough room here if we would have
used<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.290> two<00:00:34.469> by<00:00:34.680> eight<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.920> would<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.160> been

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
used a two by eight it would have been

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.119 
used a two by eight it would have been
to<00:00:35.460> about<00:00:35.670> here<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:37.290> bottom<00:00:37.710> part<00:00:37.920> here

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129

wouldn't<00:00:38.399> have<00:00:38.489> had<00:00:38.700> full<00:00:41.960> enough<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.079> got<00:00:43.290> that

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
wouldn't have had full enough I got that

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.630 
wouldn't have had full enough I got that
there<00:00:43.620> might<00:00:43.829> have<00:00:43.860> been<00:00:43.950> moving<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> camera

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
there might have been moving the camera

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.619 
there might have been moving the camera
to<00:00:45.629> buy<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.899> would<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.230> been<00:00:46.350> about<00:00:46.620> here<00:00:47.629> and

to buy it would have been about here and

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.229 
to buy it would have been about here and
we<00:00:49.260> would<00:00:49.469> have<00:00:49.590> been<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:50.010> little<00:00:50.399> short<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.149> our

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
we would have been a little short on our

we would have been a little short on our
stringer<00:00:51.870> we<00:00:51.989> want<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.199> make<00:00:52.320> sure<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.649> have

enough<00:00:52.860> they<00:00:53.760> could<00:00:53.940> always<00:00:54.059> use<00:00:54.360> two<00:00:54.629> two<00:00:54.870> by

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
enough they could always use two two by

underneath<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.450> obviously<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.560> would<00:01:10.740> need

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
underneath this obviously we would need

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.830 
underneath this obviously we would need
to<00:01:11.100> be<00:01:11.340> able<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.490> continue<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:12.090> line<00:01:12.390> up<00:01:12.600> here

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
to be able to continue this line up here

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.280 
to be able to continue this line up here
and<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.590> would<00:01:13.770> have<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.130> be<00:01:14.250> shorter<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.420> that

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
and it would have to be shorter so that

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.410 
and it would have to be shorter so that
sounds<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.770> another<00:01:17.130> video<00:01:17.610> though<00:01:17.939> that

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
sounds like another video though that

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.310 
sounds like another video though that
gives<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.780> good<00:01:18.960> idea<00:01:23.509> how<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.540> attach<00:01:25.020> that

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
gives you a good idea how to attach that

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.960 
gives you a good idea how to attach that
I'd<00:01:25.650> like<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.890> take<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> look<00:01:26.430> at<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.670> story

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
I'd like to take a look at the story

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.260 
I'd like to take a look at the story
pool<00:01:27.299> again

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
pool again

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.289 
pool again
so<00:01:30.920> here<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.040> go<00:01:32.220> with<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.610> now<00:01:32.880> again<00:01:33.090> your

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
so here we go with this now again your

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.130 
so here we go with this now again your
story<00:01:33.570> pool<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.079> useful<00:01:34.650> for<00:01:36.140> double-checking

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
story pool is useful for double-checking

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.359 
story pool is useful for double-checking
everything<00:01:39.470> you<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.619> see<00:01:40.799> once<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.159> put<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
everything you can see once you put a

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.170 
everything you can see once you put a
half-inch<00:01:42.020> stair-tread<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.500> there<00:01:44.180> we're

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
half-inch stair-tread on there we're

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:54.990 
half-inch stair-tread on there we're
going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.540> right<00:01:45.750> where<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:46.049> want<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.350> be

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.680 

there<00:01:55.600> we<00:01:55.750> go<00:01:56.880> hopefully<00:01:57.880> I'm<00:01:58.270> not<00:01:58.300> wiggling

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
there we go hopefully I'm not wiggling

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.120 
there we go hopefully I'm not wiggling
the<00:01:59.850> camera<00:02:00.850> too<00:02:01.060> much<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.770> gives<00:02:02.980> you<00:02:03.100> a

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
the camera too much that gives you a

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.880 
the camera too much that gives you a
good<00:02:03.310> idea<00:02:06.750> give<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:07.870> a<00:02:07.930> good<00:02:08.140> idea<00:02:08.530> what<00:02:08.770> you

good idea give you a good idea what you
want<00:02:09.100> to<00:02:09.190> be<00:02:09.340> now<00:02:10.470> we're<00:02:11.470> going<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.650> put<00:02:11.860> two

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
want to be now we're going to put two

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.580 
want to be now we're going to put two
more<00:02:12.220> stringers<00:02:12.700> on<00:02:12.910> here<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.560> put<00:02:14.560> some

more stringers on here and put some
plywood<00:02:14.920> on<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:16.110> then<00:02:17.110> you'll<00:02:17.350> have<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.590> pretty
