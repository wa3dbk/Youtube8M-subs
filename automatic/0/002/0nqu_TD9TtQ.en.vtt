00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
what's going on guys it's Bosnian and

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.630 
what's going on guys it's Bosnian and
today<00:00:03.780> I<00:00:04.140> got<00:00:04.589> a<00:00:04.620> very<00:00:04.920> interesting<00:00:05.339> video

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
today I got a very interesting video

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.179 
today I got a very interesting video
that<00:00:05.819> involves<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.839> zombie<00:00:07.290> game-mode<00:00:07.859> and

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
that involves the zombie game-mode and

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.459 
that involves the zombie game-mode and
before<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.000> get<00:00:09.150> into<00:00:09.269> detail<00:00:09.809> real<00:00:10.050> quick<00:00:10.290> I

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
before I get into detail real quick I

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.560 
before I get into detail real quick I
just<00:00:10.500> wanted<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:10.980> say<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:12.000> purely

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
just wanted to say that this is purely

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.959 
just wanted to say that this is purely
for<00:00:13.019> entertainment<00:00:13.190> purposes<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.490> isn't

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
for entertainment purposes and isn't

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.900 
for entertainment purposes and isn't
real<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.599> any<00:00:15.719> way<00:00:15.990> but<00:00:16.230> possibly<00:00:17.039> could<00:00:17.460> be<00:00:17.640> if

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
real in any way but possibly could be if

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.269 
real in any way but possibly could be if
you<00:00:18.240> know<00:00:18.359> tre<00:00:18.720> are<00:00:18.869> considered<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.500> idea<00:00:19.949> so

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
you know tre are considered the idea so

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.980 
you know tre are considered the idea so
anyways<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.420> idea<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.869> have<00:00:22.380> for<00:00:22.890> zombies<00:00:23.460> is

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
anyways the idea I have for zombies is

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.810 
anyways the idea I have for zombies is
mummies<00:00:24.990> instead<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.740> zombies<00:00:26.160> for<00:00:26.400> one<00:00:26.609> map

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
mummies instead of zombies for one map

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.630 
mummies instead of zombies for one map
that<00:00:27.510> takes<00:00:27.689> place<00:00:28.109> somewhere<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.039> tomb<00:00:29.310> in

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
that takes place somewhere in a tomb in

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.260 
that takes place somewhere in a tomb in
Egypt<00:00:29.900> now<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:30.929> really<00:00:31.890> don't<00:00:32.130> think<00:00:32.309> much<00:00:33.000> of

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
Egypt now I really don't think much of

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.240 
Egypt now I really don't think much of
the<00:00:33.480> map<00:00:33.719> except<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.469> could<00:00:34.680> take<00:00:34.710> place

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
the map except that it could take place

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.370 
the map except that it could take place
in<00:00:35.730> an<00:00:35.850> underground<00:00:36.300> area<00:00:36.750> where<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> tomb

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
in an underground area where a tomb

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.530 
in an underground area where a tomb
would<00:00:37.620> be<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.340> just<00:00:38.910> think<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.390> having

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
would be but I just think that having

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.440 
would be but I just think that having
mummies<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> map<00:00:40.980> would<00:00:41.309> just<00:00:41.640> be<00:00:42.360> an

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
mummies for a map would just be an

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.209 
mummies for a map would just be an
awesome<00:00:42.540> new<00:00:43.020> idea<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.649> don't<00:00:43.710> know<00:00:44.070> about

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
awesome new idea and I don't know about

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.850 
awesome new idea and I don't know about
you<00:00:44.670> guys<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.300> think<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.930> mummies<00:00:46.469> and

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
you guys but I think that mummies and

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.520 
you guys but I think that mummies and
zombies<00:00:46.950> are<00:00:47.550> pretty<00:00:47.820> much<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.239> same<00:00:48.530> because

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
zombies are pretty much the same because

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.350 
zombies are pretty much the same because
they're<00:00:49.800> both<00:00:49.920> undead<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.239> only

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
they're both undead and the only

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.630 
they're both undead and the only
difference<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:52.020> mummies<00:00:52.410> are<00:00:52.680> wrapped<00:00:52.710> in

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
difference is mummies are wrapped in

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.000 
difference is mummies are wrapped in
toilet<00:00:53.850> paper<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.660> there's<00:00:55.320> definitely<00:00:55.890> not

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
toilet paper so there's definitely not

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.459 
toilet paper so there's definitely not
anything<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.550> majorly<00:00:57.090> divides<00:00:57.600> those<00:00:58.020> two

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
anything that majorly divides those two

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.310 
anything that majorly divides those two
so<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.579> mummies<00:00:59.879> could<00:01:00.149> possibly<00:01:00.600> rise<00:01:00.989> out

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
so the mummies could possibly rise out

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.349 
so the mummies could possibly rise out
of<00:01:01.350> tombs<00:01:01.859> instead<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.579> trying<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.879> get<00:01:03.059> in

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
of tombs instead of trying to get in

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.149 
of tombs instead of trying to get in
through<00:01:03.809> doors<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.409> stuff<00:01:04.619> because<00:01:04.890> that

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
through doors and stuff because that

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.580 
through doors and stuff because that
would<00:01:05.700> kind<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.630> make<00:01:06.750> sense<00:01:07.080> because

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
would kind of make sense because

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.370 
would kind of make sense because
obviously<00:01:07.890> their<00:01:08.520> mummies<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.869> would

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
obviously their mummies and I would

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.940 
obviously their mummies and I would
definitely<00:01:11.310> set<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.700> tone<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> map<00:01:12.479> so

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
definitely set the tone for the map so

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.920 
definitely set the tone for the map so
maybe<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.430> could<00:01:14.670> take<00:01:14.850> place<00:01:15.119> around<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
maybe this could take place around the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.850 
maybe this could take place around the
Pyramids<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.710> Giza<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:18.350> possibly<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.799> could

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
Pyramids of Giza and possibly it could

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.749 
Pyramids of Giza and possibly it could
involve

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
involve

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.330 
involve
aliens<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.570> know<00:01:21.840> that's<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.340> my

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
aliens but you know that's just my

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.710 
aliens but you know that's just my
opinion<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:25.189> now<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.460> kind<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.479> part

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
opinion so now this is kind of the part

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.289 
opinion so now this is kind of the part
that<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.470> gets<00:01:28.740> kind<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.159> weird<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:29.640> these

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
that it gets kind of weird but these

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.230 
that it gets kind of weird but these
guys<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.720> keep<00:01:30.869> an<00:01:31.140> open<00:01:31.320> mind<00:01:31.579> so<00:01:32.579> four

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
guys to keep an open mind so four

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.149 
guys to keep an open mind so four
characters<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:34.079> would<00:01:34.259> be<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.920> map

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
characters that would be in the map

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.300 
characters that would be in the map
would<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.670> Brendan<00:01:36.390> Fraser<00:01:36.750> because<00:01:37.439> he's

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
would be Brendan Fraser because he's

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.490 
would be Brendan Fraser because he's
obviously<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:39.150> mummy<00:01:39.450> killer<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.200> he<00:01:40.350> would

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
obviously a mummy killer and he would

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.069 
obviously a mummy killer and he would
definitely<00:01:41.130> carry<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.850> rest<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.329> his<00:01:42.479> team<00:01:42.750> he

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
definitely carry the rest of his team he

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.649 
definitely carry the rest of his team he
was<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.560> movie<00:01:43.770> mummy<00:01:44.220> if<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.119> guys<00:01:45.270> don't

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
was in the movie mummy if you guys don't

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.510 
was in the movie mummy if you guys don't
know<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.680> would<00:01:46.770> kind<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.040> make<00:01:47.189> sense

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
know so that would kind of make sense

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.010 
know so that would kind of make sense
you<00:01:47.880> know<00:01:47.909> if<00:01:48.240> he<00:01:48.420> was<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.860> map<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:51.020> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
you know if he was in that map so the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.370 
you know if he was in that map so the
next<00:01:52.380> person<00:01:52.710> would<00:01:53.360> definitely<00:01:54.360> be<00:01:54.600> Abraham

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
next person would definitely be Abraham

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.109 
next person would definitely be Abraham
Lincoln<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:58.350> only<00:01:58.799> weapon<00:01:59.250> he<00:01:59.640> would<00:01:59.820> use

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
Lincoln and the only weapon he would use

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.450 
Lincoln and the only weapon he would use
is<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:01.049> axe<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.439> can't<00:02:01.680> use<00:02:01.860> anything<00:02:02.280> else

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
is the axe you can't use anything else

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.440 
is the axe you can't use anything else
because<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:04.049> badass<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.369> you've<00:02:06.240> never

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
because that is badass that you've never

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.850 
because that is badass that you've never
seen<00:02:06.780> an<00:02:06.899> axe<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.380> zomm

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
seen an axe and zomm

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.480 
seen an axe and zomm
and<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.820> reason<00:02:09.150> I<00:02:09.470> chose<00:02:10.470> Abraham<00:02:10.830> Lincoln

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
and the reason I chose Abraham Lincoln

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.010 
and the reason I chose Abraham Lincoln
is<00:02:11.610> because<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.030> recently<00:02:12.420> watched<00:02:12.840> the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
is because I recently watched the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.870 
is because I recently watched the
vampire<00:02:13.380> hunter<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.160> thought<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.730> the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
vampire hunter and I thought that the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.700 
vampire hunter and I thought that the
guy<00:02:15.090> would<00:02:15.420> definitely<00:02:16.050> fit<00:02:16.260> in<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.530> map

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
guy would definitely fit in the map

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.140 
guy would definitely fit in the map
because<00:02:17.000> he's<00:02:18.000> definitely<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.870> badass<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:20.150> the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
because he's definitely a badass so the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.150 
because he's definitely a badass so the
third<00:02:21.390> person<00:02:21.720> would<00:02:22.260> have<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.500> be<00:02:22.680> Woody

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
third person would have to be Woody

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.670 
third person would have to be Woody
Harrelson<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.000> we've<00:02:24.930> all<00:02:25.110> seen<00:02:25.350> him<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.560> the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
Harrelson and we've all seen him in the
