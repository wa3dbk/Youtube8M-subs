which<00:02:39.270> i<00:02:39.390> think<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.690> crucial<00:02:40.140> in<00:02:40.430> crab<00:02:41.430> cakes<00:02:41.790> a

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
which i think is crucial in crab cakes a

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.520 
which i think is crucial in crab cakes a
bean<00:02:43.739> egg<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.959> finally<00:02:45.959> we've<00:02:46.140> got<00:02:46.320> some

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
bean egg and finally we've got some

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.680 
bean egg and finally we've got some
panko<00:02:46.770> breadcrumbs<00:02:47.459> now<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.090> could<00:02:48.480> use

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
panko breadcrumbs now you could use

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.780 
panko breadcrumbs now you could use
regular<00:02:48.959> breadcrumbs<00:02:49.590> if<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:50.040> wanted<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.550> but

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
regular breadcrumbs if you wanted to but

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.850

the<00:02:50.910> reason<00:02:51.209> why<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:51.360> like<00:02:51.540> panko<00:02:52.080> is<00:02:52.230> because

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
the reason why I like panko is because

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.610 
the reason why I like panko is because
if<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.130> can<00:02:53.280> see<00:02:53.640> they're<00:02:54.420> sort<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.750> really

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
if you can see they're sort of really

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.220 
if you can see they're sort of really
really<00:02:55.950> light<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.640> crispy<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.390> they<00:02:57.930> don't

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
really light and crispy and they don't

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.880 
really light and crispy and they don't
sort<00:02:59.070> of<00:02:59.160> way<00:02:59.730> down<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.510> crab<00:03:00.750> cake<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:01.709> that's

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
sort of way down the crab cake so that's

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.620 
sort of way down the crab cake so that's
why<00:03:02.070> I've<00:03:02.250> been<00:03:02.340> using<00:03:02.580> panko<00:03:02.910> now<00:03:03.209> anytime<00:03:03.480> I

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
minutes ago and this is how simple it is

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.850 
minutes ago and this is how simple it is
I<00:03:55.030> just<00:03:55.120> literally<00:03:55.690> take<00:03:56.020> two<00:03:56.500> spoonfuls

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
I just literally take two spoonfuls

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.580 
I just literally take two spoonfuls
because<00:03:57.220> I<00:03:57.250> want<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.430> make<00:03:57.580> little<00:03:57.790> ones<00:03:58.090> and

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
because I want to make little ones and

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.000 
because I want to make little ones and
then<00:03:59.590> I<00:03:59.620> just<00:03:59.890> flatten<00:04:00.310> them<00:04:00.460> a<00:04:00.700> little<00:04:01.450> bit

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
then I just flatten them a little bit

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.830 
then I just flatten them a little bit
with<00:04:03.010> my<00:04:03.190> spoon<00:04:03.520> and<00:04:03.700> I<00:04:03.850> let<00:04:04.090> them<00:04:04.270> cook<00:04:04.510> for

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
with my spoon and I let them cook for

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.540 
with my spoon and I let them cook for
about<00:04:04.930> three<00:04:05.320> minutes<00:04:05.440> on<00:04:05.770> one<00:04:05.920> side<00:04:06.190> about

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550
