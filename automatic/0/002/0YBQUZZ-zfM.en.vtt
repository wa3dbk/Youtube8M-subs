blossoming rod is one of those problems

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.390 
blossoming rod is one of those problems
but<00:00:27.450> every<00:00:27.900> gardener<00:00:28.260> has<00:00:28.470> run<00:00:28.710> across<00:00:29.010> into

their garden blossom Nimrod can actually
affect<00:00:31.800> several<00:00:32.070> different<00:00:32.489> types<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.850> plants

affect several different types of plants
you'll<00:00:33.390> see<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.750> watermelons<00:00:34.440> but

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
you'll see it on watermelons but

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.410 
you'll see it on watermelons but
probably<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.100> primary<00:00:35.460> source<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.120> we<00:00:36.239> see

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
probably the primary source that we see

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.860 
probably the primary source that we see
it<00:00:36.510> as<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:36.720> those<00:00:36.900> 50<00:00:37.470> tomato<00:00:37.800> plants<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:39.090> when

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
it as on those 50 tomato plants and when

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.200 
it as on those 50 tomato plants and when
we<00:00:39.989> see<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.199> blossom<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.920> rot<00:00:41.129> typically<00:00:41.940> what

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
we see a blossom in rot typically what

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.210 
we see a blossom in rot typically what
we<00:00:42.360> see<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.870> outside<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.440> at<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.710> very

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
we see on the outside is at the very

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.960 
we see on the outside is at the very
butt<00:00:45.210> end<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.110> tomato<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:47.309> start<00:00:47.610> seeing<00:00:47.820> a

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
butt end of the tomato we start seeing a

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.790 
butt end of the tomato we start seeing a
brown<00:00:48.269> sunken<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.080> area<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.620> will

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
brown sunken in area and that will

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.820 
brown sunken in area and that will
continue<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.430> grow<00:00:50.640> but<00:00:51.420> about<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.320> same<00:00:52.559> size

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
continue to grow but about the same size

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.180 
continue to grow but about the same size
as<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.339> diameter<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:54.180> tomato<00:00:54.680> over<00:00:55.680> time<00:00:55.950> it

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
as the diameter of tomato over time it

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.700 
as the diameter of tomato over time it
will<00:00:56.340> start<00:00:56.489> looking<00:00:57.300> fuzzy<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.410> that's

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
will start looking fuzzy and that's

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.130 
will start looking fuzzy and that's
because<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.879> allows<00:01:00.210> other<00:01:00.539> secondary

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
because it allows other secondary

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.930 
because it allows other secondary
pathogens<00:01:01.860> to<00:01:01.949> move<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.340> here<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.520> they<00:01:02.640> start

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
pathogens to move in here and they start

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.870 
pathogens to move in here and they start
to<00:01:03.239> eat<00:01:04.170> up<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.470> decaying<00:01:04.979> tissue<00:01:05.399> at<00:01:05.700> that

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
to eat up a decaying tissue at that

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.999 
to eat up a decaying tissue at that
point<00:01:06.149> in<00:01:06.270> time

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
point in time

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.440 
point in time
besides<00:01:08.009> that<00:01:08.369> version<00:01:08.910> we<00:01:09.000> also<00:01:09.149> have<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
besides that version we also have a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.690 
besides that version we also have a
second<00:01:10.080> version<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.649> blossom<00:01:11.160> in<00:01:11.250> rot<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.460> we

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
second version of blossom in rot that we

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.420 
second version of blossom in rot that we
see<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:11.970> tomatoes<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.539> it's<00:01:12.720> an<00:01:12.810> internal

ability of those tomatoes or anything at
that<00:02:03.090> point<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.570> time<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.110> they're<00:02:04.770> completely

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
that point in time so they're completely

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.449 
that point in time so they're completely
usable<00:02:05.579> now<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.540> next<00:02:06.899> question<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.409> what<00:02:08.280> can

usable now the next question is what can

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.160 
usable now the next question is what can
we<00:02:08.549> do<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.790> control<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.329> or<00:02:09.479> prevent<00:02:10.049> it<00:02:10.110> from

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
we do to control it or prevent it from

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.560 
we do to control it or prevent it from
occurring<00:02:10.790> there's<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.850> lot<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.299> different

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
occurring there's a lot of different

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.330 
occurring there's a lot of different
theories<00:02:12.900> around<00:02:13.170> blossom<00:02:13.680> end<00:02:13.829> rot<00:02:13.860> what's

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
theories around blossom end rot what's

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.580 
theories around blossom end rot what's
actually<00:02:14.610> causing<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.360> there's<00:02:16.019> evidence<00:02:16.440> to

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
actually causing it there's evidence to

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.350 
actually causing it there's evidence to
say<00:02:16.799> that<00:02:16.829> the<00:02:17.160> calcium<00:02:17.430> deficiencies

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
say that the calcium deficiencies

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.150 
say that the calcium deficiencies
there's<00:02:18.720> evidence<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.470> maybe<00:02:19.799> it's<00:02:20.070> a

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
there's evidence that maybe it's a

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.699 
there's evidence that maybe it's a
watering<00:02:20.700> issue<00:02:20.880> but<00:02:21.660> whatever<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.170> really<00:02:22.530> is

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
watering issue but whatever it really is

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.710 
watering issue but whatever it really is
it's<00:02:22.980> more<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.280> an<00:02:23.430> environmental<00:02:24.120> issue<00:02:24.239> and

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
it's more of an environmental issue and

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.479 
it's more of an environmental issue and
there<00:02:24.959> isn't<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.320> lot<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.739> we<00:02:25.860> can<00:02:25.890> do<00:02:26.190> for<00:02:26.459> it

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
there isn't a lot that we can do for it

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.550 
there isn't a lot that we can do for it
we<00:02:27.239> know<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.630> we<00:02:27.780> have<00:02:27.930> some<00:02:28.260> tomato

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
we know that we have some tomato

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.630 
we know that we have some tomato
varieties<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.220> are<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> lot<00:02:29.610> more

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
varieties that are a lot more

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.270 
varieties that are a lot more
susceptible<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.109> typically<00:02:31.889> what<00:02:32.130> we

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
susceptible to it so typically what we

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.520 
susceptible to it so typically what we
recommend<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:33.120> if<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:33.930> have<00:02:34.049> a<00:02:34.079> problem<00:02:34.350> this

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
recommend is if you have a problem this

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.590 
recommend is if you have a problem this
year<00:02:34.590> with<00:02:34.859> that<00:02:34.980> tomato<00:02:35.340> variety<00:02:35.699> just<00:02:36.060> don't

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
year with that tomato variety just don't

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.720 
year with that tomato variety just don't
-<00:02:36.750> next<00:02:36.990> year<00:02:37.110> try<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.440> different<00:02:37.860> variety<00:02:38.010> that

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
- next year try a different variety that

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.460 
- next year try a different variety that
may<00:02:38.970> get<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.300> away<00:02:39.420> from<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.840> problem

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
may get you away from the problem

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.250 
may get you away from the problem
can<00:02:41.130> we<00:02:41.250> add<00:02:41.370> calcium<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.210> soil<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.720> help

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
can we add calcium to the soil to help

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.410 
can we add calcium to the soil to help
with<00:02:43.500> that<00:02:43.650> possible<00:02:44.400> calcium<00:02:44.850> deficiency

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
with that possible calcium deficiency

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.780 
with that possible calcium deficiency
and<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:46.110> answer<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.530> no<00:02:46.770> typically<00:02:47.580> we<00:02:47.760> have

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
and the answer is no typically we have

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.150 
and the answer is no typically we have
enough<00:02:48.150> calcium<00:02:48.540> present<00:02:49.200> in<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.710> soil<00:02:49.890> the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
enough calcium present in the soil the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.280 
enough calcium present in the soil the
plants<00:02:50.490> aren't<00:02:50.760> up<00:02:50.880> taking<00:02:51.300> them<00:02:51.420> as<00:02:51.540> up<00:02:51.780> as

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
plants aren't up taking them as up as

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.560 
plants aren't up taking them as up as
much<00:02:52.560> as<00:02:52.740> we<00:02:52.860> actually<00:02:53.070> need<00:02:53.490> available<00:02:54.150> for

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
much as we actually need available for

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.240 
much as we actually need available for
the<00:02:54.630> plant<00:02:54.840> so<00:02:55.020> adding<00:02:55.380> more<00:02:55.500> calcium<00:02:55.890> isn't

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
the plant so adding more calcium isn't

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.460 
the plant so adding more calcium isn't
going<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.460> help<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:57.030> other<00:02:57.780> big<00:02:58.020> key<00:02:58.260> with

variety to blossom in rock typically

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.560 
variety to blossom in rock typically
you're<00:03:10.920> not<00:03:11.040> seeing<00:03:11.370> as<00:03:11.520> much<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:12.270> you<00:03:12.360> want<00:03:12.510> to

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
you're not seeing as much so you want to

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.610 
you're not seeing as much so you want to
make<00:03:12.690> sure<00:03:12.840> you're<00:03:12.990> watering<00:03:13.410> it

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
make sure you're watering it

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.840 
make sure you're watering it
consistently<00:03:14.310> through<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.610> summer

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
consistently through the summer

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.390 
consistently through the summer
especially<00:03:15.570> into<00:03:16.290> those<00:03:16.440> drier<00:03:16.740> days<00:03:17.040> are

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
especially into those drier days are

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.370 
especially into those drier days are
turning<00:03:18.300> off<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.660> hose<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.050> when<00:03:19.140> we<00:03:19.230> get

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
turning off that hose and when we get

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.100 
turning off that hose and when we get
that<00:03:19.590> nice<00:03:20.030> summer<00:03:21.030> rain<00:03:21.300> in<00:03:21.540> July<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.020> August

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
that nice summer rain in July and August

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.710 
that nice summer rain in July and August
but<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.220> other<00:03:23.400> advantage<00:03:23.910> is<00:03:24.030> by<00:03:24.210> having<00:03:24.480> a

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
but the other advantage is by having a

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.780 
but the other advantage is by having a
good<00:03:24.990> watering<00:03:25.470> schedule<00:03:25.980> is<00:03:26.190> you're<00:03:26.640> also

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
good watering schedule is you're also

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.280 
good watering schedule is you're also
going<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.090> prevent<00:03:27.420> your<00:03:27.570> possibility<00:03:28.200> of

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
going to prevent your possibility of

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.260 
going to prevent your possibility of
cracking<00:03:28.830> of<00:03:28.980> your<00:03:29.010> Tomatoes<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:29.850> that's

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
cracking of your Tomatoes and that's

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.580 
cracking of your Tomatoes and that's
where<00:03:30.420> you're<00:03:30.510> gonna<00:03:30.570> get<00:03:30.750> those<00:03:30.960> lesions<00:03:31.290> on

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
where you're gonna get those lesions on

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.860 
where you're gonna get those lesions on
the<00:03:31.710> top<00:03:31.950> on<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.430> castle<00:03:32.850> on<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.210> top<00:03:33.300> part<00:03:33.750> of

the top on the castle on the top part of
that<00:03:34.050> tomato<00:03:34.350> fruit<00:03:34.740> so<00:03:35.310> that's<00:03:35.490> your<00:03:35.730> best

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
that tomato fruit so that's your best

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.260 
that tomato fruit so that's your best
thing<00:03:36.210> if<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:36.870> do<00:03:37.020> watering<00:03:38.090> property<00:03:39.090> a

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
thing if you do watering property a

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.840 
thing if you do watering property a
proper<00:03:39.990> variety<00:03:40.500> selection<00:03:40.830> typically<00:03:41.700> you

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
proper variety selection typically you

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.730 
proper variety selection typically you
should<00:03:41.880> be<00:03:42.060> able<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.390> deter<00:03:42.930> any<00:03:42.960> blossom<00:03:43.650> in

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
should be able to deter any blossom in

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.650 
should be able to deter any blossom in
rot<00:03:43.920> if<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.430> run<00:03:44.580> into<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:44.970> just<00:03:45.180> cut<00:03:45.420> it<00:03:45.540> out

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
rot if you run into it just cut it out
