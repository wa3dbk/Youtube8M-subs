next I'm just going to go through the

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.370 
next I'm just going to go through the
fourth<00:03:58.959> level<00:03:59.170> which<00:03:59.680> was<00:03:59.829> like<00:04:00.069> second<00:04:00.519> high

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
fourth level which was like second high

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.170 
fourth level which was like second high
so<00:04:02.380> I'm<00:04:02.470> just<00:04:02.620> gonna<00:04:02.769> I'm<00:04:03.400> just<00:04:03.459> a<00:04:03.790> here<00:04:04.000> the

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
arms out there my stretch there

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.080 
arms out there my stretch there
so<00:04:13.910> this<00:04:14.120> inspector<00:04:14.600> over<00:04:14.870> split<00:04:15.730> and<00:04:16.730> annexed

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
so this inspector over split and annexed

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.150 
so this inspector over split and annexed
let<00:04:17.209> me<00:04:17.359> do<00:04:17.570> it<00:04:17.780> right<00:04:18.079> here<00:04:18.500> as<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.889> fifth

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
let me do it right here as the fifth

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.450 
let me do it right here as the fifth
level<00:04:19.370> which<00:04:19.820> is<00:04:20.019> like<00:04:21.019> the<00:04:21.680> highest<00:04:21.889> for<00:04:22.430> the

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
level which is like the highest for the

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.520 
level which is like the highest for the
square<00:04:22.820> back<00:04:23.360> sure<00:04:23.540> you<00:04:23.690> can<00:04:23.810> I<00:04:23.900> go<00:04:24.050> beyond<00:04:24.410> the

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
square back sure you can I go beyond the

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.040 
square back sure you can I go beyond the
squares<00:04:24.830> so<00:04:25.510> I'm<00:04:26.510> gonna<00:04:26.630> white-collar

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
squares so I'm gonna white-collar

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.330 
squares so I'm gonna white-collar
squares<00:04:27.410> but<00:04:27.650> okay<00:04:27.919> so<00:04:28.400> this<00:04:28.580> is<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:29.120> highest

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
squares but okay so this is the highest

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.830 
squares but okay so this is the highest
so<00:04:31.340> this<00:04:31.520> is<00:04:31.669> the<00:04:31.820> one<00:04:31.970> I've<00:04:32.120> been<00:04:32.150> working<00:04:32.450> on

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
so this is the one I've been working on

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.500 
so this is the one I've been working on
for<00:04:33.290> a<00:04:33.560> bit<00:04:33.830> time<00:04:34.790> already

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
for a bit time already

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.159 
for a bit time already
so<00:04:35.870> yeah<00:04:36.110> that's<00:04:36.260> fit<00:04:36.500> to<00:04:36.770> test<00:04:37.639> over<00:04:38.000> split<00:04:38.300> so

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
so yeah that's fit to test over split so

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:40.900 
so yeah that's fit to test over split so
this<00:04:39.440> is<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.800> over<00:04:40.070> swing<00:04:40.370> for<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.700> highest

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
this is the over swing for the highest

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.350 
this is the over swing for the highest
I'm<00:04:41.750> just<00:04:42.050> gonna<00:04:42.200> stretch<00:04:42.830> there<00:04:43.220> and<00:04:43.910> do<00:04:44.120> all

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
I'm just gonna stretch there and do all

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.530 
I'm just gonna stretch there and do all
that<00:04:44.390> and<00:04:45.160> yeah<00:04:46.160> it's<00:04:46.610> just<00:04:46.760> a<00:04:46.970> suppressed

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
that and yeah it's just a suppressed

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.530 
that and yeah it's just a suppressed
book<00:04:47.780> like<00:04:47.990> that<00:04:48.200> okay<00:04:49.190> and<00:04:49.400> I<00:04:49.730> put<00:04:49.910> a<00:04:49.940> highest

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
book like that okay and I put a highest

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.350 
book like that okay and I put a highest
one<00:04:50.810> it's<00:04:51.800> what<00:04:52.250> am<00:04:52.340> I<00:04:52.430> going<00:04:52.550> to<00:04:52.610> like<00:04:53.060> start

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
one it's what am I going to like start

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.820 
one it's what am I going to like start
practicing<00:04:53.840> now<00:04:53.870> is<00:04:54.140> the<00:04:54.260> highest<00:04:54.590> I<00:04:54.680> go

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
practicing now is the highest I go

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.250 
practicing now is the highest I go
beyond<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.250> squares<00:04:55.550> so<00:04:56.110> actually<00:04:57.110> I'm<00:04:57.230> just

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
beyond the squares so actually I'm just

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.080 
beyond the squares so actually I'm just
gonna<00:04:57.560> move<00:04:58.010> this<00:04:58.280> a<00:04:58.310> little<00:04:58.490> bit<00:04:58.790> so<00:04:58.910> I<00:04:58.940> guess

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
gonna move this a little bit so I guess

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.940 
gonna move this a little bit so I guess
there<00:04:59.270> should<00:04:59.300> be<00:04:59.510> a<00:04:59.720> bit<00:05:00.050> better<00:05:00.200> feel<00:05:00.800> of<00:05:00.890> a

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
there should be a bit better feel of a

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.250 
there should be a bit better feel of a
square<00:05:01.280> so<00:05:01.790> right<00:05:02.000> here<00:05:02.180> as<00:05:02.450> I<00:05:02.630> go<00:05:02.810> beyond<00:05:03.140> the

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
square so right here as I go beyond the

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.830 
square so right here as I go beyond the
squares<00:05:03.500> so<00:05:03.740> oh<00:05:04.669> when<00:05:04.850> I<00:05:04.880> put<00:05:05.090> my<00:05:05.180> legs<00:05:05.419> up<00:05:05.570> here

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
squares so oh when I put my legs up here

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.240 
squares so oh when I put my legs up here
like<00:05:06.830> this

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.200 

how<00:05:10.250> it<00:05:10.400> hurts<00:05:10.550> a<00:05:10.700> little<00:05:10.820> bit

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
how it hurts a little bit

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.810 
how it hurts a little bit
did<00:05:11.720> you<00:05:11.840> spike<00:05:12.350> a<00:05:12.380> little<00:05:12.710> pillow<00:05:12.979> like

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
did you spike a little pillow like

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.909 
did you spike a little pillow like
whatever<00:05:14.330> I<00:05:14.390> suppose<00:05:14.720> and<00:05:15.440> I'm<00:05:15.530> just<00:05:15.650> pulling

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
whatever I suppose and I'm just pulling

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.010 
whatever I suppose and I'm just pulling
right<00:05:16.040> here<00:05:16.370> and<00:05:17.030> then<00:05:17.240> pull<00:05:17.390> my<00:05:17.479> legs<00:05:17.750> up

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
right here and then pull my legs up

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.520 
right here and then pull my legs up
there<00:05:18.260> like<00:05:18.979> this<00:05:19.270> against<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.630> pillow<00:05:21.140> and

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
there like this against the pillow and

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.680 
there like this against the pillow and
then<00:05:22.130> you<00:05:22.250> can<00:05:22.430> just<00:05:22.610> do<00:05:22.820> your<00:05:22.850> over<00:05:23.330> split

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
then you can just do your over split

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.740 
then you can just do your over split
like<00:05:24.080> this<00:05:24.380> so<00:05:25.370> there's<00:05:25.610> this<00:05:25.789> what<00:05:26.090> I<00:05:26.120> did<00:05:26.510> I

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
like this so there's this what I did I

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.190 
like this so there's this what I did I
want<00:05:27.320> to<00:05:27.410> work<00:05:27.860> on<00:05:28.070> who<00:05:28.310> my<00:05:28.400> over<00:05:28.700> split<00:05:29.200> and

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
want to work on who my over split and

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
working on it's like beyond the squares
