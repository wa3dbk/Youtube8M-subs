00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.809
 and 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.520
 hello everyone welcome today we are going to 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:25.910
 teach how to hydrate dehydrated mushrooms 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.190
 in this video we are going to show you how 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.720
 rehydrate in the mushrooms in this case 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.160
 we have some trumpets of the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.050
 death 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.480
 and the process is very simple is 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.650
 interesting to explain how it hydrates 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.380
 because many times we go to 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.110
 supermarket and we see that there is a great 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.629
 variety of mushrooms dehydrated but without 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.670
 However, we do not know exactly how 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.680
 could rehydrate and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.630
 later how could we use 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.430
 what we are going to do is extendable to 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.370
 any type of mushroom either a paulette 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.310
 or it can be chanterelle could be 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.570
 senderuela cucharete what you 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.690
 you can see in the supermarket what can you do 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.780
 following these steps is very simple 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:12.290
 let's fire our casserole 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.560
 and in it we are going to simply pour 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.560
 Water 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.149
 today we are going to look for him to raise the boil 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.460
 once it starts to boil we will turn off 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.799
 we will throw the mushrooms and let 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.829
 go infusion 'no and rehydrating by 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.909
 space of about 50 to 40 minutes 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.880
 depending on the use that you are going to give 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.500
 then the mushrooms it is convenient to think 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.990
 that if we will use the broth for 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.390
 example to wet a rice or to wet 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.030
 a risotto that we can enrich 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.469
 giving it the flavor with salt or with 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.380
 any other type of vegetables 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:48.530
 we are in concrete, we are going to 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.610
 use to make a risotto and you 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.950
 let's put some salt 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.480
 because the mushroom obviously goes without salt 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.380
 then in this way it will take flavor 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.969
 to take them to the mushroom and also 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.469
 the broth in which we are going to wet 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.469
 later our risotto 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.360
 we find it very interesting to use 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.210
 this type of mushrooms because then 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.760
 that was that broth with all the flavor and 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.190
 all the extracts that give the recipes 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.930
 and we are worth to do not only the 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.920
 rice but we could also make a 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.920
 lots of stews from 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.470
 of calderetas or viewer of meat to which 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.870
 we will incorporate the mushrooms because 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.200
 we can give all the flavor with this 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.200
 broth 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.860
 well, you see that it's practically starting 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.860
 To boil 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.650
 once boil it will turn off and 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.720
 we will leave there 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.170
 well then we would have the water ready 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.069
 to boil 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.650
 we just turn off 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.730
 and pour our dehydrated mushrooms 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.769
 so they go re hydrating 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.599
 you do not need to be page or anything 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.180
 Let there simply for space 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:05.060
 50 minutes you will see that the water is going 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.650
 to go having a dark color as it is 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.379
 the color of the mushroom itself 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.090
 and in turn the mushroom will be taking all that 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:16.019
 moisture that he had lost and return to a 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.860
 little not 100% to its original state 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.070
 but quite similar 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.620
 Well, 50 minutes have passed and 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.200
 you see the dark tonality that has 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.850
 caught the water that we had poured 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.190
 It has become a perfect broth of 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.130
 mushrooms and on the other hand we would have the 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.830
 mushrooms perfectly rehydrated now 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.910
 what we are going to do is going to be 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:42.120
 pour the here to drain the 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.050
 and so get on the one hand the zeta and for 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.050
 another side the broth 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.110
 then the mushrooms evidently increase 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.080
 of size we could 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.100
 cut if necessary and if not then 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.390
 we could use them as is 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.390
 we are going to them 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.200
 to put here so that I will do well 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.180
 well that would be the process for 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.130
 rehydrate the mushrooms then already 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.690
 we would have on one side the broth with everything 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.489
 the taste of the mushrooms that we could 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.820
 use as I said before to wet 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.290
 Risotto risottos or enrich sauces and 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.710
 On the other hand, it is perfectly 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.470
 re hydrated 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.720
 and ready for incorporation into 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.539
 any kind of stew and this would be the 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.160
 way to rehydrate some mushrooms in this 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.160
 Trumpets of death case
