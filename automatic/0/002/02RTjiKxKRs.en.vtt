yeah I thought she'd laid eggs and then

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.310 
yeah I thought she'd laid eggs and then
she'd<00:03:38.350> just<00:03:38.500> eaten<00:03:38.709> a<00:03:38.800> ton<00:03:38.980> of<00:03:39.010> salad<00:03:40.290> but<00:03:41.290> I

she'd just eaten a ton of salad but I

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.370 
she'd just eaten a ton of salad but I
looked<00:03:41.709> through<00:03:41.890> all<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.310> sand<00:03:42.820> and<00:03:43.380> there

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
looked through all the sand and there

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.410 
looked through all the sand and there
was<00:03:44.500> no<00:03:44.920> eggs<00:03:45.250> through<00:03:45.610> there<00:03:45.850> so<00:03:46.120> that<00:03:46.150> was

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
was no eggs through there so that was

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.199 
was no eggs through there so that was
really<00:03:46.450> strange<00:03:46.989> and<00:03:47.560> then<00:03:48.430> I<00:03:48.610> asked<00:03:49.090> my

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
really strange and then I asked my

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.410 
really strange and then I asked my
friend<00:03:49.480> he<00:03:49.690> said<00:03:49.930> that

no sand on her either which you'd

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.510 
no sand on her either which you'd
normally<00:04:08.010> come<00:04:08.400> out<00:04:08.720> covered<00:04:09.720> in<00:04:09.840> sand<00:04:10.520> so

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
normally come out covered in sand so

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.800 
normally come out covered in sand so
I've<00:04:11.610> looks<00:04:11.850> like<00:04:12.060> all<00:04:12.270> through<00:04:12.660> the

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
I've looks like all through the

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.410 
I've looks like all through the
enclosure<00:04:13.200> and<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:13.950> can't<00:04:14.730> find<00:04:14.970> any<00:04:15.180> eggs

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
enclosure and I can't find any eggs

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.490 
enclosure and I can't find any eggs
which<00:04:15.810> is<00:04:16.019> really<00:04:16.410> weird<00:04:17.690> so<00:04:18.690> maybe<00:04:19.139> she

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
which is really weird so maybe she

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.949 
which is really weird so maybe she
wasn't<00:04:19.709> pregnant<00:04:20.040> in<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.459> first<00:04:20.489> place<00:04:20.910> but<00:04:21.630> I

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
wasn't pregnant in the first place but I

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.640 
wasn't pregnant in the first place but I
definitely<00:04:22.770> thought<00:04:23.040> she<00:04:23.250> was<00:04:23.780> so<00:04:24.780> anyone<00:04:25.350> who

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
definitely thought she was so anyone who

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.030 
definitely thought she was so anyone who
was<00:04:26.400> expecting<00:04:26.940> to<00:04:26.970> get<00:04:27.240> a<00:04:27.300> dragon<00:04:27.900> from<00:04:28.770> Daisy

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
was expecting to get a dragon from Daisy

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.040 
was expecting to get a dragon from Daisy
and<00:04:29.250> little<00:04:29.520> Reds<00:04:29.700> clutch<00:04:30.240> maybe<00:04:30.690> that<00:04:30.930> won't

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
and little Reds clutch maybe that won't

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.590 
and little Reds clutch maybe that won't
be<00:04:31.229> possible<00:04:31.260> now<00:04:31.940> but<00:04:32.940> I'm<00:04:33.060> still<00:04:33.389> going<00:04:33.510> to

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
be possible now but I'm still going to

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.120 
be possible now but I'm still going to
try<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:33.840> breed<00:04:34.110> them<00:04:34.350> if<00:04:34.530> they<00:04:34.919> haven't

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
try and breed them if they haven't

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.730 
try and breed them if they haven't
already<00:04:35.310> bread<00:04:35.639> already<00:04:35.790> but<00:04:36.500> I'll<00:04:37.500> be<00:04:37.650> able

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
already bread already but I'll be able

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.980 
already bread already but I'll be able
to<00:04:37.889> tell<00:04:38.100> within<00:04:38.430> probably<00:04:39.360> about<00:04:39.630> three

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
to tell within probably about three

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.550 
to tell within probably about three
weeks<00:04:40.229> or<00:04:40.680> so<00:04:40.740> because<00:04:42.200> that's<00:04:43.200> about<00:04:43.470> the

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
weeks or so because that's about the

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.500 
weeks or so because that's about the
time<00:04:43.590> period<00:04:44.130> they<00:04:44.370> take<00:04:44.610> between<00:04:44.820> clutches

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
time period they take between clutches

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
only going to buy two of the three so

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.610 
only going to buy two of the three so
someone<00:06:23.160> else<00:06:23.250> offered<00:06:23.490> to<00:06:23.820> buy<00:06:23.940> three<00:06:24.270> so<00:06:24.620> he

someone else offered to buy three so he

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.140 
someone else offered to buy three so he
obviously<00:06:25.800> went<00:06:26.310> with<00:06:26.610> them<00:06:26.820> which<00:06:27.120> is

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
obviously went with them which is

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:34.310 
obviously went with them which is
disappointing<00:06:27.510> but<00:06:29.060> yeah<00:06:30.380> so<00:06:32.630> the<00:06:33.630> reason<00:06:33.840> for

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
disappointing but yeah so the reason for

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.260 
disappointing but yeah so the reason for
disassembling<00:06:35.010> these<00:06:35.220> enclosures<00:06:35.580> down<00:06:35.940> here

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
disassembling these enclosures down here

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.170 
disassembling these enclosures down here
is<00:06:36.960> because<00:06:37.230> they're<00:06:37.500> not<00:06:37.850> that<00:06:38.850> attractive

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
is because they're not that attractive

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.240 
is because they're not that attractive
and<00:06:39.660> they're<00:06:39.750> not<00:06:39.900> very<00:06:40.170> practical<00:06:40.470> either

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
and they're not very practical either

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.340 
and they're not very practical either
because<00:06:41.760> we<00:06:42.420> want<00:06:42.600> to<00:06:42.690> get<00:06:42.810> like<00:06:42.930> four

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350 
because we want to get like four

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.390 
because we want to get like four
enclosures<00:06:43.980> here<00:06:44.190> so<00:06:44.430> like<00:06:45.890> so<00:06:46.890> like<00:06:46.920> this

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
enclosures here so like so like this

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.850 
enclosures here so like so like this
like<00:06:48.090> if<00:06:48.240> we<00:06:48.390> build<00:06:48.660> them<00:06:48.840> it<00:06:49.470> will<00:06:49.530> just<00:06:49.710> get

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
like if we build them it will just get

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.180 
like if we build them it will just get
like<00:06:50.010> two<00:06:50.630> like<00:06:51.630> this<00:06:51.840> maybe<00:06:52.410> or<00:06:52.650> like<00:06:52.680> three

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.190 
like two like this maybe or like three

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.490 
like two like this maybe or like three
stack<00:06:53.550> of<00:06:53.700> three<00:06:53.960> so<00:06:54.960> we<00:06:55.020> can<00:06:55.140> have<00:06:55.230> six

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
stack of three so we can have six

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.840 
stack of three so we can have six
enclosures<00:06:56.040> out<00:06:56.190> there<00:06:56.400> which<00:06:56.580> would<00:06:56.730> be

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:56.850 
enclosures out there which would be

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:02.060 
enclosures out there which would be
really<00:06:57.060> good<00:06:59.390> so<00:07:00.390> yeah<00:07:00.510> just<00:07:00.950> thought<00:07:01.950> I'd

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.070 
really good so yeah just thought I'd

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.250 
really good so yeah just thought I'd
tell<00:07:02.100> you<00:07:02.430> tell<00:07:02.790> you<00:07:02.820> that<00:07:03.030> because<00:07:03.260> it's

tell you tell you that because it's

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.600 
tell you tell you that because it's
probably<00:07:04.500> going<00:07:04.650> to<00:07:04.710> happen<00:07:04.980> within<00:07:05.190> the<00:07:05.550> next

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:05.610 
probably going to happen within the next

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.000 
probably going to happen within the next
few<00:07:06.030> months<00:07:06.210> because<00:07:06.690> of<00:07:06.720> all<00:07:07.590> the<00:07:07.710> bearded

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.010
