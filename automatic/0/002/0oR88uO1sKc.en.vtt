00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.370
 we report live from the 2 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.370
 the situation remained out of control 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:16.119
 Bonn 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.410
 my team and me we need to reinforce security is no more 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.380
 guaranteed 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.550
 Nevertheless, hold the position and report live 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.880
 in it sees the round of the 9 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.109
 and long awaited I am a different country 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.810
 hardly on the and the Modern Warfare 2 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.769
 after more than successful first part of the Modern Warfare series 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:43.149
 Infinity Ward now dares to do exactly two years later 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.300
 with the second part of her new war epic under the critical eye 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.300
 the player 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.920
 we have fought out of her for her blood 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.540
 but actually it's very sensational 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.890
 Once Upon a time 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.870
 well that's probably the wrong approach to having history of a college judy game 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.860
 to start 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.989
 so far, there is still another way 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.280
 five years after the events of the first part of the player hatches 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.950
 again in different roles 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.430
 so you experience the story around Modern Warfare 2 just different 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.480
 perspectives 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.540
 Initially, all these fragments had no rightful connection 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.990
 however, the threads Estoril gradually come together and you rise 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.000
 more and more into the finesse of the narrated story 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.600
 Although you may not expect a bestselling novel 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.780
 but the only story remains until the last battle 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.970
 Also in this part you will again screw the series at the Patriotism 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.970
 was filmed but that is where you are typically American 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.130
 The player first finds himself on a military base movie where in 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.050
 After the training runs, the player gets the right one for him 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.180
 Difficulty levels are suggested these formalities are done 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.979
 but then without further detours directly into the battle alarm sirens 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.890
 the first injured and the player gets a new turn with patriotism 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.459
 built up proverbs as while the mightiest military power in the 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.339
 History of humanity as he is not uncommon in this game 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:24.889
 until this allusion to the war was over for one in one 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:26.740
 realistic pictures war zone 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.269
 with Hollywood action like 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.549
 as is customary in modern shooting, it has become a superfluous Shaft 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.329
 and so the view is limited to a few informational 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:37.199
 Elementa 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:41.389
 As a health indicator the player should have blood spatter in the field of vision 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.010
 once you are close to death 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.760
 So a short discovery is enough to regenerate 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.269
 and be able to quickly intervene in the game again w 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.269
 in vain and outside ammunition and show during a firefight 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.320
 Nothing more distracting from a full load of Cole of Duty 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.320
 could 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:09.249
 According to Infinity Ward, a mission should be too hard for weak ones 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:12.809
 Be tense for the player there is always the option this easy too 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:17.029
 skip but who wants to skip over here often the man 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:17.979
 gefahndet 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.199
 to write one 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.569
 to see the markets 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.819
 the court 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.189
 In addition to the normal shooter elements, the player is allowed to play again 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.300
 let several Megans arise to try 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.249
 six times into the steering wheel 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:35.929
 because his comrade was just struck down or sometimes even on a ski mobile 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:38.929
 like James Bond racing down a steep slope 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.119
 KR 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.349
 The arsenal retains the usual techniques of the meal 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.840
 about handguns applicants rocket launchers and diverse 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.900
 Support from the air 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.900
 many with everything 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.339
 wherever you look, the game shines with so much action 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:05.750
 and so only the quieter missions as a sniper remain 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.750
 to get some air 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.889
 Modern Warfare 2 once again impresses with an incredibly realistic 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:26.480
 graphic 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.620
 and raises the bar for the shooter genre a whole lot higher 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.060
 even the characters are again more than successful animated no other 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.150
 Development team is currently making a critical falls so engaging 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.440
 and so the game points in its macabre but realistic way 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.189
 the games from the first minute simple tips 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:47.189
 but honestly, we did not expect anything else 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:54.100
 the soundtrack adapts to the current gameplay 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.330
 And so every action scene becomes a feast for the ears 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.489
 and put one to the last minute a real war woman 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:10.749
 Cologne 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.169
 it has not changed here to its predecessor and so the player is after 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:38.850
 and collect experience points 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.410
 Steins son up his military ranks and can be with his alter ego 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.360
 various extras or to stay in the c and the language parks 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.360
 equip which will be gradually released for him 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.379
 Felix Hoffmann continues to be well rewarded for Kate in the first part only 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:58.419
 the ua v the air raid and the helicopter as additional callable 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.600
 Weapons Widened Infiniti has now added another 12 options to the package 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:07.740
 for the tactical atomic bomb an incredible 25 kids are needed at one go 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.389
 as game modes, they are familiar with the 14 known modes of the first part 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.389
 where initially only three of them are unlocked 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:21.169
 You can see that Infinity Ward is hardly moving away from old good concepts 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.619
 wanted and rather relies on proven 

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:26.889
 however the multiplayer waits with new maps as well as due to the changed 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:30.499
 Parks with many new tactical options on 

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:34.149
 beyond the usual multiplayer, the player still has the option 

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:37.160
 one of the numerous special forces missions 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.160
 Join a friend online or via split screen 

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:44.729
 Infiniti wanted stunts here very clearly 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:48.539
 even without big new concepts the shooter of the year 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:52.610
 Due to the sometimes quite macabre missions, Modern Warfare 2 has become the real one 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.849
 USA 18 all the time 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:58.059
 this sounds almost like a seal of quality for concentrated action 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:59.969
 never was 

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:03.209
 Already in the apron very controversial scene at the airport easily for the 

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:04.869
 German market changed 

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:08.180
 the bottom line is a pat on the back for the development team 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.930
 great hope for a sequel 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.060
 and then maybe with a little less American patriotism 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.820
 awe 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.969
 KR 

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:22.439
 an own goal after a cross 

00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:27.649
 continue 

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:37.169
 Alarm message for levies
