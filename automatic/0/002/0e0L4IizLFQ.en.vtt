00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.320 
headphones so trained emotes and as you
can<00:04:35.080> see<00:04:35.139> that<00:04:35.470> a<00:04:35.500> bit<00:04:35.650> so<00:04:36.580> I<00:04:36.610> mapped<00:04:36.910> already

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
can see that a bit so I mapped already

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.529 
can see that a bit so I mapped already
inside<00:04:37.840> I<00:04:38.310> mean<00:04:39.310> first<00:04:39.550> of<00:04:39.729> all<00:04:39.880> when<00:04:40.419> I'm

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539

inside I mean first of all when I'm
compared<00:04:40.960> with<00:04:41.139> me<00:04:41.259> I'm<00:04:41.560> comparing<00:04:42.009> them

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
compared with me I'm comparing them

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.310 
compared with me I'm comparing them
against<00:04:42.759> an<00:04:42.910> extremely<00:04:43.539> expensive<00:04:43.690> second

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
against an extremely expensive second

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.070 
against an extremely expensive second
headphones<00:04:44.740> saw<00:04:45.130> as<00:04:45.550> an<00:04:45.789> unfair<00:04:46.180> comparison<00:04:46.600> I

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
headphones saw as an unfair comparison I

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.529 
headphones saw as an unfair comparison I
would<00:04:47.800> have<00:04:48.039> to<00:04:48.160> see<00:04:48.340> it<00:04:48.430> for<00:04:48.610> 25<00:04:49.030> pounds<00:04:49.300> if

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
would have to see it for 25 pounds if

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:50.730 
would have to see it for 25 pounds if
