00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.449
 with this headline 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.759
 I want to show you how I got this cd with the body to install windows xp 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.079
 service pack 3 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.409
 with all the updates so far 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.409
 on your computer on sata hard disk 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.070
 josé sciara download it and at the end I will also show you how to install it 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.090
 for those who do not belong 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.090
 I'm going to show you how they downloaded 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.670
 a shock 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.670
 with jumps and with all the updates 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.680
 until the last moment of official windows update 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.490
 Well to the search engine Google books crisis 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.790
 taringa 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.190
 iso 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.300
 xp sp3 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.540
 I heard jinán 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.390
 jumps 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.680
 upta 3 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.330
 eight setbacks key tests 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.430
 and that search 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.760
 interesting here you will find in taringa results like this one that says 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.870
 xp 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.620
 stryper original text 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.640
 more Astori than you have until February 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.710
 but we must do is 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.360
 look for those of the month in which we are to download them more 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.140
 the clearest 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.850
 that's why we are August 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.850
 we can use the search engine to search for August 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.490
 but we see that the people who make their national state have not left 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.980
 we leave one month before July and we have them here 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.980
 you get lost modern proof that we give 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.960
 and even there as you know how to hire and you do not have to have the links 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.240
 you download the iso recording a baby 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.169
 and take advantage of moving the installation 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:15.689
 The first thing is to put or give up the computer sector 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:30.769
 with the clutch disc he senator 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.769
 olont cannes if you have it off 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.199
 it will not come out 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:42.199
 they were followed 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.789
 this screen and capture 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.469
 and it's this time longer 

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:00.399
 once all the files are loaded or disappear here 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.259
 In all this 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.449
 who he part we do not have to do the partitions 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:09.369
 so here below we have 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.369
 disk of so much space 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.639
 on the bus 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:15.749
 tab no 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:19.319
 we hold is patena part that nobody and we can follow and effective 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.029
 we have esther install 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:24.689
 to create partition ponce three outputs 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:27.149
 we create a partition 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:29.099
 it does not say how much we want it 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.329
 for that reason the one of doing the maximum that the hard disk admits that they are 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.639
 7 10 gigas 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.789
 and this we have here 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.389
 parted in 1 new original 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.749
 the listener 

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:43.669
 is to install 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:47.349
 inform you of the life partition mix formats mt s 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.999
 so that they take less time may want to give faster 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:57.929
 now it is clear form 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.599
 the files will be copied 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.689
 and the rest the process is automated 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:09.619
 we will have to put our of these licenses the key that come well 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.109
 that come in end packages 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.879
 and also in our name the date on the location 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.990
 he is copying files and I leave that if it is not going to be very long 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.690
 good luck with those who have to do this process if you have any 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.550
 doubt the comment box 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.909
 that is what is below you can 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:32.189
 you can put whatever you want
