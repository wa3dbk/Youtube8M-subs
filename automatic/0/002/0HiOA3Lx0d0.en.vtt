00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
straight and so it starts to wobble just

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.840 
straight and so it starts to wobble just
a<00:01:35.909> little<00:01:36.119> bit<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:38.220> gets<00:01:38.430> worse<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
a little bit in it and it gets worse and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.130 
a little bit in it and it gets worse and

it keeps getting worse if you can catch
it<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:47.009> time<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.220> you're<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.820> you're<00:01:47.909> smart

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.810 
it in time and you're and you're smart
enough<00:01:48.810> about<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.409> accelerating<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.460> actually

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
enough about it accelerating is actually

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.249 
enough about it accelerating is actually
probably<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.329> best<00:01:51.420> way<00:01:51.750> out<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.140> because

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
probably the best way out of it because

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.260 
probably the best way out of it because
you<00:01:52.470> want<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.710> let<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.950> want<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.220> lighten<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
you want to let you want to lighten the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.330 
you want to let you want to lighten the
load<00:01:54.299> on<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.720> front<00:01:55.020> wheels<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.799> can

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
load on the front wheels so that it can

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.160 
load on the front wheels so that it can
straighten<00:01:56.759> out<00:01:56.850> again<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.990> can

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
straighten out again and you can you can

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.069 
straighten out again and you can you can
put<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.469> back<00:01:58.500> down<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.130> keep<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.030> straight

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
put it back down and keep it straight

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.170 
put it back down and keep it straight
worst<00:02:01.710> thing<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:01.979> can<00:02:02.100> do<00:02:02.280> ever<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.880> hit<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
worst thing you can do ever is hit the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.459 
worst thing you can do ever is hit the
brake<00:02:03.360> because<00:02:03.869> you're<00:02:04.049> going<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.229> you're

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
brake because you're going to you're

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.690 
brake because you're going to you're
going<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.649> put<00:02:04.770> more<00:02:04.950> pressure<00:02:05.130> on<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.490> tire

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
going to put more pressure on the tire

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.940 
going to put more pressure on the tire
and<00:02:06.149> if<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.719> do<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.990> when<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.350> already<00:02:07.560> at

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
and if you do that when it's already at

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.339 
and if you do that when it's already at
an<00:02:08.129> angle<00:02:08.520> then<00:02:08.819> you're<00:02:09.119> just<00:02:09.330> bikes<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.289> to

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
an angle then you're just bikes going to

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:10.820 
an angle then you're just bikes going to
flip

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
flip

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.480 
flip
yeah<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:13.020> basic<00:02:13.320> of<00:02:13.440> this<00:02:13.560> is<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.980> the

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
yeah so the basic of this is the the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.870 
yeah so the basic of this is the the
standard<00:02:14.940> stock<00:02:15.180> unit<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.750> crap<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.770> mean<00:02:17.760> it

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
standard stock unit is crap I mean it

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.130 
standard stock unit is crap I mean it
does<00:02:18.060> work<00:02:18.300> better<00:02:18.570> than<00:02:18.780> not<00:02:18.930> having

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
does work better than not having

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.740 
does work better than not having
anything<00:02:19.440> at<00:02:19.650> all<00:02:19.740> but<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:21.330> one<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.660> an

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
anything at all but this one is an

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.750 
anything at all but this one is an
adjustable<00:02:22.230> one<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.740> believe<00:02:23.250> there<00:02:23.370> are<00:02:23.430> 16

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
adjustable one I believe there are 16

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.790 
adjustable one I believe there are 16
clicks<00:02:24.030> on<00:02:24.210> it<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.540> think<00:02:24.600> right<00:02:25.560> down<00:02:25.710> the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
clicks on it and I think right down the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.020 
clicks on it and I think right down the
middle<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.070> road<00:02:26.100> about<00:02:26.400> eight<00:02:26.580> clicks<00:02:26.880> is

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
middle the road about eight clicks is

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.140 
middle the road about eight clicks is
probably<00:02:27.360> pretty<00:02:27.540> good<00:02:28.340> I'm<00:02:29.340> not<00:02:29.700> really<00:02:29.940> that

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
probably pretty good I'm not really that

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.420 
probably pretty good I'm not really that
much<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.600> race<00:02:31.260> or<00:02:31.440> anything<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.980> know<00:02:32.130> the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
much of a race or anything to know the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.570 
much of a race or anything to know the
difference<00:02:32.790> but<00:02:33.530> if<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.920> situation<00:02:35.490> of

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
difference but if that situation of

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.910 
difference but if that situation of
arises<00:02:35.940> with<00:02:36.030> me<00:02:36.180> again<00:02:36.450> I'm<00:02:37.050> hoping<00:02:37.530> this<00:02:37.710> one

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
arises with me again I'm hoping this one

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.860 
arises with me again I'm hoping this one
will<00:02:37.950> this<00:02:38.520> better<00:02:39.060> unit<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.660> better

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
will this better unit this better

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.020 
will this better unit this better
steering<00:02:40.200> dampener<00:02:40.590> will<00:02:40.800> help<00:02:41.610> me<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:41.850> little

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
steering dampener will help me a little

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.060 
steering dampener will help me a little
bit<00:02:42.210> better<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:43.230> kind<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.650> get<00:02:43.770> out<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:43.980> that

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
bit better to kind of get out of that

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.130 
bit better to kind of get out of that
hopefully<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.090> never<00:02:45.120> happens<00:02:45.480> again<00:02:45.540> but<00:02:45.810> you

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
hopefully it never happens again but you

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.390 
hopefully it never happens again but you
never<00:02:46.290> know<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.560> guys<00:02:46.710> prepare<00:02:47.070> for<00:02:47.250> worse

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
never know you guys prepare for worse

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.460 
never know you guys prepare for worse
right<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.420> anyways<00:02:48.720> replacing<00:02:49.200> this<00:02:49.320> is

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
right so anyways replacing this is

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.050 
right so anyways replacing this is
pretty<00:02:49.860> simple<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.370> do<00:02:50.459> not<00:02:50.610> need<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.880> have<00:02:51.030> a

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
pretty simple you do not need to have a

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.750 
pretty simple you do not need to have a
whole<00:02:51.360> top<00:02:51.630> end<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.959> bike<00:02:52.140> off<00:02:52.760> it's

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
whole top end of the bike off it's

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.780 
whole top end of the bike off it's
pretty<00:02:53.940> easy<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.150> get<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.709> you<00:02:55.709> it's<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.640> lot

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
pretty easy to get to you it's a lot

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.030 
pretty easy to get to you it's a lot
easier<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.120> do<00:02:57.240> it<00:02:57.270> without<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:58.050> without<00:02:58.860> a

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
easier to do it without a without a

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.570 
easier to do it without a without a
front<00:02:59.280> stand<00:02:59.550> on<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.880> just<00:03:00.000> took<00:03:00.120> my<00:03:00.270> stand<00:03:00.570> off

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
front stand on it just took my stand off

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.949 
front stand on it just took my stand off
because<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:02.700> had<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:03.000> been<00:03:03.180> work<00:03:03.390> on<00:03:03.570> it<00:03:03.750> but

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
because I had that been work on it but

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.470 
because I had that been work on it but
pretty<00:03:04.170> much<00:03:04.230> there's<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.740> bolt<00:03:04.980> or<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.880> stud

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
pretty much there's a bolt or a stud

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.050 
pretty much there's a bolt or a stud
here<00:03:06.750> coming<00:03:07.080> down<00:03:07.230> off<00:03:07.530> of<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:08.040> frame<00:03:08.640> right

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
here coming down off of the frame right

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.500 
here coming down off of the frame right
below<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.450> air<00:03:09.630> dam<00:03:11.120> coming<00:03:12.120> off<00:03:12.209> there<00:03:12.420> and

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
below the air dam coming off there and

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.229 
below the air dam coming off there and
there's<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.720> bolt<00:03:12.959> screwed<00:03:13.680> into<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:13.950> bottom

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
there's a bolt screwed into the bottom

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.220 
there's a bolt screwed into the bottom
this<00:03:15.239> little<00:03:15.600> plastic<00:03:15.989> cover<00:03:16.370> just<00:03:17.370> pops<00:03:17.610> off

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
this little plastic cover just pops off

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.540 
this little plastic cover just pops off
it<00:03:19.230> was<00:03:19.350> handy<00:03:19.650> knowing<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:20.070> because<00:03:20.310> then<00:03:20.430> I

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
it was handy knowing that because then I

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.250 
it was handy knowing that because then I
could<00:03:20.610> clean<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.180> bugs<00:03:21.390> off<00:03:21.570> but<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:22.140> only

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
could clean the bugs off but it only

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.590 
could clean the bugs off but it only
fits<00:03:22.530> this<00:03:22.739> unit<00:03:23.100> so<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.880> öhlins<00:03:24.239> does<00:03:24.420> not

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
fits this unit so the öhlins does not

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.600 
fits this unit so the öhlins does not
come<00:03:25.050> with<00:03:25.170> its<00:03:25.320> own<00:03:25.440> so<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:26.190> goes<00:03:26.370> in<00:03:26.519> the

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
come with its own so that goes in the

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
come with its own so that goes in the
box<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:27.300> course<00:03:27.450> that's<00:03:27.989> all<00:03:28.200> my<00:03:28.380> broken<00:03:29.190> bits

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
box of course that's all my broken bits

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.900 
box of course that's all my broken bits
and<00:03:30.830> this<00:03:31.830> pretty<00:03:32.070> much<00:03:32.280> just<00:03:32.489> goes<00:03:32.670> on<00:03:32.880> just

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
and this pretty much just goes on just

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.990 
and this pretty much just goes on just
like<00:03:33.239> this<00:03:33.450> we're<00:03:34.200> going<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.410> replace<00:03:34.650> that

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
like this we're going to replace that

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.729 
like this we're going to replace that
bolt<00:03:36.090> eight<00:03:36.239> millimeter<00:03:36.720> with<00:03:37.260> this<00:03:37.410> one<00:03:37.560> over

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
bolt eight millimeter with this one over

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.320 
bolt eight millimeter with this one over
here<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.459> adjustment<00:03:38.880> knob<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.120> over

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
here and the adjustment knob is over

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.960 
here and the adjustment knob is over
here<00:03:39.540> so<00:03:40.170> really<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.530> very<00:03:40.739> simple<00:03:41.220> change<00:03:42.060> over

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
here so really a very simple change over

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.540 
here so really a very simple change over
the<00:03:44.970> higher<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:45.959> go<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.980> clicks<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.400> should

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
the higher you go and clicks I should

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.820 
the higher you go and clicks I should
say<00:03:47.730> to<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:48.060> right<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:48.510> believe<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:49.650> actually

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
say to the right I believe you actually

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.420 
say to the right I believe you actually
increase<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.940> resistance<00:03:51.750> of<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:53.070> turning

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
increase the resistance of the turning

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.880 
increase the resistance of the turning
of<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.580> forks<00:03:54.030> against<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.780> against<00:03:55.769> the

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
of the forks against the against the

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.880 
of the forks against the against the
frame<00:03:56.100> basically<00:03:56.489> so<00:03:57.470> it<00:03:58.470> might<00:03:58.620> get<00:03:58.769> the

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
frame basically so it might get the

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.199 
frame basically so it might get the
point<00:03:59.100> where<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.310> might<00:03:59.430> even<00:03:59.550> go<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.760> feel<00:04:00.060> it

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
point where you might even go to feel it

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.240 
point where you might even go to feel it
most<00:04:00.420> of<00:04:00.540> time<00:04:00.690> you<00:04:01.200> know<00:04:01.320> because<00:04:02.070> you're

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
most of time you know because you're

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.860 
most of time you know because you're
putting<00:04:02.489> input<00:04:02.940> in<00:04:03.120> from<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.480> end<00:04:03.630> of<00:04:03.780> the

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
putting input in from the end of the

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.590 
putting input in from the end of the
bars<00:04:04.110> you<00:04:05.040> know<00:04:05.160> you<00:04:05.730> won't<00:04:06.090> feel<00:04:06.300> that<00:04:06.360> much

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
bars you know you won't feel that much

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.910 
bars you know you won't feel that much
because<00:04:06.720> you've<00:04:06.959> got<00:04:07.110> leverage<00:04:07.350> but<00:04:07.680> if<00:04:07.799> you

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
because you've got leverage but if you

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.590 
because you've got leverage but if you
were<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.100> feel<00:04:08.280> it<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.970> know<00:04:09.000> trying<00:04:09.330> to<00:04:09.390> pull

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
were to feel it you know trying to pull

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.840 
were to feel it you know trying to pull
on<00:04:09.720> this<00:04:09.870> rod<00:04:10.380> or<00:04:10.590> they<00:04:10.680> clicks<00:04:11.010> or<00:04:11.160> so<00:04:11.310> you<00:04:11.370> can

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
on this rod or they clicks or so you can

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.650 
on this rod or they clicks or so you can
definitely<00:04:12.360> feel<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:13.040> compression<00:04:14.040> so

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
definitely feel the compression so

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.400 
definitely feel the compression so
anyways<00:04:15.660> let's<00:04:15.840> switch<00:04:15.959> that<00:04:16.109> over<00:04:16.320> real

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
anyways let's switch that over real

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.270 
anyways let's switch that over real
quick<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.709> see<00:04:16.859> how<00:04:16.950> it<00:04:17.100> looks<00:04:18.799> get<00:04:19.799> real<00:04:20.010> quick

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
quick to see how it looks get real quick

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.220 
quick to see how it looks get real quick
I<00:04:20.459> do<00:04:20.520> need<00:04:20.729> to<00:04:20.820> show<00:04:20.850> you<00:04:21.030> something

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
I do need to show you something

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.540 
I do need to show you something
have<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:23.330> to<00:04:24.330> do<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.480> get<00:04:24.660> this<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:24.930> fit<00:04:25.170> and<00:04:25.550> I'm

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
have to to do to get this to fit and I'm

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.540 
have to to do to get this to fit and I'm
not<00:04:26.670> sure<00:04:26.820> if<00:04:26.970> this<00:04:27.120> öhlins<00:04:28.250> student<00:04:29.250> dampener

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
not sure if this öhlins student dampener

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.660 
not sure if this öhlins student dampener
came<00:04:29.730> off<00:04:29.880> with<00:04:30.030> an<00:04:30.150> RS<00:04:30.420> dr<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:31.710> one<00:04:31.890> you<00:04:32.550> know

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
came off with an RS dr the one you know

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.740 
came off with an RS dr the one you know
the<00:04:32.820> version<00:04:33.390> of<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:35.060> of<00:04:36.060> this<00:04:36.510> bike<00:04:36.720> I

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
the version of the the of this bike I

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.650 
the version of the the of this bike I
guess<00:04:37.080> in<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.620> in<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.400> racing<00:04:38.790> configuration

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
guess in the in the racing configuration

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.330 
guess in the in the racing configuration
not<00:04:39.780> be<00:04:39.930> naked<00:04:40.140> not<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.710> upright<00:04:41.160> handlebars

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
not be naked not the upright handlebars

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.090 
not be naked not the upright handlebars
and<00:04:41.880> therefore<00:04:42.180> not<00:04:42.560> so<00:04:43.560> if<00:04:43.620> I<00:04:43.710> have<00:04:43.830> come<00:04:43.980> off

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
and therefore not so if I have come off

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.200 
and therefore not so if I have come off
the<00:04:44.130> bike<00:04:44.370> that<00:04:44.550> has<00:04:44.700> a<00:04:44.730> different

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
the bike that has a different

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.850 
the bike that has a different
configuration<00:04:45.720> at<00:04:46.230> the<00:04:46.350> front<00:04:46.620> different

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
configuration at the front different

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.710 
configuration at the front different
fairing<00:04:47.130> and<00:04:47.220> everything<00:04:47.550> but<00:04:47.670> anyways<00:04:48.030> the

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
fairing and everything but anyways the

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.030 
fairing and everything but anyways the
old<00:04:48.840> ones<00:04:48.990> just<00:04:49.080> came<00:04:49.380> with<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.680> standard

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
old ones just came with the standard

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.280 
old ones just came with the standard
bolt<00:04:50.310> just<00:04:51.120> just<00:04:51.660> a<00:04:51.810> short<00:04:52.170> one<00:04:52.400> I<00:04:54.020> had<00:04:55.020> to<00:04:55.110> kind

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
bolt just just a short one I had to kind

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
bolt just just a short one I had to kind
of<00:04:55.320> Pat<00:04:55.500> it<00:04:55.530> out<00:04:55.800> because<00:04:55.890> it<00:04:56.010> had<00:04:56.130> some

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
of Pat it out because it had some

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.490 
of Pat it out because it had some
corrosion<00:04:56.670> in<00:04:56.760> there<00:04:56.880> but<00:04:57.260> but<00:04:58.260> pretty<00:04:58.440> much

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
corrosion in there but but pretty much

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.650 
corrosion in there but but pretty much
as<00:04:58.740> you<00:04:59.040> can<00:04:59.190> see<00:04:59.400> I<00:04:59.610> put<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.300> bolt<00:05:00.480> in<00:05:00.540> the

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
as you can see I put the bolt in the

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.130 
as you can see I put the bolt in the
wrong<00:05:00.780> way<00:05:00.960> but<00:05:02.090> it<00:05:03.090> doesn't<00:05:03.300> it<00:05:03.690> doesn't<00:05:03.930> fit

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
wrong way but it doesn't it doesn't fit

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.900 
wrong way but it doesn't it doesn't fit
right<00:05:04.170> because<00:05:04.740> you<00:05:05.190> know<00:05:05.280> I'm<00:05:05.460> missing<00:05:05.640> that

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
right because you know I'm missing that

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.870 
right because you know I'm missing that
that<00:05:06.300> spacer<00:05:06.810> in<00:05:06.960> there<00:05:07.140> so<00:05:07.590> that's<00:05:07.880> totally

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
that spacer in there so that's totally

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.440 
that spacer in there so that's totally
not<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.270> right<00:05:09.540> bolt<00:05:09.890> for<00:05:10.890> that<00:05:11.210> so<00:05:12.210> what<00:05:12.360> I'm

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
not the right bolt for that so what I'm

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.680 
not the right bolt for that so what I'm
going<00:05:12.570> to<00:05:12.600> have<00:05:12.750> to<00:05:12.870> do<00:05:13.050> is<00:05:13.410> take<00:05:13.830> this<00:05:14.100> bolt

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
going to have to do is take this bolt

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.400 
going to have to do is take this bolt
which<00:05:17.570> went<00:05:18.570> through<00:05:18.720> the<00:05:18.780> spacer<00:05:19.230> and<00:05:19.290> of

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
which went through the spacer and of

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.990 
which went through the spacer and of
course<00:05:19.650> these<00:05:19.860> are<00:05:20.070> the<00:05:20.190> grommets<00:05:20.670> that<00:05:20.760> go

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
course these are the grommets that go

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.840 
course these are the grommets that go

movement from side to side is pretty

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.330 
movement from side to side is pretty
much<00:06:53.180> what<00:06:53.389> it<00:06:53.479> does<00:06:53.659> anyways<00:06:54.110> that's<00:06:54.340> that's

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340

the<00:06:55.460> steering<00:06:55.729> dampener<00:06:56.120> that's<00:06:56.270> how<00:06:56.389> to

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:56.449 
the steering dampener that's how to

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:59.649 
the steering dampener that's how to
install<00:06:56.810> one<00:06:57.039> there<00:06:58.039> are<00:06:58.340> other<00:06:59.030> variations

00:06:59.649 --> 00:06:59.659 
install one there are other variations

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:01.059 
install one there are other variations
of<00:06:59.719> us<00:06:59.840> during<00:06:59.960> dampener<00:07:00.530> sometimes<00:07:00.889> they'll

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:01.069 
of us during dampener sometimes they'll

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:02.529 
of us during dampener sometimes they'll
put<00:07:01.099> them<00:07:01.310> on<00:07:01.370> the<00:07:01.490> top<00:07:01.729> of<00:07:01.909> the<00:07:02.000> triple<00:07:02.360> and

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:02.539 
put them on the top of the triple and

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:05.589 
put them on the top of the triple and
anchor<00:07:03.409> it<00:07:03.500> somehow<00:07:03.710> to<00:07:03.830> the<00:07:03.979> frame<00:07:04.509> you<00:07:05.509> know

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:05.599 
anchor it somehow to the frame you know

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:07.089 
anchor it somehow to the frame you know
sometimes<00:07:05.930> they<00:07:06.050> mount<00:07:06.229> to<00:07:06.349> the<00:07:06.469> bar<00:07:06.650> so

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:07.099 
sometimes they mount to the bar so

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:09.939 
sometimes they mount to the bar so
there's<00:07:07.729> different<00:07:07.849> ways<00:07:08.090> to<00:07:08.469> to<00:07:09.469> you<00:07:09.830> know<00:07:09.889> to

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:09.949 
there's different ways to to you know to

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:12.939 
there's different ways to to you know to
dampen<00:07:10.550> the<00:07:10.669> steering<00:07:11.090> input<00:07:11.419> of<00:07:11.509> a<00:07:11.569> motorbike

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:12.949 
dampen the steering input of a motorbike

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:16.709 
dampen the steering input of a motorbike
this<00:07:13.490> is<00:07:13.639> just<00:07:13.849> a<00:07:13.940> lower<00:07:14.409> lower<00:07:15.409> triple
