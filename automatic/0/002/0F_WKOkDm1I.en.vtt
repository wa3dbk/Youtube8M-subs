00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.570
Double is a remotely controlled, mobile teleconferencing
system that enables converstations to happen

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.210
anywhere and anytime.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.960
It's the ultimate tool for telecommuting!

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.180
To move around, Double uses a gyroscope and
accelerometers.

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.430
The same concept as a Segway.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.880
It's very stable and won't tip over easily.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.540
The self-balancing algorithm will correct
itself and do its best to remain upright.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.260
You can change the height of your Double remotely
to match the eye level of those you are interacting with.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.160

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.260
Double also has two kickstands so that you
can stay in one place when you need to.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.010
There's a mirror on your Double that lines
up with the camera on the back of your iPad

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.940
so that second viewing angle is the ground
directly around your Double.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.640
This is especially helpful when navigating
tight spaces.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.960
The magnetic wide angle lens attached to the
front of your Double allows you to see a lot

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.860
more of the surrounding area than your iPad
camera detects on its own.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.920
The Double battery is lithium ion.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.300
The same as what you'd find in a laptop.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.220
A full charge on the Double battery should
last you 8 to 10 hours.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.830
And charging takes about 2 hours.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.390
The battery for the iPad that you are using
with your Double probably won't last as long

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.400
as your Double battery will.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.740
But this depends on a variety of factors,
like the brightness of your screen.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.940
We recommend parking your Double in the Charging
Dock at the end of the day so that it's ready for use in the morning.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.360

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:51.020
Video and audio is encrypted end to end with
128bit AES and it goes directly from your

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.800
Double to the driver and vice versa without
being stored or recorded.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.690
You can use any iPad that is 2nd generation
or newer for your Double's head.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.810
But we recommend iPad Air or iPad Air 2 for
best results.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.020
And you can drive your Double using a second
iPad, an iPhone, some Android tablets using

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.280
Chrome, or any computer using Chrome or Firefox.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.800
To use your Double, just sign in to Double
Robotics using a computer, iPad, or iPhone

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.800
and locate the Double that you wish to use.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.420
Once you're connected to your Double, you'll
be able to see the environment your Double is in.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.920

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.780
You can use the back, forward, and side to
side keys to move your Double around remotely.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.590
A live video of you will be shown on the head
of your Double so that you can interact with people,

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.220
as if you were there!
