dollar eighty eight for five pounds so
if<00:00:47.359> we<00:00:47.539> think<00:00:47.690> about<00:00:47.840> comparing<00:00:48.649> 99<00:00:49.399> cents<00:00:49.640> a

potatoes<00:00:52.160> that<00:00:52.339> would<00:00:52.489> be<00:00:52.579> five<00:00:52.820> dollars

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
potatoes that would be five dollars

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.840 
potatoes that would be five dollars
where<00:00:53.989> it's<00:00:54.109> a<00:00:54.410> dollar<00:00:55.070> eighty<00:00:55.280> eight<00:00:55.460> for<00:00:55.820> a

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
where it's a dollar eighty eight for a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.150 
where it's a dollar eighty eight for a
five<00:00:56.089> pound<00:00:56.329> bank<00:00:56.660> so<00:00:57.379> comparing<00:00:57.829> the<00:00:58.010> two

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
five pound bank so comparing the two
