00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
the shoe is that the lower the number

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.720 
the shoe is that the lower the number
the<00:00:31.169> more

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
the more

ground

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.670 
ground
naturally<00:00:38.329> so<00:00:38.570> as<00:00:38.809> you<00:00:38.840> go<00:00:39.140> through<00:00:39.379> the<00:00:39.469> range

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
naturally so as you go through the range

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.590 
naturally so as you go through the range
the<00:00:39.920> 5-point<00:00:40.399> OS<00:00:40.550> for<00:00:40.789> that<00:00:40.910> introductory

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.299 

where<00:00:46.600> point<00:00:46.870> 0<00:00:46.930> is<00:00:47.050> kind<00:00:47.199> of<00:00:47.260> festival<00:00:47.710> so<00:00:48.250> if

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
where point 0 is kind of festival so if

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:49.840 
where point 0 is kind of festival so if
we<00:00:48.340> do<00:00:48.519> a<00:00:48.550> little<00:00:48.699> bit<00:00:48.850> of<00:00:48.879> cushioning

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
we do a little bit of cushioning

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.610 
we do a little bit of cushioning
slower<00:00:50.120> in<00:00:50.269> ground<00:00:50.539> and<00:00:50.870> then<00:00:51.140> as<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:51.440> get<00:00:51.530> to

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
slower in ground and then as you get to

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.930 
slower in ground and then as you get to
the<00:00:51.649> three-point<00:00:51.949> o<00:00:52.280> is<00:00:52.519> for<00:00:52.550> those<00:00:52.760> people

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
the three-point o is for those people

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.549 
the three-point o is for those people
that<00:00:53.120> have<00:00:53.269> really<00:00:53.449> gone<00:00:53.989> through<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.320> five

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
that have really gone through the five

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.500 
that have really gone through the five
and<00:00:54.800> four<00:00:55.219> they're<00:00:55.699> ready<00:00:55.969> for<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:56.239> three

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
and four they're ready for the three

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.030 
and four they're ready for the three
their<00:00:57.230> strength<00:00:57.710> and

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
their strength and

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.330 
their strength and
they're<00:00:59.250> ready<00:00:59.430> to<00:01:03.379> sew<00:01:04.379> one<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.129> main

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.340 
they're ready to sew one of the main

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.160 
they're ready to sew one of the main
things<00:01:05.370> that<00:01:05.700> we<00:01:05.910> kept<00:01:06.300> from<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> last<00:01:06.840> four

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
things that we kept from the last four

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.110 
things that we kept from the last four
point<00:01:07.380> oh<00:01:07.470> was<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.340> terms<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.820> construction

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
point oh was in terms of construction

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.710 
point oh was in terms of construction
the<00:01:09.540> way<00:01:09.660> that<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:09.980> have<00:01:10.980> the<00:01:11.130> tongue<00:01:11.630> solid<00:01:12.630> on

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the way that we have the tongue solid on

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.110 
the way that we have the tongue solid on
one<00:01:12.930> side<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.410> it's<00:01:13.920> completely<00:01:14.520> open<00:01:14.970> on

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
one side and it's completely open on

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.430 
one side and it's completely open on
what<00:01:18.120> that<00:01:18.270> does<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.690> just<00:01:18.990> gives<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.229> person

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
what that does is it just gives a person

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.000 
what that does is it just gives a person
for<00:01:19.770> real

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
for real

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.870 
for real
nice<00:01:21.700> network

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
nice network

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.149 
nice network
but<00:01:23.780> it<00:01:23.869> also<00:01:24.020> allows<00:01:24.439> the<00:01:24.680> person<00:01:24.829> to<00:01:25.009> be<00:01:25.130> able

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
but it also allows the person to be able

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.499 
but it also allows the person to be able
to<00:01:25.340> get<00:01:25.460> into<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.759> shoe<00:01:25.939> and<00:01:26.210> it<00:01:26.240> allows<00:01:26.479> for

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
to get into the shoe and it allows for

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.630 
to get into the shoe and it allows for
adjustability<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:27.469> this<00:01:28.070> is<00:01:28.189> one<00:01:28.280> of<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.430> key

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
adjustability so this is one of the key

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.130 
adjustability so this is one of the key
construction<00:01:29.390> differences<00:01:29.780> between<00:01:29.930> a

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
construction differences between a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.080 
construction differences between a
four-point-oh<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.280> five<00:01:31.520> point<00:01:31.820> oh<00:01:31.880> and

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
four-point-oh and five point oh and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.060 
four-point-oh and five point oh and
people<00:01:32.750> really<00:01:33.049> love<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.530> fit<00:01:33.710> of<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.860> shoe

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
people really love the fit of the shoe

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.679 
people really love the fit of the shoe
so<00:01:34.310> people<00:01:34.490> that<00:01:34.700> loved<00:01:34.970> it<00:01:35.119> last<00:01:35.270> time<00:01:35.509> we're

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
so people that loved it last time we're

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:36.999 
so people that loved it last time we're
going<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:35.840> come<00:01:35.990> right<00:01:36.170> back<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:36.890> be

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
going to come right back to it and be

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.919 
going to come right back to it and be
able<00:01:37.100> to<00:01:37.250> know<00:01:37.640> exactly<00:01:37.670> what<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.509> expect<00:01:38.539> from

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
able to know exactly what to expect from

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.179 
able to know exactly what to expect from
the<00:01:39.049> four<00:01:39.229> point<00:01:39.470> oh<00:01:39.530> when<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:40.009> talk<00:01:40.039> about

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
the four point oh when you talk about

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.510 
the four point oh when you talk about
the<00:01:40.880> ride<00:01:41.119> of<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:41.360> shoe<00:01:41.600> it's<00:01:42.170> lower<00:01:42.560> than<00:01:42.679> the

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
the ride of the shoe it's lower than the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.580 
the ride of the shoe it's lower than the
five<00:01:43.729> point<00:01:43.970> O<00:01:44.060> of<00:01:44.539> Mike<00:01:45.079> windows<00:01:45.350> 8

five point O of Mike windows 8

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.929 
five point O of Mike windows 8
millimeters<00:01:46.069> this<00:01:46.280> is<00:01:46.399> a<00:01:46.429> six<00:01:46.700> millimeter

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
millimeters this is a six millimeter

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.600 
millimeters this is a six millimeter
offset<00:01:47.569> so<00:01:48.140> some

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
offset so some
