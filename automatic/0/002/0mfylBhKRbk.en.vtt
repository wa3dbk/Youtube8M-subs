 here 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.400
 do not break fact 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.400
 as I have done up here 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.030
 is that god scales very much 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.010
 now let's move on to the next thing 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.470
 let's put up here 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.810
 and well we move on to the next one 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.900
 here the spider going on to the next one 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.500
 is the 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.600
 chicken 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.320
 we are a chicken the ability is to fly and 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.320
 We go flying 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.190
 wherever 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.810
 and well let's move on to the next one 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.650
 next is the in burma lenderman me 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.650
 Like very much 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.640
 good the leander plus the skill that 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.290
 has this transport and is very cool 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.080
 for example I spike on that peak 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.759
 tree there and we appear there skewer 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.980
 that there and now we do there skewer 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.620
 in that we appear there we are going to put ourselves 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.440
 Up there 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.900
 and up 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.030
 and good we are transporting to the site 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.750
 where we click for example here in depth 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.150
 and well let's stay here 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.800
 the next we have is the ocelot 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.480
 what it is 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.000
 and that he had the same ability 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.810
 that after running it goes much faster 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.810
 as you see 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:43.240
 so I would say normal and very fast 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.870
 super fast and good let's move on to 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.870
 next animal 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.480
 we are placing here 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.760
 we give the u we have the good fish 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.400
 we are a good silverfish and this 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.020
 ability that you have is to look when 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.390
 it's night underwater they would look 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.250
 much better and good we go for the 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.890
 water and what it does is go through the water very 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.080
 very fast going down here by the water 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.830
 without swimming you never drown you are a 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.830
 fish is clear 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.290
 and good for where they want to be like 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.290
 you see 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.880
 over here it goes fatal super slow and good 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.030
 we move on to the next one we have the man 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.790
 of snow as you see here just 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.520
 is to transform the soil into snow as in 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.319
 have dates as high as here 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.090
 this part that is not there 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.849
 this our snowy pass and we're going 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.180
 freezing everything good we went to 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:46.109
 next next would be blaze that 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.109
 it would be the flame 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.270
 that this is the skill you have if 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.790
 we click where you stretch balls of 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.069
 fire as hell also does 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.299
 and well we go to the next one that we have 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.250
 the gas the gas 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.970
 the white bug this big we have 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.260
 here 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.260
 stretching fireballs 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.140
 and if we squeeze people throw balls of 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.360
 fire 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.700
 but to find out fireballs and 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.470
 they explode 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.599
 to destroy a whole forest if you want 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.570
 next animal that we have is the 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.450
 giant that you see is giant what 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.120
 we have here 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.500
 and there is great and well worth the 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.080
 ability it has is that if 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.180
 we puncture boom is a super punch 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.440
 grave that destroys the whole tree 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.430
 whole 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.430
 it is not 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.470
 and like crazy the good giant we went to 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.760
 next the next and last one that is 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.760
 the stone golem 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.180
 with this one that has to public glue 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:54.760
 it was strong if the bugs that were 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.400
 approach and 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.500
