to<00:01:22.420> be<00:01:22.659> a<00:01:22.869> little<00:01:22.930> bit<00:01:23.560> more<00:01:23.890> of<00:01:24.219> a<00:01:24.460> groove<00:01:24.759> kind

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
to be a little bit more of a groove kind

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.609 
to be a little bit more of a groove kind
of<00:01:25.509> feeling<00:01:25.840> and<00:01:25.960> I<00:01:26.079> didn't<00:01:26.320> want<00:01:26.469> it<00:01:26.560> to

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.200 
necessarily feel sad I wanted to just
kind<00:01:28.899> of<00:01:29.049> feel<00:01:29.289> like<00:01:29.320> a<00:01:29.799> cool<00:01:30.460> groove<00:01:30.880> that

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
so while the songwriting process for me

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.350 
so while the songwriting process for me
is<00:02:15.910> essentially<00:02:17.130> isolating<00:02:18.130> I<00:02:18.340> like<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.150> write

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
is essentially isolating I like to write

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.309 
is essentially isolating I like to write
by<00:02:19.540> myself<00:02:19.980> um<00:02:21.630> bringing<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.900> life<00:02:23.079> is

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
by myself um bringing it to life is

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.229 
by myself um bringing it to life is
something<00:02:23.470> that<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.739> really<00:02:24.040> kind<00:02:24.549> of<00:02:24.639> rely<00:02:24.970> on

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
something that I really kind of rely on

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.910 
something that I really kind of rely on
other<00:02:25.600> people<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.989> help<00:02:26.139> me<00:02:26.380> do<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.829> I<00:02:26.889> think

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
other people to help me do and I think

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.470 
other people to help me do and I think
that<00:02:27.280> it's<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:28.380> it's<00:02:29.380> really<00:02:29.680> cool<00:02:29.889> because

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
that it's that it's really cool because

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.620 
that it's that it's really cool because
I<00:02:31.480> know<00:02:31.780> that<00:02:32.549> it<00:02:33.549> wouldn't<00:02:33.880> turn<00:02:34.060> out<00:02:34.120> though

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
I know that it wouldn't turn out though

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.120 
I know that it wouldn't turn out though
it<00:02:35.170> wouldn't<00:02:35.410> turn<00:02:35.500> out<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.739> way<00:02:35.769> it<00:02:35.950> turns

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
it wouldn't turn out the way it turns

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.390 
it wouldn't turn out the way it turns
out<00:02:36.340> if<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:37.299> was<00:02:37.420> just<00:02:37.450> me<00:02:37.720> doing<00:02:38.200> it

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
out if it was just me doing it

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.089 
out if it was just me doing it
the<00:02:40.939> beauty<00:02:41.390> of<00:02:41.629> having<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:42.110> limited<00:02:42.470> time<00:02:42.680> is

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
the beauty of having a limited time is

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.170 
the beauty of having a limited time is
that<00:02:43.280> you're<00:02:43.400> kind<00:02:43.579> of<00:02:43.640> forced<00:02:43.819> to<00:02:44.000> make

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
that you're kind of forced to make

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.780 
that you're kind of forced to make
decisions<00:02:44.329> as<00:02:44.989> you're<00:02:45.980> doing<00:02:46.099> it<00:02:46.370> which<00:02:46.670> is

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
decisions as you're doing it which is

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.729 
decisions as you're doing it which is
great<00:02:46.849> because<00:02:47.239> that<00:02:47.540> those<00:02:48.170> decisions<00:02:48.650> are

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
great because that those decisions are

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.759 
great because that those decisions are
more<00:02:48.920> intuition<00:02:49.310> based<00:02:49.900> whereas<00:02:50.900> if<00:02:51.379> you<00:02:51.530> have

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
more intuition based whereas if you have

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.059 
more intuition based whereas if you have
as<00:02:52.069> long<00:02:52.250> as<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:52.519> want<00:02:52.760> in<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.810> studio<00:02:54.069> you

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
as long as you want in the studio you

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.280 
as long as you want in the studio you
can<00:02:55.459> you<00:02:56.329> know<00:02:56.420> you'll<00:02:56.659> hear<00:02:56.900> something<00:02:57.260> and

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
can you know you'll hear something and

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.630 
can you know you'll hear something and
you'll<00:02:57.500> say<00:02:57.680> oh<00:02:57.709> that's<00:02:57.980> not<00:02:58.159> right<00:02:58.310> let<00:02:58.459> me<00:02:58.519> do

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
you'll say oh that's not right let me do

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.130 
you'll say oh that's not right let me do
it<00:02:58.730> again<00:02:58.939> let<00:02:59.299> me<00:02:59.390> do<00:02:59.480> it<00:02:59.599> again<00:02:59.750> let<00:02:59.870> me<00:02:59.930> do<00:03:00.019> it

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
it again let me do it again let me do it

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.800 
it again let me do it again let me do it
again<00:03:00.349> and<00:03:00.650> again<00:03:00.739> and<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.549> just<00:03:01.579> kind<00:03:02.060> of<00:03:02.239> you

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
again and again and it just kind of you

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.009 
again and again and it just kind of you
can<00:03:02.930> overthink<00:03:03.319> things<00:03:04.180> in<00:03:05.180> this<00:03:05.510> case<00:03:05.750> it<00:03:05.959> was

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
can overthink things in this case it was

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.330 
can overthink things in this case it was
just<00:03:06.230> kind<00:03:06.379> of<00:03:06.439> like<00:03:06.500> well<00:03:06.829> we're<00:03:07.010> taking<00:03:07.280> a

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
just kind of like well we're taking a

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.890 
just kind of like well we're taking a
leap<00:03:07.549> here<00:03:07.879> we're<00:03:08.180> just<00:03:08.299> gonna<00:03:08.420> do<00:03:08.720> whatever

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
leap here we're just gonna do whatever

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.470 
leap here we're just gonna do whatever
we<00:03:09.200> can<00:03:09.379> and<00:03:09.799> track<00:03:10.489> as<00:03:10.670> many<00:03:10.939> things<00:03:11.150> as<00:03:11.329> we

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
we can and track as many things as we

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.979 
we can and track as many things as we
can<00:03:11.689> and<00:03:12.760> see<00:03:13.760> where<00:03:13.909> we<00:03:14.000> can<00:03:14.030> take<00:03:14.329> it<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.569> now

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
can and see where we can take it and now

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.629 
can and see where we can take it and now
we<00:03:15.049> have<00:03:15.290> this<00:03:15.560> great<00:03:15.769> thing<00:03:16.129> that<00:03:16.340> sounds

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
we have this great thing that sounds

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:17.800 
we have this great thing that sounds
really<00:03:16.849> cool<00:03:17.000> but<00:03:17.180> now<00:03:17.299> we<00:03:17.359> have<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:17.599> kind<00:03:17.690> of

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
far I think at some point maybe playing

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.890 
far I think at some point maybe playing
