 htc desire white accardi 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.100

 purchased here it is 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.999
 a more complete view 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.999
 just in a few days, quick guide 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.050
 small manual 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.580
 I'm the charger 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.720
 with the usp standard the fact 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.080
 in a nice way 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.070
 turin we find the cable vs swift micro sd here it is 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.680
 Lastly 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.830
 headset 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.450
 with standard tremezzo managers, here it is 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.720
 and standard headphones so we don't have a link in I and procurement being jet 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.760
 start up oss 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.360
 use the criticisms we most prefer 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.840
 battery battery from the powerful that leaves us a bit perplexed and two hundred and thirty 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.520
 milliampere now 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.429
 we do not say to give me this time the autonomy of the battery because 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:20.799
 obviously the first loved psyche one of the first reviews we do with 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:21.640
 this 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.430
 desarpa credits if a battery that they 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.590
 install here 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.590
 sideways in this covered compartment 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.540
 from this stopper the plastic still on the metal body 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.210
 in this other compartment under micro sd and hamsik al milan 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.010
 press ques 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.790
 plastic boots have been designed for you the metal shell would have blocked 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.590
 common then it is fine to make life difficult 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.469
 receive the gps historical photos a .prt file on the mobile so there are these 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.320
 these plastic inserts 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.009
 8 megapixel cam here it is 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.469
 with autofocus and double the flashdance 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.410
 then below we find the standard jazz for headphones 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.189
 the micro sd and the microphone 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.289
 left side 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:19.669
 button or better volume bar 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:22.849
 right side very clean above maybe some who has cashed so not 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.079
 convenient to press the power button 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.930
 very nice this aprilia proximity sensor tilt brightness sensors 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.159
 also the notifications hidden below 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.819
 grilled. 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.530
 we unlock the 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.480
 phone remember the display is a unit of four. 3 inches since 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.190
 true 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.649
 but huge 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:48.689
 presumptuousness however still stops at 800 by 480 pixels this tablets and disks 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.320
 and yes it is big but that big 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.140
 a bit 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.629
 all the midi - of the childhood roof the icon is when 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.949
 we will enter the rewriting of the text 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:02.759
 both when we use the applications for all magnified 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:06.229
 hspa world. 1 gps you want to do 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:08.610
 dimensions 68 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.579
 123 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.860
 11 list votes to be quiet large 174 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.859
 it is not very light but sincerely not 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.080
 coem 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.060
 don't feel in your hand maybe it was too much they did that makes it smaller than 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.479
 what much 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:25.420
 processor from you 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.879
 magikarp very powerful while I show you the time to scrub 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.760
 we really used it a bit, those who see each other wanted to make this laugh 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.219
 try this love singer 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:43.289
 right away but for that reason, instead, I have some depth between some in the 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:46.430
 day programs there are really so many these are all 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.340
 assumptions - 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.450
 installed only in what programs like ds change 4 the rest which is all one 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.940
 of 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.869
 for the series 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:58.900
 all standard we have sight 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.020
 one last thing I am immediately at the messages that I know about phone calls when 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.150
 are the things that 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.899
 I usually show you naum 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:11.059
 mdina in preview 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:13.989
 let's try to write a message 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.989
 so we see on the keyboard 

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:23.229
 obviously then I'm going to write it myself 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.240
 recipients, however, a keyboard that I think 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:31.029
 very fast reactive 

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:33.260
 obviously a thing to put it 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.189
 horizontal anthem 

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:37.730
 and always er 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.159
 there is the possibility of 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:40.289
 modify 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.920
 the keyboard type and use a very nice alphanumeric keypad 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.219
 the fact the implementation of htc to select the text 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:53.319
 to be able to copy it paste as you have seen agcom style even the search 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:58.789
 dambel text or better search for the cursor to move within the 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.650
 test however we also have the directional arrows that help us in this 

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:05.150
 cooperation 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.150
 first impressions are definitely these and I looked at speed 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.830
 serial ata 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:17.530
 the amount of applications that htc puts in this% in this design 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.279
 hd 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:21.279
 we see war navigation quickly 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.759
 Specific comments will delve into when doing nothing review 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:28.909
 ultimately 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:30.479
 anyway 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.559
 it looks like this is 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:37.529
 whether to take a disc or speed we are connected right now 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:38.440
 under 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.300
 the network you want to do some 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.540
 little problem in a pc at the moment 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.860
 but to say nothing to worry about if I follow it. 2 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.520
 also supports flash and animations 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.340
 in this case I have made optional so you then have to activate them 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.770
 from the special menu when we will test the word difference name of the 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.050
 difference between 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.460
 flash player e 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.610
 loading and loading flashes disabled 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.610
 in this case 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:12.449
 we return 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.169
 windows - trieste prima 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.379
 titles at this time there are loaded that 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:19.480
 the web page 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.610
 slightly slower than in 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.029
 obviously interfacing 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:31.910
 xvideo then with me the interface themselves 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.590
 integrated interacts with the TB because there is a page 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:39.940
 on purpose 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.310
 which htc app 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.350
 currently it is a crime the new thoughts of ecorete products will come 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.270
 presentation 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.189
 very 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:52.239
 the deeper than the customization that 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.690
 and we can have with other htc android worked a lot 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.730
 but from this point of view both 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.920
 for now to change the backgrounds to change the picture we have the most 

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:08.129
 optional that more options and respect 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:09.669
 to the past 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:14.919
 for now you for this little opens more small with indie box for all video 

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:17.919
 the next few days for the review 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:20.340
 to open it. andrea galeazzi bed
