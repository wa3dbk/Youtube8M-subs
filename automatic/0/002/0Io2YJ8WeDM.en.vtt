my name is Christian pain and the next
few<00:00:03.419> minutes<00:00:03.600> i'll<00:00:03.810> show<00:00:03.959> you<00:00:04.020> how<00:00:04.140> easy<00:00:04.350> it<00:00:04.620> is

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
few minutes i'll show you how easy it is

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:13.220 
few minutes i'll show you how easy it is
to<00:00:04.740> get<00:00:04.950> started<00:00:05.220> with<00:00:05.370> rank<00:00:11.900> rugby<00:00:12.900> rank<00:00:13.110> is

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
to get started with rank rugby rank is

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.740 
to get started with rank rugby rank is
split<00:00:13.410> into<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:14.340> sections<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.849> legs<00:00:15.089> squads

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
split into the sections of legs squads

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.460 
split into the sections of legs squads
players<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.039> matches<00:00:17.750> so<00:00:18.750> we'll<00:00:19.109> put<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.380> a

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
players and matches so we'll put in a

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.910 
players and matches so we'll put in a
new<00:00:19.680> league<00:00:20.930> going<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.020> enter<00:00:22.260> their<00:00:22.439> colin

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
new league going to enter their colin

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.660 
new league going to enter their colin
card<00:00:23.820> sheet

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:56.569 

so<00:00:32.240> once<00:00:32.419> it's<00:00:32.599> in<00:00:32.720> a<00:00:32.840> letter<00:00:33.020> squad

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.419 

so<00:00:57.179> next<00:00:57.329> step<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.870> add<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.170> players<00:00:58.429> since

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
so next step is to add the players since

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:01.459 
so next step is to add the players since
a<00:00:59.609> player<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.510> multiple<00:01:00.659> squads<00:01:01.289> we

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
a player can be in multiple squads we

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:12.170 
a player can be in multiple squads we
have<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.710> add<00:01:01.829> them<00:01:02.010> separately<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:12.000> then

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
have to add them separately and then

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.700 
have to add them separately and then
next<00:01:12.450> video<00:01:12.630> we<00:01:12.720> can<00:01:12.810> show<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.049> how<00:01:13.229> easy<00:01:13.259> it

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
next video we can show you how easy it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.740 
next video we can show you how easy it
is<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.950> import<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.789> data<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.270> your<00:01:15.420> own<00:01:15.539> you

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
is to import this data on your own you

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.080 
is to import this data on your own you
don't<00:01:15.930> need<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.110> enter<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.470> manually<00:01:19.939> so<00:01:20.939> once

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
don't need to enter it manually so once

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.539 
don't need to enter it manually so once
I've<00:01:21.210> got<00:01:21.240> my<00:01:21.799> players<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:23.070> there<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.429> now

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
I've got my players in there can now

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:49.710 
I've got my players in there can now
link<00:01:23.789> the<00:01:23.939> players<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> squad

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.480 

now<00:01:50.590> when<00:01:50.740> you're<00:01:50.860> getting<00:01:51.040> started<00:01:51.340> with<00:01:51.430> the

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
now when you're getting started with the

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.920 
now when you're getting started with the
road<00:01:51.580> we<00:01:51.730> rank<00:01:51.910> we<00:01:52.000> recommend<00:01:52.420> we<00:01:52.510> just<00:01:52.720> start

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
road we rank we recommend we just start

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.930 
road we rank we recommend we just start
with<00:01:52.990> tracking<00:01:53.770> two<00:01:54.070> or<00:01:54.220> three<00:01:54.370> players<00:01:54.610> just

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
with tracking two or three players just

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.730 
with tracking two or three players just
so<00:01:55.060> you<00:01:55.120> can<00:01:55.300> get<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.480> feel<00:01:55.720> of<00:01:55.780> how<00:01:56.230> it<00:01:56.500> works

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
so you can get a feel of how it works

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.160 
so you can get a feel of how it works
and<00:01:57.040> what's<00:01:57.280> involved<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.750> now<00:02:01.870> that<00:02:02.050> our

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
and what's involved so now that our

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.210 
and what's involved so now that our
match<00:02:02.350> is<00:02:02.560> there<00:02:03.990> we'll<00:02:04.990> add<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.140> new<00:02:05.380> one

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.740 

that's<00:02:09.220> going<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:09.490> be<00:02:09.580> Gordon<00:02:10.000> vs<00:02:10.540> west

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
that's going to be Gordon vs west

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.990 
that's going to be Gordon vs west
harbour<00:02:13.380> at<00:02:14.380> Concord<00:02:14.950> oval<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:18.430> date<00:02:18.760> was

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
harbour at Concord oval and the date was

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.880 
harbour at Concord oval and the date was
last<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:21.160> time<00:02:21.430> as<00:02:22.110> necessary

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.030 

so<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:29.310> match<00:02:29.640> has<00:02:30.050> three<00:02:31.050> states<00:02:31.379> pending<00:02:31.890> in

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
so a match has three states pending in

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.860 
so a match has three states pending in
progress<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:32.670> completes<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.269> pending<00:02:33.629> is<00:02:33.720> when

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
progress and completes a pending is when

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.970 
progress and completes a pending is when
you're<00:02:34.019> setting<00:02:34.290> them<00:02:34.410> up<00:02:34.530> moving<00:02:34.890> the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
you're setting them up moving the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.890 
you're setting them up moving the
players<00:02:35.220> around<00:02:35.580> which<00:02:36.540> are<00:02:36.720> just

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
players around which are just

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.960 
players around which are just
configuring<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.470> match<00:02:37.650> in<00:02:38.310> progress<00:02:38.790> is

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
configuring the match in progress is

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.449 
configuring the match in progress is
when<00:02:39.120> you're<00:02:39.239> tracking<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:40.160> game<00:02:41.160> and

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
when you're tracking the game and

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.970 
when you're tracking the game and
complete<00:02:42.360> is<00:02:42.660> obviously<00:02:43.200> complete<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.860> so

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
complete is obviously complete and so

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.259 
complete is obviously complete and so
you<00:02:44.040> know<00:02:44.280> more<00:02:44.549> changes<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:47.239> we'll<00:02:48.239> just

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
you know more changes so we'll just

00:02:48.269 --> 00:03:01.680 
you know more changes so we'll just
track<00:02:48.629> the<00:02:48.840> forwards

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.930 

okay<00:03:02.500> so<00:03:02.560> this<00:03:02.770> is<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.010> business<00:03:03.190> end<00:03:03.460> this<00:03:03.790> is

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
okay so this is the business end this is

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.520 
okay so this is the business end this is
what<00:03:04.090> we're<00:03:04.210> tracking<00:03:04.390> again<00:03:04.630> you<00:03:05.320> can<00:03:05.440> either

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
what we're tracking again you can either

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.580 
what we're tracking again you can either
do<00:03:05.710> this<00:03:05.860> at<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.820> ground<00:03:07.060> or<00:03:07.360> on<00:03:07.420> video<00:03:08.170> or

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
do this at the ground or on video or

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.760 
do this at the ground or on video or
whatever<00:03:09.330> afterwards<00:03:10.330> so<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.530> layout<00:03:11.740> is

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
whatever afterwards so the layout is

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.680 
whatever afterwards so the layout is
pretty<00:03:11.980> simple<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.460> game<00:03:12.640> clock<00:03:12.970> is<00:03:13.180> here<00:03:13.450> so

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
pretty simple the game clock is here so

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.960 
pretty simple the game clock is here so
you<00:03:13.780> just<00:03:13.990> click<00:03:14.230> wherever<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.190> start<00:03:15.490> so

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
you just click wherever to start so

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.250 
you just click wherever to start so
let's<00:03:16.090> say<00:03:16.300> we'll<00:03:16.420> start<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.810> 10-minute<00:03:16.960> mark

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
let's say we'll start the 10-minute mark

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.440 
let's say we'll start the 10-minute mark
we<00:03:18.250> can<00:03:18.400> see<00:03:18.550> I<00:03:18.580> peered<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:18.940> game<00:03:19.090> clocks

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
we can see I peered the game clocks

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.260 
we can see I peered the game clocks
happening<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.020> as<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.070> play<00:03:21.670> is<00:03:21.880> happening

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
happening and as the play is happening

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.540 
happening and as the play is happening
you<00:03:22.450> select<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.110> player<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.860> whatever<00:03:24.490> the

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
you select the player and whatever the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:37.490 
you select the player and whatever the
action<00:03:24.940> is<00:03:25.090> so<00:03:25.330> good<00:03:25.900> pass<00:03:28.050> bad<00:03:29.050> pass

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.610 

so<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.250> can<00:03:38.400> see<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:39.000> events<00:03:39.840> just<00:03:40.200> increase

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
so you can see the events just increase
