 so send rain and then the primitive 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.760
 33 is covered by water but 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:01:14.320
 only 3% of this water is sweet and only 10

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.550
 this percentage varies in all 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.940
 cells of our body and our city 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.350
 the organ that uses the most water is the lung 85 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.390
 of water 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.570
 we have the hope of health as per 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.140
 example, mental confusion with easy coma and 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.140

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:52.690
 water and can stay that way. 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:02:01.260
 the drainage of water in the sea or rivers or 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:01.260
 water lakes region that separates the two 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:14.230
 respond to river basins 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:16.810
 different in water and

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.569
 channel that diverts from the river to the sea or delta 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.430
 a photo and a fan or river opens in 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.670
 multiple channels up until it stops flowing into the 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.409
 sea course course the water course is the 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.920
 gil course can be divided into three 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:34.720
 upper and lower and the middle and 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.170
 is the nearest part to the 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:42.400
 middle source is the middle part 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:03:48.910
 between the source and the mouth of the lower most 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:03:52.030
 close to most graphics is an area where 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.819
 the whole of the land drain 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:03.489
 the water for this course and its 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:04.780
 rivers and lakes. 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:10.260
 that are the paths covered 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.260
 by 25%

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:27.510
 the soil until it reaches the ground 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:35.260
 the water table name was already in 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:39.550
 surface gives rise to the spring 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:42.160
 of the river born thanks to a 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.880
 lands bathed by a river may be in

 of the dean or heiko hydrographic 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.210
 set consisting of a main river and 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.979
 all its tributaries 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.699
 the sectors around the river 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:56.470
 main advancement of the basin 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:59.020
 hydrograph of the most complex systems

 the energy scene or 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.520
 integrate all space of nothing by the 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.020
 water bodies 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.200
 this example we can see a basin 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.419
 river basin at the top of the basin 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.220
 whose design its waters to the sea 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:17.110
 and in the meantime it passes through its 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:19.780
 tributaries but if these Brazilian expenditures 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.910
 In Brazil we have several types of you. 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.960
 folding people like them into the 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:31.780
 Atlantic southern section east of the southern basin

 tocantins 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:51.160
 there can be by an impartial jury sui 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:57.570
 emerged excavated depression 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:57.570
 tectonic glaciers emerged from the 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:06.880
 results the seas lakes and dams 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.820
 are frequent in the mountains where impede 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.919
 by obstacles is formed of the districts 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.620
 which give rise to dams as 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:17.050
 forming a river when the water of the river 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.960
 find an obstacle to continue its 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.060
 course and at the same time they encounter 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.960
 depressed relief areas 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:30.580
 nothing more nothing more than an extension of 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:33.460
 water surrounded by land sea â€‹â€‹and air in general 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.680
 were now a saltwater lake in the 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.870
 central asia 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.419
 known cause that was the largest 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.870
 environmental disaster that already used by 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:43.930
 men 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:46.150
 its decline began in the 1970s 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.250
 huge number of connection projects 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.380
 led by the union 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.690
 the Soviet Union to divert the 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.950
 major rivers supplying amaral 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:59.050
 so with that deviations from these 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:01.450
 influences that empties into the sea as they 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:04.380
 with which they marry this sea already becoming 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:07.090
 one of the greatest natural disasters 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:11.100
 nowadays it is no longer considered more 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:14.200
 General is just a salt water rim 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:17.290
 underground water used below the 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:20.350
 soil and so- called podes composed of 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.880
 sedimentary rocks to known here 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.670
 was an underground water reservoir 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:27.990
 capture of aquifers is closely related to 

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:30.790
 linked to the type of rock and its porosity 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:33.730
 which can be granulated type of voice 

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:37.810
 sedimentary fissural rock type 

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:40.660
 fractured the hull that comes from limestone 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:42.370
 But preliminary data released by 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:46.540
 researchers at the Federal University of 

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:48.310
 the aquifer alter the ground 

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.120
 largest reservoir of drinking water in 

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.090
 planet 

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:56.050
 the volume is called 86 thousand kilometers 

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:58.000
 cubic water to 12 Amazon state 

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.130
 I'm hungry 

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.730
 sufficient amount of water to 

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:05.760
 supply the world's population during 

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.760
 500 years
