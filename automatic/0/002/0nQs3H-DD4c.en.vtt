00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.700
 very well which of these trees 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:17.419
 we should throw away I want that's very 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.539
 small after that that would not be 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:21.740
 plus 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:25.520
 to 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:30.349
 perfect very well we will say this tree 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:32.029
 where are you and how do you 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.300
 we will throw this tree if we do not have a 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.300
 ax 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.180
 he is sure that this is a good 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.740
 idea trust me this can only 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.740
 end up being a success 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.530
 lifetime 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.530
 you know what success means true 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.480

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:08.140
 you could not give me a hand I'm sorry no 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.140

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.440

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.270

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.979

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.530
 now how are we supposed to put them 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.900
 all 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.090
 trust me this can only end 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.900
 being a good success this will be 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.900

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.280
