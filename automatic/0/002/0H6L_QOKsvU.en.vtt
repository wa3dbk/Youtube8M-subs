 ca 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.800
 everything in this video is about Flash Professional cs5 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:16.409
 I want to show you today how to set a motion Trinec 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:22.109
 To create a movement game we need a stage first 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:24.589
 we open to it 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.589
 hectic script three points 0 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.609
 With the movement we can already create a little animation 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:35.260
 Kids for not yet 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.670
 highly interesting but pine the Monte to damage itself 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.180
 First we would have Teckentrup here with the stages setting everything up 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.950
 correct is 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.929
 at frames per second 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.970
 should be 24 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.180
 to be registered 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.489
 the one with 24 frames per second 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.690
 is it our animation almost or the same 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.370
 runs just like a video 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.420
 our player is the flash player 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.119
 10 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.540
 and Squared 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.540
 the action script three points 0 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.160
 First we need a file that we want to animate 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.630
 we can import these 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.240
 because many 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.450
 we're pushing files on top of it 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.130
 import 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.430
 import into stage 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.690
 It's all possible with the Sport Cup taxation 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.860
 Here we can now our desired picture 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.680
 and open our desired ones 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.680
 I am now taking an Adobe read late 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.890
 and now 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.720
 show me 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.080
 Adobe meat 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.500
 the single strokes that I have made in this picture 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.570
 But that works only with other Naldo like products 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.020
 I want to, of course 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.479
 this is my 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.940
 No whole picture is selected 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.920
 I click on this hook 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.240
 and now my whole picture is imported in terms of Flash 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.109
 important is 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.279
 that looks like the hook for creating movie clips 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:14.739
 purely power 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.519
 otherwise it will not work 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.580
 Also to be recommended here is rather the same size as Deliss 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.579
 KÃ¶ther characters set area 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:27.779
 so we confirm the dialogue 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:30.020
 and talk about ours 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.279
 small file or as well 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:37.399
 Now we would like to ask an investigator to create animation 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.209
 my animation should now be five seconds long 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:45.959
 and percent we have set full in the stage setting that pro 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.269
 Second 24 pictures are created 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.209
 so 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.990
 Customs a bay window entire animation which is five seconds long 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.259
 220 beta 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.089
 Xenia downstairs 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:59.829
 in the timeline 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:00.940
 many numbers 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.180
 These signal or these indicate the pictures 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:07.839
 I press here now because of the 20 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:12.139
 on the bottom of the box under a hundred 20 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:14.129
 press 5 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.580
 and my level is the and Nina Timeline has waned 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:20.579
 yes 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.719
 goes up to gender 20 or increases to a hundred 20 images 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.069
 Now click on the right 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:34.499
 often our music 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.099
 came 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.380
 Hefner would create a moving 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.659
 Turin 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.970
 now this clip is driving 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.169
 we go on 8 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.179
 we start with the red Karzai at the beginning of the clip 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:52.089
 next to our stick figure and seven Essence of 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:57.469
 Ciena with the cursor 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:59.889
 at the end of the clip 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:02.959
 pull our stick figure 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.299
 Left on 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:06.779
 now we can see 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:10.209
 that a green line has been created here 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.169
 this shows the way the underscore Munich goes 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:18.809
 If I put the carcass back to the very beginning 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.509
 I can watch TV 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:23.020
 like mine 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.189
 how my male and life get their PID 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:27.270
 moves 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.849
 if I press enter now 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.849
 can i put those into animations 10 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:37.939
 so now i do not want my male straight straight ahead 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:42.289
 runs but that it makes a little downwards movement 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:46.020
 Now I go Pauli to the middle of the clip 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.439
 and Zermatt stick figures down 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:50.710
 we can see 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.199
 that now my stream my movement 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.199
 yes that one motion screen a little 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.499
 v makes movement 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.490
 I'm playing again with Enter now 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.740
 we see 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.839
 that this 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:06.839
 a stick figure makes a woman move 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:14.559
 this looks very unrealistic and that 's why I want the 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:17.639
 Kyria Bisset round off 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.920
 I can do this by driving over here drives 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.370
 take windream and would be a bit outward 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.009
 the same thing matters on the other side 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:34.689
 and some again now you go with the Corsa at the beginning of the clip 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.889
 blessed and on Enter with Enter the Third play I see 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.509
 mean the st 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:42.889
 stick figure 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.889
 do a round of exercise 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.830
 so much for exercise training 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.479
 I hope you enjoyed it and helped 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.099
 Just visit us on the back until the next video
