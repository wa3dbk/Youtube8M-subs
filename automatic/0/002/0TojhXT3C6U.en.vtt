 [Music] 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.430
 first if what I did was put a 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.500
 checked shirt that we all have a 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.500
 our closet and what I did was 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.040
 combine it with a gray scarf that the 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.600
 same print the shirt already brings gray 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.880
 they also bring black and that combines it with 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.860
 the black boots that I bring because the 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.320
 truth in these autumn days no longer 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.650
 you know if it's going to be cold if it's going to 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.650
 zoom in 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.859
 in this outfit what I wanted to do is 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.229
 cover me from these days that are very 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:47.829
 cool then that's why I put on the 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:50.890
 blue sweater to cover the back and the 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:54.030
 you had whites to give it a little more 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.339
 more feminine touch with white shirt 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.989
 they combine perfect then if you want 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:02.159
 walk comfortably and cool at the same time 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.159
 this is an outfit for you 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.650
 in this third outfit what I did was 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.270
 put on a baseball-type sweatshirt 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.600
 that are being used a lot in this 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.420
 season and combine it with a maximum 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.580
 scale that is a very light fabric 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.130
 but also that covers the chest very well 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.850
 then it's perfect for this fall 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.250
 same with the same of my targets 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.380
 I wanted to give this doctrine a touch 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.720
 romantic but at the same time sporty and 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.720
 september fashion you look pretty 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.200
 and in the last one what I wanted is to see me 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.960
 also very sporty but cool to the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.080
 Then what I did was to put on a 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.690
 metallic blue vest combining it with 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.390
 the gray scarf and putting on some tennis shoes 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.789
 very comfortable to me it occurs to me that this 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.890
 Outfit can use it on a Sunday where 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.630
 you go out with the family but you do not know what 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.820
 you're going to do they still do not have the plans 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.590
 then already prepared for everything 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:13.169
 so much for the heat 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:13.169
