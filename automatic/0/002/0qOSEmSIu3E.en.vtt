water in the frying oil and either one

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.730 
water in the frying oil and either one
that<00:01:44.120> because<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.080> oil<00:01:45.350> is<00:01:45.440> a<00:01:45.500> like<00:01:45.740> water<00:01:47.740> now

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
that because the oil is a like water now

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.860 
that because the oil is a like water now
to<00:01:48.800> test<00:01:49.280> if<00:01:49.580> they're<00:01:49.850> all<00:01:49.970> Israeli<00:01:50.420> you

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
to test if they're all Israeli you

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.230 
to test if they're all Israeli you
basically<00:01:51.290> put<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:52.070> toothpick<00:01:52.580> inside<00:01:52.940> and

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
basically put the toothpick inside and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.460 
basically put the toothpick inside and
see<00:01:53.479> you<00:01:53.600> see<00:01:53.750> what<00:01:53.900> happened<00:01:54.140> then<00:01:54.260> she

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
see you see what happened then she

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.330 
see you see what happened then she
opened<00:01:54.800> it<00:01:54.890> is<00:01:55.610> basically<00:01:56.530> is<00:01:57.530> bubbling<00:01:58.190> see

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
opened it is basically is bubbling see

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.800 
opened it is basically is bubbling see
the<00:01:58.430> bubbling<00:01:58.640> it<00:01:58.910> means<00:01:59.120> that<00:01:59.240> you<00:01:59.300> can<00:01:59.479> fry

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
the bubbling it means that you can fry

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.570 
the bubbling it means that you can fry
now<00:02:00.080> that's<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.410> good<00:02:00.560> old-fashioned<00:02:01.400> way<00:02:01.520> to

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
now that's a good old-fashioned way to

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.990 
now that's a good old-fashioned way to
test<00:02:02.030> if<00:02:02.270> you<00:02:02.360> can<00:02:02.390> fry<00:02:02.810> or<00:02:03.110> not<00:02:03.640> now<00:02:04.640> we<00:02:04.700> can

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
test if you can fry or not now we can

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.940 
test if you can fry or not now we can
fry<00:02:05.330> them<00:02:05.600> with<00:02:06.020> one<00:02:06.259> at<00:02:06.350> a<00:02:06.380> time<00:02:08.709> with<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.740> set

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950
