00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.210
 hello guys back on mine 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.350
 desk 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.540
 in this video I will explain how 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.150
 make a piggy bank shaped 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.810
 little house using the lovely of the 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.570
 size midi or those from 0.5 cm of 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.550
 outside diameter and height 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:30.560
 I'll show you a little better as it is 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.210
 made this cottage a slit on the 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.360
 roof within which we can 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.809
 to pass our pennies and then one 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.640
 time we would like to take out the coins 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.739
 the banknotes we would have accumulated 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.960
 inside the house we should not 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.749
 disassemble the whole piggy bank but there 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.659
 just remove the underlying part 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:56.600
 which is only stuck and not 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:59.569
 glued to the other parts and ho 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.679
 also realized the chimney but I have to 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:04.339
 telling the truth doesn't make me crazy 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:06.380
 so i think i will get it off you can 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.930
 apply it less according to your taste 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:14.329
 and nothing I hope you like the idea e 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:17.450
 I leave you hello tutorials we will need 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:21.259
 approximately 1300 amiable in size 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.329
 midi or those with a diameter of 0.5 cm 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.710
 outside and height 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:29.060
 in particular they will use it 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:34.219
 approximately 200 green 70 black 160 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:37.039
 brown 180 orange 90 red and 520 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:40.250
 then we will need the square base 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.560
 for the lovable ones I midi the baking paper 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.509
 I'll use tweezers to help me 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.149
 place the beads on the tablet 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.340
 then we will need the iron and the 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.049
 hot glue all the material that 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.390
 will use in this video you can 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:58.159
 buy on the site www.perlapace.it for 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.039
 we need to build the house 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.840
 various parts that we will then fit together 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.909
 to glue together using the 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.740
 hot glue I will leave the patterns 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.869
 within the video you can 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.570
 taking pictures of the screen is keeping it 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.570
 scheme always at hand 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.409
 in particular we will need a part with 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.409
 this form 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.130
 a part with this other form for the 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.130
 back of the house 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:37.080
 two identical parts with this shape for 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.080
 the side part of the house 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.440
 then we will need a layer with this 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.440
 shape for the roof 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.450
 and a layer 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.460
 but for the other part of the roof this 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.460
 part we say identical to the previous one 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.620
 just a row of orange beads 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.810
 in addition on this side it is also one 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.810
 crack to get through trouble 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.050
 almost serves 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.730
 and like this for the base of the house not 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.050
 make houses with the colors I had finished 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.370
 green beads so I got them 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.370
 arranged in this way 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.540
 and then you will need three identical parts 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.819
 with this form to realize the 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.840
 chimney of the house that we will go to 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.840
 position over the roof 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.660
 point we just have to assemble the 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.910
 our little house 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.720
 take the front part with the 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:52.030
 little door is a window and we take 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.360
 one of the side parts with the two 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:01.000
 windows and let them fit into 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:03.100
 this way we take the other part 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.930
 side with the two windows e 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:10.020
 we repeat the same passage from quest 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.020
 other side by fitting these two parts 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:18.030
 in this way we now turn the house 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:23.009
 we take the back part with 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:25.460
 this form and we also fit this 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:25.460
 part 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:38.240
 now let's take our green base 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:42.800
 small meadow and we are going to position it 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.189
 immediately getting them to fit together 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.189
 various parts 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:02.659
 at this point it's time to 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.039
 use the hot glue then 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:06.139
 holding the house in this position 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.360
 with the door facing us 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:13.180
 let's go apply some glue to 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:21.939
 warm on the left side of the house 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:21.939
 so a little bit here on this side 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.990
 only on the edge 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.180
 and also a little from this other side 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.670
 in this way and then we go immediately to 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:49.780
 place on this side of the roof 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:49.780
 the one without a slot we press a little 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:06.730
 and behold, now let us take up the glue a 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.240
 warm and spread some glue on the 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.240
 board 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:18.160
 and also on these orange beads of the 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.160
 roof 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.530
 we take the part of the roof with the 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.360
 crack and let's position it in 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:33.340
 this way by slightly overlapping it 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.340
 to the roof that we have positioned before 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:46.070
 and that's it 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:48.260
 let's go glue the comignano a 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.960
 this point and we glue the three layers 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:55.400
 which will make up the chimney one above 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:07:04.850
 the other then spread some glue 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:08.210
 over the entire surface and we glue 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:12.220
 above the first layer by matching 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.220
 perfectly the edges 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:28.050
 some more glue and place 

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.050
 above the third layer 

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:45.409
 now we will have to place the chimney more 

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:54.669
 or less at this point then we spread 

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:54.669
 a little glue to the base 

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:02.040
 and then we place the chimney on this one 

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.040
 height 

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.660
 and here is the result 

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.190
 guys the tutorial determined I hope 

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.410
 that this idea you are absolute and that 

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:15.639
 you will realize it, we feel ourselves to the next 

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.639
 hello video
