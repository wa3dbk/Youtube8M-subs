00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.859
 and 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.090
 and 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.590
 in the bad 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.359
 and as I said at the beginning of the championship 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.160
 I think nobody bet that this 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.349
 height now placed this first that 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.539
 there is a how are we are like 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.520
 we are now but we always 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.619
 we trust in the work and that if 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.230
 we did things right in practice 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.850
 then eventually on the court I went to 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.650
 have the result what we were 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.010
 doing so I think for us 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.690
 is not an objective that we always look for and 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.670
 we are very happy but also 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.040
 always clarified the same the feet on 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.420
 the earth to know that we are first that 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.420
 there are matches to finish first 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.570
 what's there could show a little bit of 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.120
 be great and you can say that 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.829
 we enter a cup but then no more 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.449
 of that not after the truth comes that 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.269
 are the playofs the treatments was 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.149
 quite a lot was also very hot I think 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:08.630
 that more in synthetic feels more heat 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:11.060
 for us who play costs 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.030
 but but good how important are they going 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.679
 to them has a team plays very well and 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.450
 good in general we are happy 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:20.720
 also because we are always first 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.700
 we look for that we are a date d 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.040
 the goal that I went into a cup so 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.390
 we hope they follow this path and today 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.800
 after the truth that makes them 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.060
 properties that depend on keeping the day 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.820
 finished well I think if you finish 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.950
 first have sports advantage you have 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.450
 a quota to the South American 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.979
 and good for us is going to be very 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.750
 important also he finished it 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.509
 first in the championship but we know 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.030
 that the grounds are two games to life 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.060
 or death and we have to do well 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.500
 things and here it would be in vain to finish 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.880
 first and stay out in the final quarter 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.799
 Our goal is to be 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.210
 champions so we have to have the 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.470
 feet on the ground we know how I say 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.079
 whenever you have to improve always 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.140
 we have to improve with san felipe has a 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:05.000
 stumbled that we do not but we think 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.799
 that to realize and also what 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.060
 did well to realize that if not 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.369
 it's a lot of folk you can at any 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.560
 team and good lottery was a match 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.940
 hard and I think we took it forward and 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.220
 that's why I think we're fair 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.560
 deserving is the first dish I think 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.780
 which is one from lowest to highest 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.090
 the last game was not very showy 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.440
 but but as I told you it also comes 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.120
 playing with a lot of heat 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.739
 then he gave me at noon I think that already 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.010
 the second time it felt very hot 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.080
 and that we are people and that 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.180
 It gives a little bit more fatigue 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.750
 it feels flatter a little heavier 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.269
 but we get a three points very 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.150
 important and as I said now we are 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.980
 first also doing many goals and 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.209
 we have cart striker that I think 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.310
 comes a very important streak for 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.190
 us and I think all the rivals 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.630
 they play here there is no difference I think in 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.610
 the current football there is no difference with 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.440
 no team if you are not focused 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.870
 you're not applied I think you can 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.340
 anybody no no there is a difference to 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.110
 all matches for the matches you go 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.630
 to win they have to enter that we have it 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.819
 clear and was the example with san felipe 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.080
 san felipe was fighting down too 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.239
 he was playing a little life for 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.769
 for what not to descend and we 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.140
 we enter relaxed and what are the 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.330
 angles won after with antofagasta 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.250
 I think there was a moment that as I said 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.750
 before we did the goals moments 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.510
 key and that for us was very 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.140
 important we do not start well they do not go 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.480
 giving the results 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.830
 we tied a lot but we killed ourselves in 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.480
 the practice the group was always 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.030
 united we were always convinced what 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.300
 what the teacher wanted and today you see the 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.720
 fruits as I told you also the feet 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.190
 on the earth here is a date for 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.870
 achieve the first goal but what 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.060
 we want everything to be a champion so it's 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.580
 there in the playoffs is where we have to 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.320
 leave everything to prove that it is very good 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.910
 to be a champion and we have to take 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.209
 all matches as finals now the 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.890
 Wednesday drink chile on Saturday with water 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.570
 to ensure a quota that for us 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.300
 makes very important in many years colo 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.580
 colo does not play us his american he plays 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.320
 an international cup then they go as 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.720
 another is going to be very important 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.310
 to achieve the first goal but 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.670
 the objective that we have here is the 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.670
 champion
