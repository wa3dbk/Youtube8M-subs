computer<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.960> if<00:01:43.110> they<00:01:43.320> don't<00:01:43.530> want<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.920> there

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
computer is if they don't want it there

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.999 
computer is if they don't want it there
might<00:01:44.340> be<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.579> good<00:01:44.880> reason<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:46.259> check<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.799> out

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
might be a good reason so check it out

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.800 
might be a good reason so check it out
thoroughly<00:01:47.340> make<00:01:47.820> sure<00:01:48.030> what<00:01:48.240> they're<00:01:48.420> asking

you're willing to to pay for that

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.139 
you're willing to to pay for that
machine<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.040> before<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.340> even<00:01:53.460> go<00:01:53.880> there

capability of that particular machine is

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.789 
capability of that particular machine is
now<00:01:59.939> buying<00:02:00.240> them<00:02:00.450> from<00:02:00.600> somebody<00:02:01.110> who<00:02:01.619> is
