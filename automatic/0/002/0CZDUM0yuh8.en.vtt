hi my name is Tim McGee and I'm the
author<00:00:03.570> of<00:00:03.720> toxic<00:00:04.170> health<00:00:04.410> and<00:00:05.190> we're<00:00:05.730> here<00:00:05.940> to

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
author of toxic health and we're here to

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.620 
author of toxic health and we're here to
review<00:00:06.870> this<00:00:07.259> experiment<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.580> this<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.510> an

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
review this experiment and this is an

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.650 
review this experiment and this is an
experiment<00:00:10.260> where<00:00:10.620> each<00:00:10.980> plant<00:00:11.429> it's<00:00:12.420> going

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
experiment where each plant it's going

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.950 
experiment where each plant it's going
to<00:00:12.780> get<00:00:12.900> watered<00:00:13.349> with<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.340> different<00:00:15.000> type<00:00:15.660> of

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
to get watered with a different type of

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.320 
to get watered with a different type of
water<00:00:16.460> and<00:00:17.460> it's<00:00:17.670> now<00:00:17.850> September<00:00:19.010> 2013<00:00:20.240> and<00:00:21.240> we

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
water and it's now September 2013 and we

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.609 
water and it's now September 2013 and we
started<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:21.900> experiment<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.949> June<00:00:23.490> 2013<00:00:24.619> and

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
started this experiment in June 2013 and

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.250 
started this experiment in June 2013 and
it's<00:00:25.920> actually<00:00:26.279> starting<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.000> give<00:00:27.390> results

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
it's actually starting to give results

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.620 
it's actually starting to give results
so<00:00:29.130> we're<00:00:29.340> going<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.519> go<00:00:29.609> through<00:00:30.029> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
so we're going to go through the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.440 
so we're going to go through the
individual<00:00:31.470> plans<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.399> I'm<00:00:33.030> going<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.210> show

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
individual plans and I'm going to show

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.770 
individual plans and I'm going to show
you<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.780> first<00:00:34.559> plant<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.460> showing<00:00:35.910> some

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
you the first plant that is showing some

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.330 
you the first plant that is showing some
defects<00:00:37.579> so<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.739> Tucson<00:00:40.950> water

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
defects so this is the Tucson water

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.110 
defects so this is the Tucson water
plant<00:00:41.809> it's<00:00:42.809> actually<00:00:43.170> doing<00:00:44.010> very<00:00:44.610> well<00:00:44.700> so

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
plant it's actually doing very well so

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.880 
plant it's actually doing very well so
this<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.539> tap<00:00:45.780> water<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:47.750> this<00:00:48.750> one<00:00:49.050> is

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
this is the tap water and this one is

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.170 
this is the tap water and this one is
aged<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:51.059> some<00:00:51.270> water<00:00:51.559> from<00:00:52.559> 2011<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:54.000> is

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
aged to some water from 2011 so this is

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.860 
aged to some water from 2011 so this is
being<00:00:54.989> kept<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.890> water<00:00:56.129> container<00:00:56.879> it's

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
being kept in a water container it's

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.470 
being kept in a water container it's
doing<00:00:58.170> very<00:00:58.379> well<00:00:58.879> but<00:00:59.879> it's<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.210> different

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
doing very well but it's a different

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.240 
doing very well but it's a different
story<00:01:00.690> here<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.739> we're<00:01:01.949> starting<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.489> see<00:01:02.520> some

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
story here so we're starting to see some

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.740 
story here so we're starting to see some
problems<00:01:05.250> with<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.489> water<00:01:05.640> pitcher<00:01:05.970> Wardens

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
problems with the water pitcher Wardens

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.670 
problems with the water pitcher Wardens
right<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.939> so<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.680> there

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
right here so you can see that there

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.670 
right here so you can see that there
appears<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.010> be<00:01:11.100> some<00:01:11.760> deformity<00:01:12.540> going<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.409> in

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
appears to be some deformity going on in

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.620 
appears to be some deformity going on in
this<00:01:13.920> area<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:15.090> we're<00:01:15.180> gonna<00:01:15.270> have<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.509> watch

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
this area so we're gonna have to watch

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.240 
this area so we're gonna have to watch
this<00:01:15.810> one<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> while<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.770> see<00:01:16.950> where<00:01:17.070> that

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
this one for a while and see where that

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.760 
this one for a while and see where that
continues<00:01:19.189> so<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.369> one<00:01:20.610> right<00:01:20.820> here<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.770> our

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
continues so this one right here is our

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.510 
continues so this one right here is our
steam<00:01:23.159> distilled<00:01:24.030> water<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:26.159> doing

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
steam distilled water and it's doing

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.020 
steam distilled water and it's doing
just<00:01:27.030> fine<00:01:27.299> as<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.590> one<00:01:29.000> which<00:01:30.000> is

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
just fine as is this one which is

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.039 
just fine as is this one which is
reverse<00:01:30.750> osmosis<00:01:31.140> you'd<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:32.040> treated<00:01:33.049> and

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
reverse osmosis you'd be treated and

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.670 
reverse osmosis you'd be treated and
this<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.619> our<00:01:34.799> microwaved<00:01:35.430> water<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:36.680> don't

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
this one is our microwaved water I don't

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.370 
this one is our microwaved water I don't
see<00:01:37.950> any<00:01:38.100> problems<00:01:38.430> with<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:38.759> one<00:01:39.170> this<00:01:40.170> one

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
see any problems with this one this one

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.590 
see any problems with this one this one
is<00:01:40.560> doing<00:01:40.770> fine<00:01:41.420> which<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:43.610> Emma<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.850> am<00:01:45.479> i

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
is doing fine which is Emma and am i

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.499 
is doing fine which is Emma and am i
water<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.040> water<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.880> treated

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
water so this is water that is treated

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.490 
water so this is water that is treated
by<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.939> transmitting<00:01:51.290> utility<00:01:52.290> meters<00:01:53.149> so<00:01:54.500> no

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
by the transmitting utility meters so no

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.910 
by the transmitting utility meters so no
real<00:01:55.710> problems<00:01:56.310> with<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.460> plan<00:01:56.820> right<00:01:57.030> now

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
real problems with that plan right now

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.580 
real problems with that plan right now
so<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.219> one<00:01:59.369> looks<00:01:59.490> good<00:01:59.990> this<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.170> Wi-Fi

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
so this one looks good this is Wi-Fi

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.940 
so this one looks good this is Wi-Fi
water<00:02:02.689> and<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.140> actually<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.560> best<00:02:04.710> plan

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
water and this is actually the best plan

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.730 
water and this is actually the best plan
right<00:02:05.159> now<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.729> one's<00:02:05.939> got<00:02:06.299> tea<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.560> one

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
right now so this one's got tea this one

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.080 
right now so this one's got tea this one
gets

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
gets

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.530 
gets
fresh<00:02:09.300> cup<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.929> cold<00:02:10.500> tea<00:02:11.180> every<00:02:12.180> time<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.450> gets

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
fresh cup of cold tea every time it gets

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.040 
fresh cup of cold tea every time it gets
watered<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.290> it's<00:02:13.560> doing<00:02:13.860> very<00:02:14.040> very<00:02:14.099> well

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
watered and it's doing very very well

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.619 
watered and it's doing very very well
and<00:02:16.050> this<00:02:16.290> one<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:17.180> coffee<00:02:19.730> this<00:02:20.730> one<00:02:21.030> over

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:28.240 
and this one is coffee this one over
here's<00:02:21.870> diet<00:02:22.560> lemonade<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:25.489> this<00:02:26.489> one<00:02:26.730> is

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
here's diet lemonade and this one is

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.430 
here's diet lemonade and this one is
diet<00:02:29.250> cola<00:02:29.580> so<00:02:30.920> that's<00:02:31.920> our<00:02:32.540> experiment<00:02:33.540> to

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
diet cola so that's our experiment to

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.809 
diet cola so that's our experiment to
date<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:35.780> we'll<00:02:36.780> come<00:02:37.140> back<00:02:37.349> and<00:02:37.590> review<00:02:38.430> this
