00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 the remembered jorge porcel who had 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.240
 stayed three months interned his son 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.740
 jorge porcel junior is not only found 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.420
 distressed but also has the 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.580
 suspected that could have been incurred 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.650
 in malpractice on the part of doctors 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.560
 who attended her is let's move on to 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.590
 another topic that is the one of jorgito for being 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.529
 Junior, we told them a while ago that 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.630
 his norm mother died a week ago 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.699
 apparently he asks for an autopsy 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.960
 because he feels there was malpractice but 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.090
 a trial in the hospital where I was 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.380
 hospitalized and surely there will be actions 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.149
 legal what happened 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.969
 I'm not going to ask you to respect my pain 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:41.640
 and my silence I come to assert my 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.809
 rights as the law establishes nothing 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.840
 more or nothing less than that 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.260
 the issue is that I now also what you 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.390
 have you have doubts about the ambiguous 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.540
 malpractice with the treatment he 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.240
 did his mother is what he looks for 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.570
 and so you're going to see the reality there are two 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:04.050
 possibilities although a bad practice 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:09.180
 although he had not suffered it in the flesh 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:12.310
 own a persecution campaign 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.090
 telling him that I'm a lazy guy that this 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.600
 the other when I look for work and not 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.939
 I have the mind behind excuse the 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.460
 term to punched on the street saying 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:28.149
 elevated because they warm your head to 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.490
 people with medicines found by 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.909
 that at the time I said about the 20 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.509
 Lucas because he was expressive of both 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.509
 accumulated pain 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.520
 from having expressed so much 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:54.979
 but 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:54.979
 and nothing 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.420
 when you start putting in saint in 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.120
 complicated state that doctors talk 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.100
 with your mother's voice when she produces 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.510
 produce that 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.510
 I had achieved it long 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.689
 interned festivals 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.689
 true 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.349
 is working 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.349
 the little plate 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.680
 whenever your mom was hospitalized 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.680
 Jorge 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.520
 what was the end of it was that no 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.990
 there was way to put him or radio 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.840
 and chemotherapy 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.460
 and other doctors talked about making a 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.470
 rehabilitation 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.930
 when they see that someone came and said he 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.510
 they want to get him out 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.510
 Jorge, what do you remember about your old woman? 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.620
 sweet friends something for saving my life 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.620
 because they are killing me 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.420
 and I have had strong strong luck 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:38.330
 and what we need today 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.340
 This will have a key organ that 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:49.080
 minister we did not enter poster just 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:51.920
 shoot under permission with your 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:57.870
 more stable mind with any concept 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:04:01.280
 many colors only what you asked me 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.280
 of the song 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.380
 as Jorge understands the health of his 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.210
 mother began to get worse from that 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.100
 both had a greater exposure in 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.510
 the media while claiming for a 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.040
 source of work so that he could 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.430
 cope with its precarious situation 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.430
 economic 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:23.140
 at some point I feel less than a meter 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.140
 of my kansas 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.290
 yes 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.300
 the guard will report expressly 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:55.460
 and it is not with you but enough told me 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.990
 live if the rhythms that are still laughing 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.580
 brothers said he just called the 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:04.790
 Police do not bother my house door 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.440
 are restricting our freedom in the 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.960
 normal path 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.960
 good if you take it is a public space 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:18.680
 if that 's so good we've wanted 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:24.400
 enough I do not want I do not want notes not 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.400
 we want more still 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.819
 good do better because there 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:49.020
 by quito sooner or later in the morning 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.600
 my son is a man who goes out and goes back to 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.970
 the time he wants son is not that for 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.390
 what I wanted to talk to the outside 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.580
 where he came back from being junior at 7 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.710
 in the morning he enjoys life 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.960
 while her mother goes out every day to 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.110
 ask in the street to have something 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.960
 what to eat and no camera 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.140
 I did not tell you, it does not stay because those 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.140
 reactions 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:22.340
 to my son all the programs are 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.810
 difficult moments for Jorge to be 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.580
 he finds himself mourning the 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.139
 death of his mother and does not finish being 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.780
 calm by how things were given 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:33.129
 That is why he asks to investigate if norm 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.129
 received the proper treatment 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.150
 good 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:48.610
 precarious because it depends on that age 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.610
 live with mom and her life 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.580
 of malpractice to what it refers to in 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.720
 reality is that last year it was 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.240
 hospitalized her for an infection 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.160
 urinary and then detect a cancer 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.900
 about which nothing can be done 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.210
 then what he says is or not what 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:09.030
 they detected or it was fulminant not what 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:09.030
 they detected the year 88 and peak 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.800
 let's check our
