several factors that go into listing

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:49.430 
several factors that go into listing
these<00:00:48.059> animals<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.780> list<00:00:49.019> and<00:00:49.170> then<00:00:49.260> they

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
these animals on this list and then they

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.910 
these animals on this list and then they

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
have other subcategories I guess you can

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.820 
have other subcategories I guess you can
