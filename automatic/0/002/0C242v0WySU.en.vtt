00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
a scout up close you have to use two

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.990 
a scout up close you have to use two
rockets<00:01:21.750> with<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> direct<00:01:22.920> hit<00:01:23.070> one<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.820> that

rockets with the direct hit one and that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.640 
rockets with the direct hit one and that
scout<00:01:24.390> sniper<00:01:25.220> spy<00:01:26.220> down<00:01:27.210> instantly<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.020> if

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
scout sniper spy down instantly and if

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.890 
scout sniper spy down instantly and if
you<00:01:28.770> get<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> crit<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.700> will<00:01:29.850> most<00:01:30.390> likely<00:01:30.509> be

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
you get a crit you will most likely be

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.660 
you get a crit you will most likely be
able<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.200> take<00:01:31.380> out<00:01:31.560> every<00:01:32.070> single<00:01:32.400> class<00:01:32.640> that

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
able to take out every single class that

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.340 
able to take out every single class that
isn't<00:01:33.240> over<00:01:33.450> heal<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:35.240> for<00:01:36.240> me<00:01:36.390> personally<00:01:36.720> my

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
isn't over heal and for me personally my

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.100 
isn't over heal and for me personally my
aim<00:01:37.710> isn't<00:01:38.070> all<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.490> good<00:01:39.240> especially<00:01:39.990> when

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
aim isn't all that good especially when

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.230 
aim isn't all that good especially when
playing<00:01:40.259> soldier<00:01:40.799> because<00:01:41.100> I'm<00:01:41.670> all<00:01:41.970> used<00:01:42.150> to

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
playing soldier because I'm all used to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.410 
playing soldier because I'm all used to
the<00:01:42.390> whole<00:01:42.540> aim<00:01:43.110> at<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.409> ground<00:01:44.180> four<00:01:45.180> feet

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
the whole aim at the ground four feet

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.850 
the whole aim at the ground four feet
away<00:01:45.540> from<00:01:45.720> them<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.110> you'll<00:01:46.259> still<00:01:46.470> get<00:01:46.680> them

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
away from them and you'll still get them

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.280 
away from them and you'll still get them
so<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:48.810> small<00:01:49.229> blast<00:01:49.470> radius<00:01:49.799> does<00:01:50.340> not<00:01:51.290> bode

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
so the small blast radius does not bode

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.289 
so the small blast radius does not bode
that<00:01:52.590> well<00:01:52.799> for<00:01:52.979> me<00:01:53.100> because<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.460> don't<00:01:54.000> do<00:01:54.149> any

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
that well for me because I don't do any

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.490 
that well for me because I don't do any
damage<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:56.549> next<00:01:57.000> weapon<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.990> beggars

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
damage the next weapon is the beggars

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.330 
damage the next weapon is the beggars

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.839 
favorite soldier primary really because
it<00:02:07.020> only<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.680> can<00:02:07.829> only<00:02:07.920> use<00:02:08.099> three<00:02:08.310> rockets

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
it only you can only use three rockets

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.809 
it only you can only use three rockets
you<00:02:09.750> can't<00:02:10.020> pick<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.229> famil<00:02:10.530> from<00:02:10.679> dispensers

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
you can't pick a famil from dispensers

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.209 
you can't pick a famil from dispensers
and<00:02:11.909> you're<00:02:12.629> often<00:02:12.810> really<00:02:13.469> really

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:14.219 
and you're often really really

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:17.270 
and you're often really really

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
to load up all your rockets fire them

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.869 
to load up all your rockets fire them
all<00:02:23.939> at<00:02:24.120> once<00:02:24.349> which<00:02:25.349> for<00:02:25.799> me<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.189> often<00:02:26.609> end<00:02:26.760> up

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
all at once which for me I often end up

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.490 
all at once which for me I often end up
accidentally<00:02:27.389> shooting<00:02:27.689> a<00:02:27.900> wall<00:02:28.079> in<00:02:28.260> killing

myself which to be honest isn't all that

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.699 
myself which to be honest isn't all that
useful<00:02:32.900> but<00:02:33.900> there<00:02:34.079> aren't<00:02:34.200> good<00:02:34.349> points<00:02:34.620> to

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
it you can do a lot of damage in a short

it you can do a lot of damage in a short
space<00:02:37.019> of<00:02:37.079> time<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.469> can<00:02:37.650> take<00:02:38.010> out<00:02:38.189> heavies

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
space of time you can take out heavies

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.250 
space of time you can take out heavies
quickly<00:02:39.060> if<00:02:39.269> you've<00:02:39.419> already<00:02:39.719> got<00:02:40.019> it<00:02:40.079> loaded

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
quickly if you've already got it loaded

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.860 
quickly if you've already got it loaded
up<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.909> its<00:02:41.909> really<00:02:42.030> good<00:02:42.359> for<00:02:42.480> ambushing

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
up and its really good for ambushing

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.809 
up and its really good for ambushing
people<00:02:43.260> lead<00:02:43.799> someone<00:02:44.129> around<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.370> corner<00:02:44.609> when

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
people lead someone around a corner when

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:45.740 
people lead someone around a corner when
you've<00:02:44.939> got<00:02:45.090> when<00:02:45.299> you're<00:02:45.389> loading<00:02:45.659> your

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
you've got when you're loading your

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.479 
you've got when you're loading your
rockets<00:02:46.109> and<00:02:46.590> listen<00:02:46.859> if<00:02:46.950> they<00:02:47.069> go<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.310> pass

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
rockets and listen if they go and pass

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.599 
rockets and listen if they go and pass
that<00:02:47.639> corner<00:02:47.969> you<00:02:48.599> can<00:02:48.750> kill<00:02:48.900> them<00:02:49.079> so<00:02:49.889> it's

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
that corner you can kill them so it's

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.259 
that corner you can kill them so it's
not<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:51.150> completely<00:02:51.689> useless<00:02:51.930> weapon<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:53.269> the

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
not a completely useless weapon and the

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.970 
not a completely useless weapon and the
cow<00:02:54.689> Mangler<00:02:54.959> now<00:02:55.949> this<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:57.620> probably<00:02:58.620> the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
cow Mangler now this is probably the

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.610 
cow Mangler now this is probably the
second<00:02:59.519> best<00:02:59.819> rocket<00:03:00.329> launcher<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:00.930> my

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
second best rocket launcher in my

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.959 
second best rocket launcher in my
opinion<00:03:03.019> it<00:03:04.019> has<00:03:04.409> unlimited<00:03:04.769> ammo<00:03:05.189> you<00:03:05.699> don't

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:05.969 
opinion it has unlimited ammo you don't

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:07.729 
opinion it has unlimited ammo you don't
need<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.150> pick<00:03:06.269> up<00:03:06.359> ammo<00:03:06.599> packs<00:03:06.900> -<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.620> know

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
need to pick up ammo packs - you know

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.670 
need to pick up ammo packs - you know
reload<00:03:08.129> so<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:09.780> know<00:03:09.870> there's<00:03:10.139> no<00:03:10.290> excuse<00:03:10.650> for

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
reload so you know there's no excuse for

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.490 
reload so you know there's no excuse for
not<00:03:10.859> using<00:03:11.099> it<00:03:11.370> if<00:03:11.549> you're<00:03:12.299> you<00:03:12.900> know<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.260> in<00:03:13.439> a

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
not using it if you're you know and in a

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.319 
not using it if you're you know and in a
king<00:03:13.709> of<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:13.859> hill<00:03:13.919> where<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.310> ammo<00:03:15.090> packs

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
king of the hill where the ammo packs

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.140 
king of the hill where the ammo packs
usually<00:03:15.719> there's<00:03:15.930> really<00:03:16.199> tiny<00:03:16.620> ones<00:03:16.889> and<00:03:17.310> it

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
usually there's really tiny ones and it

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.819 
usually there's really tiny ones and it
has<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.419> same<00:03:18.629> reload<00:03:19.079> times<00:03:19.379> to<00:03:19.590> stock

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
has the same reload times to stock

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.369 
has the same reload times to stock
rocket<00:03:20.189> launcher<00:03:20.549> it<00:03:21.060> was<00:03:21.359> update<00:03:21.989> it<00:03:22.109> used<00:03:22.259> to

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
rocket launcher it was update it used to

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:23.809 
rocket launcher it was update it used to
have<00:03:22.530> slower<00:03:23.009> reload<00:03:23.250> time

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
have slower reload time

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.839 
have slower reload time
now<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.299> doesn't<00:03:24.479> um<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:26.250> can<00:03:26.459> make<00:03:26.609> enemies

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
now it doesn't um it can make enemies

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.780 
now it doesn't um it can make enemies
panic<00:03:27.540> because<00:03:28.470> when<00:03:28.769> they're<00:03:28.919> on<00:03:28.979> fire<00:03:29.250> well

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
panic because when they're on fire well

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.069 
panic because when they're on fire well
whenever<00:03:30.090> you're<00:03:30.329> on<00:03:30.359> fire<00:03:30.659> in<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.930> game

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
whenever you're on fire in the game

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.439 
whenever you're on fire in the game
you're<00:03:31.259> like<00:03:31.409> I'm<00:03:32.310> on<00:03:32.459> fire<00:03:32.729> I<00:03:33.030> need<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.299> do

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
you're like I'm on fire I need to do

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.629 
you're like I'm on fire I need to do
something<00:03:33.780> about<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:34.229> because<00:03:35.009> when<00:03:35.549> you

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
something about that because when you

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.420 
something about that because when you
right-click<00:03:35.819> with<00:03:36.180> this<00:03:36.299> weapon<00:03:36.500> you<00:03:37.500> fire

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
right-click with this weapon you fire

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.020 
right-click with this weapon you fire
all<00:03:38.729> your<00:03:38.909> shots<00:03:39.120> at<00:03:39.269> once<00:03:39.479> and<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:41.250> does<00:03:41.519> mini

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
all your shots at once and it does mini

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.550 
all your shots at once and it does mini
quick<00:03:42.239> damage<00:03:42.449> I<00:03:42.720> think<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:42.989> does<00:03:43.109> twice<00:03:43.379> as

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
quick damage I think it does twice as

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.369 
quick damage I think it does twice as
much<00:03:43.680> damage<00:03:43.889> anyway<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.629> it<00:03:45.629> sets<00:03:46.049> all<00:03:46.349> the

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
much damage anyway and it sets all the

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.770 
much damage anyway and it sets all the
enemies<00:03:46.739> on<00:03:46.889> fire<00:03:47.189> who<00:03:47.430> were<00:03:47.549> hit<00:03:47.699> by<00:03:47.849> it<00:03:47.909> so

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
enemies on fire who were hit by it so

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.749 
enemies on fire who were hit by it so
that<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:49.739> brilliant

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:50.759 
that is brilliant

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:53.599 
that is brilliant
and<00:03:50.879> if<00:03:51.720> there<00:03:51.900> are<00:03:51.930> no<00:03:52.259> engineers<00:03:52.859> so<00:03:53.370> no

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
and if there are no engineers so no

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.339 
and if there are no engineers so no
sentries<00:03:54.030> or<00:03:54.150> anything<00:03:54.329> on<00:03:54.719> the<00:03:55.049> enemy<00:03:55.319> team

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
sentries or anything on the enemy team

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.039 
sentries or anything on the enemy team
it's<00:03:56.280> basically<00:03:56.729> a<00:03:56.849> stock<00:03:57.239> upgrade<00:03:57.689> to<00:03:57.959> the

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
it's basically a stock upgrade to the

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.520 
it's basically a stock upgrade to the
default<00:03:58.469> one<00:03:58.879> but<00:03:59.879> as<00:04:00.209> this<00:04:00.930> is<00:04:00.989> usually<00:04:01.259> the

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
default one but as this is usually the

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.199 
default one but as this is usually the
case<00:04:01.709> there<00:04:02.189> will<00:04:02.310> be<00:04:02.370> an<00:04:02.579> engineer<00:04:02.729> there

case there will be an engineer there
will<00:04:03.299> be<00:04:03.329> a<00:04:03.449> mini<00:04:03.780> sentry<00:04:04.169> or<00:04:04.290> like<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.709> normal

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
will be a mini sentry or like a normal

will be a mini sentry or like a normal
century<00:04:05.400> or<00:04:05.519> something<00:04:05.669> and<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:07.019> damage<00:04:07.379> that

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
century or something and the damage that

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.030 
century or something and the damage that
this<00:04:07.739> weapon<00:04:08.129> does<00:04:08.310> is

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
this weapon does is

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.429 
this weapon does is
patek<00:04:09.519> the<00:04:10.150> default<00:04:10.629> rocket<00:04:10.959> launcher<00:04:11.260> does

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 
patek the default rocket launcher does

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.069 
patek the default rocket launcher does
really<00:04:12.159> good<00:04:12.430> damage<00:04:12.670> against<00:04:13.269> buildings<00:04:13.810> and

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
really good damage against buildings and

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.039 
really good damage against buildings and
sentry<00:04:14.439> guns<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:16.030> next<00:04:16.269> rocket<00:04:16.419> launcher<00:04:16.870> is

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
sentry guns the next rocket launcher is

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.029 
sentry guns the next rocket launcher is
the<00:04:17.739> Liberty<00:04:18.220> launcher<00:04:18.609> I<00:04:18.880> like<00:04:19.449> this<00:04:20.039> rocket

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
the Liberty launcher I like this rocket

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.520 
the Liberty launcher I like this rocket
launcher<00:04:21.400> because<00:04:21.729> it's<00:04:22.539> good<00:04:22.930> it's<00:04:23.259> it's

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
launcher because it's good it's it's

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.370 
launcher because it's good it's it's
reliable<00:04:24.220> and<00:04:24.610> it<00:04:25.389> has<00:04:25.539> fast<00:04:25.810> rocket<00:04:26.050> speeds

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
reliable and it has fast rocket speeds

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.400 
reliable and it has fast rocket speeds
so<00:04:26.680> it<00:04:26.889> throws<00:04:27.340> Pyro's<00:04:27.880> off<00:04:28.060> so<00:04:28.539> no<00:04:29.139> air

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
so it throws Pyro's off so no air

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.860 
so it throws Pyro's off so no air
blasting<00:04:29.889> well<00:04:30.280> very<00:04:30.669> little<00:04:30.789> only<00:04:31.479> really

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
blasting well very little only really

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.270 
blasting well very little only really
good<00:04:31.990> pirates<00:04:32.350> managed<00:04:32.620> to<00:04:32.740> air<00:04:32.860> blast<00:04:33.100> these

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
good pirates managed to air blast these

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.390 
good pirates managed to air blast these
consistently<00:04:34.169> you<00:04:35.169> take<00:04:35.380> less<00:04:35.650> less<00:04:36.070> damage

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
consistently you take less less damage

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.580 
consistently you take less less damage
when<00:04:36.580> rocket<00:04:36.910> jumping<00:04:37.210> and<00:04:37.419> if<00:04:38.259> you're<00:04:38.410> using

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
when rocket jumping and if you're using

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.650 
when rocket jumping and if you're using
the<00:04:38.830> gunboats<00:04:39.250> you're<00:04:39.490> only<00:04:39.669> taking<00:04:40.090> 10%

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
the gunboats you're only taking 10%

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.700 
the gunboats you're only taking 10%
damage<00:04:41.349> which<00:04:41.919> is<00:04:42.000> like<00:04:43.000> six<00:04:43.599> so<00:04:44.080> you<00:04:44.110> can<00:04:44.289> jump

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
damage which is like six so you can jump

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.550 
damage which is like six so you can jump
all<00:04:44.860> day<00:04:45.180> but<00:04:46.180> it<00:04:46.270> does<00:04:46.479> less<00:04:46.780> damage<00:04:46.810> than<00:04:47.289> the

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
all day but it does less damage than the

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.320 
all day but it does less damage than the
stock<00:04:47.800> rocket<00:04:48.160> launcher<00:04:48.520> and<00:04:48.729> you<00:04:49.120> end<00:04:49.240> up

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
stock rocket launcher and you end up

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.510 
stock rocket launcher and you end up
having<00:04:49.479> to<00:04:49.660> fire<00:04:49.990> all<00:04:50.349> your<00:04:50.919> rockets<00:04:51.250> to<00:04:51.370> kill

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
having to fire all your rockets to kill

having to fire all your rockets to kill
a<00:04:51.550> heavy<00:04:51.849> where<00:04:52.120> usually<00:04:52.330> two<00:04:52.900> or<00:04:52.930> three<00:04:53.050> would

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
a heavy where usually two or three would

damage penalty which to be honest I

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.189 
damage penalty which to be honest I
would<00:05:55.240> have<00:05:55.330> thought<00:05:55.479> a<00:05:55.659> weapon<00:05:55.960> like<00:05:55.990> this

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 
would have thought a weapon like this

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.020 
would have thought a weapon like this
would<00:05:56.470> have<00:05:56.650> so<00:05:57.250> you<00:05:57.310> do<00:05:57.430> exactly<00:05:57.729> the<00:05:58.000> same

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
would have so you do exactly the same

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.750 
would have so you do exactly the same
time<00:05:58.360> much<00:05:58.419> as<00:05:58.570> default<00:05:58.960> which<00:05:59.110> is<00:05:59.139> a<00:05:59.260> lot<00:05:59.760> but

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
time much as default which is a lot but

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.300 
time much as default which is a lot but
there's<00:06:01.270> less<00:06:01.780> clip<00:06:02.110> size<00:06:02.320> which<00:06:03.099> is

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
there's less clip size which is

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.089 
there's less clip size which is
understandable<00:06:04.090> and<00:06:04.360> it's<00:06:05.229> not<00:06:05.590> you're<00:06:06.070> not

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
understandable and it's not you're not

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.700 
understandable and it's not you're not
forfeiting<00:06:06.880> that<00:06:07.060> much<00:06:07.300> unless<00:06:07.900> your<00:06:08.259> rocket

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
forfeiting that much unless your rocket

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.270 
forfeiting that much unless your rocket
jumping<00:06:08.979> around<00:06:09.130> so<00:06:10.440> yeah<00:06:11.440> it<00:06:11.620> lets<00:06:11.830> you<00:06:12.070> if

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
jumping around so yeah it lets you if

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.920 
jumping around so yeah it lets you if
you<00:06:12.370> using<00:06:12.490> the<00:06:12.669> black<00:06:12.849> box<00:06:13.090> use<00:06:13.570> like<00:06:13.780> the

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
you using the black box use like the

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.510 
you using the black box use like the
Contra<00:06:14.409> or<00:06:14.770> the<00:06:15.639> one<00:06:16.539> of<00:06:16.570> those<00:06:16.720> banners

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
Contra or the one of those banners

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.890 
Contra or the one of those banners
that's<00:06:18.520> probably<00:06:19.060> one<00:06:19.240> of<00:06:19.270> the<00:06:19.389> best<00:06:19.630> options

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
that's probably one of the best options

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.330 
that's probably one of the best options
for<00:06:20.260> it<00:06:20.349> I'm<00:06:20.500> using<00:06:20.680> the<00:06:20.889> gunboats<00:06:21.250> because

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
for it I'm using the gunboats because

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.900 
for it I'm using the gunboats because
I'd<00:06:22.460> know<00:06:22.730> I<00:06:22.760> just<00:06:23.150> like<00:06:23.270> to<00:06:23.419> jump<00:06:23.630> um<00:06:24.550> yeah<00:06:25.550> and

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
I'd know I just like to jump um yeah and

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.780 
I'd know I just like to jump um yeah and
it<00:06:26.449> has<00:06:26.690> the<00:06:26.870> same<00:06:27.050> rocket<00:06:27.440> speed<00:06:27.650> now<00:06:28.430> I<00:06:28.699> know

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:28.790 
it has the same rocket speed now I know

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.210 
it has the same rocket speed now I know
it<00:06:29.120> has<00:06:29.330> never<00:06:29.660> been<00:06:29.780> a<00:06:30.230> gimmick<00:06:30.650> to<00:06:30.860> it<00:06:30.979> where

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.220 
it has never been a gimmick to it where

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.969 
it has never been a gimmick to it where
it<00:06:31.400> has<00:06:31.430> faster<00:06:32.120> or<00:06:32.240> slower<00:06:32.419> rocket<00:06:32.930> speed<00:06:33.169> but

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 
it has faster or slower rocket speed but

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:37.750 
it has faster or slower rocket speed but
it's<00:06:34.910> really<00:06:35.240> a<00:06:35.360> benefit<00:06:35.720> for<00:06:35.870> me<00:06:35.990> because<00:06:36.760> any

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
it's really a benefit for me because any

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.490 
it's really a benefit for me because any
rocket<00:06:38.150> launcher<00:06:38.419> that<00:06:38.540> has<00:06:38.690> faster<00:06:39.199> rocket

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
rocket launcher that has faster rocket

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.740 
rocket launcher that has faster rocket
speed<00:06:39.740> throws<00:06:40.430> me<00:06:40.669> off<00:06:40.699> it's<00:06:41.090> why<00:06:41.210> I<00:06:41.240> can't<00:06:41.479> aim

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
speed throws me off it's why I can't aim

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.290 
speed throws me off it's why I can't aim
with<00:06:41.900> the<00:06:41.990> beggars<00:06:42.290> bazooka<00:06:42.470> or<00:06:43.100> the<00:06:43.729> direct

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
with the beggars bazooka or the direct

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.659 
with the beggars bazooka or the direct
hit<00:06:44.479> because<00:06:44.750> I<00:06:45.010> just<00:06:46.010> get<00:06:46.130> thrown<00:06:46.310> off<00:06:46.430> quite

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:46.669 
hit because I just get thrown off quite

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:50.980 
hit because I just get thrown off quite
easily<00:06:46.960> so<00:06:48.190> yeah<00:06:49.190> that<00:06:49.699> is<00:06:49.940> my<00:06:50.300> favorite
