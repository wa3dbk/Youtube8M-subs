00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.020 

firstly<00:00:21.170> let<00:00:21.500> us<00:00:21.530> introduce<00:00:22.310> the<00:00:22.580> color

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.030 
firstly let us introduce the color

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.880 
firstly let us introduce the color
coding<00:00:23.510> system<00:00:23.540> that<00:00:24.140> we<00:00:24.260> will<00:00:24.410> use<00:00:24.650> to

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
coding system that we will use to

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.850 
coding system that we will use to
decipher<00:00:25.400> the<00:00:25.520> signal<00:00:25.850> MDE<00:00:26.150> method<00:00:26.710> here<00:00:27.710> we

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
decipher the signal MDE method here we

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.770 
decipher the signal MDE method here we
see<00:00:28.070> that<00:00:28.250> each<00:00:28.430> of<00:00:28.460> the<00:00:28.760> seven<00:00:29.119> planets<00:00:29.570> is

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:29.780 
see that each of the seven planets is

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.690 
see that each of the seven planets is
assigned<00:00:30.170> one<00:00:30.470> of<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:30.740> seven<00:00:31.100> colors<00:00:31.460> of<00:00:31.490> the

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
assigned one of the seven colors of the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.979 
assigned one of the seven colors of the
spectrum<00:00:31.940> of<00:00:32.510> light<00:00:33.440> divided<00:00:33.890> in<00:00:34.130> a<00:00:34.190> prism

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.840 

next<00:00:38.989> in<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:39.350> following<00:00:39.739> series<00:00:40.100> of<00:00:40.400> diagrams

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850
