the<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:34.740> magnitude<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.810> state<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.960> just

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
the the magnitude of this state is just

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.040 
the the magnitude of this state is just
incredible<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:37.920> huge<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.550> little<00:01:39.360> tiny<00:01:39.630> you

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
quicker than swimming pool placer and

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.300 
quicker than swimming pool placer and
such<00:02:15.540> but<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.709> know<00:02:16.830> they've<00:02:16.980> used<00:02:17.190> them

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
such but it you know they've used them

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.860 
such but it you know they've used them

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
in quarries for a year used it

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.390 
in quarries for a year used it
throughout<00:02:19.080> Europe<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:19.739> it's<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.190> very
