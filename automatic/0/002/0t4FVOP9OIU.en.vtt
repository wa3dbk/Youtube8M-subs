 The West is also the theft of peace so simple is the colors music 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.640
 Colors Colors Music and Word Immediately Mega Worn Out Effects 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.490
 yes, that's time open 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.450
 of gameplay sounds easy 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.550
 but it still manages to play with only five level team-title archivist 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.780
 to get along hot 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.050
 but first you should know what it's all about even if 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.680
 The decision is that Doric does not care much the same as in the US at the time 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.250
 I still do not want to deprive you of it 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.470
 There exists a huge archive called Give in Memory of All 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.780
 Mankind are saved 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.320
 In this archive, a human should be reproduced with fed 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.140
 own memories the project was named Project Lumi 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.610
 Of course, shortly before the end, the archive will be a nasty virus 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.460
 haunted 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.030
 St and now you come into play in ego-perspective, it's your job 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.400
 to destroy that virus that I asked of Klein now they are to 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.120
 Example impress creatures will show 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.820
 For example, here's a giant phoenix 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.870
 As far as the controller is concerned, you have to say hands to the controller in advance 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.250
 the support of Kinect sounds pretty good at first on these tracks, though 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.760
 you will quickly realize that there is a lack of implementation extremely 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.110
 not only that always had the goals thanks to the legal problems 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.850
 To criticize 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.530
 throughout the process, an office is pursued forward 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.790
 in the long run an extreme ordeal 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.140
 now and then when they work up to the special move 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.080
 perform 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.780
 but he once told Kinect what she was doing for a jumping jack 2 4 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.650
 you're already dead the positive thing was that I was with Kinect 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.809
 started and then took a controller to hand 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:10.209
 what a blessing 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.609
 because then you appreciate the idea behind the game happy 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:17.219
 Scheider for him kidnaps you in a colorful world and completely without 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.930
 Nevertheless, you will be in a state of intoxication, not just that 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.439
 Here you try to mark as many animals as possible at once 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:25.690
 to score more points 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.459
 No 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.309
 you will rise in effect 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:32.259
 because the better the composings the bigger the audience and thunderstorms 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:33.429
 on your screen 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:36.359
 so profits has the a-key on the Xbox Controller 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.469
 or the exact on the PlayStation and or pressed holds 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:43.539
 the chance to mark the goals and letting go of the effects as 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:45.059
 There would be no tomorrow 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:48.989
 the rear right door the expensive double a kind of Popo SMG 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:53.599
 later in the game, both weapons would have to combine skillfully 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.779
 For example, you can shoot purple objects only supervisor AIG and everything 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:01.949
 Others with Eurocom Womack There are some viruses that are defending themselves 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.379
 and steer that in the form of fruit bats 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.089
 and missiles 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:09.489
 what turns out to be simple at the beginning is especially in the 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.109
 It was extremely difficult for opponents around 5000 to fly him around 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.039
 Pauli and Saturday 11 12 clock will then suffer heavily if these things 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.999
 meet you 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.150
 Not only the renewed taking up of the idea of ​​Red inspired me 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.080
 but also the implementation fits in front and behind 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.830
 Degele Popband think suddenly with the complete soundtrack and their 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.130
 Friend singer in June 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.749
 Here is also the main character 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:35.919
 I have to admit when I fly with a few trailers to Schalke then 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.239
 I was just confused 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.010
 just as you control yourself this crosshair and is ready in Fürth 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.490
 to let 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.560
 Do not let it go next to this great game principle and the 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.390
 Harmony of effects and music 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.080
 he expands her by rewards expensive Gallery with pictures and videos 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:55.829
 basically as before but you are happy anyway 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.349
 in the evaluation example, first dog sure of the control with Kinect so 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.959
 much that makes the game break 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.509
 Unfortunately with Kinect he will not have much fun with pollutants living Ruth 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.949
 becomes more 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:09.359
 Cursing be busy as he focuses on the game 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.029
 with the controller, however, it just means sit back and enjoy 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:16.579
 Players who deduct points will also get their money's worth 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.250
 This thesis between music and plays succeeded the developers from the house Kyu 

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:22.350
 Entertainment very good
