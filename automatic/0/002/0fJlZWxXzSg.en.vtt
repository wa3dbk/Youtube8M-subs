said lotion my hair with steel curls so
I<00:01:42.810> can<00:01:43.049> brush<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.380> out<00:01:43.470> their<00:01:43.710> way<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.130> still

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
I can brush it out their way and still

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.800 
I can brush it out their way and still
form<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.820> curl<00:01:45.030> into<00:01:45.270> shape

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
form the curl into shape

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.569 
form the curl into shape
that<00:01:46.200> makes<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.619> little<00:01:46.770> more<00:01:46.950> soft<00:01:47.399> and

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
that makes it a little more soft and

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.030 
that makes it a little more soft and
silky<00:01:47.990> versus<00:01:48.990> just<00:01:49.259> taking<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.590> rollers<00:01:49.890> out

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
silky versus just taking the rollers out

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.469 
silky versus just taking the rollers out
and<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.340> leaving<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.909> way<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.149> there's

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
and just leaving it that way so there's

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.520 
and just leaving it that way so there's
another<00:01:51.720> alternative

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
another alternative

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.710 
another alternative
after<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.490> remove<00:01:53.670> your<00:01:53.970> rollers<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.509> don't

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
after you remove your rollers you don't

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.940 
after you remove your rollers you don't
really<00:01:54.930> have<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.140> wear<00:01:55.259> your<00:01:55.350> hair<00:01:55.530> straight
