level<00:02:06.689> like<00:02:07.049> like<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.829> standing<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
level like like this standing on it and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.040 
level like like this standing on it and
then<00:02:09.060> BAM<00:02:09.390> or<00:02:09.840> inside<00:02:10.350> so<00:02:11.600> you<00:02:12.600> have<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> few

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
then BAM or inside so you have a few

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.510 
then BAM or inside so you have a few
different<00:02:13.170> options<00:02:13.500> once<00:02:14.040> you're<00:02:14.190> inside<00:02:14.280> of

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
different options once you're inside of

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.180 
different options once you're inside of
here<00:02:14.880> you<00:02:15.720> can<00:02:15.900> either<00:02:16.080> restart<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.710> level<00:02:16.980> or

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
here you can either restart the level or

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.210 
here you can either restart the level or
you<00:02:18.030> can<00:02:18.300> return<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.870> hub<00:02:19.020> by<00:02:19.680> drinking

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
you can return to the hub by drinking

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.860 
you can return to the hub by drinking
one<00:02:20.820> of<00:02:20.940> these

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
one of these

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.559 
one of these
let's<00:02:21.989> look<00:02:22.379> at<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:22.769> thing<00:02:23.519> why<00:02:24.000> would<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.269> go

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
let's look at this thing why would I go

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.289 
let's look at this thing why would I go
I'm<00:02:25.530> not<00:02:25.739> sure<00:02:25.950> exactly<00:02:26.250> what<00:02:26.580> I'm<00:02:26.670> doing<00:02:26.819> here

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
I'm not sure exactly what I'm doing here

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.640 
I'm not sure exactly what I'm doing here
ow<00:02:28.700> okay<00:02:29.700> this<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:30.150> obvious<00:02:30.510> okay<00:02:31.470> it's

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
ow okay this is obvious okay it's

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.820 
ow okay this is obvious okay it's
obvious<00:02:31.830> I'm<00:02:32.250> obvious<00:02:33.150> this<00:02:33.959> will<00:02:34.080> be<00:02:34.200> one

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
obvious I'm obvious this will be one

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.190 
obvious I'm obvious this will be one
OOP<00:02:35.129> get<00:02:35.400> off<00:02:35.519> remember<00:02:36.480> by<00:02:36.629> the<00:02:36.659> way<00:02:36.780> if<00:02:37.080> you

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
OOP get off remember by the way if you

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.860 
OOP get off remember by the way if you
take<00:02:37.379> any<00:02:37.620> damage<00:02:38.280> at<00:02:38.760> all<00:02:40.790> then<00:02:41.790> you'll<00:02:42.420> die

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
take any damage at all then you'll die

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.960 
take any damage at all then you'll die
so<00:02:43.739> what<00:02:43.860> I'm<00:02:43.950> doing<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.280> I'm<00:02:44.459> matching<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.879> up

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
so what I'm doing is I'm matching it up

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.280 
so what I'm doing is I'm matching it up
we've<00:02:45.180> got<00:02:45.209> one<00:02:45.510> three<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:45.959> then<00:02:46.079> we'll<00:02:46.170> need

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
we've got one three and then we'll need

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.520 
we've got one three and then we'll need
four<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:47.099> this<00:02:47.190> is<00:02:47.250> for<00:02:47.879> here<00:02:48.629> one<00:02:49.079> and<00:02:49.409> then

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
four and this is for here one and then

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.699 
four and this is for here one and then
this<00:02:49.620> will<00:02:49.799> need<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:49.980> be<00:02:50.099> two<00:02:50.549> on<00:02:51.299> one<00:02:52.079> of<00:02:52.140> one

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
this will need to be two on one of one

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.880 
this will need to be two on one of one
of<00:02:52.829> these<00:02:53.069> two<00:02:53.940> on<00:02:54.239> either<00:02:54.569> of<00:02:54.959> these<00:02:55.500> two

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
of these two on either of these two

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.890 
of these two on either of these two
right<00:02:56.099> here<00:02:56.129> we'll<00:02:56.910> need<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.150> get<00:02:57.269> up<00:02:57.359> to<00:02:57.480> four

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
right here we'll need to get up to four

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.539 
right here we'll need to get up to four
now<00:02:58.280> okay

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
now okay

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:07.069 
now okay
okay<00:03:00.299> those<00:03:01.140> match<00:03:01.590> these<00:03:02.430> match<00:03:05.900> let's<00:03:06.900> try

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
okay those match these match let's try

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.699 
okay those match these match let's try
this<00:03:07.140> one

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.630 

oh<00:03:13.010> there's<00:03:14.010> something<00:03:14.220> up<00:03:14.370> there

hmm<00:03:17.299> hmm<00:03:18.950> see<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.129> up<00:03:20.250> there<00:03:20.430> see<00:03:20.670> those

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
hmm hmm see that up there see those

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.020 
hmm hmm see that up there see those
solid<00:03:21.359> blocks<00:03:21.629> I<00:03:22.129> think<00:03:23.129> I<00:03:23.250> need<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.489> use<00:03:23.579> that

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.670 

so<00:03:27.030> this<00:03:27.209> has<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.660> be<00:03:27.690> one<00:03:28.079> because<00:03:28.410> of<00:03:28.530> that

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
so this has to be one because of that

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.289 
so this has to be one because of that
and<00:03:28.950> there's<00:03:29.190> three<00:03:29.400> pieces<00:03:29.639> of<00:03:29.819> glass<00:03:30.000> there

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
and there's three pieces of glass there

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.270 
and there's three pieces of glass there
dead<00:03:31.260> moving<00:03:32.040> this<00:03:32.250> way<00:03:33.169> this<00:03:34.169> one<00:03:34.530> could<00:03:35.250> be

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
dead moving this way this one could be

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.150 
dead moving this way this one could be
to<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:36.150> has<00:03:36.329> to<00:03:36.450> be<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.720> this<00:03:36.989> one<00:03:37.260> over<00:03:37.769> her

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:34.850 
which we get off then we jump on here we

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.470 
which we get off then we jump on here we
go<00:06:35.050> once<00:06:36.050> we're<00:06:36.230> up<00:06:36.380> in<00:06:36.560> the<00:06:36.680> top<00:06:37.400> we<00:06:37.910> can<00:06:37.940> push

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:38.480 
go once we're up in the top we can push

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.600 
go once we're up in the top we can push
that<00:06:38.660> and<00:06:38.870> it<00:06:38.990> breaks<00:06:39.320> that<00:06:39.650> and<00:06:40.040> we<00:06:40.250> take<00:06:40.460> this

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
that and it breaks that and we take this

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.760 
that and it breaks that and we take this
down<00:06:40.850> to<00:06:41.240> a<00:06:41.540> reasonable<00:06:41.690> level<00:06:42.080> and<00:06:42.560> then<00:06:42.680> we

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:42.770 
down to a reasonable level and then we

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.560 
down to a reasonable level and then we
take<00:06:42.920> this<00:06:43.070> back<00:06:43.280> up<00:06:45.160> good<00:06:46.160> and<00:06:46.670> look<00:06:47.360> at<00:06:47.450> that

take this back up good and look at that

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.180 
take this back up good and look at that
