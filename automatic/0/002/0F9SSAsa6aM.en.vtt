really<00:01:31.759> part<00:01:32.119> of<00:01:32.210> that<00:01:32.390> was<00:01:32.659> certainly<00:01:33.619> my

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
really part of that was certainly my

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.050 
really part of that was certainly my
love<00:01:34.070> of<00:01:34.250> music<00:01:35.229> but<00:01:36.280> part<00:01:37.280> of<00:01:37.369> it<00:01:37.460> again<00:01:37.609> was

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
love of music but part of it again was

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.380 
love of music but part of it again was
the<00:01:38.090> design<00:01:38.810> appeal<00:01:39.530> of<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.859> device<00:01:40.159> itself

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390
