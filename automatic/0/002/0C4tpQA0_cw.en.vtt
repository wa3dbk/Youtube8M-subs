bouncier<00:00:29.939> look<00:00:30.150> at<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.330> look<00:00:30.570> at<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.840> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
bouncier look at it look at that the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.200 
bouncier look at it look at that the
bounce<00:00:31.740> gives<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.219> even<00:00:32.369> more<00:00:32.520> height<00:00:32.880> so

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
bounce gives you even more height so

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.240 
bounce gives you even more height so
tanks<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.780> guess<00:00:33.960> we're<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> little<00:00:34.320> bit<00:00:34.590> glitchy

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
tanks I guess we're a little bit glitchy

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.299 
tanks I guess we're a little bit glitchy
in<00:00:35.610> Halo<00:00:36.180> 2<00:00:36.239> days<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.930> because<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.980> love

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
in Halo 2 days and because that I love

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.940 
in Halo 2 days and because that I love
them<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.640> love<00:00:38.820> them<00:00:39.360> very<00:00:39.390> much<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.230> this

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
them I love them very much and this

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.770 
them I love them very much and this
isn't<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.399> only<00:00:41.579> place<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.420> do<00:00:42.629> it

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
isn't the only place that you can do it

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.750 
isn't the only place that you can do it
I<00:00:42.809> think<00:00:43.350> any<00:00:43.680> map<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.129> has<00:00:44.309> multiple

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
I think any map that has multiple

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.760 
I think any map that has multiple
scorpion<00:00:45.750> tanks<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.110> should<00:00:46.289> be<00:00:46.379> able<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.590> do

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
scorpion tanks you should be able to do

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.369 
scorpion tanks you should be able to do
it<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:48.210> was<00:00:48.450> definitely<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.020> best

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
it but this was definitely the best

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.770 
it but this was definitely the best
place<00:00:49.739> not<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.820> best<00:00:51.000> map<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> best

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
place not just the best map but the best

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.600 
place not just the best map but the best
place<00:00:52.079> on<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.500> map<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:52.860> tested<00:00:53.250> out<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> few

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
place on the map we tested out a few

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.340 
place on the map we tested out a few
different<00:00:53.850> areas<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.210> varying<00:00:54.629> degrees<00:00:54.809> of

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
different areas to varying degrees of

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.369 
different areas to varying degrees of
success<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.370> consistently<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.809> one<00:00:58.109> was

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
success and consistently this one was

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.310 
success and consistently this one was
the<00:00:58.770> best<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.340> we<00:00:59.460> could<00:00:59.910> achieve<00:01:00.120> now<00:01:01.050> not

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
the best that we could achieve now not

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.689 
the best that we could achieve now not
only<00:01:01.410> did<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.680> try<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.340> few<00:01:02.489> different

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
only did we try this in a few different

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.250 
only did we try this in a few different
areas<00:01:02.789> we<00:01:03.120> tried<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> few<00:01:03.480> different<00:01:03.660> vehicles

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
areas we tried a few different vehicles

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.090 
areas we tried a few different vehicles
cuz<00:01:04.470> why<00:01:04.619> not

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
cuz why not

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.399 
cuz why not
alright<00:01:05.519> let's<00:01:05.700> try<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> war<00:01:06.119> dog<00:01:06.270> no<00:01:07.049> that

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
alright let's try the war dog no that

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.230 
alright let's try the war dog no that
does<00:01:07.680> not<00:01:07.860> work<00:01:08.130> out<00:01:08.369> too<00:01:08.430> well<00:01:08.760> at<00:01:08.880> all<00:01:09.030> let's

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
does not work out too well at all let's

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160 
does not work out too well at all let's
try<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.450> ghost<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.460> again<00:01:11.460> not<00:01:11.820> very<00:01:11.850> well<00:01:12.810> at

all<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:13.860> here's<00:01:14.640> another<00:01:14.729> area<00:01:15.180> again<00:01:15.600> like<00:01:15.810> I

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
all but here's another area again like I

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.630 
all but here's another area again like I
said<00:01:15.990> varying<00:01:16.560> degrees<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.860> success<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.549> was

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
said varying degrees of success that was

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.730 
said varying degrees of success that was
alright<00:01:18.080> wasn't<00:01:19.080> great<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.320> wasn't<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.710> that
