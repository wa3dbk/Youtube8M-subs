longer to five ones as I said one cord

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.400 
longer to five ones as I said one cord
per<00:00:10.280> bar<00:00:10.520> same<00:00:11.120> key<00:00:11.420> as<00:00:11.570> before<00:00:11.990> we're<00:00:12.320> gonna

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
per bar same key as before we're gonna

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.470 
per bar same key as before we're gonna
be<00:00:12.650> going<00:00:12.799> into<00:00:13.090> B<00:00:14.090> flat<00:00:14.330> major<00:00:14.480> seven<00:00:15.970> so<00:00:16.970> I'm

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
also do the sharp nine alteration then

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.870 
also do the sharp nine alteration then
we'll<00:00:30.500> move<00:00:30.590> in<00:00:30.770> and<00:00:30.920> do<00:00:31.010> some<00:00:31.220> minor<00:00:31.430> two-five

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
we'll move in and do some minor two-five

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.299 
we'll move in and do some minor two-five
ones<00:00:32.119> but<00:00:32.599> let's<00:00:33.079> take<00:00:33.260> a<00:00:33.289> look<00:00:33.500> and<00:00:33.620> see<00:00:33.890> what

ones but let's take a look and see what

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.050 
ones but let's take a look and see what
some<00:00:34.550> of<00:00:34.879> this<00:00:34.969> might<00:00:35.210> mean<00:00:36.579> here's<00:00:37.579> one<00:00:37.820> I'm

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.060 
some of this might mean here's one I'm

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.580 
some of this might mean here's one I'm
going<00:00:38.180> to<00:00:38.270> go<00:00:38.360> ahead<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:38.750> use<00:00:41.110> this<00:00:42.110> lick<00:00:42.410> so

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
going to go ahead and use this lick so

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.200 
going to go ahead and use this lick so
what<00:00:42.739> we're<00:00:42.829> gonna<00:00:42.920> do<00:00:43.220> usually<00:00:43.520> is<00:00:44.090> we're

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
what we're gonna do usually is we're

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.670 
what we're gonna do usually is we're
gonna<00:00:44.329> get<00:00:44.510> eighth<00:00:44.660> notes<00:00:44.870> per<00:00:45.079> bar<00:00:45.260> for

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
gonna get eighth notes per bar for

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.050 
gonna get eighth notes per bar for
example<00:00:46.040> I'll<00:00:46.130> just<00:00:46.160> make<00:00:46.489> one<00:00:46.520> up

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
example I'll just make one up

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.020 
example I'll just make one up
one<00:00:47.300> two<00:00:47.930> three<00:00:48.649> a<00:00:48.680> four<00:00:49.190> a<00:00:49.250> new<00:00:49.820> chord<00:00:50.149> one<00:00:51.079> two

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
one two three a four a new chord one two

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.340 
one two three a four a new chord one two
okay<00:00:53.300> it'd<00:00:53.510> be<00:00:53.720> like<00:00:53.930> 1<00:00:54.290> a<00:00:54.590> 2<00:00:54.890> a<00:00:55.190> 3<00:00:55.250> a<00:00:55.610> 4<00:00:55.880> or<00:00:56.180> 1<00:00:56.720> a<00:00:57.080> 2

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
okay it'd be like 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 or 1 a 2

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.620 
okay it'd be like 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 or 1 a 2
a<00:00:57.380> 3<00:00:57.710> a<00:00:58.070> 4<00:00:58.340> or<00:00:58.640> 1

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
a 3 a 4 or 1

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.170 
a 3 a 4 or 1
that's<00:01:01.560> pretty<00:01:01.739> slow<00:01:02.130> as<00:01:02.460> far<00:01:02.640> as<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.850> tempo

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
that's pretty slow as far as the tempo

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.820 
that's pretty slow as far as the tempo
goes<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.900> would<00:01:04.019> be<00:01:04.170> sped<00:01:04.440> up<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.650> little

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
goes but it would be sped up a little

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.560 
goes but it would be sped up a little
bit<00:01:05.040> maybe<00:01:07.880> maybe<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.000> might<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.180> something

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
bit maybe maybe you might be something

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.340 
bit maybe maybe you might be something
like<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.960> 3<00:01:10.470> 4<00:01:10.740> 1<00:01:11.100> 2<00:01:11.280> 3<00:01:11.729> 4<00:01:12.120> 1<00:01:12.420> 2<00:01:12.810> 3<00:01:12.840> 4<00:01:13.290> long

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
like this 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 long

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:23.219 
like this 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 long
[Music]

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.000 

right

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.440 

so<00:01:29.010> those<00:01:29.159> are<00:01:29.340> all<00:01:29.430> two<00:01:29.610> five<00:01:29.790> ones<00:01:30.060> it's<00:01:30.270> one

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
so those are all two five ones it's one

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.969 
so those are all two five ones it's one
cord<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:31.020> bar<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.409> may<00:01:31.530> have<00:01:31.619> noticed<00:01:31.890> how

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
cord for bar you may have noticed how

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.500 
cord for bar you may have noticed how
long<00:01:32.190> it<00:01:32.369> was<00:01:32.430> holding<00:01:32.790> there's<00:01:32.940> one<00:01:33.180> two

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
long it was holding there's one two

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.410 
long it was holding there's one two
three<00:01:33.540> four<00:01:33.960> new<00:01:34.590> cord<00:01:34.920> three<00:01:35.369> four<00:01:35.670> one<00:01:36.060> two

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
three four new cord three four one two

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.480 
three four new cord three four one two
three<00:01:36.450> four<00:01:36.869> we're<00:01:37.560> doing<00:01:37.830> it<00:01:37.950> slower

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
three four we're doing it slower

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.740 
three four we're doing it slower
because<00:01:38.729> eventually<00:01:38.850> you'll<00:01:39.330> be<00:01:39.420> able<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.630> do

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
because eventually you'll be able to do

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.870 
because eventually you'll be able to do
at<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:39.900> speed<00:01:40.500> let's<00:01:40.890> take<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> look<00:01:41.400> on<00:01:41.610> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
at that speed let's take a look on a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.120 
at that speed let's take a look on a
stop<00:01:42.180> talking<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.440> are<00:01:43.710> gonna<00:01:43.890> start

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
stop talking and you are gonna start

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.889 
stop talking and you are gonna start
playing<00:01:44.400> these<00:01:44.909> are<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.149> first<00:01:45.330> four<00:01:45.659> notes

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
playing these are the first four notes

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.920 
playing these are the first four notes
here<00:01:46.170> you've<00:01:46.320> got<00:01:46.470> G<00:01:46.770> F<00:01:47.040> F<00:01:47.430> sharp<00:01:47.850> E

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.930 

that's<00:01:51.930> where<00:01:52.110> we<00:01:52.230> want<00:01:52.410> to<00:01:52.470> end<00:01:52.560> up<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:52.980> that's

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
that's where we want to end up so that's

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.490 
that's where we want to end up so that's
a<00:01:54.060> way<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.210> get<00:01:54.420> there<00:01:54.660> that's<00:01:54.960> just<00:01:55.050> a<00:01:55.230> bebop

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
a way to get there that's just a bebop

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.620 
a way to get there that's just a bebop
idea<00:01:56.930> let's<00:01:57.930> use<00:01:58.080> a<00:01:58.110> triplet<00:01:58.880> so<00:01:59.880> you've<00:02:00.000> got<00:02:00.180> G

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
idea let's use a triplet so you've got G

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.800 
idea let's use a triplet so you've got G

four notes you've got G F F sharp E is

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.490 
four notes you've got G F F sharp E is
the<00:02:10.290> first<00:02:10.500> two<00:02:10.679> beats<00:02:10.860> right<00:02:11.160> one<00:02:11.430> two<00:02:12.500> I'm

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the first two beats right one two I'm
