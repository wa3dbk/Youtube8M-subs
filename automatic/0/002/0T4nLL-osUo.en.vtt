got to get obviously as many others as
we<00:00:19.199> care<00:00:19.380> much<00:00:19.949> feedback<00:00:20.130> as<00:00:20.279> we<00:00:20.460> can<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.029> then

we care much feedback as we can and then

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.490 
we care much feedback as we can and then
the<00:00:21.300> hope<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.689> we<00:00:21.930> can<00:00:21.960> get<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.320> ounce

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
the hope is that we can get this ounce

sensor issue and we're getting problems
i'm<00:00:47.910> getting<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.180> sensors<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.660> from<00:00:48.989> for<00:00:49.590> our

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
i'm getting the sensors in from for our

shoot<00:01:04.830> great<00:01:05.070> movies<00:01:05.540> what<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.630> see

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
shoot great movies what you see

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.270 
shoot great movies what you see
obviously<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.320> what<00:01:07.530> we<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:08.040> want<00:01:08.130> to

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
obviously with this what we we want to

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.830 
obviously with this what we we want to
try<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.549> do<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.729> ensure<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.540> know<00:01:09.659> we

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
try and do is ensure that you know we

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.960 
try and do is ensure that you know we
recover<00:01:10.290> as<00:01:10.380> many<00:01:10.530> bases<00:01:10.710> as<00:01:10.890> possible<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.549> i

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
recover as many bases as possible and i

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.429 
recover as many bases as possible and i
suppose<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.570> main<00:01:12.750> difference<00:01:13.080> with<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.290> is

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
suppose the main difference with this is

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.840 
suppose the main difference with this is
a<00:01:13.650> different<00:01:13.979> sensor<00:01:14.369> from<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.580> different

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
a different sensor from a different

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.929 
a different sensor from a different
sense<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.150> manufacturer<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.200> super<00:01:16.500> 16

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
sense of manufacturer it's a super 16

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.760 
sense of manufacturer it's a super 16
sensor<00:01:17.939> our<00:01:18.689> other<00:01:18.930> larger<00:01:19.409> camera<00:01:19.680> we

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
sensor our other larger camera we

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.640 
sensor our other larger camera we
announced<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> super<00:01:20.520> 35<00:01:21.000> mil<00:01:21.330> sensor<00:01:21.780> so

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
announced is a super 35 mil sensor so

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.810 
announced is a super 35 mil sensor so
again<00:01:22.890> that's<00:01:23.009> from<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> different<00:01:23.490> sense<00:01:23.670> of

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
again that's from a different sense of

again that's from a different sense of
manufacturer<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.750> we've<00:01:24.990> covered<00:01:25.170> as<00:01:25.350> many

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
manufacturer so we've covered as many

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.320 
manufacturer so we've covered as many
bases<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:25.979> possibly<00:01:26.189> can<00:01:26.549> but<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.210> know

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
bases as we possibly can but you know

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.940 
bases as we possibly can but you know
everybody<00:01:27.960> knows<00:01:28.140> he's<00:01:28.320> always<00:01:28.500> freaking<00:01:28.799> H

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
freak of nature and things can happen

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.359 
freak of nature and things can happen
but<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.229> know<00:01:31.350> we're<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.890> committed<00:01:32.310> and

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
but you know we're is committed and

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.649 
but you know we're is committed and
certainly<00:01:32.729> what<00:01:32.880> we<00:01:32.909> don't<00:01:33.180> want<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.450> do<00:01:33.540> is

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
certainly what we don't want to do is

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.270 
certainly what we don't want to do is
get<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.810> replication<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:34.920> maybe<00:01:35.130> what

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
get a replication of but maybe what

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.039 
get a replication of but maybe what
happened<00:01:35.579> last<00:01:35.700> year<00:01:35.790> now<00:01:36.390> why<00:01:36.630> did<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.900> guys

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
get into the camera making business you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.280 
get into the camera making business you
guys<00:01:38.909> are<00:01:39.060> doing<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.270> great<00:01:39.299> job<00:01:39.479> making<00:01:39.840> drives

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
guys are doing a great job making drives

and other things you know what made you
go<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.299> direction<00:01:42.420> well<00:01:43.229> thing<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.649> think

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
go in that direction well thing I think

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.440 
go in that direction well thing I think

throws one of the main differences is
that<00:01:45.479> we<00:01:45.780> approach<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.229> from<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.470> completely

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
that we approach this from a completely

different angle we've always had a very

post-production market and you know with

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.190 
post-production market and you know with
the<00:01:53.759> acquisition<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.240> DaVinci<00:01:54.630> Resolve<00:01:54.750> what

the acquisition of DaVinci Resolve what

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.600 
the acquisition of DaVinci Resolve what
happened<00:01:55.560> was<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.130> were<00:01:56.250> looking<00:01:56.280> at

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
happened was is that we were looking at

happened was is that we were looking at
different<00:01:57.030> different<00:01:57.960> footage<00:01:58.439> different

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
different different footage different

codecs every day of the week and what

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.420 
codecs every day of the week and what
that<00:02:01.200> basically<00:02:01.380> meant<00:02:01.740> for<00:02:01.950> us<00:02:02.040> was<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.280> we

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
that basically meant for us was that we

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.859 
that basically meant for us was that we
were<00:02:02.549> able<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.759> see<00:02:02.969> where<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.360> positives<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
were able to see where the positives and

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.149 
were able to see where the positives and
negatives<00:02:03.930> were<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.680> various

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
negatives were on various

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.760

from<00:02:05.280> file<00:02:05.490> formats<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.090> camera<00:02:06.329> four<00:02:06.359> months

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
from file formats and camera four months

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.229 
from file formats and camera four months
and<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:07.950> decided<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.429> well<00:02:08.849> why<00:02:09.000> don't<00:02:09.209> we

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
and we decided that well why don't we

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.969 
and we decided that well why don't we
start<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.720> make<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.929> camera<00:02:10.440> with<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.830> end

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
start to make a camera with the end

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.160 
start to make a camera with the end
admired<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:12.360> know<00:02:12.480> let's<00:02:12.720> let's<00:02:12.780> make

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
admired you know let's let's make

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.420 
admired you know let's let's make
something<00:02:13.410> which<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.769> very<00:02:13.830> open<00:02:14.400> very

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
something which is very open very

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.190 
something which is very open very
flexible<00:02:15.209> because<00:02:15.629> it's<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.930> great

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
flexible because it's a great

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.509 
flexible because it's a great
opportunity<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.890> be<00:02:16.950> able<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.160> shoot<00:02:17.280> at<00:02:17.400> many

opportunity to be able to shoot at many
different<00:02:17.580> file<00:02:17.970> formats<00:02:18.019> but<00:02:19.019> ultimately

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
different file formats but ultimately

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.020 
different file formats but ultimately
what<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:19.799> was<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.129> create<00:02:20.340> great<00:02:20.610> cinematic

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
what it was is to create great cinematic

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.300 
what it was is to create great cinematic
images<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.530> do<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.890> what<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.069> need<00:02:23.190> to

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
images and to do that what you need to

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.759 
images and to do that what you need to
do<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.430> have<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.730> wide<00:02:23.940> dynamic<00:02:24.150> range<00:02:24.769> so

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
do is have that wide dynamic range so

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.380 
do is have that wide dynamic range so
really<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.190> lot<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.489> ideology<00:02:26.970> started<00:02:27.299> at

okay now tell us really quickly about
the<00:02:32.010> new<00:02:32.129> 4k<00:02:32.370> camera<00:02:32.819> we're<00:02:32.940> really<00:02:33.090> excited

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
the new 4k camera we're really excited

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.720 
the new 4k camera we're really excited
about<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.780> one<00:02:33.959> it's<00:02:34.200> 4k<00:02:34.650> for<00:02:34.860> 4k<00:02:35.190> right<00:02:35.400> it

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
about that one it's 4k for 4k right it

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.920 
about that one it's 4k for 4k right it
is<00:02:35.910> so<00:02:36.209> it's<00:02:36.799> 3995<00:02:37.799> dollars<00:02:38.370> it's<00:02:39.329> 12<00:02:39.540> stops<00:02:39.810> of

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
is so it's 3995 dollars it's 12 stops of

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.110 
is so it's 3995 dollars it's 12 stops of
dynamic<00:02:39.959> range<00:02:40.500> it's<00:02:41.370> got<00:02:41.459> a<00:02:41.489> global<00:02:41.910> shutter

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
dynamic range it's got a global shutter

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.460 
dynamic range it's got a global shutter
which<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:42.510> obviously<00:02:42.750> something<00:02:42.989> which<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.349> lot

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
which is obviously something which a lot

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.130 
which is obviously something which a lot
of<00:02:43.500> people<00:02:43.590> are<00:02:44.010> really<00:02:44.340> pleased<00:02:44.819> about<00:02:45.140> it's

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
of people are really pleased about it's

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.050 
of people are really pleased about it's
also<00:02:46.349> wouldn't<00:02:46.799> having<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.069> super<00:02:47.310> 35<00:02:47.760> mil

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060

busted<00:02:50.760> reduced<00:02:51.299> crop<00:02:51.540> factor<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.200> was

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
busted reduced crop factor so you was

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.589 
busted reduced crop factor so you was
talkin<00:02:52.739> two<00:02:52.799> roundabouts<00:02:53.099> a<00:02:53.160> 1.3<00:02:53.849> 1.4<00:02:54.030> for<00:02:54.510> the

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
talkin two roundabouts a 1.3 1.4 for the

talkin two roundabouts a 1.3 1.4 for the
crop<00:02:54.780> factor<00:02:54.930> which<00:02:55.829> means<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.069> can<00:02:56.190> use

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
crop factor which means you can use

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.849 
crop factor which means you can use
those<00:02:56.459> nice<00:02:56.700> wide<00:02:56.940> angle<00:02:57.269> lenses<00:02:57.680> but<00:02:58.680> also

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
those nice wide angle lenses but also

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.259 
those nice wide angle lenses but also
what's<00:02:59.160> nice<00:02:59.310> about<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.700> as<00:02:59.790> well<00:02:59.940> as<00:03:00.090> it's

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
what's nice about that as well as it's

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.210 
what's nice about that as well as it's
got<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.450> six<00:03:00.690> gig<00:03:00.870> SDI<00:03:01.200> output<00:03:01.290> on<00:03:01.769> there<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.160> you

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
got a six gig SDI output on there so you

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.440 
got a six gig SDI output on there so you
can<00:03:02.400> actually<00:03:03.170> output<00:03:04.370> six<00:03:05.370> re<00:03:05.760> ultra<00:03:06.120> HD

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
can actually output six re ultra HD

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.900 
can actually output six re ultra HD
directly<00:03:06.870> from<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.109> camera<00:03:07.459> it<00:03:08.459> records<00:03:08.700> in<00:03:08.849> a
