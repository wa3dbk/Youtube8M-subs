00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.339 
comfortable um I don't like it I looked
at<00:02:44.790> some<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.000> their<00:02:45.180> other<00:02:45.209> knife<00:02:45.569> online<00:02:46.049> and

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
at some of their other knife online and

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.289 
at some of their other knife online and
it<00:02:46.440> looks<00:02:46.620> like<00:02:46.680> most<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.160> them<00:02:47.310> use<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:48.030> same

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
it looks like most of them use the same

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.160 
it looks like most of them use the same
style<00:02:48.660> thumbs<00:02:48.989> dead<00:02:49.670> so<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:50.780> probably<00:02:51.780> say<00:02:52.139> that

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
style thumbs dead so I probably say that

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.140 
style thumbs dead so I probably say that
