 check and 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.460
 upset in the sector is what I like about this passionate 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.630
 how things grow 1 after the national council meeting 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.159
 d fruits of the field 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.159
 they are the producers of the impossible 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.540
 there are always things to do all of them 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.180
 when I start thinking 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.230
 p 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.250
 What we're doing 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.250
 in harvest is to produce food for 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.470
 the world 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.140
 this how very proud of him 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.140
 I know what im doing 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.130
 this is a job 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.550
 and with the responsibility that they are 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.810
 is moving the population commented 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.900
 and to this day so 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.460
 very important the great challenge our yes 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.600
 without a doubt it is to produce more because the demand is each more southern 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.190
 in the growth rate they are expensive 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.800
 the people that need but is what we have food I do not think there's a 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.810
 challenge for 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.010
 aa for the whole sector power goes on 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.850
 in the same amount of surface much more kilos napoli italia masi kilo de 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.920
 meat always produce more produce more produce more 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.229
 so that it recovers 70 laws of cristina posed rotation 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.160
 I rented it for the long term 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.310
 the quarterdeck dissensions 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.360
 the oma good performance test 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.290
 precision agriculture these domes last sustainable including 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.290
 direct their services and tell the citizens 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.060
 using the 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.270
 it's hard 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.270
 one of the possible changes 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.549
 and his passion 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.069
 A lifestyle 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.069
 and an activity that presents hundreds of risks 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.880
 the producer 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.440
 It is very difficult for this to completely unplug the work 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:31.719
 nebur will make the day because it is independent or from the getafe timao have 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.719
 openwork in the other of a field 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.159
 if there are niches in edition and in it what is always pending 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.879
 the first recital that makes good weather 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.879
 generally the 15 thousand signatures of studies 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:49.299
 the other five continents the partners over whether it would be good would there be good 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.719
 It yields because it worries us 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:55.999
 because if we have bad yields prices per hectare it is charged a lot 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:59.399
 less the prize is thinking much more things 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:01.499
 This year's profitability 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:04.499
 marginal cost and semifinals 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:08.369
 cristian chivu 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:11.729
 we also have a passion 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:13.889
 raise equipment that allows 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.889
 do the work 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.480
 a machine from us 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.450
 in the campaign based on phishing or four thousand five hundred hectares have been 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.919
 consolidated before buying it I would have imagined 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:36.090
 A very complete magic cleaning grain quality 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:39.589
 Damage - almost nothing has been damaged 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:41.699
 yes the simplicity that has 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:44.350
 arm and disarm simplicity 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.700
 it means a lot of a machine that has very little movement 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.069
 i an asensi machine is the time to repair 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.009
 and when using it later it would be the most important thing 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:01.899
 the tractors for example have 20 thousand hour distribution have a smaller than 

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:02.489
 age 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.859
 we have to break a paddock an eccentric 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.339
 we have a tractor or another brand really did not go skating to him 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:13.969
 if we go to the maximum the power and the solution to the problem you do not realize 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:15.279
 that the bump but one 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:18.279
 the hamas the biggest rancahuaso of the votes 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:28.509
 the chain showed optimistic 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:29.669
 in Sonora 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.809
 the air conditioning 20 celestial 

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:34.879
 and the information and 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:37.010
 It is complete and very hermetic 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.419
 very little noise 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.210
 it's practically nothing 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.189
 this meeting the air conditioning very good all that is 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:47.189
 in excellent visibility 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.259
 when we are going to keep 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.259
 and everything possible to handle it 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.729
 I do not know kutxa a noise 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.819
 then holy drug pleasurable 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:00.849
 that is, the night in afa 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.050
 reached to be able to work a while 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.300
 Our machines include a commitment 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.810
 permanent assistance to producers and contractors to ensure the maximum 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.029
 possible productivity 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:17.469
 we do not have more than 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:20.069
 for thanks for the lion's intentions 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:22.029
 the spare itself 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:25.250
 and the predisposition of the officials was always 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.120
 Saturdays Sundays and holidays 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.460
 by cell phone and they solve you prologue by phone until out there 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.880
 in an hour and a half extend the dealership did not explode was very fast 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.759
 the answer 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:39.650
 Anton or service as spare parts 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.120
 they always serve us 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.210
 with much 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.840
 very efficiently that guitiÃ¡n come the sentence that has the ability to 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.460
 tell you he has the machine 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.370
 already half an hour but running 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.370
 one of the most important things 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:57.539
 we follow closely 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.539
 what happens and dressing change 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.389
 we know that the men of the field 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:05.740
 they need the best technology 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.559
 for the challenges that comes 

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:11.559
 in queens and hashish 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.490
 know him with a post 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.809
 I'm ready 

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:19.369
 since it exploded 

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:20.469
 I'm ready 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:22.009
 I'm fonzi 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:23.229
