00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
fix this and it's not hard it just takes

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.150 
fix this and it's not hard it just takes
a<00:00:39.899> lot<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.110> typing<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.649> figured<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.100> know

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
a lot of typing so I figured you know

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.979 
a lot of typing so I figured you know
I'll<00:00:41.550> make<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.730> video<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:44.570> hopefully<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.899> will

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
I'll make a video and hopefully it will

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.990 
I'll make a video and hopefully it will
help<00:00:46.050> if<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.860> doesn't<00:00:47.129> send<00:00:47.579> me<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.700> message<00:00:47.820> and

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
help if it doesn't send me a message and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.310 
help if it doesn't send me a message and
I'll<00:00:48.180> try<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.480> figure<00:00:48.719> out<00:00:48.809> another<00:00:48.930> way<00:00:49.110> but

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
I'll try to figure out another way but

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.040 
I'll try to figure out another way but
this<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.649> only<00:00:49.770> way<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:49.950> know<00:00:50.039> how<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:51.050> it

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
this is the only way I know how and it

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.150 
this is the only way I know how and it
seems<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.320> work<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.620> most<00:00:52.770> people

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
seems to work for most people

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.410 
seems to work for most people
um<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:55.440> basically<00:00:56.129> if<00:00:56.489> your<00:00:56.640> data<00:00:56.820> file<00:00:57.059> option

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
um so basically if your data file option

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.670 
um so basically if your data file option
is<00:00:57.510> grayed<00:00:57.750> out<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.500> can't

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
is grayed out like this like you can't

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.340 
is grayed out like this like you can't
click<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.070> or<00:00:59.480> when<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.780> click<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:01.170> data

best as I can it's the only way that I

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.789 
best as I can it's the only way that I
know<00:03:48.280> of<00:03:48.430> off<00:03:48.849> the<00:03:48.879> top<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.120> my<00:03:49.269> head<00:03:49.799> without

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.369 
know of off the top of my head without
scouring<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.430> internet<00:03:51.760> for<00:03:52.199> hours<00:03:53.199> looking

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
scouring the internet for hours looking

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.490 
scouring the internet for hours looking
for<00:03:53.560> other<00:03:53.650> fixes<00:03:54.099> that<00:03:54.609> might<00:03:54.849> not<00:03:55.000> even<00:03:55.030> work

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
for other fixes that might not even work

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.059 
for other fixes that might not even work
so<00:03:56.819> this<00:03:57.819> will<00:03:57.940> probably<00:03:58.030> fix<00:03:58.620> 90%<00:03:59.620> of<00:03:59.769> the

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
so this will probably fix 90% of the

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.009 
so this will probably fix 90% of the
people's<00:04:00.400> problem<00:04:00.849> maybe<00:04:01.090> 99%<00:04:01.599> of<00:04:01.930> the

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
people's problem maybe 99% of the

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.879 
people's problem maybe 99% of the
