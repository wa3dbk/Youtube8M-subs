attributes thing that's coming in and
the<00:00:59.460> only<00:00:59.910> way<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.120> make<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.510> work<00:01:00.690> at<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the only way to make it work at the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.689 
the only way to make it work at the
moment<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.230> by<00:01:01.350> using<00:01:01.500> nbt<00:01:02.160> tags<00:01:02.430> which<00:01:02.609> I

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
moment is by using nbt tags which I

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.299 
moment is by using nbt tags which I
don't<00:01:02.760> know<00:01:03.000> any<00:01:03.300> idea<00:01:03.690> about<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.470> can't<00:01:05.189> do

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
don't know any idea about so I can't do

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.800 
don't know any idea about so I can't do
it<00:01:05.369> sadly<00:01:05.640> enough<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:06.330> I'm<00:01:06.390> sure<00:01:06.510> someone

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
it sadly enough but I'm sure someone

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.660 
it sadly enough but I'm sure someone
else<00:01:06.960> out<00:01:07.080> there<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.500> it's<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> good<00:01:08.430> look<00:01:08.580> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
else out there can it's a good look to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.789 
else out there can it's a good look to
them<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:08.970> yeah<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.049> think<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.380> sorta

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
them and yeah so I think it's just sorta

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.890 
them and yeah so I think it's just sorta
do<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.310> think<00:01:11.610> arrows<00:01:11.820> do<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.150> well<00:01:12.180> what

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
do it I think arrows do it as well what

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.080 
do it I think arrows do it as well what
about<00:01:13.080> now<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.680> arrows<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.220> bows<00:01:14.430> do<00:01:14.640> don't

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
about now so arrows and bows do don't

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.850 
about now so arrows and bows do don't
sadly<00:01:15.360> enough<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.840> food<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.350> don't<00:01:16.530> think<00:01:16.560> does

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
sadly enough and food I don't think does

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.520 
sadly enough and food I don't think does
so<00:01:17.280> that's<00:01:17.909> pretty<00:01:18.119> nice<00:01:18.240> nothing<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.259> as<00:01:19.350> well

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
so that's pretty nice nothing is as well

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.410 
so that's pretty nice nothing is as well

I<00:01:40.049> inventory<00:01:40.680> system<00:01:40.950> type<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.250> thing<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.820> you

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
I inventory system type of thing so you

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.039 
I inventory system type of thing so you
can<00:01:41.939> actually<00:01:42.119> toggle<00:01:42.570> whether<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.869> take<00:01:42.990> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
can actually toggle whether to take the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.389 
can actually toggle whether to take the
saddle<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.649> off<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.979> obviously<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.280> know

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
saddle on and off and obviously you know

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.410 
saddle on and off and obviously you know
you<00:01:44.460> can't<00:01:44.670> control<00:01:44.880> them<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.149> do<00:01:45.270> that

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
you can't control them if you do that

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.719 
you can't control them if you do that
now<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.020> if<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.560> don't<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> chest<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.460> one

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
now and if you don't have a chest on one

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.249 
now and if you don't have a chest on one
of<00:01:47.850> them<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.540> obviously<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.140> would

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
of them it of the obviously this would

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.280 
of them it of the obviously this would
be<00:01:49.320> grey<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:50.399> um<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.570> obviously<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.200> can

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
be grey but um so obviously you can

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.690 
be grey but um so obviously you can
probably<00:01:52.439> times<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.920> out<00:01:53.009> like<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.280> so

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
probably times in and out like that so

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.100 
probably times in and out like that so
it's<00:01:53.850> rather<00:01:54.000> than<00:01:54.180> using<00:01:54.360> their<00:01:54.630> shift<00:01:54.899> click

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
it's rather than using their shift click

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.139 
it's rather than using their shift click
to<00:01:55.259> actually<00:01:55.890> use<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.759> don't<00:01:56.880> have<00:01:57.030> to

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
to actually use it and you don't have to

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.280 
to actually use it and you don't have to
be<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.420> horse<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.689> use<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.960> imagery<00:01:58.259> of

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
be on the horse to use the imagery of

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.889 
be on the horse to use the imagery of
each<00:01:58.439> got<00:01:58.649> over<00:01:58.979> shift<00:01:59.640> click<00:01:59.850> like<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.600> and

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
each got over shift click like so and

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.450 
each got over shift click like so and
then<00:02:01.530> if<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.860> just<00:02:02.009> right-click<00:02:02.369> you

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
then if you just right-click you

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.830 
then if you just right-click you
obviously<00:02:02.700> get<00:02:02.790> on<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.030> off<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.420> that's<00:02:03.719> it

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
obviously get on and off so that's it

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.050 
obviously get on and off so that's it
pretty<00:02:04.079> simple<00:02:04.460> there's<00:02:05.460> also<00:02:05.579> been<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.820> lot<00:02:06.030> of

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
pretty simple there's also been a lot of

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.999 
pretty simple there's also been a lot of
work<00:02:06.329> put<00:02:06.600> towards<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.020> new<00:02:07.229> resource<00:02:07.500> pack

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
work put towards a new resource pack

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.270 
work put towards a new resource pack
system<00:02:08.429> which<00:02:08.670> book<00:02:08.940> isn't<00:02:09.239> finished<00:02:09.569> yet<00:02:09.780> and

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
system which book isn't finished yet and

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.559 
system which book isn't finished yet and
it's<00:02:11.280> still<00:02:11.340> compatible<00:02:11.879> with<00:02:12.180> checks<00:02:12.390> back

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
it's still compatible with checks back

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.670 
it's still compatible with checks back
so<00:02:12.720> if<00:02:12.780> people<00:02:12.900> know<00:02:13.110> what<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.319> means

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
so if people know what that means

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.920 
so if people know what that means
that's<00:02:14.040> good<00:02:14.219> there's<00:02:14.879> also<00:02:14.969> an<00:02:15.420> updated

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
that's good there's also an updated

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.280 
that's good there's also an updated
internal<00:02:16.530> chat<00:02:16.739> system<00:02:16.950> mechanic<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:19.140> for

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.959 
previously left untranslated in an hour
translated<00:02:22.590> properly<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.579> is<00:02:23.730> just<00:02:23.849> the
