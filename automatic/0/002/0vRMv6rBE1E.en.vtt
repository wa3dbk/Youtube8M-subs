00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.180
 in a modern car, the technology ensures 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.800
 for safety and well-being 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.809
 because the driver must next to the traffic 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.469
 the signs and traffic lights sure its 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.750
 find a way 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.390
 Driving a car requires a very high level 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.130
 concentration of the driver should be his view 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.320
 be firmly on the street 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.029
 therefore, newer vehicles are also sitting 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.099
 an indication only for the driver 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.519
 is visible and seemingly on the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.380
 lane in front of him is with such a 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.420
 the driver has important head-up display 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.400
 information which his vehicle 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.650
 traffic situation or navigation 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.050
 constantly in view a head up displays 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.410
 a particularly innovative display system 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.510
 for all relevant information 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.060
 the term head up display is english 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.250
 and means directly translated head up 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.230
 that means you are with his 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.140
 system able without you in the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.720
 look down turns driving information 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.580
 to read function and construction of a 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.320
 such high tech device we have with 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.910
 to look at an automotive supplier 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.830
 can 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.780
 to be at continental in babenhausen 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.870
 These modular devices for every car type 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.190
 specially designed in the car that sits 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.990
 head-up display within the 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.880
 dashboards in front of the driver 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.890
 starting from a backlit 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.050
 Display the desired image content 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.700
 is displayed over two mirrors and the 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.710
 windshield a virtual picture 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.300
 generated for the driver arises the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.860
 impression that the virtual picture 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.990
 with the driver information in two 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.150
 meters distance from it above the roadway 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.340
 is the mirror for the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.770
 head-up displays are made here 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.320
 The injection molding machine is an absolute one 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.120
 high tech device made of special plastic 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.040
 The optical industry is high 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.070
 pressure and molded at high temperature 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.450
 the finished mirror may not exceed 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.790
 Unevenness is evident in the fracture part 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.920
 the thickness of a hair lie after 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.690
 to steam on a metal layer 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.030
 the high precision mirror on the 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.320
 Mirror holder glued the whole 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.630
 happens under clean room conditions 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.040
 gloves and hair protection not so 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.020
 again skin flakes still smallest 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.490
 dust grains fall into the device and 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.720
 if necessary, the image reproduction 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.720
 could influence 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.410
 next to the precision game becomes one 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.400
 variety of electronic components 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.170
 processed 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.600
 Together they form the control electronics 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.480
 the intelligence or brain of the head 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.680
 up displays the loading of the boards 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.280
 takes place in a fully automatic 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.480
 process highly integrated circuits 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.640
 Capacitors and jews will be on the 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.989
 surface set surface mounting 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.850
 This technique is called at the with 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.570
 Pistons and lynx in the past 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.120
 belong to 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.040
 Such a robot can be 15,000 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.320
 put components in the minute 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.480
 every single board will be afterwards 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.190
 extensively tested a special 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.989
 test station simulates all 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.510
 functions and operating states of the 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.340
 Module only one that all tests 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.660
 went through faultlessly 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.060
 Continue to final assembly 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.510
 That guarantees that such a display 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.400
 a car life long works after 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.330
 this test process begins the installation 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.330
 the board 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.740
 He gets ready for the display unit 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:12.660
 pre-assembled mirror with actuator motor 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:16.709
 he is screwed down and with the 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.420
 control electronics connected one 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.000
 scratch-resistant translucent 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.100
 polycarbonate foil closes the housing 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.840
 prevents and prevents the penetration of 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.069
 dust 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.090
 now it is time for one 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.340
 function test 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.420
 A technician can recognize if 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.600
 the pictures the the head-up display 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.260
 produces distortion-free, clearly focused 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.670
 and clearly visible 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.600
 here becomes aware of the human 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.600
 assessment 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.830
 packed, the finished module arrives 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.300
 vehicle manufacturer the device 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.340
 disappears later than whole in the 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.000
 dashboard and is not as such 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.000
 to recognize more 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.590
 when the head-up display is on 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.440
 Is it safe for the driver? 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.300
 driving the scope of data support the 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.550
 the display shows depends on 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.220
 vehicle model and manufacturer 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.710
 navigation danger messages or oil pressure 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.280
 wear warnings or hot on the 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.100
 roadway 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.690
 here there are no limits if in the 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.380
 city ​​on the highway or the 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.330
 Highway 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.190
 the big advantage the driver has 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.200
 important data always directly in his 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.300
 field of view and no longer has to go down 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.750
 on the dashboard look so 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.250
 holds a piece of high-tech straight for 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.210
 your safety and that of 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.210
 vehicle occupant
