00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:01.199 
every one today I'm gonna show you how

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:03.830 
every one today I'm gonna show you how
to<00:00:01.260> make<00:00:01.439> this<00:00:01.620> bubble<00:00:02.190> tea<00:00:02.580> memo<00:00:03.120> holder<00:00:03.629> and

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
to make this bubble tea memo holder and

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.539 
to make this bubble tea memo holder and
it's<00:00:04.020> made<00:00:04.200> out<00:00:04.350> of<00:00:04.380> resin<00:00:04.710> in<00:00:04.980> polymer<00:00:05.400> clay

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
it's made out of resin in polymer clay

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.490 
it's made out of resin in polymer clay
and<00:00:05.850> as<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.480> can<00:00:06.600> see<00:00:06.660> it<00:00:06.990> can<00:00:07.109> hold<00:00:07.290> little

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
and as you can see it can hold little

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.770 
and as you can see it can hold little
memos<00:00:07.859> like<00:00:08.069> this<00:00:08.250> business<00:00:08.429> card<00:00:08.790> so<00:00:09.450> pretty

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
memos like this business card so pretty

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.180 
memos like this business card so pretty
much<00:00:09.960> this<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.380> what<00:00:10.679> it<00:00:10.800> looks<00:00:10.980> like

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
much this is what it looks like

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.709 
much this is what it looks like
it<00:00:11.370> looks<00:00:11.550> pretty<00:00:11.759> realistic<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.360> me<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.630> when

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
it looks pretty realistic to me and when

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.180 
it looks pretty realistic to me and when
I<00:00:12.750> post<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.259> Instagram<00:00:13.710> most<00:00:13.920> people

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190

I post it on Instagram most people
didn't<00:00:14.490> know<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:14.880> was<00:00:15.120> fake<00:00:15.420> for<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.080> cup<00:00:16.230> I'm

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379

didn't know it was fake for the cup I'm
just<00:00:16.619> using<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:17.130> plastic<00:00:17.760> cup<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.119> got

from the dollar store and I got 20 for a
dollar<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.420> think<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.020> pretty<00:00:22.410> much<00:00:22.560> we're

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
dollar I think and pretty much we're

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.220 
dollar I think and pretty much we're
gonna<00:00:22.800> turn<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.490> clear<00:00:23.970> cup<00:00:24.180> into<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.810> bowl

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
gonna turn this clear cup into this bowl

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.220 
gonna turn this clear cup into this bowl
back<00:00:25.380> up<00:00:25.650> now<00:00:26.400> what<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.730> did<00:00:26.939> was<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.359> cut<00:00:28.080> up<00:00:28.109> some

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
back up now what I did was I cut up some

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.620 
back up now what I did was I cut up some
black<00:00:29.010> polymer<00:00:29.400> clay<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:30.029> form<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> tapioca

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
black polymer clay to form the tapioca

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.350 
black polymer clay to form the tapioca
Bulbasaur<00:00:31.590> at<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> tapioca<00:00:32.009> bubbles<00:00:32.550> now<00:00:33.120> if

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
Bulbasaur at the tapioca bubbles now if

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.930 
Bulbasaur at the tapioca bubbles now if
you<00:00:33.480> don't<00:00:33.570> want<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.870> waste<00:00:34.170> your<00:00:34.860> black<00:00:35.670> clay

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
you don't want to waste your black clay

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.229 
you don't want to waste your black clay
you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.570> always<00:00:36.960> use<00:00:37.469> grab<00:00:37.770> clay<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.370> paint

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
you can always use grab clay and paint

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.360 
you can always use grab clay and paint
it<00:00:39.390> black<00:00:39.629> if<00:00:39.960> that's<00:00:40.649> something<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.100> want<00:00:41.280> to

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
it black if that's something you want to

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.819 
it black if that's something you want to
do<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.420> didn't<00:00:42.989> want<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.200> bake<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.680> polymer

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
do but I didn't want to bake the polymer

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.610 
do but I didn't want to bake the polymer
clay<00:00:44.190> balls<00:00:44.760> because<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.480> found<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.079> easier<00:00:46.440> to

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
clay balls because I found it easier to

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.860 
clay balls because I found it easier to
stick<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.370> cup<00:00:47.670> by<00:00:48.030> not<00:00:48.270> baking<00:00:48.600> them<00:00:48.719> and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
stick to the cup by not baking them and

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.270 
stick to the cup by not baking them and
since<00:00:49.020> they're<00:00:49.170> at<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> bottom<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
since they're at the bottom and the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.250 
since they're at the bottom and the
resin<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.610> gonna<00:00:50.760> harden<00:00:51.090> over<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:52.079> don't

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
resin is gonna harden over it you don't

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.979 
resin is gonna harden over it you don't
technically<00:00:52.980> need<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.399> bake<00:00:53.550> them<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.690> chose

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
technically need to bake them so I chose

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.080 
technically need to bake them so I chose
to<00:00:55.230> keep<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.559> black<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.430> pretty<00:00:56.789> much<00:00:56.879> you're

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
to keep it black and pretty much you're

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.599 
to keep it black and pretty much you're
going<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.449> put<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.379> bubbles<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.070> side<00:00:59.460> of

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
going to put the bubbles on the side of

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.250 
going to put the bubbles on the side of
the<00:00:59.670> cup<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.180> when<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.809> pour<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.109> resin

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
the cup so that when you pour the resin

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.900 
the cup so that when you pour the resin
over<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.859> still<00:01:02.070> see<00:01:02.280> them<00:01:02.489> kind<00:01:02.760> of

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
over you can still see them kind of

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.939 
over you can still see them kind of
floating<00:01:03.780> around<00:01:03.870> at<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> bottom<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.739> this

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
floating around at the bottom and this

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.469 
floating around at the bottom and this
is<00:01:05.010> pretty<00:01:05.189> much<00:01:05.309> what<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.489> looks<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.030> did

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
is pretty much what it looks like I did

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.750 
is pretty much what it looks like I did
fill<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.840> bottom<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.920> cup<00:01:08.159> with<00:01:08.400> some

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
fill the bottom of the cup with some

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.149 
fill the bottom of the cup with some
black<00:01:09.119> clay<00:01:09.510> as<00:01:09.780> well<00:01:09.990> because<00:01:10.350> I'm<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:11.040> to

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
black clay as well because I'm going to

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.100 
black clay as well because I'm going to
stick<00:01:11.490> my<00:01:11.520> memo<00:01:12.000> clip<00:01:12.270> right<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> middle

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
stick my memo clip right in the middle

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.870 
stick my memo clip right in the middle
of<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> clay<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:13.860> going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.490> help<00:01:14.670> keep

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
of it and the clay is going to help keep

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.830 
of it and the clay is going to help keep
it<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.150> place<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:17.150> now<00:01:18.150> you're<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.509> going<00:01:18.750> to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
it in place so now you're just going to

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.570 
it in place so now you're just going to
mix<00:01:19.020> some<00:01:19.110> resin<00:01:19.590> I'm<00:01:19.770> using<00:01:19.950> one<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.430> one

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
mix some resin I'm using one to one

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.870 
mix some resin I'm using one to one
ratio<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.970> epoxy<00:01:21.330> resin<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.799> mixed<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.430> white

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
ratio of epoxy resin and I mixed a white

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.289 
ratio of epoxy resin and I mixed a white
red<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.810> yellow<00:01:25.080> pigments<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.430> form<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.030> milk

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
red and yellow pigments to form the milk

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.710 
red and yellow pigments to form the milk
tea<00:01:27.509> color<00:01:27.799> now<00:01:28.799> there<00:01:29.369> isn't<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:30.030> proper

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
tea color now there isn't a proper

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.050 
tea color now there isn't a proper
proportion<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.890> what<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.460> did<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:32.850> I

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
proportion for this what I did was I

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.270 
proportion for this what I did was I
colored<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.930> white<00:01:34.170> first<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.829> then<00:01:34.920> added

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
colored it white first and then added

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.039 
colored it white first and then added
very<00:01:35.729> little<00:01:36.150> amounts<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.540> red<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.930> yellow

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
very little amounts of red and yellow

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.560 
very little amounts of red and yellow
until<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.590> got<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> color<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.220> liked<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:39.180> as<00:01:39.450> you

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
until I got the color I liked so as you

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.450 
until I got the color I liked so as you
can<00:01:39.659> see<00:01:39.869> I'm<00:01:39.990> only<00:01:40.170> using<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.950> little<00:01:41.310> bit

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
can see I'm only using this little bit

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.399 
can see I'm only using this little bit
on<00:01:41.670> my<00:01:41.820> toothpick<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.479> didn't<00:01:42.750> really<00:01:42.990> use<00:01:43.170> much

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
on my toothpick I didn't really use much

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.590 
on my toothpick I didn't really use much
more<00:01:43.619> than<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.340> if<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.850> needed<00:01:45.180> more<00:01:45.329> than

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
more than that and if I needed more than

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.719 
more than that and if I needed more than
you<00:01:46.140> know<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.380> better<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.710> start<00:01:47.009> off<00:01:47.250> a

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
you know it's better to start off a

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.609 
you know it's better to start off a
little<00:01:48.360> by<00:01:49.259> little<00:01:49.500> than<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.220> go<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:51.329> know

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
little by little than to go you know

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.899 
little by little than to go you know
all-in<00:01:52.619> with<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.920> lot<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.159> color<00:01:53.430> because<00:01:53.790> then

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
all-in with a lot of color because then

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.070 
all-in with a lot of color because then
you<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.210> mess<00:01:54.390> up<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.750> waste<00:01:55.290> your<00:01:55.470> resin

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.380 

so<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.190> is<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.400> color<00:01:59.550> I<00:01:59.820> liked<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.210> thought

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
so this is the color I liked I thought

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.390 
so this is the color I liked I thought
it<00:02:00.540> looked<00:02:00.660> very<00:02:00.810> milky<00:02:01.470> colored<00:02:01.860> like<00:02:02.130> and

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
it looked very milky colored like and

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.030 
it looked very milky colored like and
now<00:02:03.360> you're<00:02:03.540> going<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.900> pour<00:02:04.050> it<00:02:04.200> slowly<00:02:04.350> into

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
now you're going to pour it slowly into

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.610 
now you're going to pour it slowly into
your<00:02:05.400> boba<00:02:05.880> cup<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.990> started<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.500> the

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
your boba cup and I started in the

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:32.050 
your boba cup and I started in the
middle<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.130> just<00:02:08.160> slowly<00:02:08.460> poured<00:02:08.850> over<00:02:09.030> it

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.150 

here<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.239> can<00:02:33.420> see<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.840> because<00:02:34.200> we<00:02:34.470> kind<00:02:35.099> of

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
here you can see that because we kind of

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.010 
here you can see that because we kind of
adhere<00:02:35.640> or<00:02:35.849> stuff<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.360> tapioca<00:02:36.690> balls

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
adhere or stuff the tapioca balls

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.870 
adhere or stuff the tapioca balls
towards<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.650> side<00:02:37.860> of<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.099> cup<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.730> could

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
towards the side of the cup you could

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.089 
towards the side of the cup you could
see<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.390> boba<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.110> very<00:02:40.380> very<00:02:40.620> well<00:02:40.860> and

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
see the boba is very very well and

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.259 
see the boba is very very well and
that's<00:02:41.280> why<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.459> didn't<00:02:41.790> want<00:02:41.849> to<00:02:41.970> bake<00:02:42.150> the

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
that's why I didn't want to bake the

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.150 
that's why I didn't want to bake the
polymer<00:02:42.390> clay<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.989> can<00:02:43.530> if<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.769> want<00:02:43.890> but

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
polymer clay you can if you want but

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.100 
polymer clay you can if you want but
this<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.910> just<00:02:45.180> something<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.690> decided

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
this is just something that I decided

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.809 
this is just something that I decided
and<00:02:46.620> pretty<00:02:47.069> much<00:02:47.160> you'd<00:02:47.340> be<00:02:47.430> done<00:02:47.640> if<00:02:47.760> you

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
and pretty much you'd be done if you

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.550 
and pretty much you'd be done if you
don't<00:02:47.970> want<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.180> add<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.510> metal<00:02:48.810> clip<00:02:48.989> in<00:02:49.230> but

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
don't want to add a metal clip in but

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.339 
don't want to add a metal clip in but
two<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.160> three<00:02:50.400> hours<00:02:50.700> later<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:51.000> decided<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
two to three hours later I decided the

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.140 
two to three hours later I decided the
resin<00:02:52.769> was<00:02:52.890> tacky<00:02:53.130> enough<00:02:53.310> for<00:02:53.610> me<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.849> stick

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
resin was tacky enough for me to stick

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.080 
resin was tacky enough for me to stick
the<00:02:54.739> bottom<00:02:55.739> portion<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.370> metal<00:02:56.519> clip

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
the bottom portion of the metal clip

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.680 
the bottom portion of the metal clip
into<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:57.989> middle<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.709> my<00:02:59.130> cup<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.670> it<00:03:00.510> is

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
into the middle of my cup and it is

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.780 
into the middle of my cup and it is
going<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:01.019> move<00:03:01.140> around<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.769> I<00:03:01.799> decided<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.580> use

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
going to move around so I decided to use

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.809 
going to move around so I decided to use
some<00:03:03.510> masking<00:03:03.690> tape<00:03:03.930> as<00:03:04.350> my<00:03:04.799> border<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.459> some

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
some masking tape as my border and some

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.059 
some masking tape as my border and some
popsicle<00:03:06.239> sticks<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.600> keep<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.930> upright<00:03:07.290> and

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
popsicle sticks to keep it upright and

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.070 
popsicle sticks to keep it upright and
after<00:03:08.430> waiting<00:03:08.700> 24<00:03:09.090> hours<00:03:09.420> you're<00:03:09.630> done<00:03:09.870> and

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
after waiting 24 hours you're done and

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.750 
after waiting 24 hours you're done and
this<00:03:10.380> is<00:03:10.440> what<00:03:10.769> your<00:03:10.890> creation<00:03:11.370> should<00:03:11.580> look

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
this is what your creation should look

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.330 
this is what your creation should look
like<00:03:11.790> just<00:03:12.630> like<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.840> first<00:03:13.170> boba<00:03:13.709> metal<00:03:14.130> clip

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
like just like the first boba metal clip

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.220 
like just like the first boba metal clip
