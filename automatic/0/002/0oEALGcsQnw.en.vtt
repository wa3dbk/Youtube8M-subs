first<00:02:22.970> that<00:02:23.690> would<00:02:23.900> be<00:02:24.080> some<00:02:24.350> nice<00:02:24.560> wheel<00:02:24.860> spin

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
first that would be some nice wheel spin

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.490 
first that would be some nice wheel spin
right<00:02:25.340> there<00:02:25.610> so<00:02:26.060> let's<00:02:26.660> turn<00:02:26.870> turn<00:02:27.380> the

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500

booths<00:02:27.680> down<00:02:28.180> we<00:02:29.180> don't<00:02:29.360> want<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.870> turn<00:02:30.110> it

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
booths down we don't want to turn it

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.680 
booths down we don't want to turn it
down<00:02:30.410> all<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.709> way<00:02:30.950> i<00:02:31.040> would<00:02:31.250> say<00:02:31.510> because<00:02:32.510> you

down all the way i would say because you
get<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.310> best<00:02:34.310> economy<00:02:35.150> Oh<00:02:35.320> string<00:02:36.320> is<00:02:36.410> wrong

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
get the best economy Oh string is wrong

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.560 
get the best economy Oh string is wrong
yet<00:02:36.800> there<00:02:37.160> should<00:02:37.400> be<00:02:37.430> gone<00:02:37.910> me<00:02:38.030> better<00:02:38.269> than

11<00:02:39.080> litres<00:02:39.350> per<00:02:39.380> 100<00:02:39.680> kilometers<00:02:40.570> you<00:02:41.570> get<00:02:41.840> the

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
11 litres per 100 kilometers you get the

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.460 
11 litres per 100 kilometers you get the
best<00:02:42.110> economy<00:02:42.590> around<00:02:42.739> is<00:02:43.209> boost<00:02:44.209> of<00:02:44.450> up<00:02:44.840> on<00:02:44.989> 55

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
best economy around is boost of up on 55

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.710 
best economy around is boost of up on 55
in<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.680> game<00:02:45.769> so<00:02:46.400> let's<00:02:47.090> just<00:02:47.420> keep<00:02:47.540> it<00:02:47.660> like

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
in the game so let's just keep it like

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.570 
in the game so let's just keep it like
that<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.290> see<00:02:49.040> what<00:02:49.070> we<00:02:49.310> can<00:02:49.489> do<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:51.580> granny

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
that and see what we can do and granny

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.259 
that and see what we can do and granny
doesn't<00:02:53.120> like<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:54.160> be<00:02:55.160> tanking<00:02:55.820> ultimate

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
doesn't like to be tanking ultimate

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.630 
doesn't like to be tanking ultimate
unleaded<00:02:56.450> she<00:02:57.080> would<00:02:57.230> probably<00:02:57.799> fail<00:02:58.220> at<00:02:58.459> that

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
unleaded she would probably fail at that

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.150 
unleaded she would probably fail at that
so<00:02:59.090> let's<00:02:59.480> go<00:02:59.780> for<00:03:00.080> regular<00:03:00.680> let<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:01.730> there<00:03:02.000> and

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
so let's go for regular let it there and

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.589 
so let's go for regular let it there and
a<00:03:04.160> few<00:03:04.250> mixture<00:03:05.000> of<00:03:05.180> 11

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
a few mixture of 11

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.130 
a few mixture of 11
1021<00:03:08.549> running<00:03:09.549> rich<00:03:09.750> now<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:10.959> we<00:03:11.110> have

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
1021 running rich now that we have

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.319 
1021 running rich now that we have
turned<00:03:11.409> down<00:03:11.620> boost<00:03:11.860> so<00:03:12.220> what<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:12.939> now<00:03:13.269> the

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
turned down boost so what and now the

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.780 
turned down boost so what and now the
entry<00:03:13.810> is<00:03:13.900> kept<00:03:14.200> going<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:14.860> be<00:03:14.980> destroyed<00:03:15.280> it's

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
entry is kept going to be destroyed it's

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.270 
entry is kept going to be destroyed it's
make<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.150> very<00:03:16.360> lean<00:03:16.659> and<00:03:16.920> drop<00:03:17.920> down<00:03:18.129> the

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
make it very lean and drop down the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.399 
make it very lean and drop down the
timing<00:03:18.640> as<00:03:18.760> well<00:03:18.939> and<00:03:19.239> see<00:03:19.450> how<00:03:19.599> much<00:03:19.720> less

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
timing as well and see how much less

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.420 
timing as well and see how much less
power<00:03:20.739> we<00:03:21.010> can<00:03:21.220> make<00:03:22.019> yes<00:03:23.019> yes<00:03:23.290> this<00:03:24.220> is

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
power we can make yes yes this is

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.500 
power we can make yes yes this is
looking<00:03:24.730> good<00:03:24.879> only<00:03:25.739> 184<00:03:26.739> kilowatts<00:03:27.189> left<00:03:27.510> and

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
looking good only 184 kilowatts left and

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.530 
looking good only 184 kilowatts left and
also<00:03:29.049> even<00:03:30.010> though<00:03:30.040> granny<00:03:30.489> is<00:03:30.730> somewhat

death<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:32.079> think<00:03:32.620> zero<00:03:33.609> mufflers<00:03:34.269> on<00:03:34.569> this<00:03:35.109> car

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 
death I think zero mufflers on this car

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:38.610 
death I think zero mufflers on this car
won't<00:03:36.040> be<00:03:36.579> too<00:03:37.030> good<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:37.750> let's<00:03:37.900> put<00:03:38.170> double

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
won't be too good so let's put double

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.069 
won't be too good so let's put double
reverse<00:03:39.010> flow<00:03:39.400> in<00:03:39.549> it<00:03:39.670> see<00:03:40.120> how<00:03:40.269> much<00:03:40.389> more<00:03:40.659> can

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
reverse flow in it see how much more can

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.910 
reverse flow in it see how much more can
we<00:03:41.230> drop<00:03:42.690> 164<00:03:43.690> should<00:03:44.290> make<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.590> car<00:03:44.769> more

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
we drop 164 should make the car more

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.370 
right now again and in between you can
see<00:04:35.330> your<00:04:36.220> your<00:04:37.220> score<00:04:37.639> right<00:04:38.000> there<00:04:38.380> also

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
see your your score right there also

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.610 
see your your score right there also
when<00:04:40.280> you<00:04:40.520> want<00:04:40.759> to<00:04:41.050> optimize<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.410> car

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
when you want to optimize the car

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.760 
when you want to optimize the car
without<00:04:42.860> seeing<00:04:43.759> all<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.470> scenario<00:04:45.470> stuff

without seeing all the scenario stuff
here<00:04:46.039> you<00:04:46.160> can<00:04:46.310> just<00:04:46.340> put<00:04:47.060> it<00:04:47.180> on<00:04:47.300> statistics

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
here you can just put it on statistics

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.290 
here you can just put it on statistics
and<00:04:48.169> this<00:04:49.099> disappears<00:04:49.729> this<00:04:49.910> we<00:04:50.030> know<00:04:50.150> which

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
and this disappears this we know which

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.240 
and this disappears this we know which
it<00:04:50.449> shouldn't<00:04:50.810> it<00:04:51.199> should<00:04:51.410> be<00:04:51.620> still<00:04:52.009> there

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
it shouldn't it should be still there

it shouldn't it should be still there

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
showing the medals and stuff but you can

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.890 
showing the medals and stuff but you can
see<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:55.069> stats<00:04:55.340> just<00:04:55.729> as<00:04:56.030> you<00:04:56.330> would<00:04:56.479> normally

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
see the stats just as you would normally

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.740 
see the stats just as you would normally
and<00:04:57.610> we<00:04:58.610> definitely<00:04:58.759> want<00:04:59.270> to<00:04:59.300> tune<00:04:59.660> it<00:04:59.810> for<00:05:00.610> or

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
and we definitely want to tune it for or

and we definitely want to tune it for or
optimal<00:05:02.750> tameness<00:05:02.960> in<00:05:03.320> this<00:05:03.470> case<00:05:04.030> so<00:05:05.030> it's

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
optimal tameness in this case so it's

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.379 
optimal tameness in this case so it's
what's<00:05:05.599> to<00:05:05.810> get<00:05:05.930> out<00:05:06.080> of<00:05:06.169> this<00:05:07.210> can<00:05:08.210> we<00:05:08.270> go

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
what's to get out of this can we go

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.020 
what's to get out of this can we go
wider<00:05:08.660> now<00:05:09.380> we<00:05:09.500> can't<00:05:09.740> so<00:05:10.490> let's<00:05:10.699> drop<00:05:10.880> this

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
wider now we can't so let's drop this

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:17.649 
wider now we can't so let's drop this
one<00:05:11.710> also<00:05:12.710> we<00:05:13.030> have<00:05:14.030> s<00:05:14.360> it<00:05:14.389> so<00:05:15.229> seeing<00:05:16.659> Vin

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659 
one also we have s it so seeing Vin

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:21.249 
one also we have s it so seeing Vin
Diesel<00:05:18.229> did<00:05:18.470> put<00:05:18.830> a<00:05:19.039> huge<00:05:19.880> as<00:05:20.060> we<00:05:20.509> on<00:05:20.810> top<00:05:21.110> of

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
Diesel did put a huge as we on top of

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:24.040 
Diesel did put a huge as we on top of
the<00:05:21.380> car<00:05:21.759> it<00:05:22.759> does<00:05:23.030> make<00:05:23.270> sense<00:05:23.300> though<00:05:23.750> as

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
the car it does make sense though as

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.589 
the car it does make sense though as
it's<00:05:24.289> rear-wheel<00:05:24.590> drive<00:05:24.979> but<00:05:25.789> this<00:05:26.300> thing

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
it's rear-wheel drive but this thing

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:29.140 
it's rear-wheel drive but this thing
potentially<00:05:27.349> isn't<00:05:28.159> too<00:05:28.310> good<00:05:28.460> for<00:05:28.820> your

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
potentially isn't too good for your

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.350 
potentially isn't too good for your
aerodynamics<00:05:29.840> and<00:05:30.380> thus<00:05:30.710> a<00:05:30.949> fuel<00:05:31.310> economy<00:05:31.669> so

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
aerodynamics and thus a fuel economy so

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.390 
aerodynamics and thus a fuel economy so
let's<00:05:32.630> change<00:05:32.930> this<00:05:33.169> a<00:05:33.229> bit<00:05:33.440> first<00:05:33.740> cooling

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
let's change this a bit first cooling

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.330 
let's change this a bit first cooling
airflow<00:05:34.550> now<00:05:35.240> that<00:05:35.449> the<00:05:35.570> engine<00:05:35.690> is

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
airflow now that the engine is

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.029 
airflow now that the engine is
reasonably<00:05:37.340> moderate<00:05:37.849> in<00:05:38.500> its<00:05:39.500> performance

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
reasonably moderate in its performance

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.999 
reasonably moderate in its performance
we<00:05:40.699> can<00:05:41.060> lower<00:05:41.570> this<00:05:41.810> significantly<00:05:42.440> but<00:05:42.770> also

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:43.009 
we can lower this significantly but also

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.060 
we can lower this significantly but also
we<00:05:43.340> can<00:05:43.610> drop<00:05:44.180> the<00:05:44.449> rear<00:05:44.750> wing<00:05:45.530> inclination

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
we can drop the rear wing inclination

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.629 
we can drop the rear wing inclination
quite<00:05:46.940> a<00:05:46.969> bit<00:05:47.680> she<00:05:48.680> won't<00:05:48.949> be<00:05:49.070> driving<00:05:49.310> faster

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
quite a bit she won't be driving faster

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.689 
quite a bit she won't be driving faster
than<00:05:50.030> like<00:05:50.270> 50<00:05:50.900> anyways<00:05:51.320> right<00:05:51.590> so<00:05:51.949> where's

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 
than like 50 anyways right so where's

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:54.850 
than like 50 anyways right so where's
the<00:05:52.820> point<00:05:53.060> in<00:05:53.180> having<00:05:53.210> a<00:05:53.509> wing<00:05:53.690> which<00:05:53.900> just

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
the point in having a wing which just

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.450 
the point in having a wing which just
costs<00:05:55.280> your<00:05:55.460> economy<00:05:55.880> and<00:05:57.130> that's<00:05:58.130> basically

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
costs your economy and that's basically

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.890 
costs your economy and that's basically
it<00:05:59.289> apart<00:06:00.289> from<00:06:00.699> very<00:06:01.699> importantly<00:06:02.210> this

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
it apart from very importantly this

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.629 
it apart from very importantly this
suspension<00:06:03.740> is<00:06:04.219> rock<00:06:05.210> hard<00:06:06.310> basically<00:06:07.310> every

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
suspension is rock hard basically every

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.999 
suspension is rock hard basically every
bump<00:06:07.880> is<00:06:08.090> one-to-one<00:06:08.810> translated<00:06:09.620> into<00:06:09.770> the

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:10.009 
bump is one-to-one translated into the

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:13.430 
bump is one-to-one translated into the
body<00:06:10.219> and<00:06:10.520> we<00:06:11.479> don't<00:06:11.630> want<00:06:11.780> that<00:06:12.020> so<00:06:12.620> let's

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
body and we don't want that so let's

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.910 
body and we don't want that so let's
go<00:06:13.650> with<00:06:13.830> comfort<00:06:14.370> BAM<00:06:15.270> platinum<00:06:16.200> yes<00:06:16.560> there
