00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.980
 they move many friends of youtube the day 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.470
 I bring you a call called messenger box 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.780
 in ios 7 what does this make us 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.430
 tweet this tweet first before 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.330
 download every tweet we have to always 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.000
 read the specifications for example 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.610
 this tweet and I have it installed but 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.600
 in the specifications it indicated to me that 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:36.850
 It is compatible with the application 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.250
 facebook paper 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.989
 already so for example I had to 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.699
 download this application but the 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.430
 application I think if I'm not wrong it 's 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.579
 only in the United States or others 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:52.449
 countries here in Peru for example no no no 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.820
 is still going to install it they are 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:58.680
 it's going to be a little respite 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.400
 we went out 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.530
 let's go to settings let's look for the 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.979
 Tweet 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.409
 here it is and as you can see these two do not come out 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.080
 options that are already activated from 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.190
 by itself already 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.190
 I already install this application here is 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.190
 paper 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.250
 and that what we do is the tweet 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.930
 makes us 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.540
 that when we are talking 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.620
 for example, let's go here 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.620
 to put something 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.229
 we are going in the same application 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.170
 paper is put on us so we do not get 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.110
 ball with balloon but what allows us 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.020
 now it is that we are going to leave 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.090

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.240
