 besides being a necessity the food 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.090
 It can be a pleasure and also an art 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.820
 that is studied and practiced in high 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.460
 cooks a world that little by little has 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.680
 come diversifying and expanding in 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.919
 our country without you membreño we 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.109
 presents three exponents of the group of 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:30.779
 young chefs who are changing the 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.779
 panorama of gastronomy in nicaragua 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.579
 mouth watering 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.640
 behind each saucer there is a young man 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.050
 kitchen professional 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.010
 they are the new face of the 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.289
 national gastronomy at the moment 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.910
 sew tortellinis 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.680
 approximately about 6 minutes cristina 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.019
 Gómez is the executive chef of the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.850
 restaurant the second his passion for 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.979
 culinary arts started from his 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.810
 childhood obviously for being 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.490
 little girl they never let me into the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.440
 kitchen but I went little by little first 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.149
 I started with the lemonade then I went 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.180
 preparing the rice and so on 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.820
 but it is something that I bring from small 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.539
 but I never saw it as a profession 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.570
 simply put the pasta and 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.039
 he turns for christina is a great 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.619
 challenge to lead the kitchen of a restaurant 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.380
 high profile just at the start of his 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.280
 race so that all the time people 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.440
 Question this is the chef or they ask me 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.390
 to me directly from who the chef is and 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.869
 I have to answer him and they stay 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.760
 obviously a little puzzled but he has 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.020
 been a great challenge 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:56.520
 It is the hardest part age sex 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.520
 the physical the physical aspect 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.050
 open field in a profession 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.260
 traditionally male is a challenge 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.660
 of every day with the team is very 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.840
 very very difficult especially for the subject 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.020
 of machismo that we have in this society 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.270
 all my team in kitchen are men 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.110
 all my team in kitchen are very good 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:23.080
 really but accept that part of me 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.660
 boss is a woman and has 24 years has 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.800
 been a bit difficult but you get it 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.750
 with the example 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.490
 christina studies in italy and returned to 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.980
 Nicaragua because he wants to be part of the 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.160
 nascent culinary movement my idea is 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.080
 obviously always support to support the 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.780
 people who keep dreaming I know there are 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.310
 many people who like gastronomy 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.160
 but who is afraid to study 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.990
 gastronomy for exactly what I'm going to 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.450
 live when you're graduated from 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.080
 gastronomy then I want to be a 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.510
 I want to be part of that 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.340
 between bits edwin puncturing diriges a 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.050
 kitchen where dishes are prepared 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.050
 based on recipes options 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.080
 his experience as an entrepreneur taught him 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.310
 that the administration of a local comes 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.310
 hand in hand with the culinary arts 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.280
 No use to cook very well but 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.000
 if you do not have the administrative part 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.670
 to fail 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.629
 that is, there is a part of costs of 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.959
 management human resources economy 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.549
 of personnel inventory to look for the 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.220
 best ingredients at the best 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.140
 prices to be able to leave a product of 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.330
 human relations to be able to deal with 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.580
 customers always have to put the 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.750
 best face you always have to smile for 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.750
 many problems you have 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.049
 the kitchen of a restaurant must follow 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:45.939
 a militarized routine people have 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.790
 to understand that in kitchens there 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:52.299
 time is to say if you need that 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.420
 this chicken is cooked for 5 minutes if 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:59.230
 you leave it 5 minutes 02 seconds already 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.150
 you won and if you got it 458 it is not in 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.859
 the moment you have to be then 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.269
 there is horrible pressure because in addition 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.650
 you are playing with food you are 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.659
 playing with the client's stomach 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.060
 to kill someone you can poison him 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.340
 on the surface restaurants like 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.530
 credit are a haven of peace but the 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.539
 culinary artists that make it possible 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.239
 live in a pressure cooker my 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:21.669
 workers know my collaborators 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.160
 they have said they know that I am a model in the 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.530
 kitchen but on the hour but it is in the 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.449
 moment and in the role after we talked 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.630
 we play we buy polvorones and cocacola 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.990
 we throw a little topping and not 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.390
 nothing happens 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.430
 edwin pichardo formed in the Peru 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.720
 epicenter of the culinary revolution of 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.280
 Latin America 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.050
 I feel that those of us who have access to 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.510
 a very good education we have a 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.670
 social responsibility with the country if 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.740
 we do not invest in the country who 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.690
 it will make us young 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.460
 we have to appropriate our country 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.470
 and say we are going to get ahead 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.200
 this country if skilled labor 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.500
 it goes away from here then who is going to 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.450
 do 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.400
 they end up coming foreigners ride 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.970
 your changarro and say a shine what 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.970
 I could have done 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.319
 this weekend you can not miss 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.569
 super super rich we have a special 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:12.849
 Asian food geyser block took a 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:15.159
 Different way shares his talent 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.319
 culinary through the media she 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:18.819
 he runs the simple and gourmet magazine and a 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:21.039
 TV cooking show 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:23.020
 national I had never come out in the 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.270
 television and vidal there was never 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.580
 thought of that course as a 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.860
 possibility for my career 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.870
 I do not know I did not see it as something of an image 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.840
 he had never done the result of his 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.949
 casting was much better than expected 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.319
 I arrived on Monday and agreed to do the 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.810
 casting and the things that scared me the most 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:42.550
 was what I felt uncomfortable when 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.080
 turn on the camera and opted and not even 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.469
 cooking you from a grimace of a 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.629
 recipe and I felt very comfortable two years 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:51.759
 Then his magazine came up with a project that 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:54.039
 emerged from the emptiness that he has identified 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.080
 in the national market we had a 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:58.300
 bunch of magazines like where books from 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.099
 cooks interviews that were foreign 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.449
 still waiting in Spanish 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:03.580
 the language is never the same 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:06.039
 ingredients are never even to 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.560
 Sometimes there are not or sometimes they are written 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:10.090
 They are told differently 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.590
 management knowledge and 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.870
 marketing was used to overcome 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.000
 this publishing adventure all the 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.340
 Marketing area learning 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.380
 administration is priceless right now 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.060
 for what for what I do and for 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.500
 any person or for I am 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.150
 sure that if people in 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.830
 restaurants and société or restaurant 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.650
 everything serves you because as you say 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.870
 cost management staff I manage 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.610

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.650
 with that in 2014 heysel has new 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.840
 projects for your magazine our 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.460
 intention is to try this house

 different collaborators and different 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.270
 editors 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.980

 Central America to be able to achieve that 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.370

 nicaragua on the map of astronomy and 

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:08.650
