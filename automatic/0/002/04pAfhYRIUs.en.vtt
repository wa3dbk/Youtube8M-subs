00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.340 
then you what you want to do you don't
you<00:03:06.770> should<00:03:07.040> never<00:03:07.280> crank<00:03:07.910> this<00:03:08.150> crank<00:03:08.600> it

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
you should never crank this crank it

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.140 
you should never crank this crank it
this<00:03:11.290> see<00:03:12.290> that's<00:03:12.890> what<00:03:13.040> happened<00:03:13.430> whole

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
this see that's what happened whole

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.660 
this see that's what happened whole
thing<00:03:14.560> screws<00:03:15.560> up<00:03:15.770> except<00:03:16.070> for<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.250> Mel<00:03:16.430> rod

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
thing screws up except for the Mel rod

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:33.540 
thing screws up except for the Mel rod
they<00:03:17.180> had<00:03:17.390> to<00:03:17.510> do<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.720> again

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:41.060 

I<00:03:35.610> mean<00:03:36.610> this<00:03:36.790> is<00:03:36.940> harder<00:03:37.300> than<00:03:37.330> I<00:03:37.450> thought

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:54.380 

just<00:03:42.070> easily<00:03:42.970> and<00:03:43.300> carefully<00:03:43.960> just<00:03:49.170> this

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.190 

there<00:03:55.110> we<00:03:56.300> stay<00:03:57.300> and<00:03:57.540> get<00:03:57.750> stuff<00:03:59.300> good<00:04:00.300> good

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
there we stay and get stuff good good

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.550 
there we stay and get stuff good good
and<00:04:01.290> then<00:04:01.590> now<00:04:02.540> you<00:04:03.540> put<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.900> top<00:04:04.140> back<00:04:04.170> on

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
and then now you put the top back on

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.680 
and then now you put the top back on
carefully<00:04:06.530> matching<00:04:07.700> both<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.910> sides<00:04:09.240> should

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
carefully matching both the sides should

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.300 
carefully matching both the sides should
look<00:04:10.530> like<00:04:10.560> this

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
look like this

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.530 
look like this
with<00:04:12.120> all<00:04:12.270> the<00:04:12.390> screws<00:04:12.690> and<00:04:13.320> then<00:04:14.540> let's

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
with all the screws and then let's

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.410 
with all the screws and then let's
cruise

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
cruise

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:32.990 
cruise
why<00:04:20.299> carefully<00:04:25.490> that<00:04:27.530> place<00:04:28.530> it<00:04:28.740> there<00:04:32.000> there

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
why carefully that place it there there

00:04:33.000 --> 00:05:03.610 
why carefully that place it there there
you<00:04:33.180> go

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.190 

carefully<00:05:04.620> don't<00:05:05.160> over<00:05:05.580> screw<00:05:05.880> or<00:05:06.210> else<00:05:06.390> the

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200
