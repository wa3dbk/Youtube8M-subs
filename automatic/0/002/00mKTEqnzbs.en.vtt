00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
well one of the technologies that we've

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.779 
well one of the technologies that we've
been<00:00:50.820> working<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.390> lab<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.110> is

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
been working in the lab with this is

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.240 
been working in the lab with this is
Michael<00:00:53.789> described<00:00:54.180> its<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.750> has<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.860> single

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
Michael described its it has the single

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.220 
Michael described its it has the single
touch<00:00:56.460> which<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.940> often<00:00:57.210> common<00:00:57.750> with<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
touch which is often common with the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.010 
touch which is often common with the
finger<00:00:58.620> or<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> stylus<00:01:00.090> but<00:01:00.300> one<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
finger or with a stylus but one of the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.900 
finger or with a stylus but one of the
things<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.530> were<00:01:01.710> working<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.579> how

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
things that we were working on is is how

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.719 
things that we were working on is is how
to<00:01:02.969> actually<00:01:03.570> make<00:01:04.189> multi-touch<00:01:05.189> come<00:01:05.580> to

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
to actually make multi-touch come to

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.490 
to actually make multi-touch come to
life<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.780> what<00:01:06.930> I'm<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.170> do<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.409> I

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
life and so what I'm going to do is I

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.670 
life and so what I'm going to do is I
have<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> tablet<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:09.750> brought<00:01:10.470> from

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
have a tablet here that we brought from

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.780 
have a tablet here that we brought from
the<00:01:10.799> lab<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.189> I'm<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.430> show<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.670> a

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the lab and I'm going to show you a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.570 
the lab and I'm going to show you a
demonstration<00:01:12.570> as<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.380> described<00:01:13.860> with<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
demonstration as I described with a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.490 
demonstration as I described with a
single<00:01:15.030> touch<00:01:15.180> what<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.780> application<00:01:15.930> is

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
single touch what the application is

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.530 
single touch what the application is
that<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.830> see<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.310> screen<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:18.060> just

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
that you see on the screen this just

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.270 
that you see on the screen this just
shows<00:01:18.750> whenever<00:01:19.140> I'm<00:01:19.439> touching<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.009> screen

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
shows whenever I'm touching the screen

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.760 
shows whenever I'm touching the screen
where<00:01:20.850> I'm<00:01:21.000> touching<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.750> as<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.439> can<00:01:22.560> see

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
where I'm touching it so as you can see

where I'm touching it so as you can see
I<00:01:22.799> put<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.369> finger<00:01:23.580> down<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.150> show<00:01:24.360> movement

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
I put one finger down to show movement

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.780 
I put one finger down to show movement
across<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.650> screen<00:01:25.860> at<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.310> kind<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.700> a

multi-touch technology that we're
working<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.820> you<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:32.970> see<00:01:33.180> now<00:01:33.390> I've<00:01:33.810> grabbed

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
working on you can see now I've grabbed

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.230 
working on you can see now I've grabbed
I<00:01:34.560> put<00:01:34.860> five<00:01:35.100> fingers<00:01:35.490> down<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> screen

I put five fingers down on the screen

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.969 
I put five fingers down on the screen
I'm<00:01:36.479> recognizing<00:01:37.320> all<00:01:37.470> five<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.770> those

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
I'm recognizing all five of those

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.190

fingers simultaneously concurrently on
the<00:01:40.680> screen<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.610> begin<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.970> say<00:01:42.210> well

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the screen so you begin to say well

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.080 
the screen so you begin to say well
that's<00:01:42.720> kind<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.049> neat<00:01:43.280> but<00:01:44.280> yeah<00:01:44.850> what<00:01:45.030> would

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
that's kind of neat but yeah what would

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.310 
that's kind of neat but yeah what would
you<00:01:45.149> do<00:01:45.360> with<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.600> what<00:01:45.840> would<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.079> do<00:01:46.170> with

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
you do with that what would you do with

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.020 
you do with that what would you do with
it<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.619> think<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.040> stole<00:01:47.250> your<00:01:47.310> line<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.820> one

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
first I'm going to pull up a a simple

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.649 
first I'm going to pull up a a simple
draw<00:01:57.810> application<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.990> we<00:02:00.990> get<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:02.479> bring<00:02:03.479> that

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
draw application and we get a bring that

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.289 
draw application and we get a bring that
up<00:02:03.689> full<00:02:04.020> screen<00:02:04.549> and<00:02:05.549> again<00:02:06.030> I'm<00:02:06.119> going<00:02:06.240> to

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
up full screen and again I'm going to

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.139 
up full screen and again I'm going to
take<00:02:06.450> my<00:02:06.719> hands<00:02:07.170> all<00:02:07.560> fingers<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.520> as<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.000> can

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
take my hands all fingers and as you can

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.330 
take my hands all fingers and as you can
see<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.450> begin<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.959> draw<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.470> screen

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
see I can begin to draw on the screen

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.630 
see I can begin to draw on the screen
just<00:02:12.340> one<00:02:12.750> multiple<00:02:13.750> points<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.470> touch<00:02:15.310> and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
just one multiple points of touch and

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.699 
just one multiple points of touch and
it's<00:02:16.300> it's<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.630> very<00:02:16.810> simple<00:02:16.989> drawing

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
it's it's a very simple drawing

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.110 
it's it's a very simple drawing
application<00:02:17.860> but<00:02:18.459> I<00:02:18.489> think<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:18.760> shows<00:02:18.910> the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
application but I think it shows the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.880 
application but I think it shows the
capability<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:19.840> what<00:02:20.349> you<00:02:20.470> can<00:02:20.530> get<00:02:20.650> out<00:02:20.709> of

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
capability of what you can get out of

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.150 
capability of what you can get out of
the<00:02:20.950> application<00:02:22.200> let<00:02:23.200> me<00:02:23.319> show<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.680> little

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
the application let me show you a little

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.830 
the application let me show you a little
bit<00:02:24.340> different<00:02:24.730> example<00:02:25.180> this<00:02:25.330> one<00:02:25.390> is<00:02:25.750> a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
bit different example this one is a

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.070 
bit different example this one is a
little<00:02:26.170> bit<00:02:26.260> more<00:02:26.440> concrete<00:02:28.080> versus

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
little bit more concrete versus

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.190 
little bit more concrete versus
something<00:02:29.440> you're<00:02:29.650> your<00:02:30.069> kids<00:02:30.100> might<00:02:30.580> do<00:02:31.200> so

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
something you're your kids might do so

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.280 
something you're your kids might do so
let<00:02:32.350> me<00:02:32.440> show<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.800> photo<00:02:33.370> application<00:02:34.290> and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
let me show you a photo application and

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.220 
let me show you a photo application and
how<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.709> might<00:02:36.040> use<00:02:36.450> multi-touch<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.900> manage

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
how you might use multi-touch to manage

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.949 
how you might use multi-touch to manage
photos<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:39.760> I've<00:02:39.880> got<00:02:40.030> four<00:02:40.239> different<00:02:40.599> photos

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
photos so I've got four different photos

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.509 
photos so I've got four different photos
I'm<00:02:41.200> going<00:02:41.349> to<00:02:41.410> first<00:02:41.590> take<00:02:41.830> one<00:02:42.040> finger<00:02:42.250> I'm

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
I'm going to first take one finger I'm

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.360 
I'm going to first take one finger I'm
going<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.760> grab<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:43.569> the<00:02:44.380> tiger<00:02:44.769> picture<00:02:45.160> move

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
going to grab the the tiger picture move

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
that around I'm going to use my second

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.770 
that around I'm going to use my second
finger<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.890> move<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.280> second<00:02:48.730> one<00:02:48.880> now<00:02:49.630> I'm

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
finger to move the second one now I'm

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.420

going<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:49.959> take<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.290> first<00:02:50.530> one<00:02:50.769> I'm<00:02:51.040> taking

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
going to take the first one I'm taking

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.729 
going to take the first one I'm taking
two<00:02:51.580> fingers<00:02:52.030> on<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.330> corners<00:02:52.780> of<00:02:52.959> that

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
two fingers on the corners of that

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.090 
two fingers on the corners of that
picture<00:02:54.040> I'm<00:02:54.450> resizing<00:02:55.450> I'm<00:02:55.660> rotating<00:02:56.200> now<00:02:57.069> I

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
picture I'm resizing I'm rotating now I

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.520 
picture I'm resizing I'm rotating now I
can<00:02:57.459> manage<00:02:57.850> move<00:02:58.390> around<00:02:58.690> as<00:02:59.019> you<00:02:59.200> can<00:02:59.350> see

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
can manage move around as you can see

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.340 
can manage move around as you can see
with<00:02:59.650> my<00:02:59.890> hands<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.400> think<00:03:01.299> there's<00:03:01.630> the

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
with my hands so I think there's the

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.960 
with my hands so I think there's the
creativity<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:03.190> how<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.519> use<00:03:03.790> this

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
creativity of how to use this

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.449 
creativity of how to use this
multi-touch<00:03:04.510> technology<00:03:04.720> is<00:03:05.620> still<00:03:06.040> untapped

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.430 
multi-touch technology is still untapped
in<00:03:06.850> terms<00:03:07.150> of<00:03:07.330> how<00:03:07.510> people<00:03:07.569> might<00:03:07.959> use<00:03:08.019> this

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
in terms of how people might use this

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.930 
in terms of how people might use this
and<00:03:08.709> I<00:03:09.069> think<00:03:09.280> it's<00:03:09.370> going<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.549> be<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.730> great

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
and I think it's going to be a great
