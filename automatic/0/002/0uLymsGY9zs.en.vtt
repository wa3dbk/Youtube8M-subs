00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.870
 site assembly with after point with dot 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.670
 br 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.349
 in this video lesson or are you explaining 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.809
 How do you remove the background of the image? 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:18.900
 using the fantastic tool 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:22.020
 medical team is for those who like 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.740
 working with ad is too much in general 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.410
 often one of the corners challenge for 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.900
 is to avoid making the assembly pretty cool with 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.969
 your photos and remove the wallpaper from the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.420
 image to be replaced either by a 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.570
 texture a natural and serbian landscape 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.030
 often we need to use the 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.980
 photoshop to remove the background but I 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.190
 I discovered this tool 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.449

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.339
