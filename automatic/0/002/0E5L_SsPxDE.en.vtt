and then get spun back through the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.500 
and then get spun back through the
machine<00:01:05.640> where<00:01:05.940> it's<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.240> meet<00:01:06.390> the

machine where it's going to meet the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.510 
machine where it's going to meet the
backing

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.219 

this<00:01:09.759> is<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:09.939> back<00:01:10.180> side<00:01:10.210> of<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.659> calendar<00:01:11.109> is

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
this is the back side of the calendar is

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.440 
this is the back side of the calendar is
they<00:01:11.380> can<00:01:11.530> see<00:01:11.710> at<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.490> top<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.909> ribbon<00:01:13.240> comes

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
they can see at the top the ribbon comes

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.130 
they can see at the top the ribbon comes
down<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.799> gets<00:01:14.950> spread<00:01:15.399> into<00:01:15.700> a<00:01:15.729> fill<00:01:16.149> which

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
down and gets spread into a fill which

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.980 
down and gets spread into a fill which
is<00:01:17.320> right<00:01:17.560> there<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:18.219> then<00:01:18.939> get<00:01:19.090> fuse<00:01:19.570> and

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
is right there and then get fuse and

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.050 
is right there and then get fuse and
gets<00:01:20.170> fused<00:01:20.530> right<00:01:20.979> back<00:01:21.250> onto<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.759> backing

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
gets fused right back onto the backing

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.740 
gets fused right back onto the backing
which<00:01:22.990> is<00:01:23.140> this<00:01:23.259> white<00:01:23.530> thing<00:01:23.560> coming<00:01:24.130> through

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
which is this white thing coming through

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.100 
which is this white thing coming through
backing<00:01:25.750> and<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.700> PVC<00:01:27.700> get<00:01:28.360> fused<00:01:28.810> together

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
backing and the PVC get fused together

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.920 
backing and the PVC get fused together
through<00:01:29.679> the<00:01:29.770> calendaring<00:01:30.340> process

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.440 

so<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.110> third<00:01:34.350> stage<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.740> then<00:01:35.190> basically<00:01:35.850> as

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
so the third stage is then basically as

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.550 
so the third stage is then basically as
it<00:01:37.440> got<00:01:37.560> fused<00:01:37.950> over<00:01:38.460> there<00:01:38.670> together

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
it got fused over there together

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.100 
it got fused over there together
those<00:01:40.560> were<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.860> two<00:01:41.040> parts<00:01:41.370> where<00:01:41.550> they<00:01:41.670> met

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
those were the two parts where they met

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.660 
those were the two parts where they met
here<00:01:43.110> comes<00:01:43.410> the<00:01:43.620> clean<00:01:43.920> sheet<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:45.200> PVC<00:01:46.200> vinyl

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
here comes the clean sheet of PVC vinyl

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.160 
here comes the clean sheet of PVC vinyl
and<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.880> gets<00:01:48.060> cooled<00:01:48.420> down<00:01:48.690> through<00:01:49.080> these

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
and it gets cooled down through these

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.539 
and it gets cooled down through these
cooling<00:01:49.530> rollers

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.609 

and<00:01:54.090> gets<00:01:54.270> wound<00:01:54.539> up<00:01:54.810> through<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.109> backside

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
and gets wound up through the backside

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.459 
and gets wound up through the backside
here<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:57.380> then<00:01:58.380> after<00:01:58.679> this<00:01:58.799> it'll<00:01:59.130> go<00:02:00.469> to

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
here and then after this it'll go to

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.050 
here and then after this it'll go to
this<00:02:01.590> next<00:02:01.799> station<00:02:02.310> which<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.759> embossing

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
this next station which is the embossing

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.750 
this next station which is the embossing
station
