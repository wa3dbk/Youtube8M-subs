00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.069
 the conference was held in milan today 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.349
 print presentation of the day 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.389
 national parkinson who will come 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.190
 celebrated on November 30th for the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.299
 fifth consecutive year on the whole 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.070
 National territory 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.960
 on this occasion we make the point 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.210
 on parkinson's disease with the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.710
 professor giovanni abruzzese director 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.600
 of the neurological clinic two 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.880
 responsible for the parkinson center 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.279
 of the University of Genoa and President 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.869
 of the lim for the Italian league for the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.170
 fight against parkinson syndromes 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.670
 extrapyramidal and dementia professor 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.739
 Abruzzese can give us a framework 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.710
 general condition of parkinson's disease 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.760
 if therefore a degenerative disease of the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.219
 nervous system 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.899
 therefore it is due to a process that 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.140
 affects some regions of ours 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.879
 brain that classically 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.829
 identified is the famous black substance 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.620
 on whose degeneration depend 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.780
 basically the motor symptoms though 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.670
 the acquisition of the last ten 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.219
 years and that actually to the process more 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.680
 widespread, which therefore also affects others 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.479
 brain areas from which also the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.189
 appearance of so-called symptoms in the 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.979
 engines that can sometimes even 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.500
 precede the mother diagnosis of 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.850
 disease and the appearance of motor ones 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.619
 how old is this disease in 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.330
 Our country therefore goes to 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.340
 prevalence and incidence of the disease 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.740
 they are essentially identical in all 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.259
 the world so there is a rate of 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.820
 prevalence therefore the number of cases in 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.170
 a country at a given time 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.430
 historical is about between the 250 250 cases 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.430
 every 100,000 inhabitants 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.680
 so there are around 230 blacks in Italy 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.650
 thousand patients suffering from the disease 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.810
 what are the causes is this honestly 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.689
 a question that is difficult to answer 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.200
 because they are probably more than one in the 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.399
 sense that to the disease probably 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.920
 contribute both of type factors 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.009
 genetic in the sense of a 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.960
 predisposition our ct bilic and then 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.880
 probably of the vice type factors 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.620
 environmental toxic for that with i 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.380
 subjects have lesser ability to 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.970
 detoxify toxic elements that 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.070
 that no environment and therefore in 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.240
 based on this predisposition they develop 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.970
 then the disease 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.740
 what are the main symptoms then 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.240
 as I said before the diagnosis is 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.980
 basically it is based on 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.320
 recognition of motor symptoms e 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.240
 then the classic symptoms and on their own 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.610
 movement orientation to slowness 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.860
 of the rigidity movement of the 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.260
 muscles and possibly the tremor that 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.720
 however, it is only present in about two thirds 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.980
 of patients and then also in one 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.670
 progressive impairment 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.740
 balance 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.960
 these are the classic motor symptoms 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.730
 those on the basis of which they are formulated 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.020
 diagnosis 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.700
 here a study will be presented to him 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.160
 on the analysis of the prevention of falls 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.870
 in patients on parkinson's he talks about it 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.580
 yes because this is one of the most problems 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.380
 big in regards to 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.200
 let's say patient quality of life 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.900
 I was saying before that there is a problem with 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.310
 the balance deficit becomes worse 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.300
 progressively over the course of 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.500
 disease 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.760
 therefore patients because they are six years old 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.010
 tend to fall much more 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.350
 frequently of non-subjects 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.450
 parkinsonians of the same age and 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.430
 obviously the falls make up of one 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.300
 series of fracture problems 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.340
 then hospitalization or let's say 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.010
 insulation at home so also costs 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.050
 important for the social service for 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.090
 the health service or even 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.400
 psychological problems the fear of 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.530
 fall that automatically makes it 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.360
 these sides much weight patients 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.730
 factors that are responsible for 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.350
 falls have not even come yet 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.120
 because there have been studies and 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.070
 merano all the studies we say about gods 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.490
 very small samples and with drawings 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.230
 we don't always say adequate so 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.090
 what we decided to do was to 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.990
 do a study on a large sample of 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.090
 patients 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.430
 we expect to roll around 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.190
 thousand patient who has a large number 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.040
 with an extensive battery of evaluations 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.470
 instrumental and diagnostic clinics and 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.390
 with the rating scales e 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.340
 the goal with your own try to 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.620
 highlight what the factors are 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.080
 predispose to the risk of falling into 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.010
 Parkinsonian patients already study it 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.390
 started 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.239
 at the present time they have been disbursed 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.910
 about 500 patients so we are halfway through 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.769
 road and also a number of checks 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.989
 because obviously it is also my role 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.450
 checks not because the signals 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.660
 so we trust by spring 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.800
 2014 having completed the study and by 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.379
 to be able to switch to 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.780
 Data analysis today was presented 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:29.740
 the national parkinson observatory of 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.840
 what is it? 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.659
 with this initiative an initiative 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.789
 new that wants to present this 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:40.210
 observatory that basically a 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:42.030
 open web portal we tell everyone the 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.860
 frying patients or their families 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.190
 with the primary goal of succeeding 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.960
 have reliable information 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.909
 certified by scientific societies e 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.370
 we also hope from the higher institute 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:57.129
 of health but also open to doctors for 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.219
 of course have updates on 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:01.870
 new therapies on new procedures 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:03.729
 finally diagnose the goal more 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.710
 important with us we think with this 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.719
 observatory to be able to collect also 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.270
 a very important data 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:12.129
 epidemiological that is missing and which would be 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.139
 very useful to the regions for the canvas 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:17.050
 then program the intervention lines 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.259
 of these therapeutic dynastic plans 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.259
 regional
