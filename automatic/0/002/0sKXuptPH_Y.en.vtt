 product for sale this is the part 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.720
 more important for your product to be 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.270
 band they have to learn to sell it like this 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.190
 that here comes a quick lesson from 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.560
 how they should make good sales 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.080

 we have created then we are already 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.440
 On the other hand step number 2 is very 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.730
 important they have to choose the public 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.730
 who will sell 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.309
 do not 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:10.379
 the third step is very important have 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:13.579
 than give a speech that convinces your 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.579
