00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.960
 two regulars from league 1 who 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.980
 does not exploit all their potential this 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.359
 season 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.039
 the Trojans have achieved a beautiful course 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.000
 in league cup and since they have 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.619

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.840
 efforts that may pay in 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:31.029
 championship while nancy and loses little 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.029
 but concedes too many draws 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.809
 the trojans at home plays one of 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.610
 their last cards for the climb 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.019
 even if it is Lorraine who will 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.050
 create the first opportunity in this 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.190
 recon party is completely 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.050
 destabilized by jeff louis who center 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.329
 at the far post but benjamin jeannot 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.980
 do not fit jeff louis again him 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.590
 retrieves this time he decides to 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.770
 try your luck alone without success 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.090
 and on this corner françois bellugou deviated 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.369
 at the first post benjamin jeannot 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.990
 concludes it's played very well except that 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.220
 it's not in the right box a goal 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.289
 against his side for the center forward 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.899
 nanceand the Trojans 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:15.950
 he has by the corner hit by fahid ben 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.810
 khalfallah did not do much 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.179
 on this action that allows them 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:26.179
 yet in the game stops to open 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:28.940
 score 1-0 at the break pablo correa 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:30.979
 the Lorraine coach is not satisfied 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.090
 of the first period 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.090
 issued by his team 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.310
 and in the second period the Lorraine go 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.780
 start walking back to the floor by creating yourself 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.810
 a first opportunity by 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.460
 the intermediary of benjamin jeannot he 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.270
 wins his duel against rincon 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:54.090
 he is ahead of mathieu dreyer but his 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.090
 balloon file right next to the Trojan goal 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.610
 an action he really 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.710
 provoke alone by winning his duel and in 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.870
 striking with the left foot 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.220
 unfortunately without new success 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.780
 opportunity for Lorraine with karaboué 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.920
 who shifts the shot is countered that 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.650
 return to jeff louis the keystroke 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.580
 sudden and the volleying no 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.580
 framed for Haitians 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.190
 the Trojans who are going to create again 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.510
 an opportunity with benjamin nivet to 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.640
 the entrance to the playing surface in 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.250
 triangle and ended with jimmy 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.950
 chabot second goal of the season for the 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.420
 young striker jimmy cabot served well 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.860
 by corentin people jamie cabot who was coming 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.440
 just coming into play instead 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.700
 of fahid ben khalfallah and who cheats 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.670
 paul tuesday for second goal trojan 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.739
 and if the first goal results above all 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.200
 an error of defense lorraine 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.920
 this second achievement and especially 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.350
 a superb Trojan action and it's not 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.640
 finished since in the game stops 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.739
 new opportunity for 10th cabot 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.050
 this time again served 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.470
 by corentin jean sees his shot go 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:12.040
 right next to paul nardi's goal without 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.810
 therefore the estac is required 2 to 0 and 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.580
 flips back into the first 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.950
 part of the ranking while the 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.489
 nancials miss a great opportunity to 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.489
 get closer to the podium
