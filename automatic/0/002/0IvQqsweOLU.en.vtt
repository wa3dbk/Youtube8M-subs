a<00:00:15.750> little<00:00:16.560> tricky<00:00:16.880> it's<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.000> hardest<00:00:18.270> part<00:00:18.390> I

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
a little tricky it's the hardest part I

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.470 
a little tricky it's the hardest part I
can't<00:00:20.160> even<00:00:20.280> explain<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.700> to<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.060> other<00:00:21.420> than

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
can't even explain it to you other than

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.410 
can't even explain it to you other than
go<00:00:21.840> like<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.080> go<00:00:22.230> like<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.760> all<00:00:23.760> right<00:00:23.820> now

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
go like this go like this all right now

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.679 
go like this go like this all right now
is<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.140> easy<00:00:25.349> part<00:00:26.060> because<00:00:27.060> we<00:00:27.300> know<00:00:27.450> how<00:00:27.630> to

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
is the easy part because we know how to

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.030 
is the easy part because we know how to
braid<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.170> direction<00:00:29.990> so<00:00:30.990> just<00:00:31.500> continue

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
braid in this direction so just continue

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.300 
braid in this direction so just continue
only<00:00:32.759> adding<00:00:33.480> hair<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.140> outside<00:00:35.510> and

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:37.310 
only adding hair to the outside and

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.500 
only adding hair to the outside and
point<00:00:38.310> it<00:00:38.460> as<00:00:38.670> tight<00:00:38.970> as<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.180> can

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
point it as tight as you can

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.580 
point it as tight as you can
I<00:00:41.300> know<00:00:42.300> my<00:00:42.540> bangs<00:00:42.750> look<00:00:43.020> interesting<00:00:43.500> in

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
I know my bangs look interesting in

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.210 
I know my bangs look interesting in
front<00:00:43.860> but<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:46.260> nice<00:00:46.410> thing<00:00:46.590> about<00:00:46.620> bangs<00:00:47.010> is

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
front but the nice thing about bangs is

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.960 
front but the nice thing about bangs is
they<00:00:47.370> puff<00:00:47.579> out<00:00:47.730> easily<00:00:49.550> next<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:53.790> just

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
they puff out easily next and we just

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.230 
they puff out easily next and we just
continue<00:00:54.390> braiding<00:00:57.830> down<00:00:58.830> the<00:00:59.070> back<00:00:59.220> over<00:00:59.940> our

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
continue braiding down the back over our

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:08.340 
continue braiding down the back over our
head

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:20.190 

with<00:01:09.010> the<00:01:09.280> usual<00:01:09.700> hand<00:01:10.270> holds<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:19.810> only

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
with the usual hand holds but only

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:30.600 
with the usual hand holds but only
adding<00:01:20.620> hair<00:01:20.830> to<00:01:21.270> one<00:01:22.270> side<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:25.180> outside<00:01:29.610> I'm

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
adding hair to one side the outside I'm

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.440 
adding hair to one side the outside I'm
hoping<00:01:30.940> you<00:01:31.060> can<00:01:31.090> still<00:01:31.479> see<00:01:33.090> without<00:01:34.090> we<00:01:34.270> turn

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
hoping you can still see without we turn

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.530 
hoping you can still see without we turn
it<00:01:34.570> around<00:01:34.630> because<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:36.670> is<00:01:36.729> one<00:01:37.060> braid<00:01:37.300> I<00:01:37.330> do

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
it around because this is one braid I do

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:49.340 
it around because this is one braid I do
need<00:01:37.810> here<00:01:38.290> for<00:01:40.140> okay<00:01:41.140> how<00:01:41.470> much<00:01:41.619> we<00:01:41.830> got<00:01:41.950> left

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.130 

since<00:01:49.980> we<00:01:50.130> only<00:01:50.280> break<00:01:50.520> from<00:01:50.790> one<00:01:51.180> side<00:01:51.540> your

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
since we only break from one side your

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.149 
since we only break from one side your
hair<00:01:52.500> will<00:01:52.740> actually<00:01:53.030> automatically<00:01:54.830> go<00:01:55.830> in<00:01:56.070> a

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
hair will actually automatically go in a

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.200 
hair will actually automatically go in a
circle<00:01:57.410> for<00:01:58.410> some<00:01:58.920> reason<00:01:59.370> I'm<00:01:59.640> not<00:01:59.700> exactly

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
circle for some reason I'm not exactly

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:24.930 
circle for some reason I'm not exactly
sure<00:02:00.420> why<00:02:06.680> two<00:02:07.680> more

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.930 

make<00:02:25.510> sure<00:02:25.690> you<00:02:25.810> I'm<00:02:26.080> still<00:02:26.410> in<00:02:26.530> frame<00:02:26.770> and<00:02:27.760> our

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
make sure you I'm still in frame and our

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:42.220 
make sure you I'm still in frame and our
last<00:02:28.210> piece<00:02:30.270> all<00:02:31.270> right

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.809 

and<00:02:42.830> I<00:02:42.920> know<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.190> can<00:02:43.310> probably<00:02:43.490> hear<00:02:43.760> some

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
and I know you can probably hear some

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.460 
and I know you can probably hear some
snapping<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:44.630> breaking<00:02:45.050> that<00:02:45.950> is<00:02:45.980> my<00:02:46.459> hair

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
snapping and breaking that is my hair

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.330 
snapping and breaking that is my hair
I'm<00:02:48.470> not<00:02:48.770> particularly<00:02:49.459> care<00:02:49.880> for<00:02:51.340> hairdos

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
I'm not particularly care for hairdos

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.680 
I'm not particularly care for hairdos
they<00:02:52.780> have<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.810> tendency<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.580> snap<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:56.060> break

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
they have a tendency to snap and break

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.500 
they have a tendency to snap and break
my<00:02:57.020> hair<00:02:57.290> which<00:02:58.130> is<00:02:58.310> yet<00:02:58.520> another<00:02:58.700> reason

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
my hair which is yet another reason

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.559 
my hair which is yet another reason
flip<00:03:00.319> it<00:03:00.440> over<00:03:00.500> your<00:03:00.739> right<00:03:00.890> shoulder<00:03:00.920> just

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
flip it over your right shoulder just

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.750 
flip it over your right shoulder just
yet<00:03:02.569> another<00:03:02.810> reason<00:03:03.050> why<00:03:03.350> I<00:03:03.620> will<00:03:03.709> never<00:03:04.430> do

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
yet another reason why I will never do

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.370 
yet another reason why I will never do
this<00:03:05.720> hairdo<00:03:05.989> again<00:03:06.580> okay<00:03:07.580> so<00:03:08.540> when<00:03:09.019> you<00:03:09.110> braid

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
this hairdo again okay so when you braid

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.900 
this hairdo again okay so when you braid
you<00:03:09.650> want<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.860> end<00:03:10.010> up<00:03:10.160> braiding<00:03:10.519> over<00:03:10.790> the

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
you want to end up braiding over the

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.089 
you want to end up braiding over the
shoulder<00:03:11.269> of<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.599> side<00:03:11.780> you<00:03:11.989> started<00:03:12.380> on<00:03:12.500> so

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
shoulder of the side you started on so

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.120 
shoulder of the side you started on so
that<00:03:13.280> you've<00:03:13.459> got<00:03:13.489> a<00:03:13.970> round<00:03:14.959> kind<00:03:15.680> of<00:03:15.800> effect

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
that you've got a round kind of effect

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.490 
that you've got a round kind of effect
going<00:03:16.340> on<00:03:16.840> now<00:03:17.840> I<00:03:17.870> know<00:03:18.050> what<00:03:18.170> you're<00:03:18.290> saying

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
going on now I know what you're saying

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.949 
going on now I know what you're saying
and<00:03:18.709> you're<00:03:18.830> saying<00:03:19.360> torn<00:03:20.360> doesn't<00:03:20.780> really

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
and you're saying torn doesn't really

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.400 
and you're saying torn doesn't really
look<00:03:21.170> much<00:03:21.650> like<00:03:21.890> a<00:03:21.950> crown<00:03:22.250> braid<00:03:22.959> that's<00:03:23.959> I

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
look much like a crown braid that's I

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.590 
look much like a crown braid that's I
don't<00:03:24.890> know<00:03:25.069> what<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.400> is<00:03:25.580> don't<00:03:26.120> worry<00:03:26.360> it's

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
don't know what that is don't worry it's

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.759 
don't know what that is don't worry it's
all<00:03:26.750> on<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:26.959> finishing<00:03:28.600> now<00:03:29.600> I<00:03:29.630> know<00:03:30.019> like<00:03:30.620> I

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
all on the finishing now I know like I

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.650 
all on the finishing now I know like I
said<00:03:30.830> you've<00:03:31.220> seen<00:03:31.250> sites<00:03:31.700> like<00:03:31.970> Dreamweaver

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
said you've seen sites like Dreamweaver

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.900 
said you've seen sites like Dreamweaver
braiding<00:03:33.049> which<00:03:33.230> we've<00:03:33.440> all<00:03:33.709> seen<00:03:34.069> and<00:03:34.340> my

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
braiding which we've all seen and my

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.900 
braiding which we've all seen and my
gosh<00:03:35.209> they<00:03:35.510> do<00:03:35.569> some<00:03:35.810> pretty<00:03:35.840> hair<00:03:36.610> but<00:03:37.610> I

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
gosh they do some pretty hair but I

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
gosh they do some pretty hair but I
argue<00:03:38.480> that<00:03:38.510> that's<00:03:38.840> because<00:03:39.910> somebody<00:03:40.930> has

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
argue that that's because somebody has

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.690 
argue that that's because somebody has
done<00:03:42.500> their<00:03:42.709> hair<00:03:42.950> they<00:03:43.370> didn't<00:03:43.610> do<00:03:43.670> it

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
done their hair they didn't do it

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.250 
done their hair they didn't do it
themselves<00:03:44.739> because<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:46.010> self<00:03:46.280> crown<00:03:46.549> braid

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
themselves because the self crown braid

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.770 
themselves because the self crown braid
is<00:03:48.260> difficult<00:03:48.769> since<00:03:49.180> you<00:03:50.180> know<00:03:50.299> you<00:03:50.540> can't
