00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.730
 today we are going to make it villas of 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.990
 cheese and sobrasada and we need these 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.120
 ingredients 4 wheat tortillas 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:16.420
 sobrasada to taste six or more slices of 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.210
 ground pepper cheese and olive oil 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.430
 The first thing we are going to do is anoint 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.550
 a generous layer of sobrasada in two 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.220
 wheat tortillas 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.410
 we must try not to reach the edges 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.750
 and leave a small margin of a 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.399
 centimeter to avoid 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.040
 we leave when it comes to toast 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.410
 quesadillas to better extend the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.020
 Sobrasada is recommended to remove it from 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.330
 refrigerator a while before 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.480
 when we have the sobrasada anointed 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.830
 we cover with the slices of cheese 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.320
 trying not to leave the edges 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.470
 the quantity depends on the taste of each 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.110
 one we have put in each one 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.090
 three slices of cheese type agar but 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.890
 you can use our favorite cheese 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.890
 as long as it is well founded 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.520
 then let's take a little 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.350
 freshly ground pepper optionally if 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.630
 we want to give a sweet touch to our 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.030
 quesadillas we can add a jet 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.640
 of honey we cover with the other two 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.670
 wheat tortillas and now let's move on 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.950
 to toast 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.229
 in a pan we take a splash of 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.090
 olive oil and heat to fire 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.860
 medium the moment it is hot 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.860
 we take one of the quesadillas 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.330
 when we see that the bottom part is 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.590
 slightly golden brown we turn it 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.590
 with a quick movement 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.420
 We wait for the other one to be done 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.270
 face and we can take it out 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.189
 we do the same with the other we let 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.530
 temper in a little and they would be ready 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.930
 to eat these quesadillas are 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.330
 delicious and the mixture of sobrasada 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.810
 with cheese pepper and tortillas 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.850
 of wheat is spectacular we encourage you to 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.250
 that you try them although we noticed 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.320
 which is a calorie bomb if it has 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.600
 liked this recipe do not forget to give 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.539

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.580

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.819
 next
