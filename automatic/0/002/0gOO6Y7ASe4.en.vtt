they're<00:01:50.070> not<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.579> expensive<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.960> ring

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
they're not that expensive it's a ring

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.139 
they're not that expensive it's a ring
compressor<00:01:52.610> maybe<00:01:53.610> some<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.909> might<00:01:54.060> be

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
compressor maybe some of you might be

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.249 
compressor maybe some of you might be
familiar<00:01:54.299> with<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> ones<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.049> ratchet

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
familiar with the ones that you ratchet

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.440 
familiar with the ones that you ratchet
down<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.860> compress<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> springs<00:01:56.610> down<00:01:56.850> but

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
down and compress the springs down but

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.600 
down and compress the springs down but
this<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.719> actually<00:01:57.869> way<00:01:58.229> simpler<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:59.430> buy

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
this is actually way simpler you buy

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.740 
this is actually way simpler you buy
them<00:01:59.729> for<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.030> particular<00:02:00.270> board<00:02:00.630> they're

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
them for the particular board they're

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.539 
them for the particular board they're
using<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.229> particular<00:02:01.380> block<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.040> an<00:02:02.159> 87

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
using this particular block is an 87

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.160 
using this particular block is an 87
millimeter<00:02:02.820> bore<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.780> what<00:02:03.930> we<00:02:04.020> will

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
millimeter bore so this is what we will

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.630 
millimeter bore so this is what we will
use<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.530> install<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.040> Pistons<00:02:05.399> into<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
use to install the Pistons into the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.910 
use to install the Pistons into the
block<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.570> now<00:02:06.719> we'll<00:02:06.869> set<00:02:07.049> our<00:02:07.259> ring

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
block so now we'll set our ring

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.699 
block so now we'll set our ring
orientation<00:02:09.110> now<00:02:10.110> when<00:02:10.289> you're<00:02:10.410> pushing

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
orientation now when you're pushing

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.720 
orientation now when you're pushing
these<00:02:10.830> down<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.009> want<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.280> make<00:02:11.400> sure<00:02:11.430> that

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
these down you want to make sure that

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.760 
these down you want to make sure that
the<00:02:11.849> rod<00:02:12.080> doesn't<00:02:13.080> hit<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
the rod doesn't hit the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.290 
the rod doesn't hit the
counterweight<00:02:14.430> because<00:02:14.820> if<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.030> hits<00:02:15.180> the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
counterweight because if it hits the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.340 
counterweight because if it hits the
counterweight<00:02:15.750> then<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:16.020> won't<00:02:16.110> go<00:02:16.320> in

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
counterweight then it won't go in

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.800 
counterweight then it won't go in
correctly<00:02:16.950> we're<00:02:17.910> now<00:02:17.970> ready<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.270> install<00:02:18.480> our

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
RTV gasket sealant added a little bit of

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.070 
RTV gasket sealant added a little bit of
lubrication<00:02:23.520> of<00:02:23.970> oil<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.480> it'll<00:02:24.690> slide<00:02:24.810> over

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
lubrication of oil so it'll slide over

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.750 
lubrication of oil so it'll slide over
