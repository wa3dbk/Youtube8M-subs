but<00:05:14.080> yeah<00:05:14.170> I<00:05:14.200> think<00:05:14.350> it's<00:05:14.530> really<00:05:14.650> cool<00:05:14.890> to

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
but yeah I think it's really cool to

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.070 
but yeah I think it's really cool to
paint<00:05:15.280> jobs<00:05:15.550> how<00:05:15.700> they<00:05:15.850> how<00:05:16.510> they<00:05:16.540> added<00:05:16.930> that

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
paint jobs how they how they added that

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.060 
paint jobs how they how they added that
in<00:05:17.260> that's<00:05:17.440> really<00:05:18.160> cool<00:05:18.490> it's<00:05:18.700> different<00:05:19.150> and

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
in that's really cool it's different and

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.320 
in that's really cool it's different and
to<00:05:21.070> be<00:05:21.160> honest<00:05:21.430> out<00:05:21.610> of<00:05:21.820> all<00:05:21.970> of<00:05:22.000> them<00:05:22.270> I

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
to be honest out of all of them I

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.740 
to be honest out of all of them I
probably<00:05:22.570> would<00:05:22.810> rather<00:05:23.140> just<00:05:23.440> have<00:05:23.590> the<00:05:23.740> van

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750
