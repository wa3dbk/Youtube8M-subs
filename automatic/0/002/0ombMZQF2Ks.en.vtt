00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
on here didn't have a spine this runs

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.560 
on here didn't have a spine this runs
down<00:03:38.080> half<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.410> handle<00:03:39.030> it's<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.120> one-piece

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
down half the handle it's a one-piece

construction<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:43.239> can<00:03:43.330> see<00:03:43.600> that<00:03:43.750> guess<00:03:44.320> it

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
construction you can see that guess it

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.430 
construction you can see that guess it
acts<00:03:44.620> as<00:03:44.769> a<00:03:44.800> block<00:03:45.100> spacer<00:03:45.580> also<00:03:45.970> but<00:03:46.720> that's

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
acts as a block spacer also but that's

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.840 
acts as a block spacer also but that's
the<00:03:47.530> difference<00:03:47.769> between<00:03:47.860> a<00:03:47.980> cheap<00:03:48.250> around<00:03:48.610> it

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
the difference between a cheap around it

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.270 
the difference between a cheap around it
and<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.120> you<00:03:49.480> know<00:03:49.600> well-built<00:03:50.280> high-end
