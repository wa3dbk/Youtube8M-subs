00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.700
 from my body is a dye to a 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.909
 dye I stained yesterday with 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.759
 I put lemon in it 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.920
 nail polish remover nothing comes to me 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.259

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.999
 I'm in these conditions 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.649
 I hope in the photos at least to succeed in 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:25.060
 disguise a little with iphoto I don't have 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.619
 not even photoshop so let alone 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.909
 what can come out of it 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.439
 oh well anyway I'm talking a little 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.799
 too much I leave you to the tutorial a kiss 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.799
 Hello 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.610
 start by applying a basic pass 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.890
 on everything 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.840
 I'm using the base here 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.850
 collistar that performs various functions 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.430
 which then have in art bass with a polish 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.410
 white this is pupa and I spread it 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.760
 single color only on the long annular of 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.790
 every hand 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.010
 I then take this and 704 black glaze 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.470
 of pupa lasting color and I always spread it 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.940
 monochrome on all other nails are 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.680
 left alone at home so I can 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.420
 talk without having to go and register 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.460
 then the item above at this point then 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.960
 once the polish dry 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.700
 I take a buffer with the grain 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.740
 the very soft ones you need 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:15.040
 for the natural nail and go slightly 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:16.840
 to dull this white nail 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.670
 point when the black Greek painting me 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.380
 I use a small brush like this but from 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.380
 make in bloom 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.040
 which of each one is smaller 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.910
 at this point all that remains is to apply 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.440
 the top cooked but only when painting 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.680
 criticism will be dry I go to 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.680
 use of the absence studies line 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.460
 however with this it is everything I hope 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.930
 so there is received rai and leave you 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.930
 to the photos a kiss hello
