00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
 that's how and when was created between the hours 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.780
 cellular April 3 of the year 73 eye looks 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.269
 they created a cell phone 73 but for 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.620
 create an interconnected network so that you 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.509
 meat on the street 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.400
 they had antennas that will communicate you with 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.840
 phone was not until the year 1984 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.330
 where the first motorbike was made 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.750
 the first call made from 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.970
 mobile phone not connected not with disk 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.520
 obviously because although the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.770
 73 needs to have a whole network of 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.050
 communication that will work attention 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.140
 this was the creation of the mobile phone 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.149
 cell phone before having phones 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.309
 completely mobile we had phones 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.520
 of car and telephones that operated 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.010
 with giant batteries I was one that 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.110
 had one of the first cell phones there was 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.030
 that carrying the battery was a briefcase and 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.039
 you had to upload an antenna like that and 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.100
 you looked like a platoon commander in 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.050
 vietnam no longer the portable mobile phone 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.040
 was originally invented by a 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.690
 motorola team in 1973 but it would take 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.770
 ten more years to launch 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:15.060
 in the commercial service we had to 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.830
 create a vision of the future you imagine was 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.020
 a phone that you could load all the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.490
 time the first users were 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.680
 exercised every time they used the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.450
 phone could have been portable 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.880
 but they did not easily enter the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.130
 nobody's pocket 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.530
 the cell phones of the early 80s 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.200
 allowed 30 minutes of calls and 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.780
 they cost $ 4000 that would be like 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.049
 nine thousand dollars our days but that 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.270
 well in reality besides making calls 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:45.270
 they had no memory you had to mark the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.460
 number each time of the first set because only 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.039
 you could make calls nothing more and 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.229
 receive calls in the early 80's 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.700
 only a few chosen ones could afford 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.009
 an article like this 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.460
 the only ones who had them were the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.640
 presidents and rich children 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.369

 called clear and could receive and give 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.170

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.819
 When I called you, there are no numbers 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.620

 when these were given they cost in these 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.500
 15 million 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.500

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.549

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.230
 and he called me he called me and it started to ring 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.609

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.230

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.650
 they understood they take out a brick the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.650

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.590

 use of these sandra cell phones 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.489
 and they ended up obviously reaching
