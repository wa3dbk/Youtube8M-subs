00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.220

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.040
 then comment in but try 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.370
 that it would have a lot of humor in it too 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.870
 stop 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.309
 where today it does not go for a while 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.379
 succeed and I will explain why my 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.420
 father they went sick for a while so 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.949
 with car new so with things arranged 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.359
 there comes the family I go in the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.070
 evening away but now I help for a moment 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.090
 my stepmother because my father is sick 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.320
 is who has 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.099
 I went to the hospital this afternoon 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.420
 so it's pretty serious 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.160
 so thats why desk to it and jan 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.690
 hurriedly because it is now 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.820
 of course the day 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.670
 the last day of 2012 and I like it 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.100
 an honor to be the last day of 2012 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.379
 upload on letters and to this bike rod 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.870
 it just in the one month less than 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.690
 one less than the month in which 29 days 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.850
 2000 items has reached range 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.379
 sorry and that is really in c and it is coming 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.789
 can't fail to come to that here 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.629
 here giving away a penalty anyway stores 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.520
 nowhere 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.520
 just dachshund that ball and it is 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.949
 apparently political but steve to the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.420
 has therefore sometimes achieved 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.769
 2000 sips in less than a month and that 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.060
 is really itself if we do that then few months 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.950
 persevere you understand him we really have 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.210
 want within the short time and within 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.590
 five months or so 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.180
 and whoever of 10,000 pieces of course 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.979
 it is not going so fast but hopefully 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.659
 soon we will because we get caught 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.460
 with soon we are with gel stevie 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.689
 that is a dutch networking day 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.400
 lady of the dutch with god someone 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.030
 then one on a course quite handy 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.890
 and such a nice foreknowledge that four tastes 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.360
 possibly in orphan giving away so that 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.130
 we will soon do everything with 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.850
 contracts so that it is handled there 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.360
 I'm working on it 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.900
 and the first thing we can give me 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.000
 know is 12 years or 12 months xbox live 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.320
 profile timon i don't know that we can 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.759
 give it away and that will come 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.750
 soon the video of the 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.070
 screw and not in the comments 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.600
 left to you in the crude 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.430
 idea what it will of course win 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.140
 bit of a shame for nancy playing ps3 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.310
 nothing to it, we also go there 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.220
 what kind of rain because otherwise it would 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.659
 of course to be honest and you like that 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.100
 possibly so soon give away and 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.390
 stuff like that has guys that 4 so 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.790
 more often that 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.950
 that you think they are the pressure than we are 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.720
 give away with their partners and 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.310
 that is naturally super fat and with it 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.180
 money that we receive through a partnership 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.770
 do you know 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.850
 we have often thought about that and 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.289
 so just go there once 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.970
 we can say things there 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.520
 but for those who are unfair 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.930
 because of course we are seven 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.000
 and because the money we earn with it 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.709
 but not ridiculous much is not 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.150
 more than normal because 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.890
 of course upload every day because 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.420
 divided by doing seven beats 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.890
 of course nothing really because then 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.150
 you have nothing with me so with that 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.270
 we will also do verbeek once and for all 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.830
 somewhat stimulate our cono mi and there 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.330
 I look very much from a not only me but 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.940
 everyone because in the new year too 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.870
 do and of course keep all 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.910
 here is just continue we go 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.560
 upload twice a day soon 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.910
 just have to see how do that or there 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.580
 still need people because we are with 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.130
 seven and even me and everyone 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.900
 otherwise always have trouble saying 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.250
 but certain time you upload ready to 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.980
 have around 01:00 i have you busier then 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.800
 another week and everyone is your app 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.510
 young and everyone's favorite thing 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.310
 life is probably postponing 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.840
 and of course it is ours too 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.400
 case 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.989
 I also notice very much about myself 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.220
 so we have to look at that and 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.470
 maybe we have new people 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.010
 let's do the last one all upload 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.049
 and i'm dave and yes that is actually 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.910
 incredibly good in March cumpilation 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.920
 of silver squad are gold squats and 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.209
 won squat sort of squad previews and 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.799
 they will also be running runs soon 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.390
 to be squad use to engage people 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.560
 I myself already have a few squads that I do 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.489
 would like to share with you 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.200
 so that's why it's all faster 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.239
 should go because if you go to one 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.790
 can push a video teachers neighborhood council 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.079
 two videos not to refine 20 but 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.180
 something of March 18 is still well 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.160
 almost double and there really hope 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.829
 a bit on while this gameplay 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.019
 jar that you are going to see now that is 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.310
 really just pure goals I don't know myself 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.079
 agree with how many brothers I have scored 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.820
 but the were a lot 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.410
 I'm not even saying a lot about it 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.280
 because if methyl talks fast it is possible 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.580
 to attempt 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.110
 excuse me sacha 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.120
 I live here who does official tin 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.220
 sixteen-meter area and actually touches like that 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.110
 peaceful and so easily lost and you 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.640
 writes wrong leg at the bottom 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.620
 climb it yourself but it just shoots 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.180
 always very overpowed in the short corner 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.640
 short angle that the 13 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.950
 straw at first post also beeps like animals 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.330
 and if you deny a 14h to 2 0 for that 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.400
 then it is not really good 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.260
 difficult more than the oil thing 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.540
 arkey comes along here en masse 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.470
 Movares with shouts he almost had 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.620
 but he just couldn't quite do it 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.760
 and here again his keeper 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.320
 let's say that ball or 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.390
 of this final show if I bring something and 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.130
 jorge a unique de 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.419
 between the first game on our clubhouse day 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.010
 after i bought it is really one 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.860
 super player so I have it on 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.180
 right winger and emerson on left winger 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.590
 and that is really sick because they are both 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.630
 economists quickly and numbered 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.830
 yes, pretty good shooting and a tram 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.470
 pick up more because I just want that 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.390
 google score is your extra coins and i saw 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.340
 last it could be from someone who said how 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.870
 you're really not good at what you do 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.580
 votes only then also comes from you 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.690
 winning is good but if i meet it 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.450
 play ben 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.220
 and I lead one here and I scored 5 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.960
 one then makes me feel nothing at all 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.850
 he won't come back anyway I want 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.320
 you simply have to stay, you prefer 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.790
 never actually feel sorry for you 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.560
 opponent 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.910
 because he didn't say it either 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.610
 just so I say one more point to him 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.270
 need to study potty theaters than one 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.979
 messages 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.550
 yes you know we will tie it 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.720
 because then I will benefit from it 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.430
 and you too 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.810
 and that he scored in the 90th minute 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.280
 Do you know what makes him win? 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.840
 the kind of thing that happens after him on 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.520
 video games would have nothing 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.289
 here, by the way, beautiful Easter doll lima 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.300
 Only better not learned is that he finished 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.919
 to do with the poli margaery die 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.270
 while in a device not again 6 one 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:33.190
 really in c or seven a shot and yes yes 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.320
 credit to this guest because he is still 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.789
 kept playing because I really would already 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.979
 for a long time because we have placed control 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:40.479
 we so angry me I can already say so 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.100
 often to pressure from the b'lieve because me 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.560
 do not feel like wasting time 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.210
 a jar that does not go through but now 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.620
 don't make magic very much because me 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.789
 play a fair amount online I play at 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.860
 day online more 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.090
 here god you 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.830
 The intention with such a good shot 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.620
 really shock that you can do that as crazy 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.879
 veil from under 1000 cages but me 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.650
 play banana is a lot more online 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:01.110
 it does not have a team changes 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.550
 that it is suitable for because I have come 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.900
 my corentin with players all 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.490
 sold because the market is going soon 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.080
 cash and I've had it so often enough 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.509
 said on videos on my channel 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.509
 vive ldv other people said so 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:13.860
 if you don't know then you do something 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:15.810
 wrong but the players are going soon 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.210
 Amanda comes with the team or created 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.949
 out if it's okay if it wasn't 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.659
 then the idea would be a very weird one 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:23.099
 made a decision but go there 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:24.419
 but assume it will happen 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:25.889
 and a lot of people go and think yes 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.870
 you know i want to buy such a package every 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:29.189
 camp are expensive so get involved than 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.020
 I sell my team I solve some email 

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:32.460
 accelerate cheaply and or buy it and 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.680
 then I can go on 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.509
 and so do 50,000 people and if you do 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.520
 50,000 people each team of eleven players 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:40.080
 shall again be 500,000 players 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.939
 cheap step 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.819
 that's that I mean then becomes very good 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:48.389
 also but guests this was the last video 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:49.889
 on vive and on d of the year 2012 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:51.509
 happy new year careful with 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:52.800
 your fingers do not live version 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:54.300

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.560
