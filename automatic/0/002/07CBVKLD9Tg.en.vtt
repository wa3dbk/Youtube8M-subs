00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 listen to 

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.210
 I was traveling on the train that was going 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.160
 flowers and it was the moment when I 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.690
 I decomposed, well, people threw themselves at me 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.139
 over 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.199
 and more or less in the third car more or 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.900
 less than happened I do not know I felt a strong 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.390
 impact and good the despair the 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.750
 people who shouted the people that were 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.520
 threw on top too so if there was 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.100
 pretty people and how was the time 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:36.129
 get out of the train or do not know a despair 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.129
 I could not breathe all the people 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.449
 pulled over I did not feel bad and 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.050
 I came here by your own means 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:47.050
 yes because I went to work and then 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.700
 I could not stand the pain anymore and I came to 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.300
 Hospital 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.700
 I do not have other reasons in the back and 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.880
 the front part in the fissures that 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.430
 remember I was in precisely the 3rd 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.020
 wagon be wagons dress something in front 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.960
 you got to see the collective follow up 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.270
 see the other train or I did not see anything 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:12.130
 nothing if you listen if the brake 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.950
 Yes Yes Yes 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.140
 of strong impact and desperate people 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.280
 and the desperate people threw themselves on me 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.200
 and then I could not leave this out 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.509
 you went straight to your work, 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.490
 I helped friends who were also friends 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.310
 my partner one of my companions 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.409
 also images that remembered images 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.270
 from that moment of life sica people who 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.679
 it fell on you that you were injured that 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.039
 remember people who fell on me 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:41.289
 because it's the least it came out to the bank like this 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:44.170
 that came on top of everything so 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.479
 it was a very ugly moment not in the part 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.670
 where I was not looking at the seats of the 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.630
 place if they broke the 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.630
 glasses all 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.660
 It was quite full and quite full on 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.640
 train in that wagon the third all 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.680
 they left by their own means 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.680
 and there were firemen who helped 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.070
 people I helped one of my classmates and 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.010
 that's why it was at that moment that I already 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.800
 I decomposed and well I stayed there for a while 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.570
 sitting with her the company and all this 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.130
 the ambulance came in that car was 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.540
 help for the state of shock that I had 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.220
 the people I will help because also 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.200
 they were trapped between the irons not 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.000
 because we were stuck there too 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.600
 I could leave luckily thanks to me 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.600
 can leave
