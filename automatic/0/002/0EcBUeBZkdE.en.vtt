00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
not there are a lot of risks involved in

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.350 
not there are a lot of risks involved in
stretching<00:01:04.890> reconstructed<00:01:05.880> ears<00:01:06.000> because

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
stretching reconstructed ears because

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.140 
stretching reconstructed ears because
obviously<00:01:06.780> then<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.080> was<00:01:07.200> strong<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.850> they're

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
obviously then it was strong and they're

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.330 
obviously then it was strong and they're
just<00:01:09.360> literally<00:01:09.900> scar<00:01:10.170> tissue<00:01:10.500> now<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.950> if<00:01:11.280> I

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
just literally scar tissue now and if I

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.850 
just literally scar tissue now and if I
do<00:01:11.400> decide<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.790> stretch<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.240> will<00:01:12.540> make<00:01:13.020> videos

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
do decide to stretch I will make videos

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.149

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
like updating my stretching process and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.070 
like updating my stretching process and
stuff<00:01:17.369> because<00:01:17.520> one<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.970> people<00:01:18.090> will<00:01:18.540> ask

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
stuff because one of the people will ask

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.969 
stuff because one of the people will ask

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
to explain but I basically cut a chunk

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.889 
to explain but I basically cut a chunk
of<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.820> out<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.119> then<00:01:54.210> stitch<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.659> and

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
of it out and then stitch it up and

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.420 
of it out and then stitch it up and
reattach<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.710> your<00:01:55.890> face<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.250> stuff

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
reattach it to your face and stuff

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.010 
reattach it to your face and stuff
healing<00:01:57.299> they<00:01:57.840> leave<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.200> stitches<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.729> for

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
healing they leave the stitches in for

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.020 
healing they leave the stitches in for
one<00:02:01.020> week<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.500> then<00:02:02.159> after<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.579> went<00:02:02.820> and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
one week and then after that I went and

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.959 
one week and then after that I went and
got<00:02:03.180> them<00:02:03.360> taken<00:02:03.869> out<00:02:04.229> um<00:02:04.770> apparently<00:02:05.700> I

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
got them taken out um apparently I

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:06.770 
got them taken out um apparently I
healed

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
healed

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.979 
healed
oddly<00:02:07.409> fast<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:08.970> don't<00:02:09.450> know<00:02:09.509> if<00:02:09.629> everyone

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
oddly fast so I don't know if everyone

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.600 
oddly fast so I don't know if everyone
else's<00:02:10.319> healing<00:02:10.679> process<00:02:11.099> would<00:02:11.310> be<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.459> same

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
else's healing process would be the same

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.280 
else's healing process would be the same
but<00:02:12.239> after<00:02:12.599> two<00:02:12.840> weeks

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
but after two weeks

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.550 
but after two weeks
it<00:02:14.010> went<00:02:14.549> from<00:02:14.879> like<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.120> big<00:02:15.450> red<00:02:15.720> sort<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.230> scar

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
it went from like a big red sort of scar

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.740 
it went from like a big red sort of scar
to<00:02:16.890> pretty<00:02:17.250> much<00:02:17.459> just<00:02:17.519> skintone<00:02:18.299> like<00:02:18.569> it

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
to pretty much just skintone like it

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.350 
to pretty much just skintone like it
almost<00:02:19.379> just<00:02:19.560> vanished<00:02:20.010> instantly<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.909> now

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
almost just vanished instantly and now

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.199 
almost just vanished instantly and now
it's<00:02:21.750> just<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:22.110> white<00:02:22.349> scar<00:02:22.980> across<00:02:23.430> my<00:02:23.579> earlobe

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209

I<00:02:24.829> really<00:02:25.829> hate<00:02:26.010> talking<00:02:26.220> about<00:02:26.489> this<00:02:26.849> but<00:02:27.269> I

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
I really hate talking about this but I

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.410 
I really hate talking about this but I
figured<00:02:27.870> like<00:02:28.590> if<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.489> make<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.670> video<00:02:30.000> out<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.239> it

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
figured like if I make a video out of it

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.399 
figured like if I make a video out of it
they<00:02:30.510> don't<00:02:30.659> know<00:02:30.750> how<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.870> talk<00:02:31.140> about<00:02:31.170> it

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
they don't know how to talk about it

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.229 
they don't know how to talk about it
again<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.709> can<00:02:31.950> just<00:02:32.129> send<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:32.819> to<00:02:33.000> everyone

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
again I can just send this to everyone

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.970 
again I can just send this to everyone
they<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:33.989> do<00:02:34.230> do<00:02:34.379> it<00:02:34.500> under<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.739> local

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
they you do do it under a local

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.500 
they you do do it under a local
anesthetic<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.760> can't<00:02:36.000> feel<00:02:36.269> anything

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
anesthetic so you can't feel anything

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.300 
anesthetic so you can't feel anything
but<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.019> disgusting<00:02:37.620> part<00:02:37.769> is<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.159> you<00:02:38.280> can

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310

looked after properly and I'd never

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.500 
looked after properly and I'd never
suggest<00:03:02.849> someone<00:03:03.329> to<00:03:04.579> start<00:03:05.579> stretching<00:03:06.030> if

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
suggest someone to start stretching if

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.059 
suggest someone to start stretching if
they<00:03:06.750> don't<00:03:06.930> plan<00:03:07.109> on<00:03:07.170> having<00:03:07.319> them<00:03:07.829> for<00:03:08.010> a

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
they don't plan on having them for a

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.520 
they don't plan on having them for a
very<00:03:08.340> very<00:03:08.700> very<00:03:09.150> long<00:03:09.540> time<00:03:09.780> if<00:03:10.079> not<00:03:10.260> forever

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
very very very long time if not forever

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.610 
very very very long time if not forever
but<00:03:11.010> that's<00:03:11.609> just<00:03:11.849> me<00:03:12.120> like<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.720> think<00:03:13.049> of<00:03:13.409> them

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
but that's just me like I think of them

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.089 
but that's just me like I think of them
as<00:03:13.920> almost<00:03:14.700> as<00:03:15.299> big<00:03:16.200> as<00:03:16.379> commitment<00:03:16.980> as<00:03:17.069> a

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
as almost as big as commitment as a

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.089 
as almost as big as commitment as a
tattoo<00:03:17.430> if<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:18.389> makes<00:03:18.569> any<00:03:18.690> sense<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:19.349> know

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
tattoo if that makes any sense I know

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.800 
tattoo if that makes any sense I know
that<00:03:20.280> sounds<00:03:20.579> very<00:03:20.669> hypocritical<00:03:21.030> since<00:03:21.690> I

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
that sounds very hypocritical since I

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.509 
that sounds very hypocritical since I
had<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.079> get<00:03:22.230> mine<00:03:22.410> stitch<00:03:22.680> sharp<00:03:22.949> but<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.370> was

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
had to get mine stitch sharp but it was

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.879 
had to get mine stitch sharp but it was
more<00:03:23.819> of<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:24.030> health<00:03:24.359> concern<00:03:24.599> rather<00:03:25.500> than<00:03:25.769> an

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
more of a health concern rather than an

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.390 
more of a health concern rather than an
aesthetic<00:03:26.370> concern<00:03:26.910> I<00:03:27.120> had<00:03:28.099> my<00:03:29.099> ears

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
aesthetic concern I had my ears
