accident<00:00:11.940> but<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.509> just<00:00:12.960> thought<00:00:13.110> it<00:00:13.259> was

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
accident but I just thought it was

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.490 
accident but I just thought it was
pretty<00:00:13.559> good<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.340> just<00:00:14.460> put<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:15.000> up<00:00:15.289> at<00:00:16.289> this

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
pretty good so I just put it up at this

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.340 
pretty good so I just put it up at this
point<00:00:17.029> before<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.240> starts<00:00:18.600> I'm<00:00:18.750> not<00:00:18.960> holding

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
point before it starts I'm not holding

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.870 
point before it starts I'm not holding
the<00:00:19.500> controller<00:00:19.920> at<00:00:20.730> any<00:00:20.939> point<00:00:21.949> but<00:00:22.949> now<00:00:23.160> he

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
the controller at any point but now he

match<00:00:24.060> starts<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:25.140> realized<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
match starts and I realized that the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.080 
match starts and I realized that the
matches<00:00:26.039> start<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:26.460> i<00:00:26.490> picked<00:00:26.820> up<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090
