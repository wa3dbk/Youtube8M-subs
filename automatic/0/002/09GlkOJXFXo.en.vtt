00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.670 
directly brings a big chance you might
draw<00:01:47.220> another<00:01:47.899> overcook<00:01:48.899> yourself<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.560> I

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
draw another overcook yourself and I

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.469 
draw another overcook yourself and I

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
would say may become grainy so make sure

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.690 
would say may become grainy so make sure
you<00:01:51.689> have<00:01:51.869> room<00:01:52.049> between<00:01:52.290> those<00:01:52.979> two<00:01:53.159> here

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700
