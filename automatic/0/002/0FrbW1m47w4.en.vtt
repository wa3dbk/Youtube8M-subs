the<00:00:41.850> archer<00:00:42.540> towers<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.170> would<00:00:43.980> recommend<00:00:44.190> of

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the archer towers I would recommend of

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.600 
the archer towers I would recommend of
depending<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:45.930> your<00:00:46.050> level<00:00:46.200> again<00:00:46.710> Archer

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
depending on your level again Archer

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.500 
depending on your level again Archer
towers<00:00:48.000> level<00:00:48.270> seven<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.050> eight<00:00:50.180> to<00:00:51.180> bring<00:00:51.360> it

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
towers level seven and eight to bring it

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.830 
towers level seven and eight to bring it
to<00:00:51.690> level<00:00:51.840> seven<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.800> eight<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.370> really<00:00:53.969> long<00:00:54.480> I

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
to level seven to eight is really long I

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.619 
to level seven to eight is really long I
think<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:55.350> five<00:00:55.739> days<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.149> if<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.539> have

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
think it's five days so if you have

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.500 
think it's five days so if you have
something<00:00:57.660> better<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.500> upgrade<00:00:59.100> go<00:00:59.430> ahead<00:00:59.730> by

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
something better to upgrade go ahead by

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
can put it in air and ground but you

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.990 
can put it in air and ground but you
lose<00:02:28.780> range<00:02:29.230> or<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:30.040> can<00:02:30.220> put<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.520> to<00:02:30.640> ground

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
lose range or you can put it to ground

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.980 
lose range or you can put it to ground
only<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:32.320> increases<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.100> range<00:02:33.490> in<00:02:33.990> the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
only and it increases the range in the

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.870 
only and it increases the range in the
high<00:02:35.170> level<00:02:35.410> games<00:02:35.860> where<00:02:36.220> people<00:02:36.610> attack

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
high level games where people attack

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.790

breakers and giants and spells I would

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.870 
breakers and giants and spells I would
recommend<00:02:42.400> putting<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:43.060> ground<00:02:43.540> only<00:02:44.230> if<00:02:44.880> not

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
recommend putting it ground only if not

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.510 
recommend putting it ground only if not
put<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:46.420> air<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:46.900> ground<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.350> depends<00:02:48.250> on<00:02:48.340> what

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
put it air and ground it depends on what

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.660 
put it air and ground it depends on what
you<00:02:48.640> prefer<00:02:49.260> now<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.650> more<00:02:50.890> tars<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.489> more
