well<00:00:13.580> as<00:00:13.759> ophthalmologist<00:00:14.660> we<00:00:14.900> believe<00:00:15.200> that

these small blood vessel changes in his
retina<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:16.510> some<00:02:16.690> when<00:02:16.840> we<00:02:16.990> find<00:02:17.320> this<00:02:17.620> we

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
retina and some when we find this we

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.770 
retina and some when we find this we
