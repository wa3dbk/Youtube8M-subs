down<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.149> sides<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.570> reason<00:01:00.809> why<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.079> that

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
down the sides the reason why we do that

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.450 
down the sides the reason why we do that
is<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.320> want<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.530> seal<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.859> pastry<00:01:02.219> okay

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
is we want to seal the pastry okay

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.189 
is we want to seal the pastry okay
because<00:01:03.180> if<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.420> doesn't<00:01:03.539> seal<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.870> foie<00:01:04.019> gras

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
because if it doesn't seal the foie gras

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.270 
because if it doesn't seal the foie gras
fat<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.470> gonna<00:01:04.559> leak<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.890> that's<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.189> whole

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
fat it's gonna leak it that's a whole

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.060 
fat it's gonna leak it that's a whole
best<00:01:05.460> part<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.760> dish<00:01:05.880> gun<00:01:06.090> that's<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.720> yeah

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
best part of the dish gun that's it yeah

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.250 
best part of the dish gun that's it yeah
so<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> next<00:01:08.400> course<00:01:08.850> we're<00:01:09.180> gonna<00:01:09.330> do<00:01:09.570> is

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
beef yeah

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.960 
beef yeah
we'll<00:02:44.099> flip<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.370> over<00:02:44.900> get<00:02:45.900> more<00:02:46.079> salt<00:02:46.440> here

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
we'll flip it over get more salt here

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.009 
we'll flip it over get more salt here
I'm<00:02:47.970> not<00:02:48.150> gonna<00:02:48.269> use<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.420> paper<00:02:48.660> on<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:48.930> one

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
I'm not gonna use a paper on this one

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.240 
I'm not gonna use a paper on this one
because<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.200> want<00:02:49.379> the<00:02:49.440> pan<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.650> get<00:02:49.860> really<00:02:50.069> hot

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
because I want the pan to get really hot

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.190 
because I want the pan to get really hot
over<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.790> oven<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:51.510> normally<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.840> paper<00:02:51.989> is

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
over the oven so normally the paper is

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.900 
over the oven so normally the paper is
actually<00:02:52.560> act<00:02:52.980> as<00:02:53.069> diffuser<00:02:53.489> between<00:02:53.819> the

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
actually act as diffuser between the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.610 
actually act as diffuser between the
meat<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.420> actual<00:02:54.720> steel<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.440> I'm<00:02:55.500> gonna

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
meat and the actual steel so I'm gonna

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.350 
meat and the actual steel so I'm gonna
leave<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:55.890> sitting<00:02:56.099> straight<00:02:56.340> on<00:02:56.459> there<00:02:56.640> and

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
leave it sitting straight on there and

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.400 
leave it sitting straight on there and
the<00:02:57.480> reason<00:02:57.660> for<00:02:57.780> that<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:57.989> need<00:02:58.109> the<00:02:58.170> pan<00:02:58.319> to

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
the reason for that is I need the pan to

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.780 
the reason for that is I need the pan to
get<00:02:58.500> super<00:02:58.799> hot<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:58.980> it's<00:02:59.129> gonna<00:02:59.220> sort<00:02:59.519> of<00:02:59.609> act

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
get super hot and it's gonna sort of act

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.039 
get super hot and it's gonna sort of act
just<00:03:00.030> like<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.150> frying<00:03:00.450> pan<00:03:00.540> basically

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
just like a frying pan basically

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.569 
just like a frying pan basically
caramelizing<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.709> top<00:03:01.890> side<00:03:02.099> of<00:03:02.190> that<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.459> be

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
caramelizing the top side of that to be

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.000 
caramelizing the top side of that to be
tenderloin<00:03:02.970> get<00:03:03.720> back<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.230> Mary<00:03:04.530> chef<00:03:04.799> of

the<00:03:15.840> word<00:03:15.959> microwave<00:03:16.319> technology<00:03:16.620> but<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:16.980> is

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
the word microwave technology but it is

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.650 
the word microwave technology but it is
microwave<00:03:17.700> technology<00:03:18.060> but<00:03:18.359> in<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.510> different

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
way that we're sort of familiar with as

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.089 
way that we're sort of familiar with as
a<00:03:20.940> society<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.780> fact<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.099> regular

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
a society in the fact that regular

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.559 
a society in the fact that regular
microwave<00:03:23.400> cooking<00:03:23.700> cooks<00:03:24.120> food<00:03:24.389> molecules

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
microwave cooking cooks food molecules

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.539 
microwave cooking cooks food molecules
yeah<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.500> technology<00:03:26.010> in<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.130> merry<00:03:26.340> chef

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
yeah the technology in the merry chef

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:27.680 
yeah the technology in the merry chef
which<00:03:26.730> has<00:03:26.849> been<00:03:26.970> developed<00:03:27.269> again<00:03:27.450> just<00:03:27.630> in

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
which has been developed again just in

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.120 
which has been developed again just in
the<00:03:27.750> last<00:03:27.840> couple<00:03:28.109> years<00:03:28.169> actually<00:03:28.530> agitates

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
the last couple years actually agitates

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.680 
the last couple years actually agitates
food<00:03:29.340> molecules<00:03:29.519> molecules<00:03:29.940> so<00:03:30.389> they<00:03:30.510> don't

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
food molecules molecules so they don't

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.360 
food molecules molecules so they don't
actually<00:03:31.200> cook<00:03:31.620> they<00:03:32.040> caused<00:03:32.220> themselves

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
actually cook they caused themselves

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.220 
actually cook they caused themselves
just<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.970> cook<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.599> meat<00:03:33.720> around<00:03:33.840> them<00:03:34.109> as

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230
