you<00:02:56.320> need<00:02:56.709> a<00:02:56.740> I've<00:02:57.040> got<00:02:57.070> a<00:02:57.220> fairly<00:02:57.459> long<00:02:57.550> moment

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
you need a I've got a fairly long moment

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.980 
you need a I've got a fairly long moment
yeah<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:59.440> you<00:02:59.530> have<00:02:59.680> a<00:03:00.420> fair<00:03:01.420> distance<00:03:01.780> to

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
yeah so you have a fair distance to

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.320 
yeah so you have a fair distance to
travel<00:03:02.380> there<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:03.400> be<00:03:03.520> able<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.760> get<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.150> that

travel there to be able to get to that

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.449 
travel there to be able to get to that
so<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:04.840> really<00:03:05.560> short<00:03:05.740> nail<00:03:05.980> might<00:03:06.190> have<00:03:06.430> a

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
so a really short nail might have a

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.900 
so a really short nail might have a
problem<00:03:06.790> but<00:03:07.600> I'm<00:03:08.590> sure<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:09.010> could<00:03:09.520> suffice

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
problem but I'm sure you could suffice

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.280 
problem but I'm sure you could suffice
you<00:03:10.060> don't<00:03:10.239> use<00:03:10.360> up<00:03:10.510> button<00:03:10.720> terribly<00:03:11.080> often<00:03:11.230> I

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
you don't use up button terribly often I

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.620 
you don't use up button terribly often I
would<00:03:11.380> imagine<00:03:11.620> power<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.459> button<00:03:12.760> easy<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.450> get

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
would imagine power a button easy to get

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.170 
would imagine power a button easy to get
to<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.890> nothing<00:03:15.160> around<00:03:15.370> outside

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
to and nothing around outside

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.320 
to and nothing around outside
it<00:03:17.140> doesn't<00:03:17.709> quite<00:03:17.830> pop<00:03:18.340> open<00:03:18.519> as<00:03:18.850> easily<00:03:19.030> as

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
it doesn't quite pop open as easily as

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.630 
it doesn't quite pop open as easily as
it<00:03:19.450> did<00:03:19.630> whenever<00:03:19.989> it<00:03:20.080> was<00:03:20.200> there<00:03:20.980> wasn't<00:03:21.130> a<00:03:21.370> an

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640
