00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.850 
again there's a lag and it does it does
take<00:01:53.420> some<00:01:53.630> getting<00:01:53.690> used<00:01:54.050> to<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:54.440> I<00:01:54.500> wish<00:01:54.680> you

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
take some getting used to and I wish you

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.320 
take some getting used to and I wish you
wouldn't<00:01:55.160> have<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:55.610> get<00:01:55.700> used<00:01:55.910> to<00:01:56.090> it

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
wouldn't have to get used to it

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.880 
wouldn't have to get used to it
I<00:01:56.360> wish<00:01:56.720> Ford<00:01:57.020> would<00:01:57.170> have<00:01:57.260> built<00:01:57.560> a<00:01:57.710> system

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
I wish Ford would have built a system

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.310 
I wish Ford would have built a system
that<00:01:58.190> did<00:01:58.400> not<00:01:58.670> have<00:01:59.150> any<00:01:59.180> lag<00:01:59.600> that<00:01:59.630> was<00:02:00.050> very

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
that did not have any lag that was very

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.660 
that did not have any lag that was very
smooth<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.720> fluid<00:02:02.920> this<00:02:03.920> system<00:02:04.340> is<00:02:04.490> neither

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
smooth and fluid this system is neither

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.700

it's neither smooth nor fluid but it is

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.639 
it's neither smooth nor fluid but it is
robust<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.640> dizzy<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:08.030> is<00:02:08.179> easy<00:02:08.450> to<00:02:08.690> use<00:02:08.720> these

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649

around<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:51.500> went<00:02:51.680> from<00:02:51.830> just<00:02:51.950> having<00:02:52.250> an<00:02:52.459> attack

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
around I went from just having an attack

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.030 
around I went from just having an attack
and<00:02:53.030> those<00:02:53.150> in<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.750> fuel<00:02:54.049> gauge<00:02:54.170> you<00:02:54.860> have<00:02:54.980> an

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
and those in a fuel gauge you have an

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.460 
and those in a fuel gauge you have an
attack<00:02:55.310> fuel<00:02:55.580> gauge<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:55.940> also<00:02:56.209> now<00:02:56.360> a

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
attack fuel gauge and also now a

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.140 
attack fuel gauge and also now a
temperature<00:02:57.470> control<00:02:57.830> there's<00:02:58.760> also<00:02:59.000> a

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
temperature control there's also a

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.430 
temperature control there's also a
screen<00:02:59.360> that<00:02:59.390> shows<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.840> status<00:03:00.049> and<00:03:00.320> they

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
screen that shows the status and they

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.530 
screen that shows the status and they
all<00:03:00.560> wheel<00:03:00.739> drive<00:03:00.769> there<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.850> trip<00:03:02.060> computers

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
all wheel drive there the trip computers

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.630 
all wheel drive there the trip computers
now<00:03:02.690> are<00:03:02.959> so<00:03:03.830> much<00:03:03.980> more<00:03:04.040> than<00:03:04.340> just<00:03:04.370> the

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
now are so much more than just the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.490 
now are so much more than just the
mileage<00:03:05.120> there's<00:03:05.450> also<00:03:05.630> gets<00:03:05.900> easy<00:03:06.170> fuel

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
mileage there's also gets easy fuel

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.460 
mileage there's also gets easy fuel
economy<00:03:06.739> and<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:08.150> gasoline<00:03:08.630> usage<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:09.230> until

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
economy and the gasoline usage and until

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.990 
economy and the gasoline usage and until
the<00:03:09.590> drive<00:03:09.799> time<00:03:10.070> that<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.370> vehicles<00:03:10.700> been<00:03:10.820> on

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
the drive time that the vehicles been on

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000 
the drive time that the vehicles been on
so<00:03:11.450> it's<00:03:11.600> a<00:03:11.989> lot<00:03:12.290> more<00:03:12.500> than<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.890> old

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
so it's a lot more than the old

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.270 
so it's a lot more than the old
push-button<00:03:13.489> things<00:03:14.260> this<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:15.440> a<00:03:15.470> new<00:03:15.769> Ford's
