00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
Rick Grimes

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.400 
Rick Grimes
probably<00:00:15.119> -<00:00:15.449> how<00:00:15.569> he<00:00:15.629> was<00:00:15.929> in<00:00:16.170> season<00:00:17.070> two<00:00:17.310> and

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
probably - how he was in season two and

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.999 
probably - how he was in season two and
I<00:00:19.519> actually<00:00:20.519> like<00:00:21.269> this<00:00:21.900> figure<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.410> little

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009 
I actually like this figure a little

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.079 
I actually like this figure a little
better<00:00:23.279> than<00:00:23.609> his<00:00:24.710> first<00:00:25.710> set<00:00:26.189> then<00:00:26.820> how<00:00:27.029> he

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:27.089 
better than his first set then how he

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.960 
better than his first set then how he
was<00:00:27.329> in<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.570> first<00:00:27.749> series<00:00:28.519> he<00:00:29.519> doesn't<00:00:29.820> come

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
was in the first series he doesn't come

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.529 
was in the first series he doesn't come
with<00:00:30.150> as<00:00:30.300> many<00:00:30.449> accessories<00:00:30.990> but<00:00:31.650> he's<00:00:32.550> got<00:00:33.510> a

00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:33.539 
with as many accessories but he's got a

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.860 
with as many accessories but he's got a
really<00:00:33.809> good<00:00:34.050> design<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.500> think<00:00:34.949> it<00:00:35.039> looks<00:00:35.870> a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
really good design I think it looks a

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.900 
really good design I think it looks a
little<00:00:37.680> better<00:00:38.039> than<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> first<00:00:38.670> when<00:00:38.879> I

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
little better than the first when I

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.279 
little better than the first when I
thought<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.239> first<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.539> had<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> pretty<00:00:39.989> close

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
thought the first one had a pretty close

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.240 
thought the first one had a pretty close
likeness<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.219> him<00:00:41.399> as<00:00:41.520> well<00:00:41.760> but<00:00:42.770> the<00:00:43.770> detail

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
likeness to him as well but the detail

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.040 
likeness to him as well but the detail
on<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> shirt<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:46.219> pants<00:00:47.899> everywhere<00:00:48.899> is

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
on a shirt and pants everywhere is

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.000 
on a shirt and pants everywhere is
really<00:00:49.410> nice

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
really nice

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.099 
really nice
the<00:00:50.129> only<00:00:50.340> weird<00:00:50.879> looking<00:00:51.359> thing<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.780> him<00:00:51.960> is

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
the only weird looking thing on him is

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.060 
the only weird looking thing on him is
on<00:00:52.320> his<00:00:52.530> arm

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.119 

the<00:00:55.579> way<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:56.379> other's<00:00:57.379> hands<00:00:57.649> and<00:00:57.859> everything

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
the way the other's hands and everything

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.970 
the way the other's hands and everything
because<00:00:58.370> you<00:00:58.489> have<00:00:58.699> interchangeable<00:00:59.510> hands

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
because you have interchangeable hands

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.380 
because you have interchangeable hands
so<00:01:00.980> they<00:01:01.100> kind<00:01:01.339> of<00:01:01.460> stick<00:01:01.699> out<00:01:01.850> a<00:01:01.909> little<00:01:02.149> bit

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
so they kind of stick out a little bit

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.800 
so they kind of stick out a little bit
where<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.690> hinges<00:01:03.109> are<00:01:03.289> and<00:01:03.530> everything<00:01:04.810> but

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
where the hinges are and everything but

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.840 
where the hinges are and everything but
he's<00:01:06.560> a<00:01:06.590> little<00:01:07.540> more<00:01:08.680> articulated<00:01:09.680> in<00:01:10.220> those

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
he's a little more articulated in those

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.020 
he's a little more articulated in those
spots<00:01:11.240> than<00:01:11.659> he<00:01:11.750> was<00:01:11.930> in<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.170> first<00:01:12.409> series<00:01:13.030> he

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
spots than he was in the first series he

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.889 
spots than he was in the first series he
has<00:01:14.479> a<00:01:14.509> lot<00:01:14.750> more<00:01:14.780> movement<00:01:16.690> one<00:01:17.690> of<00:01:17.810> the

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
has a lot more movement one of the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.109 
has a lot more movement one of the
things<00:01:18.140> that<00:01:18.350> I<00:01:18.490> don't<00:01:19.490> like<00:01:19.729> about<00:01:19.880> this

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
things that I don't like about this

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.399 
things that I don't like about this
figure<00:01:20.390> that<00:01:20.539> I<00:01:20.750> thought<00:01:20.960> he<00:01:21.080> was<00:01:21.229> going<00:01:21.320> to

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
figure that I thought he was going to

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.499 
figure that I thought he was going to
have<00:01:21.649> was<00:01:21.920> going<00:01:22.070> to<00:01:22.130> be<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.310> removable<00:01:23.119> hat

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
have was going to be a removable hat

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.380 
have was going to be a removable hat
that<00:01:24.200> hat<00:01:24.409> is<00:01:24.590> actually<00:01:24.979> fixed<00:01:25.880> on<00:01:26.000> to<00:01:26.240> his

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
that hat is actually fixed on to his

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.790 
that hat is actually fixed on to his
head<00:01:26.630> it's<00:01:26.810> part<00:01:27.110> of<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.520> part<00:01:28.520> of<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:28.700> sculpt

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
head it's part of the part of the sculpt

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.870 
head it's part of the part of the sculpt
that<00:01:30.800> would<00:01:30.950> have<00:01:31.039> been<00:01:31.159> nice<00:01:31.340> being<00:01:31.610> able<00:01:31.729> to

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.870 
that would have been nice being able to
take<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.179> hat<00:01:32.330> off<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:32.750> put<00:01:32.899> it<00:01:32.929> on<00:01:33.110> from<00:01:33.470> the
