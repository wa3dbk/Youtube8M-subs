go so when you're 10 to 20 metres away
from<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:11.690> corner<00:01:11.929> you<00:01:12.649> should<00:01:12.679> be<00:01:13.070> looking

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
from the corner you should be looking

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.990 
from the corner you should be looking
towards<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.270> entry<00:01:14.840> and<00:01:14.990> apex<00:01:15.860> this<00:01:16.729> gives

towards the entry and apex this gives

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.580 
towards the entry and apex this gives

there's<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.690> good<00:02:14.870> chance<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:15.530> could<00:02:15.680> crash<00:02:15.950> if

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
there's a good chance you could crash if

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.610 
there's a good chance you could crash if
it's<00:02:16.730> wet<00:02:16.970> you'll<00:02:17.510> want<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.840> enter<00:02:18.049> the<00:02:18.350> corner

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
it's wet you'll want to enter the corner

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.550 
it's wet you'll want to enter the corner
much<00:02:19.220> slower<00:02:19.640> but<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.480> also<00:02:20.690> need<00:02:21.079> to<00:02:21.139> be<00:02:21.320> even

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
much slower but you also need to be even

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.979 
much slower but you also need to be even
gentler<00:02:22.250> on<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.609> brakes<00:02:22.880> that<00:02:23.209> means<00:02:23.780> you

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
gentler on the brakes that means you

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.319 
gentler on the brakes that means you
need<00:02:24.109> to<00:02:24.169> start<00:02:24.290> braking<00:02:24.980> earlier<00:02:25.400> maybe<00:02:26.120> as

need to start braking earlier maybe as

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
step is to stop peddling drop your

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.800 
step is to stop peddling drop your
