00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:11.820
 Hello, I would like to say about this 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.580
 a knife that everyone knows about him 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:20.390
 there were two series x 12m 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:26.630
 I forged him there and cut off the descendants 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:29.460
 Now Iâ€™m wondering what was the detail 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.060
 put the handle on it is jute 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.870
 mykarta 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:43.309
 and made well because of without plastic 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:50.899
 need and now i want to send it 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:54.989
 to our friend and a note of 124 wife 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.710
 because we wear normal good 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.780
 an attitude 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:05.850
 I call him back there all 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:12.030
 We're talking here 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:13.310
 make him a gift as you remember me 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.000
 also 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:22.070
 your time our another friend Vasil 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.420
 terabyte would make a present too 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:32.520
 kershaw folding 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:35.460
 nerve is called and says that here I am 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.380
 I realized that to the licks this 10 started this 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.189
 the topic that I will give you and you who do not 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.450
 the core 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:49.350
 husband eat dictionary so vasil told me 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.090
 Well, this philosophy I liked 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.090
 actually I decided to continue the topic 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:02.649
 why not yet not 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:08.799
 then maybe someone else can not actually 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:15.299
 exactly I think so maybe it will become 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:19.890
 tradition to live in the community even though I 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:24.239
 absolutely do not call anyone for anything 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:28.180
 so it turned out such a sheath 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:33.160
 rivets really broke if you see them 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:37.860
 boxing on the clip did not do it because he 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.860
 fits well in your pocket 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.579
 excellent it did not polish did not get out 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.780
 all scratch actually it 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:52.680
 positioned as more or less such 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:58.390
 knife for hard work any 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.139
 his 07 has become since I 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:05.440
 and destiny 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:08.139
 for cutting and rope then it was 05 well in 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:13.329
 In general, all I think is not accurate and 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:22.530
 now I did not do 1 is the accent I did 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:27.010
 grip made need well that's all 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:34.079
