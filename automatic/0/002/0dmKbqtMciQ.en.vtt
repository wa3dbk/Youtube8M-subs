there<00:00:11.290> Jason<00:00:11.680> you've<00:00:11.860> got<00:00:12.040> me<00:00:12.130> quite<00:00:12.310> excited

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
there Jason you've got me quite excited

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.089 
there Jason you've got me quite excited
about<00:00:13.180> something<00:00:13.690> called<00:00:13.840> transmission<00:00:14.350> wind

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
about something called transmission wind

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:16.950 
about something called transmission wind
up<00:00:15.430> I<00:00:15.550> thought<00:00:15.880> it<00:00:16.090> was<00:00:16.270> coming<00:00:16.450> over<00:00:16.660> here<00:00:16.840> and

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
up I thought it was coming over here and

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.630 
up I thought it was coming over here and
telling<00:00:17.410> the<00:00:17.500> transmission<00:00:18.070> you're<00:00:18.220> no<00:00:18.400> good

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
telling the transmission you're no good

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.550 
telling the transmission you're no good
but<00:00:19.210> it's<00:00:19.390> not<00:00:19.510> that<00:00:19.660> it's<00:00:19.720> always<00:00:20.110> it<00:00:20.289> it's

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
but it's not that it's always it it's

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.350 
but it's not that it's always it it's
basically<00:00:20.710> the<00:00:21.220> front<00:00:21.460> and<00:00:21.610> rear<00:00:21.699> axles<00:00:22.180> are

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
basically the front and rear axles are

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.720 
basically the front and rear axles are
joined<00:00:22.600> together<00:00:22.779> to<00:00:23.199> make<00:00:23.650> a<00:00:23.680> solid<00:00:24.070> shaft<00:00:24.340> so

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
joined together to make a solid shaft so

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.760 
joined together to make a solid shaft so
it's<00:00:25.180> causing<00:00:25.750> the<00:00:25.840> inside<00:00:26.140> rear<00:00:26.380> wheel<00:00:26.560> to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
it's causing the inside rear wheel to

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.650 
it's causing the inside rear wheel to
try<00:00:26.980> and<00:00:27.130> go<00:00:27.250> as<00:00:27.340> fast<00:00:27.580> as<00:00:27.789> the<00:00:28.029> outside<00:00:28.390> front

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
try and go as fast as the outside front

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.439 
try and go as fast as the outside front
wheel<00:00:28.840> I<00:00:29.310> see<00:00:30.310> that's<00:00:30.670> what<00:00:30.970> it<00:00:31.090> will<00:00:31.210> was

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
wheel I see that's what it will was

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.419 
wheel I see that's what it will was
speeding<00:00:32.229> up<00:00:32.319> all<00:00:32.529> the<00:00:32.619> time<00:00:32.800> trying<00:00:33.069> kept<00:00:33.309> up

00:00:33.419 --> 00:00:33.429 
speeding up all the time trying kept up

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:34.709 
speeding up all the time trying kept up
with<00:00:33.460> it<00:00:33.729> we've<00:00:33.879> locked<00:00:34.120> to<00:00:34.239> the<00:00:34.300> transmission

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 
with it we've locked to the transmission

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:36.540 
with it we've locked to the transmission
front<00:00:35.019> to<00:00:35.170> back<00:00:35.319> and<00:00:35.589> that<00:00:35.800> gives<00:00:36.309> us<00:00:36.399> better

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
front to back and that gives us better

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.639 
front to back and that gives us better
off<00:00:36.789> road<00:00:36.999> capabilities<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:38.019> downside<00:00:38.499> of

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
off road capabilities the downside of

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.619 
off road capabilities the downside of
that<00:00:38.679> is<00:00:38.769> I'm<00:00:39.249> tarmac<00:00:39.789> he's<00:00:40.030> not<00:00:40.210> good<00:00:40.420> for<00:00:40.539> the

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
that is I'm tarmac he's not good for the

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.479 
that is I'm tarmac he's not good for the
vehicle<00:00:40.989> it'll<00:00:41.530> wear<00:00:41.620> the<00:00:41.769> tires<00:00:41.979> out<00:00:42.219> quick

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
vehicle it'll wear the tires out quick

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.069 
vehicle it'll wear the tires out quick
and<00:00:42.699> it<00:00:42.789> could<00:00:42.940> possibly<00:00:43.089> do<00:00:43.420> very<00:00:43.629> expensive

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
and it could possibly do very expensive

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.869 
and it could possibly do very expensive
damage<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:44.409> the<00:00:44.469> transmission<00:00:44.859> I<00:00:45.159> see<00:00:45.639> so

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
damage to the transmission I see so

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.910 
damage to the transmission I see so
what's<00:00:46.449> different<00:00:46.809> than<00:00:46.899> with<00:00:47.079> the<00:00:47.170> l200<00:00:47.769> with

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
what's different than with the l200 with

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.279 
what's different than with the l200 with
the<00:00:48.010> l200<00:00:48.579> as<00:00:48.699> a<00:00:48.729> centre<00:00:49.149> differential<00:00:49.569> and<00:00:50.170> if

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
the l200 as a centre differential and if

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:51.539 
the l200 as a centre differential and if
we<00:00:50.379> unlock<00:00:50.679> the<00:00:50.710> centre<00:00:50.979> differential<00:00:51.339> we

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:51.549 
we unlock the centre differential we

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:52.799 
we unlock the centre differential we
still<00:00:51.760> have<00:00:51.850> the<00:00:51.940> benefits<00:00:52.329> of<00:00:52.449> four-wheel

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
still have the benefits of four-wheel

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.360 
still have the benefits of four-wheel
drive<00:00:53.109> but<00:00:53.649> we<00:00:53.739> don't<00:00:53.949> have<00:00:54.190> the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
drive but we don't have the

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.259 
drive but we don't have the
disadvantages<00:00:55.059> of<00:00:55.120> transmission<00:00:55.690> wider

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
disadvantages of transmission wider

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.289 
disadvantages of transmission wider
right<00:00:58.269> so<00:00:58.510> now<00:00:58.749> ease<00:00:59.139> free<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.159> diff<00:01:00.369> and<00:01:01.059> that

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
right so now ease free the diff and that

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:02.939 
right so now ease free the diff and that
means<00:01:01.569> that<00:01:01.959> there's<00:01:02.199> none<00:01:02.499> of<00:01:02.530> that<00:01:02.649> wheel

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
means that there's none of that wheel

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.130 
means that there's none of that wheel
spinning<00:01:03.639> anymore<00:01:04.059> trying<00:01:04.300> to<00:01:04.449> catch<00:01:04.660> up<00:01:04.870> with

the<00:01:05.440> front<00:01:05.650> wheel<00:01:05.890> it's<00:01:06.430> perfect<00:01:06.850> it's

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
the front wheel it's perfect it's

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.210 
the front wheel it's perfect it's
allowing<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:08.020> front<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:08.470> rear<00:01:08.620> prop<00:01:08.920> chaps

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
allowing the front and rear prop chaps

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.220 
allowing the front and rear prop chaps

to turn at different speeds if you need

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.720 
to turn at different speeds if you need

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
to have extra traction you can then just

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:19.830 
to have extra traction you can then just

this<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.179> what<00:02:00.600> happens<00:02:01.189> now<00:02:02.189> let's<00:02:02.460> try<00:02:02.670> it

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
this is what happens now let's try it

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.050 
this is what happens now let's try it
again

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
again

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.999 
again
this<00:02:03.569> time<00:02:03.810> we're<00:02:04.170> gonna<00:02:04.289> select<00:02:04.560> four<00:02:04.890> wheel

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
this time we're gonna select four wheel

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.080 
this time we're gonna select four wheel
drive<00:02:05.249> high<00:02:05.520> but<00:02:06.179> no<00:02:06.420> traction<00:02:06.750> control<00:02:07.380> you

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
drive high but no traction control you

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.070 
drive high but no traction control you
can<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.330> see<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.690> tail<00:02:09.959> slide<00:02:10.259> out<00:02:12.080> same

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
can just see the tail slide out same

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.580 
can just see the tail slide out same
Junction<00:02:13.620> same<00:02:14.280> speed<00:02:14.700> but<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:15.840> time<00:02:16.140> we

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
Junction same speed but this time we

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.710 
Junction same speed but this time we
have<00:02:16.769> Mitsubishi<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.430> active<00:02:17.940> stability<00:02:18.480> and

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
have Mitsubishi is active stability and

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.890 
have Mitsubishi is active stability and
traction<00:02:19.019> control<00:02:19.319> switched<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.629> just<00:02:21.629> look

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
traction control switched on just look

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.140 
traction control switched on just look
at<00:02:22.019> a<00:02:22.080> difference<00:02:22.530> confident<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:23.700> safe<00:02:23.879> in

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
at a difference confident and safe in

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.200 
at a difference confident and safe in
any<00:02:24.540> conditions
