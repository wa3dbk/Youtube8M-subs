00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.900
 It was not an easy step we are 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.820
 yesterday until with a compound 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.490
 presidents and of course have the 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.440
 analyzed last games and in the 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.730
 The results in 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.490
 order given we have in the last 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.650
 five play only three points and made 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.119
 did not feel good in yesterday's game 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.750
 So that did not show us 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.910
 like 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.210
 and that's why we have the decision 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.190
 it is then hit by us 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.370
 fk austria wien ag bylaws 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.379
 anchored that that the question of 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.289
 cheftrainers one 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.239
 Supervisory Board resolution is required 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:52.219
 then started at night 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:55.249
 this proposal of the board quasi 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.100
 to submit to the decision then stop 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:01:00.010
 in the morning the unanimous decision 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.809
 get that our proposal namely 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.089
 to oust militzer company and 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.469
 at the same time gaga became the new boss of the 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.630
 to make the last 13 games 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:10.579
 is fully agreed and therefore 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.820
 then we have the further measures 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:15.109
 we have already set something yesterday 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.390
 people maybe you can pass 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:18.480
 could but it was then he was in the 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.440
 early of course 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:26.520
 surprising how to get the pin it 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.890
 Of course, it's hard to say how 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.900
 it has gone now or if only and 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.090
 depended the result 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.550
 It was just the last time very much 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.130
 difficult and unfortunately are the result of one 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.870
 the relationship is yes there is always 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.060
 tense the players the endgames 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.460
 are always dissatisfied but we have 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.380
 hoped for more and that was actually 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.610
 the reason and as always in the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.950
 Trainer job decide that 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.220
 results and we want our goal 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.420
 reach second third place and that 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.610
 we have actually seen in danger 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.740
 have the measure taken and 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.080
 I still have this goal 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.520
 so the dots distance of the colorful 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.200
 distance is not so big but we 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.310
 have to offer better services then 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.970
 I believe that we reach the goal 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.000
 can 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.930
 well the preparation was very positive 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.970
 and mayor may be the first 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.080
 games are not that successful when it does 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.750
 then what could happen 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.150
 But I think I have to do it in such a way 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.920
 see analysis as a side note there is not 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.660
 the one reason or there is 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.400
 mostly trigger as well as the match 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.020
 yesterday but of course there is one 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.140
 trend and we still have that today 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.140
 team explains we have of course 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.239
 2013 huge successes celebrated with the 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.739
 championship and with that reach the 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.640
 champions league and so our the 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.060
 champions-league group phase 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.620
 but 2013 is over 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.020
 just have to go into the heads 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.250
 we can not buy anything from that anymore 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.920
 we have had the success but now 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.690
 is about 2014 and the claims of 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.250
 austria vienna and that did not help 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.450
 knowing that he got the job 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.980
 that wise as the player here and the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.340
 Just hesse qualification for one 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.590
 international competition 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.360
 we have then in his analysis 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.300
 the heating season so already in december 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.610
 we are convinced with some 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.959
 Measures speak with some new ones 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.480
 but also some others 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.910
 In the environment, action will believe that 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.459
 we with the coach and the team 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.940
 come back on this road to success 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.280
 can 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.540
 yes and then we have at the transfermarkt 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.000
 We just have to do some things 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.130
 after the games against rapid and wiener 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.140
 neustadt not only what the result 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.190
 concerns but also the experience of 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.910
 Team concerns say that's too 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.230
 little we see the goal one 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.750
 to reach international starting place 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.710
 absolutely endangered and just believe 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.870
 Take this new impulse a measure 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.380
 to have and reach the goal yet 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.160
 can 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.300
 well three-point rule last so we 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.240
 Of course now have something to make up there 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.470
 have after 13 games and we hope 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.780
 Of course you can book there if 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.130
 already start so he will have gaga 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.810
 excellent job in the last 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.810
 already at austria vienna 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.420
 First, the academy then contributed 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.790
 the amateurs now in autumn with the 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.280
 1909 you look but also last at 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.080
 tournament victory in godingen and it is 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.760
 convinced that a very very good man 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.440
 is and therefore we want to have this opportunity 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.630
 have said clearly and that too 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.790
 also the supervisory board presents clearly 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.530
 for the last 13 games we are looking for 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.260
 no other trainer cares 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.970
 nobody at the moment 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.680
 could be from summer 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.450
 and of course we hope that will be here 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.810
 not quite as successful works that he 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.430
 Just convinced us that 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.410
 be quite long none 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.270
 Chancellor of herbert is our very 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.770
 do a good job not only if the 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.050
 amateur area but now in the 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.540
 newsweek and you can see we were very 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.890
 this step not prepared 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.140
 because we have no other coach 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.730
 spoken but we said if 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.200
 we now make these decisions 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.860
 participate we will in the 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.840
 occupy 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.550
 We have full confidence to herbert 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.420
 Gager and Herbert will be the next 13 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.860
 make games 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.080
 We will not be a coach now either 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.120
 but we have full 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.550
 Trust him and we hope he does 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.610
 Success has reached the goal then can 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.530
 we also go to work 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.350
 imagine after the summer that is one 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.180
 classic leave of absence that is the 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.010
 Covers naturally continue 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.300
 but it is simply a measure that we 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.600
 as board members in the sense of development 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.110
 the east and that is the main task 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.300
 hit 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.520
 I believe in such things is times 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:36.070
 of course disappointed but as I said 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.740
 are all ultimately professionals and 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.510
 so ultimately did too 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.770
 reacts and I would like too 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.590
 really thank him again 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.700
 for us in a difficult phase in the 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.310
 taken over summer 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.140
 Peter StÃ¶ger had very short notice 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.190
 was left by cologne from the contract 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.590
 bought out 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.390
 who accepted this challenge 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.550
 with us one of the biggest successes in the 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.800
 champions league with the qualification 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.970
 celebrated 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.080
 but we are finally at the end 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.760
 other things have to be said 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.650
 failed and therefore we have these 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.720
 taken action 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.910
 of course we were disappointed that this 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.000
 have made a decision but it is 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.860
 always hard when you do such a step 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.560
 but we just did not want it 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.270
 wait a long time because we have got it 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.620
 We consider whether we make the decision 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.790
 should or should meet now 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.530
 to wait two games 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.410
 I believe that the time is right 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:28.420
 was and in the end were now the 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.880
 last two games decide where we are 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.780
 really did not play well and so 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.430
 how we are against vienna neustadt 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.370
 We presented with that 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.200
 not satisfied because there you have seen 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.190
 that some does not fit and I hope 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.190
 that will change now
