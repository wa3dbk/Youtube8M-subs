00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 and do not look grips with the piquito 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.429
 seeds take out the shell and eat the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.920
 little seeds the flames the gold is called 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.300
 arturo is a talkative parrot this time blue 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.670
 because you see that it has the coloration 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.139
 xarquet to the peak they know her is 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.930
 andrea valid the florencio zoo 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.779
 varela that is always with us you 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.820
 I'm going to talk about these achievements that is what 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.189
 what happens when they are in captivity 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.289
 I'm not going to touch you with a hard weapon and 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.820
 characteristics that everyone has are 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.769
 the talkers are autochthonous 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.219
 our country and selling is north section 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.280
 they go up all over Central America if this one and 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.829
 if they are let's say they are common animals 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.230
 it is very typical to look at the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.750
 trees in the holes of the trees 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.510
 They put up three eggs we raise together 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.680
 to the chicks if they are seen is very common 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.950
 see them in the houses yes 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.900
 and what happens when they are in captivity 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.300
 they live for a few years they live in good 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.830
 conditions and are well fed if what 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.380
 that is recommended is that people do not 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.229
 adopt parrots of course we are only 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.610
 clear are not considered pets and if 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.770
 they infect the man with a disease 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.020
 that is called appointment thing that is very 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.390
 complicated psittacosis when when 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.400
 it affects us is not true 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.380
 yes and usually it is not detected easy 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.660
 you know when people start 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.940
 that reduce the degree if fever fever 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.670
 very high visual disturbances 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.410
 vomiting dizziness until death 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.600
 true but usually the 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.450
 veterinarians and the doctors of this 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.190
 clinicians never suspect 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.170
 psittacosis psittacosis can be 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.390
 contagious or not is not that it is not a condition 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.100
 indispensable every person who has the 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.520
 gold is going to be contagious if such thing is not 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.409
 well and it spreads through the saliva 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.719
 what usually happens is that when we have 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.460
 to pets at home if we give 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:52.219
 eat with our hands fruits seeds 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.990
 after we ingest that same but in 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.759
 veterinarians sell these achievements for 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.700
 axes and unfortunately are sold in the 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.619
 veterinary at the fairs itself is very 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.049
 It is common for these animals to be sold 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.670
 the crossings of the tracks I recommend not 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.009
 buy them because the truth that a little 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.200
 this note the idea beyond talking about 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.299
 the characteristics of these parrots 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.160
 talkative or not talkative is that 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.049
 you become aware that they are not 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.489
 pets as andreas said but that 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.120
 well, pets are dogs and 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.010
 cats 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.540
 the truth that birds do not have to 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.010
 being in captivity do not have to be 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.170
 in a cage they have to live in 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.420
 freedom and have it especially to cope 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.069
 clear the whole process because they do not procreate 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.510
 for example being in captivity for 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.519
 is one of the risks step when they have 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.650
 couple nor do they also look 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.030
 so that an animal is so he does not 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.700
 has the wings cut today I would 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.799
 they asked but he is not sitting when 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.329
 it was the pigeon they still lack more 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.549
 colors that will be acquired with the 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.950
 time if it lacks a little color 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.660
 and he's been raised that way by us from 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.510
 always but live with a very good 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.610
 yes because he is very sociable actually 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.170
 is all sides that this is what 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.940
 It strikes me that maybe this is 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.830
 of people who in the study could have 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.210
 such a reaction plus fear and be the 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.620
 Once the commissary that is 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.450
 where we prepare food for the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.690
 wrong restaurant and he lives there with 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.850
 us and if as parrot is talkative 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.460
 they repeat sounds if the talking parrots 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.460
 if they learn the healthy they repeat the 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.110
 sound of family people if this one 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.850
 it is very common we have one that 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.820
 came from a donation of in particular 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.550
 who laughs like the owner of the house or 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.140
 Sing tangos sing so good with a parrot 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.940
 singing is about to be millionaire 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.350
 the owner of heaven I pray because it's not like 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.390
 in things that like a singing in the first 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.340
 birthday but it's not that I know I have 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.750
 conscience or the question people that the 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.750
 animal have consciousness that was 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.760
 singing but repeats that sound and 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.060
 as the stimulus is the owner's laughter 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.460
 it was the food you can perceive there 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.170
 an emotion on the part of the human being that 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.760
 is all the time motivating and 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.850
 so that's why you do it again if you do not 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.709
 it's not not that it calls surely in 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.930
 particular and it's because we do not repeat a 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.700
 little now as we talk about the achievements 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.730
 the contest that we have with the zoo 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.560
 of florencio varela about the guys who 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.810
 they have to send a drawing of a deer 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.909
 autochthon and say what are the five 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.379
 deer classes indigenous to our 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:12.959
 We can give you some help because 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.849
 the truth is very difficult that people 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.560
 know what they are because we have not 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.810
 busy promoting the many to 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.660
 our native herbs one of them 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.180
 is the deer of the pampas that is the one 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.039
 it is mostly a table of vertices 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.050
 deer from the pampas and at the end of the month or 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.940
 principles of the other let's do the 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.160
 contest we are going to draw to see what 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.259
 school can go to visit this 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.070
