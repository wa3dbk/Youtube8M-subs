00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
can best pick up the sound which is nice

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.750 
can best pick up the sound which is nice
and<00:03:25.709> so<00:03:25.859> you<00:03:25.920> want<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.190> have<00:03:26.310> it<00:03:26.400> like<00:03:26.579> right

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
and so you want to have it like right

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.340 
and so you want to have it like right
down<00:03:26.940> here<00:03:27.150> in<00:03:27.239> front<00:03:27.299> of<00:03:27.570> you<00:03:27.660> in<00:03:27.989> front<00:03:28.260> of

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
down here in front of you in front of

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.650 
down here in front of you in front of
your<00:03:28.470> face<00:03:28.650> when<00:03:28.890> you're<00:03:29.010> talking<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.660> you

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
your face when you're talking and you

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.270
