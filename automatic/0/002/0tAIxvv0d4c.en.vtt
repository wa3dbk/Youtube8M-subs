gonna be roughly two foot by two foot a

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.880 
gonna be roughly two foot by two foot a
little<00:00:34.239> bit<00:00:34.390> it's<00:00:35.110> like<00:00:35.260> about<00:00:35.469> twenty<00:00:35.800> four

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890

little bit it's like about twenty four
and<00:00:36.040> a<00:00:36.070> half<00:00:36.250> by<00:00:36.640> on<00:00:36.730> one<00:00:36.880> side<00:00:37.120> and<00:00:37.420> 24<00:00:38.140> on<00:00:38.260> the

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
and a half by on one side and 24 on the

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.010 
and a half by on one side and 24 on the
other<00:00:38.500> so<00:00:38.920> not<00:00:39.610> exactly<00:00:39.730> square<00:00:40.329> but<00:00:40.690> wasn't

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
other so not exactly square but wasn't

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.260 
other so not exactly square but wasn't
really<00:00:41.200> after<00:00:41.350> square<00:00:41.800> so<00:00:42.220> one<00:00:42.880> of<00:00:42.970> the<00:00:43.030> things

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
really after square so one of the things

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.000 
really after square so one of the things
I'd<00:00:43.450> done<00:00:43.570> this<00:00:43.899> one<00:00:44.200> that<00:00:44.470> I<00:00:44.500> thought<00:00:44.800> was<00:00:44.980> a

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
I'd done this one that I thought was a

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.680 
I'd done this one that I thought was a
little<00:00:45.190> bit<00:00:45.280> different<00:00:45.489> as<00:00:45.910> opposed<00:00:46.600> to

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
little bit different as opposed to

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.330 
little bit different as opposed to
wasting<00:00:47.079> all<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.380> pocket<00:00:47.680> hole<00:00:47.829> screws<00:00:47.860> like

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
wasting all the pocket hole screws like

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.210 
wasting all the pocket hole screws like
I<00:00:48.370> got<00:00:48.520> my<00:00:48.700> first<00:00:49.000> one<00:00:49.180> I<00:00:49.390> glued<00:00:50.200> it<00:00:50.380> to<00:00:50.680> a<00:00:50.710> piece

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
I got my first one I glued it to a piece

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.110 
I got my first one I glued it to a piece
of<00:00:51.720> OSB<00:00:52.720> that<00:00:53.500> I<00:00:53.530> had<00:00:53.800> just<00:00:54.070> some<00:00:54.280> free<00:00:54.790> scrap

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
of OSB that I had just some free scrap

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.420 
of OSB that I had just some free scrap
stuff<00:00:55.420> left<00:00:55.660> over<00:00:55.870> that<00:00:56.620> I<00:00:56.649> got<00:00:56.980> from<00:00:57.280> a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
stuff left over that I got from a

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.520 
stuff left over that I got from a
factory<00:00:57.880> that<00:00:57.910> was<00:00:58.059> no<00:00:58.210> longer<00:00:58.450> using<00:00:58.750> it<00:00:58.840> so

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
factory that was no longer using it so

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.910 
factory that was no longer using it so
so<00:01:00.160> far<00:01:00.489> except<00:01:00.850> for<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.120> screws<00:01:01.920> everything

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
so far except for the screws everything

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.170 
so far except for the screws everything
and<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.129> glue<00:01:03.340> I<00:01:03.370> guess<00:01:03.640> about<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:03.940> glue

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
and the glue I guess about the glue

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.069 
and the glue I guess about the glue
everything<00:01:04.659> so<00:01:05.110> far<00:01:05.379> has<00:01:05.619> been<00:01:06.360> free<00:01:07.360> scavenge

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079 
everything so far has been free scavenge

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:10.499 
everything so far has been free scavenge
stuff<00:01:08.649> so<00:01:09.039> I<00:01:09.069> guess<00:01:09.340> I'm<00:01:09.520> up<00:01:09.729> cycling<00:01:10.060> it<00:01:10.359> as

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
stuff so I guess I'm up cycling it as

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.300 
stuff so I guess I'm up cycling it as
well<00:01:10.719> or<00:01:11.079> calling<00:01:11.439> now<00:01:11.590> as<00:01:11.889> opposed<00:01:12.219> to

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
well or calling now as opposed to

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.730 
well or calling now as opposed to
recycling<00:01:12.909> it<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.780> one<00:01:13.990> thing<00:01:14.229> I<00:01:14.380> wanted<00:01:14.679> to

saw<00:01:42.849> little<00:01:43.359> portable<00:01:43.779> contractor<00:01:44.469> saw<00:01:44.709> does

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
saw little portable contractor saw does

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.099 
saw little portable contractor saw does
not<00:01:45.789> have<00:01:46.029> an<00:01:46.179> opening<00:01:46.539> I<00:01:46.689> doubt<00:01:46.899> it's<00:01:46.990> gonna

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
not have an opening I doubt it's gonna

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:49.230 
not have an opening I doubt it's gonna
show<00:01:47.349> that<00:01:47.529> the<00:01:47.709> shaft<00:01:47.979> is<00:01:48.279> on<00:01:48.369> it<00:01:48.579> is<00:01:48.700> not<00:01:48.939> long

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
show that the shaft is on it is not long

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.289 
show that the shaft is on it is not long
enough<00:01:49.450> to<00:01:49.509> accept<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.169> dado<00:01:50.349> blade<00:01:50.679> and<00:01:51.299> that

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
enough to accept a dado blade and that

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.050 
enough to accept a dado blade and that
is<00:01:52.899> we<00:01:53.020> no<00:01:53.139> good<00:01:53.349> now<00:01:53.529> so<00:01:53.889> basically<00:01:54.340> what<00:01:54.939> I'm

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
is we no good now so basically what I'm

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.620 
is we no good now so basically what I'm
doing<00:01:55.090> is<00:01:55.810> I'm<00:01:56.499> trying<00:01:57.099> to<00:01:57.340> recreate<00:01:58.270> this

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
doing is I'm trying to recreate this

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.499 
doing is I'm trying to recreate this
myself<00:01:59.229> which<00:02:00.069> is<00:02:00.310> also<00:02:00.549> not<00:02:00.880> something<00:02:01.359> easy

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
myself which is also not something easy

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.779 
myself which is also not something easy
to<00:02:01.749> do<00:02:01.869> on<00:02:02.139> a<00:02:02.229> board<00:02:02.919> that's<00:02:03.130> warped<00:02:03.459> as<00:02:03.669> you

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
to do on a board that's warped as you

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.370 
to do on a board that's warped as you
can<00:02:03.969> see<00:02:04.299> I<00:02:04.479> don't<00:02:04.779> know<00:02:04.899> if<00:02:04.959> we<00:02:05.020> can<00:02:05.109> actually

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
can see I don't know if we can actually

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.709 
can see I don't know if we can actually
see<00:02:05.529> or<00:02:05.649> not<00:02:05.799> this<00:02:06.639> board<00:02:06.999> right<00:02:07.209> here<00:02:07.239> is

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
see or not this board right here is

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.440 
see or not this board right here is
coped<00:02:08.200> quite<00:02:08.619> a<00:02:08.649> bit<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.369> rotates<00:02:10.030> back<00:02:10.270> and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
coped quite a bit and rotates back and

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.420 
coped quite a bit and rotates back and
forth<00:02:10.690> but<00:02:11.410> what<00:02:11.620> I'm<00:02:11.710> doing<00:02:12.010> is<00:02:12.100> I<00:02:12.220> went<00:02:12.370> ahead

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
forth but what I'm doing is I went ahead

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.090 
forth but what I'm doing is I went ahead
and<00:02:12.850> just<00:02:13.000> set<00:02:13.210> my<00:02:13.360> table<00:02:13.600> saw<00:02:13.810> blade<00:02:14.290> up<00:02:14.590> it's

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
and just set my table saw blade up it's

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.080 
and just set my table saw blade up it's
running<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.460> little

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
running a little

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.690 
running a little
over<00:02:16.209> 1/4<00:02:16.450> inch<00:02:16.810> deep<00:02:17.319> I've<00:02:17.530> cut<00:02:18.069> two<00:02:18.310> grooves

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
over 1/4 inch deep I've cut two grooves

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.699 
over 1/4 inch deep I've cut two grooves
in<00:02:18.879> this<00:02:19.000> board<00:02:19.239> so<00:02:19.480> far<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:20.019> now<00:02:20.470> I'm<00:02:20.590> gonna

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
in this board so far and now I'm gonna

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.860 
in this board so far and now I'm gonna
do<00:02:20.980> is<00:02:21.160> figure<00:02:21.400> out<00:02:21.610> exactly<00:02:21.849> how<00:02:22.120> high<00:02:22.480> I<00:02:22.510> want

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
do is figure out exactly how high I want

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.309 
do is figure out exactly how high I want
this

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
this

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.430 
this
I'm<00:02:23.680> just<00:02:24.099> inching<00:02:25.060> down<00:02:25.269> so<00:02:25.810> slightly<00:02:26.260> down

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
I'm just inching down so slightly down

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.800 
I'm just inching down so slightly down
swinging<00:02:26.890> so<00:02:27.280> I<00:02:27.340> get<00:02:27.550> my<00:02:27.700> little<00:02:27.910> I'm<00:02:28.540> going

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
swinging so I get my little I'm going

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.309 
swinging so I get my little I'm going
put<00:02:28.989> a<00:02:29.019> 1/16<00:02:30.360> proud<00:02:31.360> is<00:02:31.629> what<00:02:31.840> I'm<00:02:31.900> looking<00:02:32.019> for

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
put a 1/16 proud is what I'm looking for

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.160 
put a 1/16 proud is what I'm looking for
it<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.500> be<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.970> keep<00:02:34.690> thinking<00:02:35.049> I<00:02:35.140> probably

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
it to be and I keep thinking I probably

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.449 
it to be and I keep thinking I probably
need<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.560> make<00:02:35.709> it<00:02:35.799> a<00:02:35.830> little<00:02:35.920> bit<00:02:36.069> more<00:02:36.160> proud

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
need to make it a little bit more proud

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.979 
need to make it a little bit more proud
than<00:02:36.489> that<00:02:36.790> now<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.150> just<00:02:37.390> actually<00:02:37.540> hit<00:02:37.840> me<00:02:37.959> a

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
than that now it just actually hit me a

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.839 
than that now it just actually hit me a
pretty<00:02:38.200> go<00:02:38.410> at<00:02:38.470> least<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.709> quarter<00:02:38.920> because<00:02:39.610> now

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
pretty go at least a quarter because now

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.210 
pretty go at least a quarter because now
it's<00:02:40.000> gonna<00:02:40.120> be<00:02:40.209> too<00:02:40.299> weak<00:02:41.230> on<00:02:41.530> top<00:02:41.769> there<00:02:42.040> so

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
it's gonna be too weak on top there so

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.770 
it's gonna be too weak on top there so
I'll<00:02:42.310> probably<00:02:42.430> go<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.790> quarter<00:02:43.120> proud

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
I'll probably go the quarter proud

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.240 
I'll probably go the quarter proud
which<00:02:43.989> means<00:02:44.230> this<00:02:44.410> lines<00:02:44.650> have<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:44.890> come<00:02:45.099> down

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
which means this lines have to come down

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.640 
which means this lines have to come down
here<00:02:45.280> about<00:02:45.819> another<00:02:46.150> eight<00:02:46.989> an<00:02:47.290> inch<00:02:47.470> or<00:02:47.620> so

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
here about another eight an inch or so

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.430 
here about another eight an inch or so
and<00:02:48.099> I'll<00:02:48.549> take<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:48.970> cut<00:02:49.269> once<00:02:49.900> I<00:02:50.019> get<00:02:50.140> lined

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
and I'll take that cut once I get lined

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.780 
and I'll take that cut once I get lined
up<00:02:50.620> where<00:02:50.829> I<00:02:50.860> want<00:02:51.130> I'm<00:02:51.370> setting<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.730> up

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
up where I want I'm setting it up

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.839 
up where I want I'm setting it up
against<00:02:52.239> this<00:02:52.420> board<00:02:52.690> here<00:02:53.250> from<00:02:54.250> there<00:02:54.519> I'm

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
against this board here from there I'm

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.430 
against this board here from there I'm
measuring<00:02:55.329> off<00:02:55.540> but<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.930> instant<00:02:56.380> that

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
measuring off but the instant that

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.140 
measuring off but the instant that
sixteenth<00:02:56.980> is<00:02:57.160> about<00:02:57.340> how<00:02:57.459> thick<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:57.730> wood

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
sixteenth is about how thick that wood

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.910 
sixteenth is about how thick that wood
is<00:02:58.329> they're<00:02:58.540> all<00:02:58.750> together<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.319> then<00:02:59.799> I'll

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
is they're all together and then I'll

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.190 
is they're all together and then I'll
just<00:03:00.190> keep<00:03:00.489> taking<00:03:00.970> pass<00:03:01.239> after<00:03:01.599> pass<00:03:01.629> and

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
just keep taking pass after pass and

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.110 
just keep taking pass after pass and
what<00:03:02.680> I'm<00:03:02.799> gonna<00:03:02.920> do<00:03:03.099> to<00:03:03.250> do<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.849> cheat

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
what I'm gonna do to do that to cheat

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.970 
what I'm gonna do to do that to cheat
over<00:03:04.420> here<00:03:04.599> on<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.840> saw<00:03:05.019> is<00:03:05.379> I'm<00:03:05.799> going<00:03:05.920> to

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
over here on the saw is I'm going to

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.119 
over here on the saw is I'm going to
start<00:03:06.160> off<00:03:06.280> by<00:03:06.310> putting<00:03:06.760> in<00:03:06.910> some<00:03:07.180> real<00:03:07.360> thin

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
start off by putting in some real thin

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.680 
start off by putting in some real thin
wood<00:03:09.129> all<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.489> way<00:03:09.579> up<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:09.970> you<00:03:10.599> know

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
wood all the way up to you know

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.990 
wood all the way up to you know
basically<00:03:11.019> thick<00:03:11.530> wood<00:03:11.769> until<00:03:12.549> I<00:03:12.610> get<00:03:12.819> to

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
basically thick wood until I get to

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.410 
basically thick wood until I get to
these<00:03:13.180> pieces<00:03:13.420> however<00:03:13.810> it's<00:03:14.140> gonna<00:03:14.230> take<00:03:14.500> to

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
these pieces however it's gonna take to

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.030 
these pieces however it's gonna take to
get<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.690> right<00:03:16.900> thickness<00:03:17.170> and<00:03:17.620> basically

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
get the right thickness and basically

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.930 
get the right thickness and basically
use<00:03:18.190> my<00:03:18.340> crappy<00:03:19.150> blade<00:03:19.390> as<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:20.609> dado<00:03:21.609> blade

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
use my crappy blade as a dado blade

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.670 
use my crappy blade as a dado blade
pretty<00:03:22.239> much<00:03:22.420> just<00:03:22.720> by<00:03:22.870> putting<00:03:23.260> shims

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
pretty much just by putting shims

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.949 
pretty much just by putting shims
between<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.220> fence<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.819> board<00:03:25.120> once<00:03:25.840> I

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
between the fence and the board once I

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.599 
between the fence and the board once I
get<00:03:26.109> the<00:03:26.230> fence<00:03:26.470> stood<00:03:26.680> exactly<00:03:26.859> where<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.310> want

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
get the fence stood exactly where I want

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.289 
get the fence stood exactly where I want
it<00:03:27.700> for<00:03:28.090> it's<00:03:29.130> like<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.519> bottom<00:03:30.910> width<00:03:31.120> I

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
it for it's like that the bottom width I

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.789 
it for it's like that the bottom width I
guess<00:03:31.510> is<00:03:31.720> what<00:03:31.810> I'm<00:03:31.870> looking<00:03:32.079> for<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.500> then

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
guess is what I'm looking for and then

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.800 
guess is what I'm looking for and then
I'll<00:03:32.920> reset<00:03:33.549> it<00:03:33.670> all<00:03:33.760> up<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.209> I'll<00:03:34.510> do<00:03:34.630> it<00:03:34.720> for

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
I'll reset it all up and I'll do it for

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.599 
I'll reset it all up and I'll do it for
the<00:03:34.900> top<00:03:35.109> width<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:35.709> then<00:03:35.889> from<00:03:36.099> there<00:03:36.310> I'll

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
the top width and then from there I'll

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.460 
the top width and then from there I'll
just<00:03:36.639> put<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.060> shims<00:03:37.299> in<00:03:37.540> or<00:03:37.989> even<00:03:38.230> move<00:03:38.380> the

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
just put the shims in or even move the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.050 
just put the shims in or even move the
fence<00:03:38.650> over<00:03:38.829> each<00:03:39.099> time<00:03:39.400> doesn't<00:03:39.819> bother<00:03:39.970> me

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
fence over each time doesn't bother me

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.110 
fence over each time doesn't bother me
long<00:03:40.450> as<00:03:40.569> I<00:03:40.690> get<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.680> top<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.430> bottom<00:03:42.760> exactly

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
long as I get the top and bottom exactly

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.180 
long as I get the top and bottom exactly
where<00:03:43.389> I<00:03:43.450> want<00:03:43.720> it<00:03:43.810> I'll<00:03:43.989> run<00:03:44.500> all<00:03:44.739> four<00:03:44.799> of<00:03:45.130> my

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
where I want it I'll run all four of my

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.129 
where I want it I'll run all four of my
boards<00:03:45.549> through<00:03:45.819> it<00:03:45.910> that<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.060> need<00:03:46.150> once

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
the tip of my thumb is the difference

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.680 
the tip of my thumb is the difference
between<00:04:24.010> how<00:04:24.640> far<00:04:24.909> down<00:04:25.150> it's<00:04:25.330> pushing<00:04:25.539> that

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
between how far down it's pushing that

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.170 
between how far down it's pushing that
board<00:04:26.050> at<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:26.950> very<00:04:27.130> end<00:04:27.340> because<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.849> war

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.450 
board at the very end because the war
so<00:04:28.539> I'll<00:04:29.199> have<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.500> go<00:04:29.590> back<00:04:29.800> in<00:04:30.009> and<00:04:30.100> recut

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
so I'll have to go back in and recut

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.950 
so I'll have to go back in and recut
that<00:04:30.669> actually<00:04:31.090> I'll<00:04:31.150> pry<00:04:31.300> cut<00:04:31.509> that<00:04:31.600> into<00:04:31.810> off

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
that actually I'll pry cut that into off

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.480 
that actually I'll pry cut that into off
a<00:04:31.990> won't<00:04:32.320> matter<00:04:32.470> because<00:04:32.979> you<00:04:33.160> can<00:04:33.190> see<00:04:33.370> it's

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
a won't matter because you can see it's

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.740 
a won't matter because you can see it's
splitting<00:04:33.850> out<00:04:33.940> pretty<00:04:34.210> good<00:04:34.419> so<00:04:34.570> I'm<00:04:34.630> gonna

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
splitting out pretty good so I'm gonna

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.300 
splitting out pretty good so I'm gonna
pray<00:04:34.960> cut<00:04:35.169> the<00:04:35.289> board<00:04:35.470> back<00:04:35.680> to<00:04:35.860> here<00:04:36.100> so<00:04:36.220> it's

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
pray cut the board back to here so it's

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.370 
pray cut the board back to here so it's
gonna<00:04:36.400> steal<00:04:37.300> a<00:04:37.330> little<00:04:37.690> bit<00:04:37.810> of<00:04:37.900> that<00:04:37.960> problem

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
gonna steal a little bit of that problem

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.020 
gonna steal a little bit of that problem
out<00:04:38.740> of<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:38.949> way<00:04:39.100> for<00:04:39.160> me<00:04:39.430> soon<00:04:39.610> as<00:04:39.729> I<00:04:39.789> get<00:04:39.940> it
