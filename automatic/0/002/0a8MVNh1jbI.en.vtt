goes<00:00:51.420> we're<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> left<00:00:51.989> side<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> bike

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
goes we're on the left side of the bike

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.410 
goes we're on the left side of the bike
not<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.280> right<00:00:53.460> side<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.030> old<00:00:54.210> clutch

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.290 
not the right side like the old clutch
cable<00:00:54.629> did<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:56.399> cable<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.910> comes<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
cable did the cable that comes in the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.299 
cable did the cable that comes in the
kit<00:00:57.329> because<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.320> meant<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.739> different

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
kit because it's meant for a different

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.950 
kit because it's meant for a different
model<00:00:59.820> of<00:01:00.030> bike<00:01:02.270> needs<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> little<00:01:03.719> bit

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
model of bike needs to be a little bit

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.780 
model of bike needs to be a little bit
longer<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.129> what<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:05.460> do<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.670> we

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
longer for that so what we do is we

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.890 
longer for that so what we do is we
route<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> left<00:01:06.450> side<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.780> bike

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
route it on the left side of the bike

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.289 
route it on the left side of the bike
and<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.140> works<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.500> fine<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.729> here<00:01:09.000> I'm<00:01:09.119> going

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
and it works just fine so here I'm going

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:31.030 
and it works just fine so here I'm going
to<00:01:09.360> take<00:01:09.570> off<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:11.340> bolts<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.850> hold<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.180> tank

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.030 
way down there's another plastic clip
that<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:03.730> can<00:03:03.910> sit<00:03:04.090> in<00:03:04.470> I'm<00:03:05.470> going<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.710> take<00:03:05.860> it

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
that I can sit in I'm going to take it

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.390 
that I can sit in I'm going to take it
underneath<00:03:06.400> here<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.930> like<00:03:08.800> I<00:03:08.920> said<00:03:08.980> in<00:03:09.280> my

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
underneath here and like I said in my

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.450 
underneath here and like I said in my
previous<00:03:09.610> post<00:03:10.030> I<00:03:10.300> took<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.660> around<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.140> boss

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
previous post I took it around the boss

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.330 
previous post I took it around the boss
or<00:03:12.460> the<00:03:12.730> bolt<00:03:12.970> for<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.570> seat<00:03:13.780> goes<00:03:14.140> into<00:03:14.620> and

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
or the bolt for the seat goes into and

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.210 
or the bolt for the seat goes into and
then<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.700> comes<00:03:16.030> down<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:17.590> it<00:03:17.680> lines<00:03:17.920> up<00:03:18.160> with

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
then it comes down and it lines up with

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.400 
then it comes down and it lines up with
the<00:03:18.400> slave<00:03:18.640> cylinder<00:03:18.940> just<00:03:19.420> perfect<00:03:19.930> it

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
the slave cylinder just perfect it

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.410 
the slave cylinder just perfect it
leaves<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.770> bleeder<00:03:20.980> valve<00:03:21.420> sticking

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
leaves the bleeder valve sticking

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:30.630 
leaves the bleeder valve sticking
straight<00:03:22.660> out<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:23.290> it's<00:03:23.440> easy<00:03:23.620> to<00:03:23.710> bleed<00:03:29.640> and

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
straight out so it's easy to bleed and

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.340 
straight out so it's easy to bleed and
that's<00:03:30.850> basically<00:03:31.300> how<00:03:31.540> it's<00:03:31.750> routed<00:03:32.050> on<00:03:32.140> my

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
that's basically how it's routed on my

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.440 
that's basically how it's routed on my
bike<00:03:32.560> I<00:03:32.830> have<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.370> fill<00:03:33.580> it<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:33.790> bleed<00:03:34.060> it<00:03:34.270> I

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
bike I have to fill it and bleed it I

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.110 
bike I have to fill it and bleed it I
haven't<00:03:34.810> done<00:03:34.990> that<00:03:35.050> yet<00:03:35.790> but<00:03:36.790> I'm<00:03:36.940> pretty

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
haven't done that yet but I'm pretty

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.500 
haven't done that yet but I'm pretty
sure<00:03:37.300> it's<00:03:37.420> gonna<00:03:37.510> work<00:03:37.720> out<00:03:37.870> just<00:03:37.930> fine

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
sure it's gonna work out just fine

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.050 
sure it's gonna work out just fine
again<00:03:40.890> if<00:03:41.890> you<00:03:41.980> focus<00:03:42.400> on<00:03:42.550> this<00:03:42.790> rod<00:03:43.030> right

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
again if you focus on this rod right

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.130 
again if you focus on this rod right
here<00:03:43.440> do<00:03:44.440> not<00:03:44.470> bend<00:03:44.920> this<00:03:45.750> so<00:03:46.750> if<00:03:46.930> you're<00:03:47.050> going

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
here do not bend this so if you're going

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.760 
here do not bend this so if you're going
to<00:03:47.200> tighten<00:03:47.590> up<00:03:47.680> your<00:03:48.390> banjo<00:03:49.390> bolt<00:03:49.660> do<00:03:50.440> it<00:03:50.590> with

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
to tighten up your banjo bolt do it with

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.490 
to tighten up your banjo bolt do it with
this<00:03:50.950> whole<00:03:51.400> slave<00:03:51.760> cylinder<00:03:52.030> detached<00:03:52.720> so

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
this whole slave cylinder detached so

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.930 
this whole slave cylinder detached so
now<00:03:53.620> you<00:03:53.680> can<00:03:53.890> hold<00:03:54.010> it<00:03:54.160> in<00:03:54.220> your<00:03:54.340> hand<00:03:54.550> or<00:03:54.790> put

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
now you can hold it in your hand or put

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.430 
now you can hold it in your hand or put
a<00:03:54.970> wrench<00:03:55.209> on<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.480> outside<00:03:55.780> of<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:55.959> housing

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
a wrench on the outside of the housing

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.979 
a wrench on the outside of the housing
if<00:03:57.370> you<00:03:57.520> bend<00:03:57.730> this<00:03:57.850> rod<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.510> slave<00:03:58.750> cylinder

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
if you bend this rod the slave cylinder

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:05.250 
if you bend this rod the slave cylinder
won't<00:03:59.290> work<00:03:59.440> anymore<00:03:59.709> and<00:04:03.600> you<00:04:04.600> can<00:04:04.780> see<00:04:04.959> that

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
won't work anymore and you can see that

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.050 
won't work anymore and you can see that
the<00:04:05.410> slave<00:04:05.650> cylinder<00:04:05.920> fits<00:04:06.459> into<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:06.910> same

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
the slave cylinder fits into the same

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.090 
the slave cylinder fits into the same
bracket<00:04:07.510> where<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.720> clutch<00:04:07.900> cable<00:04:08.140> was<00:04:10.020> and

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
bracket where the clutch cable was and

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.620 
bracket where the clutch cable was and
the<00:04:12.100> other<00:04:12.250> end<00:04:12.550> has<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:12.940> fitting<00:04:13.239> on<00:04:13.330> it<00:04:13.480> just

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
the other end has the fitting on it just

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.600 
the other end has the fitting on it just
like<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.900> cable<00:04:14.230> did<00:04:14.440> and<00:04:15.100> it<00:04:15.220> sits<00:04:15.370> inside

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
like the cable did and it sits inside

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.199 
like the cable did and it sits inside
the<00:04:15.760> clutch<00:04:16.030> arm<00:04:16.239> just<00:04:16.570> like<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.840> cable<00:04:17.620> did

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
the clutch arm just like the cable did

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.300 
the clutch arm just like the cable did
that's<00:04:19.209> pretty<00:04:19.419> much<00:04:19.540> it<00:04:19.859> like<00:04:20.859> I<00:04:20.950> said<00:04:21.160> the

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
that's pretty much it like I said the

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.680 
that's pretty much it like I said the
riving<00:04:21.609> is<00:04:21.700> fairly<00:04:21.910> simple<00:04:22.240> there's<00:04:22.570> already

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
riving is fairly simple there's already

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.909 
riving is fairly simple there's already
clips<00:04:23.020> there<00:04:23.200> for<00:04:23.410> you<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:23.590> use<00:04:23.940> so<00:04:24.940> uh<00:04:25.919> go

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
clips there for you to use so uh go

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.320 
clips there for you to use so uh go
ahead<00:04:26.980> and<00:04:27.070> tackle<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.460> job<00:04:27.669> it's<00:04:28.060> a<00:04:28.120> piece<00:04:28.270> of

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
ahead and tackle the job it's a piece of

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.510 
ahead and tackle the job it's a piece of
cake
