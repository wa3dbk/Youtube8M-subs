hardware so these I actually got from

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.220 
hardware so these I actually got from
the<00:00:17.400> hardware<00:00:17.490> store<00:00:17.699> these<00:00:18.270> are<00:00:18.330> actual<00:00:18.990> jump

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
actually use anything as long it has a

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.400 
actually use anything as long it has a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
is three pieces of one yard of any court

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.360 
is three pieces of one yard of any court

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.649 

nice<00:01:27.710> neat<00:01:28.039> knot<00:01:28.310> we're<00:01:29.030> just<00:01:29.210> gonna<00:01:29.359> pull

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
nice neat knot we're just gonna pull

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.539 
nice neat knot we're just gonna pull
each<00:01:29.869> one<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:30.560> time<00:01:30.950> it<00:01:31.819> it<00:01:32.149> looks<00:01:32.299> like<00:01:32.359> that

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
each one and time it it looks like that

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.300 
each one and time it it looks like that
so<00:01:34.549> then<00:01:34.789> I'm<00:01:35.119> going<00:01:35.149> to<00:01:36.009> for<00:01:37.009> this<00:01:37.130> you'll

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
so then I'm going to for this you'll

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.569 
so then I'm going to for this you'll
probably<00:01:37.340> need<00:01:37.640> a<00:01:37.670> clipboard<00:01:38.060> just<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:39.579> hold

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
probably need a clipboard just to hold

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.999 
probably need a clipboard just to hold
it<00:01:40.759> while<00:01:40.880> you're<00:01:41.090> breeding<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.719> cord<00:01:42.009> so

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
it while you're breeding the cord so

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.679 
it while you're breeding the cord so
basically<00:01:43.459> this<00:01:43.880> is<00:01:43.939> just<00:01:44.270> like<00:01:44.359> braiding

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
basically this is just like braiding

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.270 
basically this is just like braiding
hair<00:01:44.929> but<00:01:45.200> for<00:01:45.229> those<00:01:45.590> who<00:01:45.649> don't<00:01:46.009> know<00:01:46.069> how<00:01:46.219> to

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
hair but for those who don't know how to

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.940 
hair but for those who don't know how to
braid<00:01:46.490> hair<00:01:46.729> you<00:01:47.509> have<00:01:47.750> three<00:01:48.140> strands<00:01:48.799> and

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
braid hair you have three strands and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.569 
braid hair you have three strands and
you're<00:01:49.099> always<00:01:49.280> going<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:51.729> bring<00:01:52.729> one<00:01:53.179> over

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
you're always going to bring one over

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.429 
you're always going to bring one over
then<00:01:55.579> so<00:01:55.939> the<00:01:56.060> left<00:01:56.240> side<00:01:56.450> over<00:01:56.659> to<00:01:57.079> the<00:01:57.170> middle

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
then so the left side over to the middle

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.410 
then so the left side over to the middle
and<00:01:57.590> that<00:01:57.709> becomes<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:58.129> middle<00:01:58.369> and<00:01:58.579> then<00:01:59.179> the

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
and that becomes the middle and then the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.020 
and that becomes the middle and then the
right<00:01:59.629> side<00:01:59.950> so<00:02:00.950> you're<00:02:01.099> just<00:02:01.189> alt<00:02:01.429> whichever

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
right side so you're just alt whichever

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.789 
right side so you're just alt whichever
one<00:02:02.209> that<00:02:02.239> you<00:02:02.479> bring<00:02:02.719> to<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.200> middle<00:02:03.409> becomes

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
one that you bring to the middle becomes

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.559 
one that you bring to the middle becomes
the<00:02:04.009> middle<00:02:04.219> color<00:02:04.429> and<00:02:04.700> then<00:02:05.119> you<00:02:05.239> just<00:02:05.420> bring

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
the middle color and then you just bring

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.139 
the middle color and then you just bring
each<00:02:05.810> side<00:02:06.079> over<00:02:06.469> so<00:02:07.250> you<00:02:07.310> separate<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:07.909> three

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
each side over so you separate the three

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.389 
each side over so you separate the three
strands<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:08.929> we're<00:02:09.590> going<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:09.739> take<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.099> left

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
strands and we're going to take the left

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.960 
strands and we're going to take the left
strand<00:02:10.759> over<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:12.140> center<00:02:12.799> strand<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:16.760> the

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
strand over the center strand so the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.759 
strand over the center strand so the
left<00:02:17.180> strand<00:02:17.420> is<00:02:17.569> now<00:02:17.750> your<00:02:18.049> Center<00:02:18.500> strand

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
left strand is now your Center strand

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.470 
left strand is now your Center strand
and<00:02:19.069> then<00:02:19.640> you're<00:02:19.760> gonna<00:02:19.849> take<00:02:20.090> your<00:02:20.420> right

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
and then you're gonna take your right

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.150 
and then you're gonna take your right
strand<00:02:21.140> over<00:02:22.030> your<00:02:23.030> new<00:02:23.329> Center<00:02:23.900> strand<00:02:24.230> so

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
strand over your new Center strand so

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.979 
strand over your new Center strand so
basically<00:02:25.489> it's<00:02:25.700> just<00:02:25.790> moving<00:02:26.090> from<00:02:26.480> one<00:02:26.720> side

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
basically it's just moving from one side

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.309 
basically it's just moving from one side
to<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:28.280> middle<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:28.879> then<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.690> other<00:02:29.840> side<00:02:30.109> to

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
to the middle and then the other side to

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.699 
to the middle and then the other side to
the<00:02:30.410> middle<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.690> then<00:02:32.690> it's<00:02:33.290> up<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.470> you<00:02:33.650> if

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
the middle and then it's up to you if

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.819 
the middle and then it's up to you if
you<00:02:33.829> want<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.160> tighter<00:02:34.489> braid<00:02:34.880> or<00:02:35.359> a<00:02:35.829> looser

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
you want a tighter braid or a looser

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.190 
you want a tighter braid or a looser
braid<00:02:36.980> that's<00:02:37.310> totally<00:02:38.239> up<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.930> and

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
braid that's totally up to you and

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:48.080 
braid that's totally up to you and
depends<00:02:39.950> on<00:02:40.190> your<00:02:42.700> design

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.670 

it's<00:02:48.600> just<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.780> little<00:02:49.020> hard<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.410> manipulate

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
it's just a little hard to manipulate

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.820 
it's just a little hard to manipulate
cuz<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.100> gotta<00:02:50.220> hold<00:02:50.400> everything<00:02:50.790> down<00:02:50.970> you

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
cuz you gotta hold everything down you

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.080 
cuz you gotta hold everything down you
can<00:02:52.830> start<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.190> can<00:02:53.340> do<00:02:53.610> something<00:02:53.940> with<00:02:53.970> a

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
can start you can do something with a

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.230 
can start you can do something with a
lot<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.660> washers<00:02:55.260> or<00:02:55.560> just<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.130> few<00:02:56.370> washers<00:02:56.819> so

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.160 

these<00:03:00.240> are<00:03:00.390> from<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.600> hardware<00:03:00.840> store<00:03:01.020> so<00:03:01.080> the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
these are from the hardware store so the

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.360 
these are from the hardware store so the
more<00:03:01.319> you<00:03:01.440> put<00:03:01.620> on<00:03:01.650> it's<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.860> little<00:03:02.069> heavy

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
more you put on it's a little heavy

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.330 
more you put on it's a little heavy
there's<00:03:02.550> zinc<00:03:03.770> so<00:03:04.770> for<00:03:04.950> something<00:03:05.130> like<00:03:05.220> this

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
there's zinc so for something like this

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.130 
there's zinc so for something like this
I<00:03:05.489> probably<00:03:05.640> wouldn't<00:03:05.970> use<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.090> many<00:03:06.569> just

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
I probably wouldn't use that many just

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.330 
I probably wouldn't use that many just
because<00:03:08.390> they<00:03:09.390> would<00:03:09.540> be<00:03:09.660> really<00:03:09.959> heavy<00:03:10.340> okay

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
because they would be really heavy okay

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.970 
because they would be really heavy okay
so<00:03:11.400> now<00:03:11.580> I'm<00:03:11.670> gonna<00:03:11.790> start<00:03:11.880> adding<00:03:12.450> my<00:03:12.569> first

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
so now I'm gonna start adding my first

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:21.590 
so now I'm gonna start adding my first
washer<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.280> I'm<00:03:14.489> going<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:20.150> -<00:03:21.150> I'm<00:03:21.420> going<00:03:21.540> to

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
washer so I'm going to - I'm going to

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.930 
washer so I'm going to - I'm going to
add<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.110> right<00:03:22.320> side<00:03:22.590> I'm<00:03:22.950> going<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.400> add

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
add to the right side I'm going to add

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:31.580 
add to the right side I'm going to add
the<00:03:24.720> washer<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:29.750> then<00:03:30.750> I'm<00:03:30.870> going<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.290> bring

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
the washer and then I'm going to bring

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:40.160 
the washer and then I'm going to bring
it<00:03:31.800> over<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.489> middle<00:03:37.580> then<00:03:38.810> I'm<00:03:39.810> going<00:03:40.110> to

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
it over to the middle then I'm going to

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:48.730 
it over to the middle then I'm going to
add<00:03:40.350> a<00:03:40.380> washer<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.220> left<00:03:41.550> side

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.960 

so<00:03:49.740> here's<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.160> tricky<00:03:50.490> part<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:50.760> want<00:03:50.910> to

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
so here's the tricky part you want to

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.530 
so here's the tricky part you want to

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
they're all going in the same direction

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.330 
they're all going in the same direction
the<00:03:56.400> washers<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:58.440> then<00:03:58.860> I'm<00:03:59.010> gonna<00:03:59.160> bring

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.160 
that to the middle so you see how
they're<00:04:03.090> like<00:04:03.690> this<00:04:05.600> that's<00:04:06.600> what<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:06.959> want

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
to make sure again that it's gonna be

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.820 
to make sure again that it's gonna be
stacked<00:04:36.240> up

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.640

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
going to continue breeding without the

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.649 
going to continue breeding without the
washers<00:04:56.479> and<00:04:57.490> now<00:04:58.490> because<00:04:59.270> I'm<00:04:59.330> getting<00:04:59.449> to

00:04:59.649 --> 00:04:59.659 
washers and now because I'm getting to

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:01.149 
washers and now because I'm getting to
the<00:04:59.690> bottom<00:04:59.780> of<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.199> board<00:05:00.409> I<00:05:00.530> need<00:05:00.620> more<00:05:00.979> of<00:05:01.069> a

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:35.800 
grip on the whole thing and then we just
continue<00:05:21.430> braiding<00:05:31.599> you<00:05:32.599> can<00:05:34.780> decide<00:05:35.780> to

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
continue braiding you can decide to

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.360 
continue braiding you can decide to
leave<00:05:36.020> like<00:05:36.229> a<00:05:36.289> longer<00:05:36.740> fringe<00:05:37.039> and<00:05:37.250> add

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
leave like a longer fringe and add

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.869 
leave like a longer fringe and add
little<00:05:37.610> beads<00:05:37.879> on<00:05:38.120> them<00:05:39.490> that's<00:05:40.490> one<00:05:40.729> of<00:05:40.849> your

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:40.879 
little beads on them that's one of your

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:42.580 
little beads on them that's one of your
options<00:05:41.449> and<00:05:41.629> you<00:05:41.810> would<00:05:42.020> stop<00:05:42.289> braiding

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
options and you would stop braiding

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.459 
options and you would stop braiding
earlier<00:05:43.719> and<00:05:44.719> then<00:05:44.840> we're<00:05:44.930> going<00:05:45.020> to<00:05:45.080> stop<00:05:45.319> it

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:45.469 
earlier and then we're going to stop it

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:48.129 
earlier and then we're going to stop it
over<00:05:45.680> here<00:05:45.949> for<00:05:46.130> now<00:05:46.279> and<00:05:46.870> then<00:05:47.870> you<00:05:47.960> want<00:05:48.110> to

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
over here for now and then you want to

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.409 
over here for now and then you want to
just<00:05:48.259> kind<00:05:48.500> of<00:05:48.620> straighten<00:05:49.219> it<00:05:49.310> by<00:05:49.880> pulling<00:05:50.330> it

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
just kind of straighten it by pulling it

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.600 
just kind of straighten it by pulling it
a<00:05:50.479> little<00:05:50.690> bit<00:05:50.810> just<00:05:50.990> to<00:05:51.139> loosen<00:05:51.169> it<00:05:51.620> just<00:05:52.520> to

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
a little bit just to loosen it just to

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.209 
a little bit just to loosen it just to
make<00:05:52.729> the<00:05:52.819> tension<00:05:53.330> all<00:05:53.539> even<00:05:54.229> and<00:05:55.039> then<00:05:55.159> you

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:55.219 
make the tension all even and then you

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:57.580 
make the tension all even and then you
see<00:05:55.370> how<00:05:55.490> your<00:05:55.699> washers<00:05:56.599> are<00:05:56.719> all<00:05:56.930> nicely

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
see how your washers are all nicely

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:07.059 
see how your washers are all nicely
stacked

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:07.069 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:16.409 

just<00:06:08.069> make<00:06:08.220> a<00:06:08.250> knot

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:26.409 

okay<00:06:17.440> and<00:06:18.440> then<00:06:18.800> this<00:06:19.069> I<00:06:24.970> need<00:06:25.970> you<00:06:26.060> to<00:06:26.180> just

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
okay and then this I need you to just

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:33.790 
okay and then this I need you to just
tie<00:06:26.900> it<00:06:26.960> here<00:06:32.050> and<00:06:33.050> I<00:06:33.110> think<00:06:33.169> this<00:06:33.380> style<00:06:33.590> sort

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
tie it here and I think this style sort

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.890 
tie it here and I think this style sort
of<00:06:33.919> works<00:06:34.069> well<00:06:34.280> with<00:06:34.490> these<00:06:34.699> um<00:06:34.940> dangles<00:06:35.750> so

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
of works well with these um dangles so

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.980 
of works well with these um dangles so
that's<00:06:36.199> why<00:06:36.319> I<00:06:36.349> can<00:06:36.530> do<00:06:36.680> the<00:06:36.830> closure<00:06:37.990> could

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
that's why I can do the closure could

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.960 
that's why I can do the closure could
use<00:06:39.199> you<00:06:39.440> know<00:06:39.470> three<00:06:40.039> different<00:06:40.160> color<00:06:40.580> cord

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
use you know three different color cord

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.390 
use you know three different color cord
all<00:06:41.240> the<00:06:41.840> same<00:06:42.110> color<00:06:42.349> cord<00:06:42.680> so<00:06:43.009> it<00:06:43.099> looks<00:06:43.250> like

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
all the same color cord so it looks like

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.339 
all the same color cord so it looks like
this<00:06:43.580> this<00:06:43.940> one<00:06:44.120> I<00:06:44.180> did<00:06:44.330> graduate<00:06:44.569> at<00:06:45.080> jump

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:45.349 
this this one I did graduate at jump

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:48.580 
this this one I did graduate at jump
rings<00:06:45.620> so<00:06:45.889> they're<00:06:46.520> large<00:06:47.330> medium<00:06:48.050> to<00:06:48.349> small

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
rings so they're large medium to small

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.630 
rings so they're large medium to small
or<00:06:49.550> all<00:06:50.000> the<00:06:50.240> same<00:06:50.419> size
