00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.200
 hello live on stopgame.ru and we 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.330
 continue our report from football 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.699
 arenas somewhere on planet earth where 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.160
 team of idiots continues desperate at 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.320
 his absurdity match with the team 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.390
 idiots across the field are running cow fans all 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.400
 explodes and smokes and I don't know what it is 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.960
 for football so well that it went all 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.940
 nafig I probably quit something like that 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.230
 would feel themselves football commentators 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.559
 if they were there for their happiness here 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.840
 no as arbiters and so ladies and gentlemen i 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.820
 presenting you an alternative look at 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.840
 most popular sports entertainment 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.730
 in the world of food lab and yes you heard right 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.820
 exactly lol 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.129
 what kind of beast is this first 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.500
 not a sports simulator in any way 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.570
 control in the game is generally not direct and 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.070
 more like a kind of simulator 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.989
 god simply put 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.170
 players scamper across the field by themselves 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.450
 it is impossible to manage them directly 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.640
 but you can not undermine them 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.590
 put a portal under their feet to fall on 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.170
 head meteorite slap all the grass 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.970
 strange green slurry and create mass 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.810
 other non-football and not at all 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.830
 sports obscene why to glory 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.229
 Satan and of course not really to 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.610
 win because the opponent because 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.579
 possesses such powers 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.200
 may not be exactly like that but 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.390
 and generally you can take the match 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.920
 limited number of forces for each of 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.500
 they have a limited amount 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.990
 applications and that's when you have open 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.299
 pieces of 6 at least various effects 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.530
 involuntarily you start to think that 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.619
 take with you 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.659
 and in what ratios and suddenly 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.850
 it turns out that the game is not only fun 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.189
 but also tactful and not in the sense that 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.689
 manner is not and highly secular sense that 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.299
 before each fight must be thoughtful 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.729
 pick up a skill set they just poke 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.770
 from the bald and the skill is not bad so 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.110
 balanced and develop some 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.349
 God forbid a combination against which no one 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.410
 nothing can almost impossible 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:17.280
 so in a sense every round 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.660
 well, or a match in general, each batch on 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.239
 really represents 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.430
 some kind of card game in which 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.110
 It is necessary to estimate approximately what can take 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.540
 your opponent to have some 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.970
 means of counteracting his aggression and 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.940
 think up what method you will attack 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.160
 myself though realistic for note here 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.080
 what 's a tactical card game 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.920
 perceived multiplayer part 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.840
 football 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.720
 when you pass the plot single 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.480
 the company feels a little different because 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.220
 that there are a little more different modes then 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.989
 there are most matches there as in 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.330
 multiplayer occurs under one and the same 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.769
 same motto after three minutes you 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.080
 must defeat the enemy 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.239
 however, other incidents happen. 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.610
 for example finish a match with a certain 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.400
 score or score five goals more 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.319
 rival here here already has a very 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.269
 carefully observe that 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.510
 get up little people on the screen 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:12.629
 so that they, God forbid, do not beat too much 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.940
 hunger and that's it all together in single 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.610
 that in multiplayer it is very entertaining 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.670
 as the game as a whole is necessary here 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.590
 understand food lol it is not saints row 4 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.870
 which immediately takes a course on total 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.090
 madness all look'ov it's just fun 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.030
 pleasant arcade to with a touch of madness 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.860
 in its own way, honey is understandable and without donat or 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.440
 some kind of burdensome for steam 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.720
 came from work in the evening of strength with 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.330
 I enjoyed playing a couple of matches 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.330
 got how much play money you went 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.430
 a little pumped up before pumping here 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.230
 too 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.480
 simple but diversified 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.879
 on the one hand, you can pump your 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.040
 team to run faster sculpted sword 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.260
 and on the other hand you can pump 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.330
 yourself to get more money per match 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.310
 from the third party you can open 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.409
 additional slot for special abilities 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.810
 or increase the amount of use 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:06.330
 most of these special abilities in the game well, 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.519
 and of course there is customization again 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.709
 simple but enough for 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.620
 such scales can be changed form 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.549
 together with the flag hat and choose your 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.280
 players eyes 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.070
 sounds certainly not rich but in fact 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.710
 that is enough 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.800
 in general expect from football some kind there 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:26.750
 divine revelations are not worth it however 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.840
 the game and not trying to pretend to be something 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.000
 there is pretentious so if you 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.280
 like the fact that you see something boldly 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.770
 grab your legs and run to the site 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.170
 developer or vd sura where the game is already 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.650
 out or vote for her in 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.690
 greenlight and then buy the incentive 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.820
 on this i'm not saying goodbye apt fall 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.240
 meteorites to you and to aliens 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:54.760
 cows less often dragged off and see you on 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.760
 stop game room
