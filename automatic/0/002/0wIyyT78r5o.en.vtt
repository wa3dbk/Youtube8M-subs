you<00:02:54.859> know<00:02:54.980> anime<00:02:55.459> logic<00:02:55.910> one<00:02:56.690> piece<00:02:56.930> logic

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
you know anime logic one piece logic

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.680 
you know anime logic one piece logic
bullets<00:02:57.769> don't<00:02:57.980> actually<00:02:58.700> hit<00:02:59.599> ever<00:03:01.480> like<00:03:02.480> at

bullets don't actually hit ever like at

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.479 
bullets don't actually hit ever like at
all<00:03:02.720> they<00:03:03.170> just<00:03:03.319> don't<00:03:03.530> unless<00:03:04.129> like<00:03:04.370> an

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
all they just don't unless like an

all they just don't unless like an
important<00:03:05.180> character<00:03:05.569> has<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:05.720> gun<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.139> baby<00:03:06.530> 5

important character has a gun and baby 5

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.490 
important character has a gun and baby 5
is<00:03:07.099> not<00:03:07.280> important<00:03:08.030> enough<00:03:08.269> to<00:03:08.329> have<00:03:08.989> her

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
is not important enough to have her

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.610 
is not important enough to have her
bullets<00:03:10.099> actually<00:03:10.220> do<00:03:10.760> anything<00:03:11.150> ever<00:03:11.690> so<00:03:12.290> it

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
bullets actually do anything ever so it

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.069 
bullets actually do anything ever so it
is<00:03:12.920> actually<00:03:13.160> more<00:03:13.639> practical<00:03:14.299> if<00:03:14.450> we're

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
is actually more practical if we're

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.780 
is actually more practical if we're
looking<00:03:15.260> at<00:03:15.560> things<00:03:15.739> from<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.340> one<00:03:16.519> piece

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
looking at things from the one piece

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.390 
looking at things from the one piece
logic<00:03:17.329> perspective<00:03:18.019> for<00:03:18.470> her<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.829> switch<00:03:19.130> from

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
logic perspective for her to switch from

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.280 
logic perspective for her to switch from
the<00:03:19.639> guns<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.299> sites<00:03:20.599> because<00:03:20.870> now<00:03:21.230> she

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
the guns to the sites because now she

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.470 
the guns to the sites because now she
can<00:03:21.620> go<00:03:21.769> head-on<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.310> thus<00:03:22.639> ice<00:03:22.849> can<00:03:23.120> actually

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
can go head-on and thus ice can actually

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.930 
can go head-on and thus ice can actually
at<00:03:23.840> least<00:03:24.139> she<00:03:24.319> can<00:03:24.470> have<00:03:24.769> a<00:03:24.799> chance<00:03:25.160> ok<00:03:25.549> cuz<00:03:25.790> if

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
at least she can have a chance ok cuz if

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.250 
at least she can have a chance ok cuz if
you<00:03:25.970> just<00:03:26.209> shooting<00:03:26.540> him<00:03:26.720> you're<00:03:26.959> not<00:03:26.989> gonna

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
you just shooting him you're not gonna

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.080 
you just shooting him you're not gonna
get<00:03:27.739> nothing's<00:03:28.099> gonna<00:03:28.250> happen<00:03:28.459> okay<00:03:28.760> because

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
get nothing's gonna happen okay because

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.059 
get nothing's gonna happen okay because
