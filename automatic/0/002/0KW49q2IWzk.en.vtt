00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.940 

okay<00:00:02.310> when<00:00:02.550> we<00:00:02.669> started<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.810> make<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:04.319> new<00:00:04.500> CLS

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
okay when we started to make the new CLS

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.089 
okay when we started to make the new CLS
our<00:00:05.850> biggest<00:00:06.420> issue<00:00:06.480> was<00:00:06.810> whether<00:00:07.350> a

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
our biggest issue was whether a

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.299 
our biggest issue was whether a
predecessor<00:00:08.880> there<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:09.990> had<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.200> big<00:00:11.099> sister

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
predecessor there that had a big sister

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.470 
predecessor there that had a big sister
sick<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.210> big<00:00:12.630> success<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.400> therefore<00:00:14.480> was

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
sick of a big success and therefore was

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.859 
sick of a big success and therefore was
really<00:00:16.039> a<00:00:17.039> long<00:00:17.609> way<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.820> think<00:00:18.300> over<00:00:18.660> what

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
really a long way to think over what

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.480 
really a long way to think over what
could<00:00:19.619> we<00:00:19.770> change<00:00:20.779> to<00:00:21.779> make<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.170> new<00:00:22.320> car<00:00:22.590> even

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
could we change to make the new car even

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.990 
could we change to make the new car even
just<00:00:24.000> look<00:00:24.210> as<00:00:24.480> modern<00:00:24.840> as<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.859> old<00:00:26.010> one<00:00:26.279> but

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
just look as modern as the old one but

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.950 
just look as modern as the old one but
even<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:28.260> make<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.740> outstanding<00:00:29.960> four-door

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the first thing of all is the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.369 
the first thing of all is the
proportions<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.120> proportions<00:00:39.750> are<00:00:39.960> almost

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
proportions the proportions are almost

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.299 
proportions the proportions are almost
the<00:00:40.590> same<00:00:40.620> light<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> 219<00:00:42.739> me<00:00:43.739> an<00:00:43.860> actus

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
the same light on on a 219 me an actus

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.310 
the same light on on a 219 me an actus
this<00:00:44.789> might<00:00:45.030> come<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.450> segment<00:00:45.899> where

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
this might come to the segment where

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.319 
this might come to the segment where
this<00:00:46.440> high<00:00:46.680> shoulder<00:00:47.070> line<00:00:47.280> here<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:48.180> high

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
this high shoulder line here the high

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.810 
this high shoulder line here the high
shoulder<00:00:48.719> line<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.260> gives<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.710> car<00:00:49.950> that

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
shoulder line that gives the car that

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.660 
shoulder line that gives the car that
the<00:00:51.149> small<00:00:51.449> site<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.649> small<00:00:53.039> side<00:00:53.280> windows

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the small site the small side windows

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.479 
the small site the small side windows
with<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> coupe<00:00:54.570> line<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.770> rear<00:00:56.280> end

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
the CLS into the modern into the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.029 
the CLS into the modern into the
modernity<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.750> let's<00:02:01.049> come<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> side<00:02:01.710> once

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
modernity so let's come to the side once

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:11.690 
modernity so let's come to the side once
again<00:02:03.950> even<00:02:08.899> if<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.080> look<00:02:10.229> at<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.380> side<00:02:10.739> it's

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
again even if you look at the side it's

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.570 
again even if you look at the side it's
the<00:02:11.880> first<00:02:12.360> car<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:13.140> us<00:02:13.500> that<00:02:13.709> has<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.160> the

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
the first car of us that has the the

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.309 
the first car of us that has the the
dropping<00:02:14.970> line<00:02:15.180> here<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:15.630> we<00:02:15.780> have<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.019> peak

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
dropping line here so we have the peak

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.620 
dropping line here so we have the peak
of<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.709> of<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.430> character<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.209> signature

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
of the of the character of the signature

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.440 
of the of the character of the signature
line<00:02:18.840> here<00:02:19.200> it's<00:02:19.610> going<00:02:20.610> down<00:02:20.940> there<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.299> this

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
line here it's going down there and this

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.430 
line here it's going down there and this
gives<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.870> car<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:23.190> impression<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.970> our<00:02:24.870> for

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
gives the car the impression of our for

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.850 
gives the car the impression of our for
example<00:02:25.850> if<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:27.030> dress<00:02:27.360> today<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:28.380> can<00:02:28.590> dress
