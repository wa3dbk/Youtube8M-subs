00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.290 
that I just came from and it actually
has<00:04:43.180> a<00:04:43.210> spicy<00:04:43.660> taste<00:04:43.900> to<00:04:44.050> it<00:04:45.060> so<00:04:46.060> I<00:04:46.090> think<00:04:46.210> that

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
has a spicy taste to it so I think that

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.580 
has a spicy taste to it so I think that
one<00:04:46.510> might<00:04:46.630> actually<00:04:46.780> be<00:04:47.020> mustard<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:47.500> this

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
one might actually be mustard and this

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.810 
one might actually be mustard and this
is<00:04:47.770> something<00:04:48.070> else<00:04:48.190> it<00:04:48.370> almost<00:04:48.520> kind<00:04:48.700> of

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
is something else it almost kind of

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.360 
is something else it almost kind of
looks<00:04:48.970> like<00:04:49.410> collard<00:04:50.410> greens<00:04:50.650> groans<00:04:50.980> oh<00:04:51.160> that

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
looks like collard greens groans oh that

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.630 
looks like collard greens groans oh that
would<00:04:51.460> be<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:51.580> good<00:04:51.730> one<00:04:51.880> to<00:04:51.940> eat<00:04:52.150> right<00:04:52.330> there

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640
