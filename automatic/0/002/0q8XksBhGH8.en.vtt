purely<00:02:10.310> probably<00:02:10.880> because<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.360> lot<00:02:11.569> of<00:02:11.600> other

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
purely probably because a lot of other

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.990 
purely probably because a lot of other
guys<00:02:11.959> done<00:02:12.260> I'd<00:02:12.590> say<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.430> feel<00:02:13.640> like<00:02:13.670> my

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.059 
guys done I'd say and I feel like my
game<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.540> my<00:02:14.959> speed<00:02:15.230> around<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.590> court<00:02:15.830> and

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
game and my speed around the court and

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.670 
game and my speed around the court and
the<00:02:16.490> yo<00:02:17.450> really<00:02:17.750> works<00:02:17.959> well<00:02:18.140> on<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.410> grass

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680

court I think because we don't get to

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.750 
court I think because we don't get to
