00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
can put off incredible saves and then

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.439 
can put off incredible saves and then
other<00:00:50.340> times<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:50.789> lets<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.149> through<00:00:51.360> his

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.330 
other times it just lets it through his
arms<00:00:51.690> but<00:00:51.840> i'm<00:00:51.899> guessing<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.980> what<00:00:53.190> it's

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340
