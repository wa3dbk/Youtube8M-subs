it<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.979> has<00:01:44.130> three<00:01:44.430> height<00:01:44.729> positions<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.540> put

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
it it has three height positions we put

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.120 
it it has three height positions we put
it<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.229> highest<00:01:46.820> one<00:01:47.820> it'll<00:01:48.060> go<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:49.130> he's

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
it on the highest one it'll go and he's

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.450 
it on the highest one it'll go and he's
too<00:01:50.729> tall<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.299> now<00:01:51.619> his<00:01:52.619> little<00:01:53.009> feet<00:01:53.280> are

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
too tall for it now his little feet are

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.120 
too tall for it now his little feet are
like<00:01:53.729> crunched<00:01:54.420> up<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.899> he<00:01:55.079> can't<00:01:55.380> move<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.979> it

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
like crunched up and he can't move in it

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.910 
like crunched up and he can't move in it
so<00:01:56.430> he<00:01:56.759> outgrew<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.420> before<00:01:58.200> he<00:01:58.320> even<00:01:58.469> was

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
so he outgrew that before he even was

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.870 
so he outgrew that before he even was
able<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.460> get<00:01:59.610> in<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.920> third<00:02:02.130> stage<00:02:02.490> is

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
that it goes up I think two to three

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.990 
that it goes up I think two to three
years<00:02:30.870> or<00:02:31.050> something<00:02:31.170> he's<00:02:31.860> seven<00:02:32.370> months<00:02:32.790> and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
years or something he's seven months and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.870 
years or something he's seven months and
it<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.540> short<00:02:34.110> short<00:02:35.070> too<00:02:35.280> short<00:02:35.550> for<00:02:35.610> him

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
it is short short too short for him

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.750 
it is short short too short for him
already<00:02:36.030> so<00:02:36.720> if<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:36.930> make<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.500> c-shape<00:02:38.070> he's

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
already so if I make it a c-shape he's

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.270 
already so if I make it a c-shape he's
not<00:02:38.910> gonna<00:02:39.030> be<00:02:39.210> able<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.480> use<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.990> so<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:40.950> was
