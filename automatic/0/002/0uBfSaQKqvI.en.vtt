00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
people who do this but they realign or

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.960 
people who do this but they realign or
readjust<00:02:01.619> your<00:02:01.950> Atlas<00:02:02.460> bone<00:02:02.640> which<00:02:02.940> is

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
readjust your Atlas bone which is

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.570 
readjust your Atlas bone which is
essentially<00:02:03.840> your<00:02:04.470> first<00:02:04.830> vertebra<00:02:05.280> it's

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
essentially your first vertebra it's

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.520 
essentially your first vertebra it's
what<00:02:05.759> holds<00:02:06.179> your<00:02:06.390> head<00:02:06.720> up<00:02:06.929> and<00:02:07.200> apparently

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
what holds your head up and apparently

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.279 
what holds your head up and apparently
on<00:02:08.069> most<00:02:08.429> people<00:02:08.759> it's<00:02:09.090> somewhat<00:02:09.720> misaligned

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
on most people it's somewhat misaligned

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.380 
on most people it's somewhat misaligned
and<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:11.220> can<00:02:11.340> cause<00:02:11.550> all<00:02:11.880> different<00:02:12.180> kinds

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
and that can cause all different kinds

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.770 
and that can cause all different kinds
of<00:02:12.480> health<00:02:12.690> issues<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:14.580> can<00:02:14.819> like<00:02:15.269> impair<00:02:15.750> your

moving apparently you know having your

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.280 
moving apparently you know having your
Atlas<00:02:50.189> bone<00:02:50.400> misaligned<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.540> can<00:02:51.810> impair<00:02:52.230> your

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
Atlas bone misaligned it can impair your

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.619 
Atlas bone misaligned it can impair your
brain<00:02:52.799> function<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.639> it<00:02:53.790> like<00:02:54.000> messes<00:02:54.480> up

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
brain function and it like messes up

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.080 
brain function and it like messes up
your<00:02:55.379> spine<00:02:55.709> obviously<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.519> all<00:02:56.639> kinds<00:02:57.030> of

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
your spine obviously and all kinds of

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.420 
your spine obviously and all kinds of
different<00:02:57.450> things<00:02:57.629> that<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.900> just<00:02:58.829> cannot

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
different things that I just cannot

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.330 
different things that I just cannot
eloquently<00:03:00.349> described<00:03:01.349> because<00:03:01.799> I<00:03:01.950> probably

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
eloquently described because I probably

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.399 
eloquently described because I probably
didn't<00:03:02.819> research<00:03:03.209> it<00:03:03.450> but<00:03:03.659> I<00:03:03.689> trust<00:03:04.019> my<00:03:04.230> mother

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
didn't research it but I trust my mother

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.500 
didn't research it but I trust my mother
um<00:03:04.889> but<00:03:05.280> anyway<00:03:05.489> she<00:03:05.669> believes<00:03:05.939> strongly<00:03:06.329> that

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
um but anyway she believes strongly that

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.699 
um but anyway she believes strongly that
this<00:03:06.780> would<00:03:06.930> help<00:03:07.019> me<00:03:07.200> because<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.590> have

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
this would help me because I have

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.179 
this would help me because I have
scoliosis<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:09.530> basically<00:03:10.530> on<00:03:10.829> my<00:03:10.859> first

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
scoliosis and basically on my first

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.520 
scoliosis and basically on my first
visit<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:11.819> went<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.419> they<00:03:12.569> took<00:03:13.200> this<00:03:13.349> little

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
visit I went and they took this little

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.699 
visit I went and they took this little
device<00:03:13.769> and<00:03:14.340> scanned<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.139> guess<00:03:16.319> see<00:03:16.500> how

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
device and scanned to I guess see how

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.800 
device and scanned to I guess see how
misaligned<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.370> was<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:17.909> then<00:03:18.329> they<00:03:18.689> took

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
misaligned it was and then they took

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.690 
misaligned it was and then they took
another<00:03:19.049> little<00:03:19.409> device<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.680> jabbed<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.489> into

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
another little device and jabbed it into

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.580 
another little device and jabbed it into
place<00:03:20.939> do<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.359> like<00:03:21.540> how<00:03:21.780> I'm<00:03:22.169> describing

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
place do you like how I'm describing

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.500 
place do you like how I'm describing
these<00:03:23.010> things<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:23.639> now<00:03:23.790> I'm<00:03:23.909> going<00:03:24.120> back<00:03:24.329> with

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
these things so now I'm going back with

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.449 
these things so now I'm going back with
my<00:03:24.629> mom<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.049> they're<00:03:25.139> gonna<00:03:25.319> scan<00:03:25.650> us<00:03:26.010> again

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
my mom and they're gonna scan us again

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.839 
my mom and they're gonna scan us again
and<00:03:26.790> see<00:03:27.209> if<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:28.019> bone<00:03:28.290> stayed<00:03:28.769> aligned<00:03:29.549> like

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
and see if the bone stayed aligned like

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.369 
and see if the bone stayed aligned like
after<00:03:30.180> they<00:03:30.299> relined<00:03:30.689> it<00:03:30.840> or<00:03:31.049> if<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.349> shifted

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
after they relined it or if it shifted

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.250 
after they relined it or if it shifted
back<00:03:32.040> out<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.280> place<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:33.000> see<00:03:33.959> if<00:03:34.019> they<00:03:34.139> need

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
back out of place and see if they need

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.599 
back out of place and see if they need
to<00:03:34.409> adjust<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:34.769> again<00:03:35.010> come<00:03:35.340> up<00:03:35.370> with<00:03:35.579> a

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
to adjust it again come up with a

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.030 
to adjust it again come up with a
treatment<00:03:35.909> plan<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:37.169> don't<00:03:37.199> know<00:03:37.440> we're

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
treatment plan and I don't know we're

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.710 
treatment plan and I don't know we're
gonna<00:03:38.129> see<00:03:38.400> I<00:03:38.549> have<00:03:38.699> no<00:03:38.879> idea<00:03:39.180> what's<00:03:39.359> going<00:03:39.599> on

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720

I didn't know what to expect when I went

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.250 
I didn't know what to expect when I went
the<00:03:41.159> first<00:03:41.370> time<00:03:41.489> so<00:03:42.000> it's<00:03:42.540> kind<00:03:42.810> of<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.989> weird
