00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.370
 you told me an anecdote about 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.430
 the guitars I would like to hear it if 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.160
 this one tell a friend that here when 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:17.480
 they sent some good guys just 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.699
 when I was to be founded here that 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.650
 had sent two Spaniards to the 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.050
 they will teach the guitars not to remove them 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.570
 because according to the story there should have been 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.079
 been vihuelas vihuelas or some 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.380
 instrument of those of the ancients said 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:35.810
 that if you do not 22 for us to teach and that 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.060
 the few neighbors added 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.500
 and that told him that he told them the father of 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.380
 passes that manuals and jewelry because it 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.510
 they liked it so soon they do not have 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.980
 few months teaching people say no 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.660
 is that we are teaching them and 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.960
 they are already selling doing for their 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.090
 account and selling you can free 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.870
 people, that is, people here 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.090
 I look for everything yes yes yes and partly I believe 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.650
 to this friend because there is a writer 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.440
 Russian that was dedicated to 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.250
 to study all this of the guitar and 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.020
 says that in him 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.540
 the Spaniards left two builders 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.490
 of vihuelas and if it came then 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.409
 veracruz and this those are nothing imagine of 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.210
 for the huastecas then they 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.280
 well now people and said they need very 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.100
 admired people that was very good 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.280
 to teach that it was very good even 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.740
 it took a point where 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.190
 they prohibited them from making instruments 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.909
 musicals because formerly nothing more 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.340
 for the church for the ceremony of the 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.920
 church then the parents do not 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:49.240
 it seemed that they were doing for 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:53.399
 they have been very ingenious and creative 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.399
 for this type of work 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.460
 you know that good not if you hear the 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.159
 tradition 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.869
 where does it come from almost you 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.209
 because I relevant today the fourth 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.519
 generation making strong guitars and 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.099
 grandfather teach me Grandpa has me 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.010
 stepped the bikes is advanced to my dad 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:24.610
 Manuel DÃ­az 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.750
 this is my great grandfather and my grandfather to me 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.640
 father 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.210
 and my dad company we are three 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.380
 brothers were you taught us 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:37.410
 all of them are engaged in manufacturing 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:40.770
 of guitars and you 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.010
 continue with it will be a tradition I think 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.260
 that the master hector also yes yes 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.650
 is also starting in this yes already 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.970
 He is also supporting me because I have 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.670
 I said a lot to my son that this work 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.000
 It is very beautiful 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.379
 look has so many 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.709
 features has so much for here what 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.599
 we can spend all day working and 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.920
 happy and happy then we are not 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.240
 this 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.130
 in the interperie we are encerraditos 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.690
 I imagine that this work is not me 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.350
 I imagine it 's work is very beautiful 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.580
 true 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.370
 so is 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.550
 finally hear something you want to add and 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:25.410
 some message that you gave them to give 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:28.260
 the teachers to the students and even to the 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.870
 public in general 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.860
 or you can come one that you know 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.760
 that was given in him 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.230
 the time to look for family workshops 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.050
 that they send to make a guitar in a 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.720
 family workshop because one cares 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.770
 much for everything for this drying of the 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.830
 woods 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.230
 it is very the gift a guitar to someone 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.910
 It is very personal work is very 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.040
 staff and is dedicated to one and they 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.530
 talking on the phone he hears you 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.690
 would like us to put on adornment is 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.240
 very different from a factory or the one in 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.280
 go buy a guitar to a local and 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.290
 settled down 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.680
 this is one of the messages that 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.020
 I would say visit to visit 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.130
 paracho and that make a return to the 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.480
 workshops 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.480
 It seems that here is coffee 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.020
 until sometimes they do not already know then 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.850
 so that they come here to stop 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.810
 I am shocked to find 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.810
 between europe 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:36.660
 practically closer to europe than 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:39.860
 mexico Mexico the exit to Morelia and from 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.860
 Morelia europe europe 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.300
 well well of guadalajara is 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.560
 Guadalajara 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.870
 zamora and heading to europe half an hour before 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.760
 to reach half an hour 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.760
 the statement of ai 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.620
 for all tastes for all 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.750
 budgets and good apart 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.510
 the other tradition that said this too 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:17.780
 the food also for done if it does 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:22.400
 while we savor if it is more carnitas 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.889
 Sheep sheep not no no no no longer with 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.980

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.710
 ex especially if that is the decider 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.380
 is a 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.350
 it's a house where they are given 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.940
 guitar lessons has a very museum 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:42.040
 good one of the forerunners of the 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.560
 guitar is at this point is peace 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.040
 rest Mr. Manuel Monroy or his 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.310
 son carlos manuel 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.110
 and Jorge are all very noble and they 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:59.460
 they have their guitar factory but they do not 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:06:01.470
 they have left they are promoters because 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.560
 one side in a handmade way but according to 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.210
 I 've been going there for a while 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.910
 this already reaches proportions even 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.870
 industrial truth if you leave the a 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:14.970
 large manufacturers there are factories if the 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:18.170
 taking the 200-250 remove the miseries 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:21.099
 and they are like five or six factories 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:27.439
 then they supply the 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:29.539
 of battle for students people 

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:35.330
 which is interested or simply the 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:38.569
 wants so that all visitors the 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:42.560
 people who go to visit us then 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:47.020
 that they take a memory and if they take 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.020
 a guitar so much better
