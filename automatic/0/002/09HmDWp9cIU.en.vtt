00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.150 
the packaging there is a sticker that
said<00:00:53.670> highly<00:00:54.030> articulated<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:55.039> think<00:00:56.039> it

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
said highly articulated I think it

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.099 
said highly articulated I think it
depends<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.850> how<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.149> look<00:00:57.390> at<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> figures

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
depends on how you look at the figures

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.389 
depends on how you look at the figures
and<00:00:58.250> how<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.309> pose<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:01.039> to<00:01:02.039> me<00:01:02.190> this

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
and how you pose it and to me this

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.060 
and how you pose it and to me this
figure<00:01:02.789> only<00:01:02.969> had<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.719> decent<00:01:04.320> amount<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
figure only had a decent amount of the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.070 
figure only had a decent amount of the
articulation<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.510> not<00:01:06.750> highly

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
articulation it is not highly

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.170 
articulation it is not highly
articulated<00:01:07.850> it<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.060> here<00:01:09.740> just<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:11.180> advertise

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
the keys join that can really bring out

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.980 
the keys join that can really bring out
the<00:03:52.950> potential<00:03:53.400> of<00:03:53.670> this<00:03:53.820> figure<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.360> mean<00:03:54.540> you

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
the potential of this figure I mean you

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.500 
the potential of this figure I mean you
can<00:03:55.170> totally<00:03:55.320> pose<00:03:55.740> him<00:03:56.010> better<00:03:56.300> with<00:03:57.300> the

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
can totally pose him better with the

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.220 
can totally pose him better with the
with<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.870> light<00:03:59.030> with<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.150> silver<00:04:00.510> bicep<00:04:01.050> and

with the light with the silver bicep and
the<00:04:01.290> civil<00:04:01.650> tie<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:02.580> way<00:04:02.730> his<00:04:02.940> hip<00:04:03.240> joint<00:04:03.600> is

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
the civil tie the way his hip joint is

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.220 
the civil tie the way his hip joint is
he<00:04:05.160> doesn't<00:04:05.760> go<00:04:05.880> out<00:04:06.090> like<00:04:06.420> move<00:04:06.750> in<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.110> out

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
he doesn't go out like move in and out

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.460 
he doesn't go out like move in and out
like<00:04:07.290> this<00:04:08.270> they<00:04:09.270> let<00:04:09.450> go<00:04:09.660> in<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.020> out<00:04:10.200> like

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
like this they let go in and out like

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.440 
like this they let go in and out like
this<00:04:10.770> so<00:04:11.040> it<00:04:11.340> look<00:04:11.490> kind<00:04:11.820> of<00:04:11.910> weird<00:04:13.160> so<00:04:14.160> a<00:04:14.520> super

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
this so it look kind of weird so a super

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.039 
this so it look kind of weird so a super
time<00:04:15.630> would<00:04:15.840> be<00:04:16.049> helpful<00:04:16.440> because<00:04:16.680> you<00:04:16.859> wanna

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
time would be helpful because you wanna

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:24.530 
time would be helpful because you wanna
rotate<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:20.000> nopd<00:04:21.140> rotate<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:23.120> lower<00:04:24.120> part<00:04:24.510> of

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
rotate the nopd rotate the lower part of

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.600 
rotate the nopd rotate the lower part of
the<00:04:24.600> leg<00:04:24.810> forward<00:04:25.140> to<00:04:26.010> make<00:04:26.160> it<00:04:26.280> look<00:04:26.400> more

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
the leg forward to make it look more

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.600 
the leg forward to make it look more
natural<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.210> a<00:04:28.140> single<00:04:28.530> bicep<00:04:29.040> would<00:04:29.190> be<00:04:29.310> nice

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
natural and a single bicep would be nice

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.680 
natural and a single bicep would be nice
so<00:04:30.030> because<00:04:30.930> you<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:32.130> forearm<00:04:32.970> can<00:04:33.120> go<00:04:33.300> up<00:04:33.540> and

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
so because you the forearm can go up and

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.680 
so because you the forearm can go up and
down<00:04:33.870> you<00:04:34.560> know<00:04:34.650> you<00:04:34.860> cannot<00:04:35.130> rotate<00:04:35.480> the<00:04:36.480> arm

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
down you know you cannot rotate the arm

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.390 
down you know you cannot rotate the arm
from<00:04:36.900> side<00:04:37.230> to<00:04:37.260> side<00:04:37.880> so<00:04:38.880> that's<00:04:39.180> kind<00:04:39.480> of<00:04:40.400> that

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
from side to side so that's kind of that

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.100 
from side to side so that's kind of that
that's<00:04:41.910> kind<00:04:42.270> of<00:04:42.419> a<00:04:42.750> downer<00:04:44.600> but<00:04:45.600> beside<00:04:45.990> the

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
that's kind of a downer but beside the

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.200 
that's kind of a downer but beside the
painting<00:04:46.530> is<00:04:46.680> called<00:04:46.919> sculpting<00:04:47.580> it's<00:04:47.729> clay<00:04:47.970> I

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
painting is called sculpting it's clay I

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.480 
painting is called sculpting it's clay I
think<00:04:48.990> this<00:04:49.110> will<00:04:49.290> capture<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.950> light<00:04:50.130> the

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
think this will capture the light the

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.990 
think this will capture the light the
lightness<00:04:50.880> of<00:04:51.030> no<00:04:51.330> arena<00:04:51.810> very<00:04:52.260> good<00:04:52.970> but<00:04:53.970> I

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
lightness of no arena very good but I

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.440 
lightness of no arena very good but I
find<00:04:54.419> that<00:04:54.479> the<00:04:55.020> painting<00:04:55.440> of<00:04:55.650> his<00:04:55.830> eye<00:04:56.030> is<00:04:57.030> a

find that the painting of his eye is a

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.350 
find that the painting of his eye is a
little<00:04:57.630> bit<00:04:57.930> weird<00:04:58.229> the<00:04:58.800> people<00:04:59.220> are<00:04:59.460> way<00:04:59.880> too

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
out here because this is the only figure

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.689 
out here because this is the only figure
I<00:06:21.770> have<00:06:21.979> right<00:06:22.219> now<00:06:23.349> I<00:06:24.349> think<00:06:25.159> the<00:06:25.219> scale<00:06:25.490> is

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:25.699 
I have right now I think the scale is

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:29.469 
I have right now I think the scale is
good<00:06:26.090> comparing<00:06:26.860> that<00:06:27.860> egg<00:06:28.279> is<00:06:28.879> a<00:06:28.909> little<00:06:29.240> kid

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 
good comparing that egg is a little kid

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:32.589 
good comparing that egg is a little kid
in<00:06:29.689> the<00:06:29.750> show<00:06:30.050> so<00:06:30.349> he<00:06:31.009> is<00:06:31.310> pretty<00:06:31.729> small<00:06:32.300> for

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 
in the show so he is pretty small for

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:34.269 
in the show so he is pretty small for
the<00:06:32.810> regular<00:06:33.229> two<00:06:33.439> huge<00:06:33.650> three<00:06:33.919> quarter

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:34.279 
the regular two huge three quarter

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:37.499 
the regular two huge three quarter
figures<00:06:35.439> so<00:06:36.439> I<00:06:36.469> think<00:06:36.740> the<00:06:36.830> scale<00:06:37.069> is<00:06:37.129> good

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:37.509 
figures so I think the scale is good

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:42.040 
figures so I think the scale is good
overall<00:06:38.509> this<00:06:38.870> is<00:06:38.930> a<00:06:39.229> good<00:06:39.589> figures<00:06:40.870> but<00:06:41.870> I

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
overall this is a good figures but I

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.999 
overall this is a good figures but I
don't<00:06:42.229> think<00:06:42.409> the<00:06:42.500> way<00:06:42.620> I<00:06:42.889> don't<00:06:43.490> think<00:06:45.009> your

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:46.009 
don't think the way I don't think your

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:49.600 
don't think the way I don't think your
money<00:06:46.219> is<00:06:46.460> worth<00:06:47.710> paying<00:06:48.710> for<00:06:48.860> this<00:06:49.159> guy<00:06:49.400> I

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 
Misso I think a bug is a little bit too

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.240 
Misso I think a bug is a little bit too
much<00:07:09.889> to<00:07:10.009> ask<00:07:10.159> for<00:07:10.580> these<00:07:11.120> figures<00:07:11.770> I<00:07:12.770> would

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.250 
much to ask for these figures I would

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.760 
much to ask for these figures I would
recommend<00:07:13.819> this<00:07:14.270> figure<00:07:14.509> only<00:07:15.169> for<00:07:15.439> the<00:07:15.560> fan

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770 
recommend this figure only for the fan

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.779 
recommend this figure only for the fan
and<00:07:16.659> if<00:07:17.659> you<00:07:17.810> are<00:07:17.960> fan<00:07:18.199> of<00:07:18.229> the<00:07:18.529> show<00:07:18.770> you<00:07:19.639> would
