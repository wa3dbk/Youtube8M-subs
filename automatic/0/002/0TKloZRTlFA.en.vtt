00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.320 
very graphic and a very very evil I
think<00:06:38.680> they<00:06:38.800> show<00:06:39.040> Joker<00:06:39.460> is<00:06:39.520> like<00:06:39.820> really

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
think they show Joker is like really

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.420 
think they show Joker is like really
evil<00:06:41.020> and<00:06:42.720> but<00:06:43.720> um<00:06:43.930> it's<00:06:44.260> a<00:06:44.380> great<00:06:44.740> story<00:06:45.190> for

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
evil and but um it's a great story for

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.629 
evil and but um it's a great story for
Joker<00:06:45.850> these<00:06:46.660> state<00:06:47.050> this<00:06:47.740> these<00:06:48.100> guys<00:06:48.370> also

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 
Joker these state this these guys also

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:54.130 
Joker these state this these guys also
did<00:06:48.940> a<00:06:48.970> book<00:06:50.100> from<00:06:51.100> like<00:06:51.430> Slenderman<00:06:52.150> appeal

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.140 
did a book from like Slenderman appeal

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.260 
did a book from like Slenderman appeal
and<00:06:55.140> I<00:06:55.410> think<00:06:55.470> they<00:06:55.740> do<00:06:56.310> a<00:06:56.340> really<00:06:56.760> good<00:06:57.000> job<00:06:57.060> of

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
and I think they do a really good job of

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.830 
and I think they do a really good job of
showing<00:06:57.660> who<00:06:58.650> is<00:06:59.610> showing<00:06:59.850> things<00:07:00.510> through

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
the eyes of the villain for Lex he

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.170 
the eyes of the villain for Lex he
thinks<00:07:03.510> that<00:07:03.630> he<00:07:03.810> is<00:07:03.840> the<00:07:04.620> good<00:07:04.830> guy<00:07:04.860> right<00:07:05.280> the
