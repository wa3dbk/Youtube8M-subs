00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
 and 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.550
 you hold them like that for good 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.349
 to master and after more is after all 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.710
 and after you turn left to right and 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.710
 by 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.200
 so much good 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.510
 even tie and the super 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.000
 easy advantage 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.990
 oh la la that's what she's the one 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.990
 I 'm going to buy that one 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.479
 extraordinary that it even like that with 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.050
 the brakes laon beats for the fuck 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.619
 completely 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:28.910
 it will go up when attacked on the ground 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:33.759
 but even like that I thought we'll have the 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.759
 extraordinary role 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.130
 it's all alone 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.610
 yannig and 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.450
 sentences range from bella to hamsik or 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.100
 so in time it if you depress 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.480
 start the complete depressed our 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.000
 hymn so there you release the back 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.390
 rooms is much more stingy lakers 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.300
 Yes 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.350
 cordially to his left but a lot 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.650
 much faster they show 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.479
 a lot more but then with even in 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.650
 paramotor that you can take off as 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.290
 that we will not get locked up by the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:24.120
 tension but without wind without it 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:25.470
 would be better flatly to agree by 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.050
 against after take off faster from the 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.600
 yes yes because yeah bah yes yes 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.610
 it's normal yes it makes sense 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.110
 yes here yeah it's just for 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.580
 have a peace heap of small impulses 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:43.470
 and that moment it rises above the 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:49.800
 rapido head and eventually you can 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.810
 put in mode at half okay but 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.350
 without wind and we dress sanvensa that 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.350
 showed better 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.440
 yeah and just to keep it 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.470
 for the wii 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.470
 Yes Yes 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.689
 yes because there is very little wind 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.829
 actually a little wind there is just 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:21.310
 what it takes for her to go up to 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.310
 to cease 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.160
 he 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:57.800
 a little Julian demo it's good 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.800
 age classes or sale at age 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.470
 good go really easy it's true 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.300
 the finesse was going to give for how much 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.730
 does not give the finesse but a good 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.390
 finesse when even a good girl 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.820
 nation so not reported by an engine 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.030
 live free and free settings and by
