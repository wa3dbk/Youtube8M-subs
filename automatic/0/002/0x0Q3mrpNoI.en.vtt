alright<00:00:14.670> hey<00:00:14.820> guys<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.269> just<00:00:15.299> wanted<00:00:15.630> to

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
alright hey guys so I just wanted to

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.410 
alright hey guys so I just wanted to
take<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:16.020> few<00:00:16.410> minutes<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.010> talk<00:00:17.220> about<00:00:17.460> two

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
take a few minutes to talk about two

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.720 
take a few minutes to talk about two
terms<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.080> think<00:00:19.380> often<00:00:19.859> get<00:00:20.070> confused

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
terms that I think often get confused

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.040 
terms that I think often get confused
and<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.720> also<00:00:21.900> think<00:00:22.260> are<00:00:22.380> highly<00:00:22.740> relevant<00:00:23.100> to

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
and I also think are highly relevant to

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.839 
and I also think are highly relevant to
nutrition<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.260> bodybuilding<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.160> those

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
nutrition and bodybuilding and those

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.849 
nutrition and bodybuilding and those
terms<00:00:27.150> are<00:00:27.420> accuracy<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.560> precision

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
terms are accuracy and precision

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.610 
terms are accuracy and precision
so<00:00:31.859> basically<00:00:32.329> accuracy<00:00:33.329> means<00:00:33.510> how<00:00:34.050> close

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
so basically accuracy means how close

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.370 
so basically accuracy means how close
you<00:00:34.920> are<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.100> your<00:00:35.460> target<00:00:36.149> value<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.840> I'm

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
you are to your target value and I'm

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.250 
you are to your target value and I'm

true value so in the case of tracking

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.930 
true value so in the case of tracking
let's<00:00:57.210> say<00:00:57.420> calories<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.710> would<00:00:58.890> be<00:00:59.039> accurate

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
let's say calories we would be accurate

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.799 
let's say calories we would be accurate
if<00:01:00.420> our<00:01:00.690> goal<00:01:01.140> value<00:01:01.739> was<00:01:01.969> 2,400<00:01:02.969> calories<00:01:03.149> and

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
if our goal value was 2,400 calories and

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.950 
if our goal value was 2,400 calories and
we<00:01:04.559> were<00:01:04.680> hitting<00:01:04.979> around<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.330> target

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
we were hitting around that target

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.330 
we were hitting around that target
pretty<00:01:07.439> closely<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.659> consistent<00:01:09.659> basis<00:01:10.350> so

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
pretty closely on a consistent basis so

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.620 
pretty closely on a consistent basis so
I've<00:01:11.460> drawn<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> picture<00:01:12.360> here<00:01:12.630> where<00:01:14.450> we<00:01:15.450> would

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
I've drawn a picture here where we would

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.960 
I've drawn a picture here where we would
be<00:01:15.750> accurate<00:01:16.409> if<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:17.070> was<00:01:17.250> our<00:01:17.369> target<00:01:17.640> of

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
be accurate if this was our target of

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.120 
be accurate if this was our target of
2,400<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.470> were<00:01:19.619> eating<00:01:19.799> say

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
2,400 and we were eating say

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.760 
2,400 and we were eating say
twenty-three<00:01:20.850> hundred<00:01:21.200> twenty-five<00:01:22.200> hundred

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770

twenty four twenty five twenty three
seventy<00:01:26.310> five<00:01:26.759> let's<00:01:27.600> say<00:01:27.750> we're<00:01:27.930> around<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
seventy five let's say we're around the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.770 
seventy five let's say we're around the
target<00:01:29.579> but<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.820> average<00:01:30.119> we're<00:01:30.630> averaging

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
target but on average we're averaging

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.899 
target but on average we're averaging
around<00:01:32.270> 2,400<00:01:33.380> now<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.070> contrast<00:01:35.729> this

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
around 2,400 now we can contrast this

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.649 
around 2,400 now we can contrast this
with<00:01:36.270> precision<00:01:37.280> which<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.610> essentially<00:01:39.360> how

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
with precision which is essentially how

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.370 
with precision which is essentially how
well<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.860> individual<00:01:41.549> values<00:01:42.210> correspond<00:01:43.170> to

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
well the individual values correspond to

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.020 
well the individual values correspond to
one<00:01:43.770> another<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:45.320> here<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.590> picture<00:01:46.920> of

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
one another so here is the picture of

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.109 
one another so here is the picture of
precision<00:01:48.030> if<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.840> our<00:01:48.990> target<00:01:49.229> value<00:01:49.829> of

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
precision if this is our target value of

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:57.580 
precision if this is our target value of
2,400<00:01:51.119> we<00:01:51.689> could<00:01:51.899> be<00:01:52.020> eating<00:01:52.579> 2601<00:01:53.990> 2602

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.440 

$25.99<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.009> all<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.759> values<00:02:00.119> would<00:02:00.299> be

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
$25.99 and all the values would be

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.840 
$25.99 and all the values would be
really<00:02:00.810> close<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.110> one<00:02:01.469> and

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
really close to one and

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.789 
really close to one and
there<00:02:02.030> but<00:02:02.540> they<00:02:02.659> aren't<00:02:02.900> accurate<00:02:03.260> because

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
there but they aren't accurate because

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.999 
there but they aren't accurate because
they<00:02:04.100> aren't<00:02:04.460> close<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:06.100> 2400<00:02:07.100> goal<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.950> I

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
they aren't close to the 2400 goal and I

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.070 
they aren't close to the 2400 goal and I
wanted<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.429> point<00:02:10.670> this<00:02:10.880> difference<00:02:11.300> out<00:02:11.450> to

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
wanted to point this difference out to

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.590 
wanted to point this difference out to
say<00:02:12.319> that<00:02:12.560> it's<00:02:13.340> much<00:02:13.610> more<00:02:13.850> important<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.450> be

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
say that it's much more important to be

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.780 
say that it's much more important to be
accurate<00:02:14.900> with<00:02:15.709> your<00:02:15.739> tracking<00:02:16.220> than<00:02:16.550> it<00:02:16.670> is

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
accurate with your tracking than it is

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.600 
accurate with your tracking than it is
to<00:02:16.940> be<00:02:17.090> precise<00:02:17.690> with<00:02:18.020> your<00:02:18.050> tracking<00:02:18.470> a<00:02:18.830> lot

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
to be precise with your tracking a lot

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.430 
to be precise with your tracking a lot
of<00:02:19.790> people<00:02:20.090> get<00:02:20.270> obsessive<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.140> they<00:02:21.260> make

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
of people get obsessive and they make

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.710 
of people get obsessive and they make
sure<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:21.770> down<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.489> each<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.000> every<00:02:23.330> gram<00:02:23.690> of

sure that down to each and every gram of

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.320 
sure that down to each and every gram of

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
carbohydrate protein and fat it has to

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.500 
carbohydrate protein and fat it has to
be<00:02:26.450> dead-on<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.980> what<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.819> is<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.120> they<00:02:29.239> want

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
be dead-on to what it is that they want

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.420 
be dead-on to what it is that they want
and<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:30.200> think<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.560> this<00:02:30.680> is<00:02:30.800> actually<00:02:30.950> pretty

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
and I think that this is actually pretty

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.390 
and I think that this is actually pretty
futile<00:02:32.030> for<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.390> few<00:02:32.690> reasons<00:02:32.980> first<00:02:33.980> of<00:02:34.160> all

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
futile for a few reasons first of all

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.610 
futile for a few reasons first of all
when<00:02:35.209> you<00:02:35.300> set<00:02:35.630> up<00:02:35.660> your<00:02:36.050> daily<00:02:36.230> caloric

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
when you set up your daily caloric

exactly to the gram that you think they

are<00:03:21.470> all<00:03:21.829> the<00:03:22.190> time<00:03:22.430> so<00:03:23.060> it's<00:03:23.390> a<00:03:23.540> little<00:03:23.810> bit

that precise when the information that

you're tracking just isn't that precise
to<00:03:33.769> begin<00:03:34.100> with<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:36.230> third<00:03:36.470> reason<00:03:36.709> is

to begin with and the third reason is

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.259 
to begin with and the third reason is
that<00:03:37.430> you<00:03:38.420> aren't<00:03:38.750> really<00:03:39.109> aware<00:03:40.010> of<00:03:40.310> how<00:03:40.700> much

energy you're expending on a daily basis

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.750 
energy you're expending on a daily basis
so<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.299> be<00:03:44.540> super<00:03:45.049> precise<00:03:45.590> with<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.519> food

so to be super precise with the food
that<00:03:46.940> you're<00:03:47.060> taking<00:03:47.420> in<00:03:47.690> without<00:03:48.380> being
