nash<00:03:44.079> olecranon<00:03:45.079> is<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.799> top<00:03:46.010> part<00:03:46.220> goes<00:03:46.549> into

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
nash olecranon is the top part goes into

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.750 
nash olecranon is the top part goes into
the<00:03:46.940> olecranon<00:03:47.150> fossa<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:50.780> then<00:03:51.199> we<00:03:51.349> have<00:03:51.760> the

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
the olecranon fossa and then we have the

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.990 
the olecranon fossa and then we have the
coronoid<00:03:53.299> process<00:03:54.430> which<00:03:55.430> is<00:03:55.609> this<00:03:55.760> process

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
coronoid process which is this process

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.869 
coronoid process which is this process
here<00:03:56.479> goes<00:03:56.690> into<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.019> coronoid<00:03:57.379> fossa<00:03:57.590> and

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.930 

then<00:04:01.879> we<00:04:02.060> have<00:04:02.650> radial<00:04:03.650> notch<00:04:03.859> it's<00:04:04.729> the

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
then we have radial notch it's the

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.159 
then we have radial notch it's the
little<00:04:05.180> notch<00:04:05.329> where<00:04:05.569> the<00:04:05.659> radius<00:04:05.989> here

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
little notch where the radius here

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.009 
little notch where the radius here
connects<00:04:06.680> can<00:04:07.579> zoom<00:04:07.879> in<00:04:08.000> on<00:04:08.120> that<00:04:08.239> that<00:04:08.780> little

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
connects can zoom in on that that little

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.380 
connects can zoom in on that that little
notch<00:04:09.199> in<00:04:09.229> there

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.460 

and<00:04:15.390> then<00:04:16.170> lastly<00:04:16.730> styloid<00:04:17.730> process<00:04:18.350> see<00:04:19.350> this

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
and then lastly styloid process see this

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.770 
and then lastly styloid process see this
little<00:04:19.680> part<00:04:20.520> that<00:04:20.670> looks<00:04:20.760> like<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:21.000> pen<00:04:21.300> like

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
little part that looks like a pen like

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.640 
little part that looks like a pen like
you<00:04:21.959> write<00:04:22.170> with<00:04:22.320> it

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
you write with it

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.750 
you write with it
styloid<00:04:23.280> process<00:04:24.440> alright

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
styloid process alright

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.230 
styloid process alright
that's<00:04:26.760> am<00:04:27.200> radius<00:04:28.200> good<00:04:29.070> news<00:04:29.250> radius<00:04:30.090> is

that's am radius good news radius is
pretty<00:04:30.450> easy<00:04:31.280> Radiohead<00:04:33.140> we<00:04:34.140> have<00:04:34.380> the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.490 

styloid<00:04:38.250> process<00:04:38.480> right<00:04:39.480> here<00:04:39.510> where<00:04:40.410> you

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
styloid process right here where you

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.320 
styloid process right here where you
could<00:04:40.620> use<00:04:40.800> it<00:04:40.920> as<00:04:41.010> a<00:04:41.070> pen<00:04:41.310> -<00:04:41.550> it's<00:04:42.090> got<00:04:42.240> that

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
could use it as a pen - it's got that

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.770 
could use it as a pen - it's got that
little<00:04:42.480> point<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:43.700> then<00:04:44.700> the<00:04:45.240> ulnar<00:04:45.600> notch

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
little point and then the ulnar notch

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:53.360 
little point and then the ulnar notch
weighting<00:04:46.410> all<00:04:46.650> that<00:04:46.800> goes<00:04:46.950> into<00:04:51.620> alright<00:04:52.620> and

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
weighting all that goes into alright and

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:00.590 
weighting all that goes into alright and
then<00:04:53.580> we're<00:04:53.880> on<00:04:53.910> to<00:04:54.290> carpals<00:04:57.950> purpose<00:04:59.570> we<00:05:00.570> have

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
then we're on to carpals purpose we have

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.070 
then we're on to carpals purpose we have
the<00:05:00.780> metacarpals<00:05:03.770> then<00:05:04.770> we<00:05:04.920> have<00:05:05.010> flanges<00:05:06.080> now

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
the metacarpals then we have flanges now

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.890 
the metacarpals then we have flanges now
the<00:05:07.140> flanges<00:05:07.680> we<00:05:08.400> count<00:05:08.670> it<00:05:08.880> we<00:05:09.090> count<00:05:09.750> the

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
the flanges we count it we count the

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.780 
the flanges we count it we count the
digits<00:05:10.260> like<00:05:10.410> this<00:05:10.650> 1<00:05:11.520> 2<00:05:11.550> 3<00:05:12.470> 4<00:05:13.470> 5<00:05:13.950> start<00:05:14.670> with<00:05:14.760> a

digits like this 1 2 3 4 5 start with a

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.880 
digits like this 1 2 3 4 5 start with a
thumb<00:05:15.060> workout<00:05:15.830> 1<00:05:16.830> 2<00:05:17.130> 3<00:05:17.490> 4<00:05:17.850> 5<00:05:18.120> now<00:05:18.470> on<00:05:19.470> the<00:05:19.620> plans

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
thumb workout 1 2 3 4 5 now on the plans

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.590 
thumb workout 1 2 3 4 5 now on the plans
