Evo for hopefully with that that was
kind<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.880> confusing<00:01:36.659> endeavor<00:01:37.140> because<00:01:37.409> we

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
kind of a confusing endeavor because we

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.590 
kind of a confusing endeavor because we
were<00:01:37.890> going<00:01:38.040> back<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.250> forth<00:01:38.430> over<00:01:38.790> text<00:01:39.390> and

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
were going back and forth over text and

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.390 
were going back and forth over text and
pressure<00:01:40.259> which<00:01:40.530> would<00:01:40.619> go<00:01:40.799> where<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.310> I

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
pressure which would go where and I

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.980 
pressure which would go where and I
found<00:01:41.579> trouble<00:01:41.909> reading<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> diagram<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:42.840> we

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
found trouble reading the diagram but we
