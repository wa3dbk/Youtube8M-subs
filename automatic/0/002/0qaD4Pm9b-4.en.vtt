00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:09.170
 hello youtube people today I'm going to 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:12.549
 teach how to install a radar in 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.549
 the counter strike 1.6 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.789
 all right 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.859
 download let's talk 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.759
 I'm going to leave this page in the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.759
 description of the video 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.599
 download 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.590
 but in a little while 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.460
 two 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.570
 here is the anac live link here 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.380
 say the link 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.380
 there 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.770
 and then ask to save the file 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.439
 He does not ask me because I already have it 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.369
 well once recorded the file what 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.369
 decompress 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.200
 to this 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.710
 more is strike 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:29.400
 sprites 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.400
 so that this file is copied and they go 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.740
 the title of the counter 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.009
 my case is in 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.900
 local disk the program is archived 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.830
 contain traigo 1.66 strike 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.370
 price 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.890
 and here they paste that file that copy is going 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.340
 to ask if they want to replace it 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.340
 they say yes 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.740
 ready breed 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.630
 now very important 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.630
 in the context now in the count 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.180
 giving encouragement because I was with him 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.180
 catchment 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.519
 we put this in console 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.470
 they are chosen under radar type 1 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.730
 I'm going to leave this in the 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.540
 description to activate the radar 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.540
 we go to any server 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.600
 a void 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.790
 as you see here, he was right 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.290
 it's right there 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.220
 with talent for the passion camp 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:29.360
 As you have already confirmed that it is there , 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.360
 go so 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.050
 good 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.050
 that was all 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:44.180
 If you want me to do some tutorial about 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:48.879
 something they ask me this is my first video 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.879
 and nothing just that, chao
