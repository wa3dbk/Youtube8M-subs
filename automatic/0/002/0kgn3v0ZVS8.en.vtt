a real protagonist in this film so I

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.320 
a real protagonist in this film so I
just<00:05:11.190> wanted<00:05:11.400> enough<00:05:11.640> it<00:05:11.790> was<00:05:11.880> more<00:05:12.090> difficult

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
just wanted enough it was more difficult

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.270 
just wanted enough it was more difficult
to<00:05:12.660> prepare<00:05:12.870> for<00:05:13.230> this<00:05:13.320> movie<00:05:13.680> that<00:05:13.980> it<00:05:14.100> was

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
to prepare for this movie that it was

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:22.210 
to prepare for this movie that it was
for<00:05:14.670> 20

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.350 

wasn't<00:05:23.220> about<00:05:23.340> the<00:05:23.400> preparation<00:05:24.000> of<00:05:24.060> it<00:05:24.180> was

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
wasn't about the preparation of it was

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.029 
wasn't about the preparation of it was
definitely<00:05:24.750> harder<00:05:25.139> to<00:05:25.320> do<00:05:25.440> is<00:05:25.590> really<00:05:25.800> just

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
definitely harder to do is really just

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:27.650 
definitely harder to do is really just
because<00:05:26.280> of<00:05:26.400> any<00:05:26.550> that<00:05:27.150> went<00:05:27.300> through<00:05:27.509> what<00:05:27.630> I

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
because of any that went through what I

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.730 
because of any that went through what I
had<00:05:27.780> to<00:05:27.870> go<00:05:27.990> through<00:05:28.169> the<00:05:28.410> photo<00:05:28.650> i<00:05:30.169> think<00:05:31.169> i

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
had to go through the photo i think i

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.290 
had to go through the photo i think i
can<00:05:31.889> choose<00:05:32.250> a<00:05:32.280> less<00:05:32.490> what<00:05:32.699> Agnes<00:05:33.000> in<00:05:33.240> the

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
can choose a less what Agnes in the

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.580 
can choose a less what Agnes in the
beginning<00:05:33.600> of<00:05:33.690> the<00:05:33.780> story<00:05:33.960> which<00:05:34.229> makes<00:05:34.470> it

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
beginning of the story which makes it

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.560 
beginning of the story which makes it
more<00:05:35.070> powerful<00:05:35.759> when<00:05:35.880> she<00:05:36.000> finally<00:05:36.210> snaps

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
more powerful when she finally snaps

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.480 
more powerful when she finally snaps
back<00:05:36.780> because<00:05:37.080> she's<00:05:37.320> literally<00:05:37.889> completely

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
back because she's literally completely

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.670 
back because she's literally completely
not<00:05:38.850> like<00:05:39.060> a<00:05:39.169> non-participant<00:05:40.169> in<00:05:40.320> real<00:05:40.440> life

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
not like a non-participant in real life

00:05:40.680 --> 00:06:00.180 
not like a non-participant in real life
like<00:05:40.889> she<00:05:41.039> just<00:05:41.330> died

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.190

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
in the book even though you leave Bella

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.450 
in the book even though you leave Bella
you're<00:06:07.390> very<00:06:07.600> much<00:06:07.870> an<00:06:08.590> integral<00:06:09.070> part<00:06:09.100> of<00:06:09.370> our

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
thoughts so I know this could be

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.850 
thoughts so I know this could be
challenging<00:06:13.450> to<00:06:13.480> represent<00:06:14.080> on<00:06:14.170> screen<00:06:14.560> so<00:06:14.800> i

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
challenging to represent on screen so i

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.530 
challenging to represent on screen so i
