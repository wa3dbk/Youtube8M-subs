around<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.680> eyepiece<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.810> it

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
around the eyepiece like so and it

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.010 
around the eyepiece like so and it
simply<00:01:28.320> screws<00:01:28.740> into<00:01:28.979> place<00:01:29.420> nice<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.479> secure

simply screws into place nice and secure

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.240 
simply screws into place nice and secure
white<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.840> next<00:01:33.840> we<00:01:34.200> need<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.500> attach<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
white so next we need to attach the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.090 
white so next we need to attach the
camera<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.600> camera<00:01:36.930> adapter<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:37.979> do

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
camera to the camera adapter and we do

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.510 
camera to the camera adapter and we do
that<00:01:38.310> using<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.820> t<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.180> mount<00:01:40.250> onto<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> back

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
that using the t to mount onto the back

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.340 
that using the t to mount onto the back
like<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:41.939> again<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.720> make<00:01:42.960> sure<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.229> nice

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
like so again this make sure it's nice

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.520 
like so again this make sure it's nice
and<00:01:43.409> secure<00:01:44.270> remove<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.450> lens<00:01:45.630> from<00:01:46.439> the
