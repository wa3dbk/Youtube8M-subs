00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 the hard and software charts 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.870
 Germany are unrecognizable 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.429
 let's go ok friends now it's how often 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.690
 could the new 3ds in his 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.570
 release week sell 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.940
 he was only on friday and saturday in 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.020
 to have the specified period of time and has 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.020
 27,700 and 1 x sold what you 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.460
 maybe even a buyer yes and 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.250
 as were in the past 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.070
 with gameboy and gameboy color ds and dsi 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.949
 is now back at 3ds and new 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.620
 3ds that the models added together 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.329
 So 3ds and new 3ds will not be 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.690
 individually filled but all three ds 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.300
 Models together have 27 1701 times 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.370
 can sell and now even if 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.890
 only ever nintendo 3ds will stand 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.539
 So all models are common that is 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.809
 three ds 3ds xl two ds and newly 3ds 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.219
 and wii 3ds xl all together this is 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.800
 was coined as I said in the 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.510
 Past also always so against 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.770
 stinks the playstation 4 this time completely 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.559
 nice to see how it will look like in the future 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.299
 will develop during the fight of the giant 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.250
 how long will the new 3ds be whole? 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.460
 stay up and then there is a big one 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.439
 gap ps3 wii xbox ears you know that 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.180
 and the vita also has the xbox 360 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.640
 overhauled congratulation 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.619
 you are probably at the moment rather on one 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.479
 handheld rip ok come to the software 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.049
 charts because you know what has appeared 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.409
 The election of Zelda Majora's mask 3D 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:33.270
 and that is rightly the top rider 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.400
 software charts with 52,500 60 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.880
 sold units can see each other 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.740
 to let 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.600
 just under half has the second-placed 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.729
 e-wolf a new game vps 4 pc and xbox 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.740
 Horn has three times in the 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.780
 Charts yes games new games 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.060
 in the release week is of course still 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.009
 are bought a lot that settles 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.229
 course different depending on the game 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.270
 over time and for that reason see how 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.610
 it stands with the wolf and with majora's 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.860
 Mask 3d in third place came on 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.290
 monster hunter 4 ultimate also 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.850
 appeared and well suited for the new 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.360
 3ds though playable too on the 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.080
 old 3ds and yes only on the fifth 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.600
 place with pokemon omega 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.970
 ruby and alpha sapphire a well-known 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.650
 has risen again to 10,000 so 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.110
 not comparable to the last week 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.300
 The two days ago came because charts came 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.340
 somehow so close one what you 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.920
 why and otherwise have yet 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.560
 gta fifa minecraft and call of duty 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.180
 save 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.760
 let's see there I am very curious how 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.810
 the next week you will also look 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.880
 can you imagine there was also each 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.880
 crowd movement in the interviews though 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.560
 which is very soft the two newcomers 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.810
 Of course, this is also the number one spot 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.900
 and two legend of zelda majora's mask 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.570
 3d and monster hunter 4 ultimate accustomed 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.160
 from pokÃ©mon then smash brothers for 3ds 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.620
 has sold more than smash 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.750
 brothers for view I think that depends 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.790
 synonymous with the fact that the top 5 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.650
 in the nintendo charts three of each 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.900
 Games are so many have the new 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.610
 3ds bought and maybe even looks 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.720
 which game i have not yet and 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.140
 I think there were many buyers 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.300
 Find 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.100
 smash brothers 3ds also present 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.930
 if you already have a ju 3ds tool i 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.610
 perhaps even not just a game 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.340
 but 203 to launch a new one 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:19.000
 console you have since fisherman from the 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.860
 open purse and mario kart 807 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.660
 and the legend of zelda ocarina of time 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.790
 3d i said it before a two 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.530
 weeks has sold more and now 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.690
 again in the top 10 in 9th place 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.640
 to be exact 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.340
 1941 went over the counters 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.430
 from place 17 to place nine of course 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.530
 that also many 3d-owls owed 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.660
 theater loads that has done a lot 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.280
 finally I have to say or something like that 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.500
 bit was a bit too for me 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.330
 exhausting always the whole other of 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.340
 to keep you interesting 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.530
 the next new releases are available 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.230
 also ready and how they are 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.000
 striking when compared to the 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.650
 Newcomers to this week's day easy 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.300
 by no means miss the 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.040
 next charts I say for 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.250
 see dom bettlers and see you and then 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.250
 ciao
