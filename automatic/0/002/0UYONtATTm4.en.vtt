00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
got your hands on a pegasi Osiris we're

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.700 
got your hands on a pegasi Osiris we're
gonna<00:01:19.960> roll<00:01:20.200> until<00:01:20.350> I<00:01:20.560> Santos<00:01:20.920> customs<00:01:22.710> so

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
to be trying to replicate is the bigger

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.890 
to be trying to replicate is the bigger
knee<00:01:26.530> wearer<00:01:26.890> 730<00:01:27.550> s<00:01:27.760> so<00:01:28.510> the<00:01:28.600> first<00:01:28.780> thing

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
knee wearer 730 s so the first thing

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.300 
knee wearer 730 s so the first thing
that<00:01:29.020> we're<00:01:29.110> going<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:29.290> do<00:01:29.440> is<00:01:29.620> go<00:01:29.800> into<00:01:29.920> paint
