know if it's the exact terrain from the
actual<00:01:55.619> game<00:01:55.759> but<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.030> pretty<00:01:57.240> close<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.840> it

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
actual game but it is pretty close to it

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
did go further that's sad because we

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.260 
did go further that's sad because we
only<00:02:23.600> get<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.110> much<00:02:24.260> with<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.620> xbox<00:02:25.069> and<00:02:25.370> you

only get so much with the xbox and you

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.390 
only get so much with the xbox and you
know<00:02:26.390> you<00:02:26.450> can't<00:02:26.780> be<00:02:26.900> mad<00:02:27.050> with<00:02:27.260> that<00:02:27.290> but<00:02:27.650> look

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
know you can't be mad with that but look

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.750 
know you can't be mad with that but look
at<00:02:28.550> this<00:02:28.700> this<00:02:28.940> is<00:02:29.000> just<00:02:29.360> a<00:02:29.890> fantastic<00:02:30.890> map<00:02:31.370> and

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
at this this is just a fantastic map and

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.220 
at this this is just a fantastic map and
I<00:02:31.970> don't<00:02:32.209> think<00:02:32.480> you're<00:02:32.569> supposed<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:32.870> go<00:02:33.050> any

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
I don't think you're supposed to go any

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.140 
I don't think you're supposed to go any
further<00:02:33.410> out<00:02:33.770> I<00:02:34.040> hope<00:02:34.940> this<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.330> not<00:02:35.360> just<00:02:36.020> one

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
further out I hope this is not just one

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.340 
further out I hope this is not just one
okay<00:02:38.150> looks<00:02:38.450> like<00:02:38.540> this<00:02:38.840> might<00:02:39.050> be<00:02:39.260> another

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
okay looks like this might be another

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.100 
okay looks like this might be another
area<00:02:39.940> but<00:02:40.940> once<00:02:41.150> again<00:02:41.270> I'm<00:02:41.480> not<00:02:41.510> sure<00:02:41.900> because

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
area but once again I'm not sure because

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.900 
area but once again I'm not sure because
this<00:02:42.410> is<00:02:42.560> all<00:02:42.709> flat<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.220> it's<00:02:43.310> just<00:02:43.459> bedrock

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
this is all flat and it's just bedrock

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.780 
this is all flat and it's just bedrock
so<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:44.180> don't<00:02:44.420> know<00:02:44.920> if<00:02:45.920> we<00:02:46.130> are<00:02:46.280> supposed<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:46.670> be

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
so I don't know if we are supposed to be

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.360 
so I don't know if we are supposed to be
back<00:02:46.970> here<00:02:47.000> or<00:02:47.300> not<00:02:47.420> but<00:02:47.800> this<00:02:48.800> is<00:02:48.860> just<00:02:49.040> a

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
back here or not but this is just a

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.810 
back here or not but this is just a
fantastic<00:02:50.330> map<00:02:50.870> for<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.860> know<00:02:52.040> for<00:02:52.550> you<00:02:52.670> guys
