00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.440 
cubing is like this is like the first
time<00:02:20.620> I<00:02:20.860> cool<00:02:21.160> no<00:02:21.489> actually<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.060> second<00:02:22.420> time

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
time I cool no actually the second time

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.320 
time I cool no actually the second time
the<00:02:23.349> first<00:02:23.380> time<00:02:23.680> was<00:02:23.980> my<00:02:24.810> phantoms<00:02:25.810> card<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:28.000> I

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
the first time was my phantoms card so I

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.880 
the first time was my phantoms card so I
haven't<00:02:28.599> really<00:02:28.750> cube<00:02:29.170> anything<00:02:29.530> in<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.709> while

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
haven't really cube anything in a while

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.250 
haven't really cube anything in a while
since<00:02:30.370> my<00:02:30.760> knight<00:02:31.270> Lord<00:02:31.450> was<00:02:31.750> pretty<00:02:32.050> much

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
since my knight Lord was pretty much

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.590 
since my knight Lord was pretty much
finished<00:02:34.650> from<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:36.730> know<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.030> cubing<00:02:37.390> side

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
finished from you know the cubing side

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.540 
finished from you know the cubing side
so<00:02:37.959> it's<00:02:38.769> been<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:38.920> while<00:02:39.130> since<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.459> cube<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.470> I

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
so it's been a while since I cube and I

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.070 
so it's been a while since I cube and I
mean<00:02:42.550> it<00:02:42.760> only<00:02:42.819> took<00:02:43.060> me<00:02:43.120> like<00:02:43.269> six<00:02:43.750> cubes

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
mean it only took me like six cubes

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.110 
mean it only took me like six cubes
right<00:02:44.200> now<00:02:44.380> just<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.769> get<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:44.980> unique<00:02:45.370> so<00:02:45.670> can't

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
right now just to get to unique so can't

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.030 
right now just to get to unique so can't
really<00:02:46.180> complain<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:47.440> know<00:02:47.500> I'll<00:02:47.650> take<00:02:47.860> that

any day so you know when when these um

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.039 
any day so you know when when these um
super<00:02:53.590> cubes<00:02:53.830> first<00:02:54.100> came<00:02:54.280> out<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:55.630> know<00:02:55.780> I

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
super cubes first came out you know I

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.770 
super cubes first came out you know I
was<00:02:56.110> really<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:57.010> was<00:02:57.459> really<00:02:57.850> lucky<00:02:58.209> I<00:02:58.390> ended<00:02:58.690> up

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
was really I was really lucky I ended up

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.340 
was really I was really lucky I ended up
getting<00:02:58.989> like<00:02:59.380> from<00:03:00.010> unique<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.459> legendary<00:03:00.940> in

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
getting like from unique to legendary in

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.680 
getting like from unique to legendary in
like<00:03:02.350> like<00:03:02.980> two<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.310> three<00:03:03.340> cubes<00:03:03.819> like<00:03:04.239> on

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
like like two to three cubes like on

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.190 
like like two to three cubes like on
every<00:03:04.959> single<00:03:05.230> equip<00:03:05.739> so<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:07.720> know<00:03:07.840> at<00:03:07.989> first

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
every single equip so you know at first

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.020 
every single equip so you know at first
I<00:03:08.380> thought<00:03:08.590> oh<00:03:08.799> maybe<00:03:09.100> it's<00:03:09.370> like<00:03:09.489> a<00:03:09.549> premium

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
I thought oh maybe it's like a premium

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.250 
I thought oh maybe it's like a premium
cubes<00:03:10.330> where<00:03:10.630> you<00:03:10.780> have<00:03:10.900> like<00:03:11.080> the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
cubes where you have like the

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.229 
cubes where you have like the
twenty-five<00:03:11.830> percent<00:03:12.010> chance<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.850> rank<00:03:13.090> up

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
twenty-five percent chance to rank up

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.430 
twenty-five percent chance to rank up
but<00:03:13.900> as<00:03:14.500> tan<00:03:15.040> as<00:03:15.190> time<00:03:15.790> passed<00:03:16.060> by<00:03:16.299> I<00:03:16.630> ended<00:03:17.350> up

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
but as tan as time passed by I ended up

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.039 
but as tan as time passed by I ended up
noticing<00:03:17.920> that<00:03:18.040> it's<00:03:18.220> taking<00:03:18.670> me<00:03:18.820> even<00:03:19.810> longer

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
noticing that it's taking me even longer

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.160 
noticing that it's taking me even longer
