makes the best tomato sauce the reason

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.069 
makes the best tomato sauce the reason
we<00:04:07.340> would<00:04:07.430> peel<00:04:07.670> and<00:04:07.820> feed<00:04:07.970> a<00:04:08.030> tomato<00:04:08.329> is<00:04:08.660> so

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
we would peel and feed a tomato is so

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.470 
we would peel and feed a tomato is so
that<00:04:09.230> we<00:04:09.350> can<00:04:09.590> use<00:04:09.739> it<00:04:09.860> for<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.070> tomato<00:04:10.340> sauce<00:04:10.610> so

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
that we can use it for a tomato sauce so

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.390 
that we can use it for a tomato sauce so
the<00:04:11.600> first<00:04:11.810> thing<00:04:11.930> we're<00:04:12.049> gonna<00:04:12.170> do<00:04:12.350> is<00:04:12.560> we're

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
the first thing we're gonna do is we're

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.690 
the first thing we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:04:13.459> remove<00:04:13.850> the<00:04:14.180> core<00:04:14.810> of<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.989> tomato<00:04:15.700> and

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
gonna remove the core of the tomato and

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.920 
gonna remove the core of the tomato and
then<00:04:16.850> we're<00:04:16.970> gonna<00:04:17.060> put<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.359> tomatoes<00:04:17.750> in

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
then we're gonna put the tomatoes in

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.390 
then we're gonna put the tomatoes in
boiling<00:04:17.989> water<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:21.440> average<00:04:21.799> time<00:04:22.010> it<00:04:22.280> would

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
boiling water the average time it would

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.909 
boiling water the average time it would
be<00:04:22.520> about<00:04:22.669> 30<00:04:22.910> seconds<00:04:23.530> so<00:04:24.530> here<00:04:24.710> we're<00:04:24.830> gonna

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
be about 30 seconds so here we're gonna

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.050 
be about 30 seconds so here we're gonna
take<00:04:25.160> it<00:04:25.280> out<00:04:25.370> more<00:04:25.610> in<00:04:25.669> the<00:04:25.700> throw<00:04:25.910> them<00:04:26.000> in

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
take it out more in the throw them in

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.630 
take it out more in the throw them in
ice<00:04:26.240> water<00:04:26.289> and<00:04:27.289> the<00:04:27.860> reason<00:04:28.130> for<00:04:28.310> throwing<00:04:28.400> it

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
ice water and the reason for throwing it

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.460 
ice water and the reason for throwing it
ice<00:04:28.789> water<00:04:29.090> is<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:29.360> want<00:04:29.539> to<00:04:29.690> stop<00:04:30.229> the

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
cooking right away so once we cool the

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.779 
cooking right away so once we cool the
tomato<00:04:33.350> down<00:04:33.530> you<00:04:34.100> want<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:34.370> peel<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:34.669> skin
