like pretty decently Trank when they're

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.889 
like pretty decently Trank when they're
wet<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.550> right<00:00:44.760> when<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:44.940> got<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.239> shower<00:00:45.450> or

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
wet like right when I got the shower or

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.240 
wet like right when I got the shower or
for<00:00:46.440> example<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.920> hot<00:00:47.100> tub<00:00:48.200> of<00:00:49.200> course<00:00:49.469> so

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
for example the hot tub of course so

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.880 
for example the hot tub of course so
here<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.120> how<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.329> train<00:00:51.660> them<00:00:51.840> method<00:00:52.590> one

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
here is how you train them method one

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.939 
here is how you train them method one
but<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.699> made<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.090> up<00:00:54.180> myself<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.500> side<00:00:55.739> is

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
but I made it up myself so this side is

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.410 
but I made it up myself so this side is
the<00:00:56.039> side<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.640> usually<00:00:56.789> would<00:00:57.059> part<00:00:57.270> on

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
the side that I usually would part on

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.299 
the side that I usually would part on
when<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.050> had<00:00:58.609> not<00:00:59.609> straight<00:00:59.969> bangs<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.390> so

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
when I had not straight bangs and so

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.860 
when I had not straight bangs and so
like<00:01:02.309> literally<00:01:02.910> they<00:01:03.210> would<00:01:03.600> come<00:01:03.750> out<00:01:03.809> of

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
like literally they would come out of

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.010 
like literally they would come out of
the<00:01:04.049> shower<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.559> they<00:01:04.680> would<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.949> like<00:01:06.020> poofy

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the shower and they would be like poofy

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.230 
the shower and they would be like poofy
and<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.590> would<00:01:07.979> do<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.760> thing<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.150> they

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
and I would do like this thing and they

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.100 
and I would do like this thing and they
wouldn't<00:01:09.570> stay<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.240> got<00:01:12.240> bobby<00:01:12.450> pins<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.250> I

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.590 
wouldn't stay so I got bobby pins and I
just<00:01:16.110> weighed<00:01:16.320> them<00:01:16.590> now<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.450> looks

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600
