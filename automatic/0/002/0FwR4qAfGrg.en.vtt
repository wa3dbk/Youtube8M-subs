one thing it does not need in order for
it<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:44.020> be<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.200> good<00:03:44.410> game<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:44.980> that's<00:03:45.910> number

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
it to be a good game and that's number

it to be a good game and that's number
one<00:03:46.870> good<00:03:47.680> killstreaks<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:49.320> score<00:03:50.320> streets

them different things um so I think

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.390 
them different things um so I think
ghosts<00:03:55.300> an<00:03:55.480> advanced<00:03:56.080> warfare<00:03:56.560> have<00:03:57.100> been

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
ghosts an advanced warfare have been

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.270 
ghosts an advanced warfare have been
lacking<00:03:57.670> in<00:03:58.030> that<00:03:58.090> department<00:03:59.100> because<00:04:00.100> if

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
lacking in that department because if

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.910 
lacking in that department because if
I'm<00:04:00.489> having<00:04:00.730> a<00:04:00.940> hard<00:04:01.180> time<00:04:01.270> getting<00:04:02.260> past<00:04:02.500> a

I'm having a hard time getting past a

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.110 
I'm having a hard time getting past a
UAV<00:04:03.959> in<00:04:04.959> advanced<00:04:05.350> warfare<00:04:05.800> then<00:04:06.580> how<00:04:07.060> does

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
UAV in advanced warfare then how does

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.410 
UAV in advanced warfare then how does
that<00:04:07.390> appeal<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.350> casual<00:04:08.709> player<00:04:08.950> because

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
that appeal to the casual player because

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.440 
that appeal to the casual player because
what<00:04:10.420> call<00:04:10.720> of<00:04:10.870> duty<00:04:11.170> enjoys<00:04:11.560> is<00:04:11.830> a<00:04:11.890> huge<00:04:12.820> fan

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
what call of duty enjoys is a huge fan

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.750 
what call of duty enjoys is a huge fan
base<00:04:13.690> because<00:04:14.170> of<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.440> casual<00:04:14.860> player<00:04:15.100> so<00:04:15.700> you

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
base because of the casual player so you

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.340 
base because of the casual player so you
call<00:04:15.940> duty<00:04:16.120> used<00:04:16.390> to<00:04:16.540> be<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.720> game<00:04:17.049> where<00:04:17.260> you

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
call duty used to be a game where you

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.620 
call duty used to be a game where you
can<00:04:17.470> just<00:04:17.500> pick<00:04:17.770> up<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:17.980> play<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:18.430> not<00:04:18.970> have

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
can just pick up and play and not have

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.960 
can just pick up and play and not have
too<00:04:20.019> much<00:04:20.169> thinking<00:04:20.530> involved<00:04:21.220> a<00:04:21.370> lot<00:04:21.820> of

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
too much thinking involved a lot of

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.250 
too much thinking involved a lot of
people<00:04:22.210> can<00:04:22.360> pick<00:04:22.570> up<00:04:22.690> and<00:04:22.810> play<00:04:22.960> this<00:04:23.080> game

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
people can pick up and play this game

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.040 
people can pick up and play this game
and<00:04:23.410> just<00:04:23.590> do<00:04:23.710> well<00:04:23.919> or<00:04:24.400> so<00:04:24.820> it<00:04:25.120> was<00:04:25.510> that<00:04:25.810> way

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
and just do well or so it was that way

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.220 
and just do well or so it was that way
until<00:04:26.820> ghosts<00:04:27.820> and<00:04:28.030> advanced<00:04:28.540> warfare<00:04:28.990> came

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
until ghosts and advanced warfare came

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.230 
until ghosts and advanced warfare came
along

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
along

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.260 
along
but<00:04:30.840> um<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.199> think<00:04:31.620> if<00:04:31.889> gahl<00:04:32.430> duty<00:04:32.759> is<00:04:32.940> able<00:04:33.180> to

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
but um I think if gahl duty is able to

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.909 
but um I think if gahl duty is able to
bring<00:04:33.509> back<00:04:33.720> those<00:04:33.960> killstreaks<00:04:34.470> it<00:04:34.680> will

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
bring back those killstreaks it will

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.689 
bring back those killstreaks it will
give<00:04:35.099> people<00:04:35.430> an<00:04:35.580> incentive<00:04:35.970> to<00:04:36.449> get<00:04:37.410> on<00:04:37.740> those

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
give people an incentive to get on those

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.029 
give people an incentive to get on those
large<00:04:39.060> killstreaks<00:04:39.870> and<00:04:40.110> do<00:04:40.620> well<00:04:40.830> in<00:04:40.949> the

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
large killstreaks and do well in the

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.820 
large killstreaks and do well in the
game<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.599> another<00:04:42.599> thing<00:04:42.870> brings<00:04:43.380> me<00:04:43.530> to<00:04:43.680> that

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
game and another thing brings me to that

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.620 
game and another thing brings me to that
skill<00:04:44.069> based<00:04:44.250> matchmaking<00:04:44.460> portion<00:04:45.330> which<00:04:45.509> I

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
skill based matchmaking portion which I

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.540 
skill based matchmaking portion which I
think<00:04:46.110> needs<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:46.889> be<00:04:46.949> thrown<00:04:47.160> out<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.520> window

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
think needs to be thrown out the window

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.249 
think needs to be thrown out the window
because<00:04:47.819> first<00:04:48.330> of<00:04:48.419> all<00:04:48.539> the<00:04:48.900> connections

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
because first of all the connections

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.170 
because first of all the connections
because<00:04:49.710> you're<00:04:49.889> being<00:04:50.520> paired<00:04:50.819> up<00:04:50.970> with

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
because you're being paired up with

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.860 
because you're being paired up with
people<00:04:51.630> all<00:04:51.900> across<00:04:52.229> the<00:04:52.590> world<00:04:53.509> solely<00:04:54.509> based

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
people all across the world solely based

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.629 
people all across the world solely based
off<00:04:55.139> of<00:04:55.169> your<00:04:55.470> skill<00:04:55.800> level<00:04:55.830> and<00:04:56.250> that's

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
off of your skill level and that's

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.839 
off of your skill level and that's
throwing<00:04:57.030> off<00:04:57.360> connections<00:04:58.430> helping<00:04:59.430> people

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
throwing off connections helping people

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.050 
throwing off connections helping people
lose<00:05:00.240> gunfights<00:05:00.930> and<00:05:01.520> providing<00:05:02.520> lag<00:05:02.699> spikes

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
lose gunfights and providing lag spikes

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.659 
lose gunfights and providing lag spikes
etc<00:05:03.630> and<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:04.259> second<00:05:04.560> part<00:05:04.740> is<00:05:04.919> if<00:05:05.520> you're

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
etc and the second part is if you're

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.249 
etc and the second part is if you're
constantly<00:05:05.940> facing<00:05:06.389> people<00:05:06.780> of<00:05:06.960> the<00:05:07.050> same

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
constantly facing people of the same

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:09.680 
constantly facing people of the same
skill<00:05:07.530> level<00:05:07.560> to<00:05:07.919> you<00:05:08.069> means<00:05:09.030> you're<00:05:09.180> playing

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
skill level to you means you're playing

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.600 
skill level to you means you're playing
against<00:05:10.050> try-hards<00:05:10.620> and<00:05:10.830> you're<00:05:11.039> not<00:05:11.159> able<00:05:11.340> to

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.820 
against try-hards and you're not able to
stomp<00:05:11.940> on<00:05:12.120> kids<00:05:12.449> and<00:05:12.690> again<00:05:13.319> that<00:05:13.500> does<00:05:13.680> not
