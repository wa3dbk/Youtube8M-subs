 tempted and christian this edition 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.270
 it just seemed like a bomb because 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.190
 our service before their level a little bit 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.930

 ukrainian boxes let's start so 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.690

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.579
 in the amount of 30 milliliters is a lotion for 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.699

 these amazing jars of flowers in 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.250
 not all in me personally for me they 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.710
 seem alike 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.240
 they have light sweeties nice frame 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.979
 him under these bodies quite a bit 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.439
 so I can say that he does not 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.210
 remarkable smell on the body remains 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.830
 pretty long time on 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.470
 not long enough to have to catch 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.140
 there are literally two hours and it feels 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.720
 on the body and it all goes away but 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.439
 how much good near he will have appeared 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.009

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.430

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.680

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.579

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.850
 these products are amazing 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.850

 for the lover of sweet flavors 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.479
 it's just a find they are very sweet and 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.950
 very billiards and oil are not very similar to 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.380
 those you class I met 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.580
 earlier because it is transparent before 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.260

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.019
 two products from the brand in the same series and 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.650
 soloist 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:29.410

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.060

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.519
 so I have not found to regret my 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.920
 ideal 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.140
 the elixir is young code so I get to know 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.299
 with these products they may become 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.340
 my pets next box 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.590
 project to align skin tone from 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.269
 clinics or in the common people just network 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.190
 the cream was crazy for me 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.900
 acquainted with the Graham this brand 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.239
 since at the moment you are my network 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.299
 cream from the company lumina I was 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:23.950
 just insanely praise everything 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:26.260
 youtube but I'm not in history 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.940
 so i'm looking for something better 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.950
 with this cream with pleasure 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.019
 familiarity is the only thing 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.660
 familiarity will probably have to be postponed yes 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.840
 summer since now this tone is for me 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.819
 but it is too dark even though 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.910
 that these cream must adapt to 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.340
 skin tone anyway you can see the difference 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.859
 just postpone until the summer and then already 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.410
 get acquainted 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.250
 next box is a balm from the company 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.870
 benefit professional 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.270
 we have to smooth the skin 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.970
 mount and and also hide pores 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.610
 since my skin is normal even 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.740
 prone to dryness this product opinion 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:08.020
 so it is necessary to mount nothing 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.020
 narrow me too 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.180
 further in the toilet miniature box 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:17.090
 water from 5 blocked here 4 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.980
 millimeter this is not a probe no no i 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.250
 collected rock is it really 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.170
 miniature vodichka very interesting I 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.470
 I heard from a friend that it is a sweet scent 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.150
 I waited for this water with impatience but to 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.630
 regret it's not exactly that sweet 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.190
 the fragrance of which I am mad, I completely 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.810
 I do not know how to describe the flavors 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.000
 only what do i divide it into 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.070
 pleasant or unpleasant this scent 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.919
 nice but not so much that i bought 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.169
 full-size version of the Cossack hold 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.419
 this is a thumbnail the wind is emulsions a 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.000
 which prevents shine 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.710
 for me personally this is a miniature cute and i 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.010
 can't even tell if some effect 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.810
 since my skin is oily next 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.870
 product box is biphasic 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.610
 makeup remover i am for 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.350
 the product has not yet come across therefore 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.490
 I will definitely try it since mine 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.780
 favorite bioderma does not always cope 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.930
 really thin carcasses 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.240
 or hermetic waterproof makeup therefore 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.310
 no matter what kind of lovers 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.800
 micellar water biphasic liquid 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.169
 cosmetic bags should be and start even 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.350
 the best micellar water you have 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:26.810
 there is a chance to remain a panda next 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:31.070
 product box is a miniature mascara from 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:34.030
 clarins lengthening and giving volume 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.320
 bending mascara as promised by the manufacturer 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.490
 my opinion is ink 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.800
 I have her right away 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.919
 testil and since the cripple got the most 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:46.849
 am the first layer is good the bar is good in 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:48.910
 second layer of mascara 2 is good the third layer 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:53.449
 mascara came down well 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:55.580
 not great but good for me basically 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:56.750
 liked the effect given away the same she 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.530

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:03.800
 she lengthened the stairs she divided them 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.930
 in principle they were not stuck together by a torus 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.550
 really worthy of attention i 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.009
 maybe even look at 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:14.120

 The color of the lipstick is very, very 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:32.659
