little fuzzy and well I think it's more

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.950 
little fuzzy and well I think it's more
of<00:00:43.559> me<00:00:43.739> defining<00:00:44.700> your<00:00:44.940> brother<00:00:45.210> knowing<00:00:45.750> that

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
of me defining your brother knowing that

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.600 
of me defining your brother knowing that
no<00:00:46.140> well<00:00:46.559> good<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.980> don't<00:00:47.039> feel<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.430> badly

no well good and I don't feel so badly
you<00:00:48.360> no<00:00:48.480> idea<00:00:48.809> where<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.379> difference<00:00:49.680> between

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
you no idea where the difference between

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.270 
you no idea where the difference between
the<00:00:50.070> two<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.399> perfect<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.890> within<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.010> jetty

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
the two it perfect so within a jetty

the two it perfect so within a jetty
clearing<00:00:53.789> we're<00:00:54.000> obviously<00:00:54.149> channeling<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
clearing we're obviously channeling the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.979 
clearing we're obviously channeling the
energy<00:00:55.230> using<00:00:55.949> your<00:00:56.129> hands<00:00:56.610> yeah<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.239> working

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
on the chakras there's lots of ways with

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.889 
on the chakras there's lots of ways with
natural<00:01:01.710> balance<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.100> chakras<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:03.570> one<00:01:03.870> of

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
natural balance the chakras so one of

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.780 
natural balance the chakras so one of
the<00:01:04.080> things<00:01:04.140> I've<00:01:04.470> developed<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.280> this

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790

really really nice ah and there's
another<00:01:36.930> idea<00:01:37.500> I'm<00:01:37.950> sort<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.460> hope<00:01:39.420> I'm

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
another idea I'm sort of hope I'm

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.930 
another idea I'm sort of hope I'm
working<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.050> a<00:01:40.260> colored<00:01:40.830> rejection<00:01:41.400> my

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
working on a colored rejection my

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.110 
working on a colored rejection my

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
computer screen some ID and Simon see

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.030 
computer screen some ID and Simon see
how<00:01:56.340> that's<00:01:56.550> working<00:01:56.790> nice<00:01:57.330> actually<00:01:58.320> lighten
