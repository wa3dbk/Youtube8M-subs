The painting is a bit paranoid in a certain sense. 

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:28.000
A skeptical painting towards men in uniforms.

00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:41.000
It is a moment in which one is confronted with a watching crowed. It’s a moment of confrontation with a threat which masquerades as protection.

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:49.000
The thought and observation is that hooliganism, violence and police lie very close together.

00:00:49.001 --> 00:01:03.000
The effect this has on me, and probably that’s why I draw it – and probably the effect many people can empathize – is the one of unpredictability of a situation, a latently violent situation.

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:20.000
I have indeed included many imaging, peripheral methods into my painting: 

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:30.000
the infrared look, the glance characterized by the consumption of drugs, but also surveillance cameras and night vision devices,

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:40.000
because they are all sights that in a certain way orbit our center but as views at the same time transport a certain form of ideology.

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:45.000
The painting is a larger version of one that I have painted before. The other one is named “Dog Planet”

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:56.000
and it is a light, and relatively bright one. I wanted to find out what happens if I transformed it into a darker, actually relatively trashy painting.

00:01:56.001 --> 00:02:10.000
So the processes you can see – it always differs and depends on my thoughts – in this painting is that I have spread a lot of liquid color in the beginning, neon color first. 

00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:23.000
Then I poured other colors like the blue tones on top of it. In between, in order to get some orientation, I randomly applied scotch tape and color leftovers. 

00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:36.000
I knew the motif I was going to draw so I transferred that freehand and during the drawing process I dissected it in a certain extent and  then reassembled it.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The big formats have a sense of world stage and that is what challenged me. To me the immodesty and the risk of pathos and bombast are very appealing. 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I always did works of smaller format at the same time but obviously they have a different effect and also limit you in a different way. 

00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:14.000
In most of my paintings I try not to put too much content inside but rather work as iconic as possible.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I use anything that the world offers me in terms of picture productions. Whether that is photo journalism or

00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:40.000
newspaper photography or comics or classical illusions or the art work of other artists.

00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:47.000
I was Werner Büttner’s student. What I wasn’t aware of during my studies and what I just realized later is 

00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:59.000
that Büttner and his colleagues Kippenberger and Oehlen belong to a genealogy which goes back to Immendorf, Polke and in a wider sense can be lead back to Beuys. 

00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:09.000
This idea of art which serves the accelerating of truth and which is not about developing a style 

00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:19.000
but rather a method to draw closer the production of truth which lies in the paintings – I guess this is what influenced me.

00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:24.000
I don’t know whether I would think differently if I had studied with someone else. 

00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:32.000
However now I am in a certain way the result of the thoughts that have been put in my head.
