00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
colors like for example this one is a

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.740 
colors like for example this one is a
bell<00:04:36.620> from<00:04:36.800> Europe<00:04:37.190> it's<00:04:37.370> a<00:04:37.580> beaver<00:04:38.180> fur<00:04:38.479> felt

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
it was interesting the punch detail try

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.320 
it was interesting the punch detail try
to<00:04:42.560> make<00:04:42.770> everything<00:04:43.100> you<00:04:43.280> need<00:04:43.610> so<00:04:43.910> when<00:04:44.060> come

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
to make everything you need so when come

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.240 
to make everything you need so when come
in<00:04:44.449> here<00:04:44.720> most<00:04:45.380> of<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:45.620> things<00:04:45.830> are<00:04:45.949> one<00:04:46.070> of<00:04:46.190> a

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
in here most of the things are one of a

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.890 
in here most of the things are one of a
kind<00:04:46.280> and<00:04:46.910> then<00:04:47.000> you<00:04:47.120> can<00:04:47.270> order<00:04:47.570> from<00:04:47.750> the

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
kind and then you can order from the

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.550 
kind and then you can order from the
sample<00:04:48.580> because<00:04:49.580> I<00:04:49.850> think<00:04:49.910> that<00:04:50.380> first<00:04:51.380> of<00:04:51.470> all

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
sample because I think that first of all

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.379 
sample because I think that first of all
I<00:04:51.590> attired<00:04:52.130> making<00:04:52.610> the<00:04:52.669> same<00:04:52.880> thing<00:04:53.060> over<00:04:53.210> and

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
I attired making the same thing over and

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.420 
I attired making the same thing over and
over<00:04:53.510> again<00:04:53.690> I<00:04:54.229> like<00:04:54.740> to<00:04:54.860> have<00:04:55.010> things<00:04:55.220> that

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
over again I like to have things that

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.210 
over again I like to have things that
are<00:04:55.550> different<00:04:56.410> like<00:04:57.410> this<00:04:57.590> one<00:04:57.800> features

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
are different like this one features

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.010 
are different like this one features
these<00:04:58.400> cuts<00:04:58.729> which<00:04:59.090> you<00:04:59.510> know<00:04:59.630> you<00:04:59.690> can<00:04:59.870> do<00:04:59.990> a

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
these cuts which you know you can do a

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.379 
these cuts which you know you can do a
lot<00:05:00.200> of<00:05:00.260> fun<00:05:00.530> stuff<00:05:00.830> with<00:05:01.040> it<00:05:01.220> you<00:05:01.970> can<00:05:02.120> kind<00:05:02.270> of

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
lot of fun stuff with it you can kind of

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:04.420 
lot of fun stuff with it you can kind of
like<00:05:02.540> move<00:05:02.780> it<00:05:02.930> around<00:05:03.020> different<00:05:03.620> ways<00:05:03.919> and

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
like move it around different ways and

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.430 
like move it around different ways and
then<00:05:05.090> you<00:05:05.150> have<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.360> embroider<00:05:05.720> here<00:05:06.139> which

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
then you have the embroider here which

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.950 
then you have the embroider here which
sets<00:05:06.889> off<00:05:07.070> the<00:05:07.130> texture<00:05:07.940> which<00:05:08.570> makes<00:05:08.840> it

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
sets off the texture which makes it

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.909 
sets off the texture which makes it
really<00:05:09.200> nice<00:05:10.960> another<00:05:11.960> example<00:05:12.110> of<00:05:12.560> a<00:05:12.680> fur<00:05:12.889> hat

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
really nice another example of a fur hat

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.529 
really nice another example of a fur hat
this<00:05:13.910> one<00:05:14.120> I<00:05:14.150> did<00:05:14.360> with<00:05:14.510> the<00:05:14.630> wire<00:05:16.270> which<00:05:17.270> makes

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
this one I did with the wire which makes

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.090 
this one I did with the wire which makes
it<00:05:17.660> fun<00:05:17.870> because<00:05:18.050> if<00:05:18.169> you<00:05:18.260> can<00:05:18.500> shape<00:05:19.070> it

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
it fun because if you can shape it

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.820 
it fun because if you can shape it
different<00:05:19.520> ways

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830
