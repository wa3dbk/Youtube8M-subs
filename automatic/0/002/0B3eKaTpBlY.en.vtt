00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.770
 certainly start brushing right now 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.200
 brushing there are concrete differences 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.880
 I put my hair and haircut and 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.160
 maybe she brushes that 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.080
 round brush volume rhine can lead 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.119
 that allows a variant of the best 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.350
 the second synchronous has exactly my 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.850
 style nothing to do 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.310
 that has to do with it first and foremost 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.990
 i can sanctify my hair 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.699
 This helps to keep the scalp healthy 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.730
 And these are completely different requirements 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.290
 I would like to be smooth from the princes 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.850
 I would like to have some hair 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.680
 I want to lure you in 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.690
 different tools I need 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.910
 First and foremost, this is always important 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.440
 The tool looks around to attack 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.930
 and you really grab those 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.640
 brussner and you realize they are the 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.489
 sharp-edged it hurts or 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.960
 or somewhere easy 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.700
 bad the game did processed 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.430
 in the back then you have to expect it when 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.930
 I often my hair so that 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.670
 of course, that it misled the 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.670
 is injured so permanent 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.170
 which is very good when it's wet 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.130
 is and brush only 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.780
 being very bad by the ones 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.119
 Hair through com is usually at the 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.500
 Care does not fit a long hair 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.570
 have they said themselves lost with the 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.850
 you can brush very well or found 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.280
 always so it fits to small pieces 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.380
 that always just not everything 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.610
 at once brushing and with those 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.860
 it brushes like this 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.630
 the gfk sees itself clearly that it 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.220
 very good because the goose star is the one 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:38.600
 start to tear or 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:39.890
 injured hair styling from the 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.470
 coast with yes I can 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.970
 I can only promote 1 volume 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.399
 a nice we something illegal 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.780
 I can do it if you can 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.460
 the whole is made of plastic or 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.850
 think her hair basic material is the 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.039
 Well 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.200
 it's the type of plastic 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.869
 again after that is the first 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.210
 the second thing is in a lot 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.240
 which is important if i have the 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.250
 hair Lehmann to and I have too little 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.659
 post only then I can not stress 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.000
 Build up the slide all the time 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.970
 hair through 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.290
 and how do you do that with the brush? 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.330
 you do not have to introduce them 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.770
 a nature has brush film in the beginning 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.340
 always with you, he will like to hang 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.810
 sticking to the wall and what they do 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.010
 can only do now is only then 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.560
 very much like worn too flat 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.120
 I can do that with my front brow 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.190
 with this series it can with 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.739
 pull down when flat on the skin 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.480
 Above this is exactly this one row 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.940
 this falls out where you think what 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.980
 heard that belongs in the reason 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.540
 frashes are quite flat 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.129
 hold 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.370
 I've been with it for 20 years 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.370
 brush 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.640
 as you can see for example is a natural 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.740
 and art brist what's in there 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.260
 this bit tighter but very short 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.900
 cut and the mandate is the wood 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.610
 and is made of metal that has metal 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.160
 the advantage of metal warms up 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.630
 and I'm a little faster at curling 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.130
 Feel or be curious for example 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.290
 nice then it is important that the sooner 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.490
 The more compact one is that they hold well 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.650
 and heat is available here the hair 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.870
 Of course, to the brush of sure that 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.200
 take your heat then of course have 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.239
 much better jumping power indoors 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.550
 what's up with the other one again ? 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.680
 brush not the case is there but 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.380
 This one wants it a bit bigger 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.800
 not that they are so curly so small 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.160
 become 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.380
 only this must always be introduced if the 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.030
 still very fresh and new are there 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.709
 the hair get caught very very much 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.900
 inside and then maybe others 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.690
 Hair still fall over it 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.610
 rheinfelder yes then they have too 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.489
 problems we get there I disturb 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.660
 My breasts are out with that 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.660
 something more difficult to lead
