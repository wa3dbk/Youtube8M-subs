00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 here is a very economical method for 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.910
 make the vegetable patch 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.130
 just use boards 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:14.670
 coming from a sawmill here it's about 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:16.920
 poplars since we square of vegetable garden 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.490
 do a doctor two sides we will couple 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.480
 of a doctor's plants one measures a 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:32.399
 doctor with a handsaw too 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:33.450
 jumping if you have one now 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.940
 that the four boards cut a 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.940
 doctor we will move to assembly for 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.640
 that we will use and ddd corner of wood 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.320
 to be sure the angles a screwdriver and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.789
 some vices and the sphere v8 play there 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.800
 Today, there are defects that the 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.800
 peculiarity of not splitting wood 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.290
 now we are going to spend his 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.850
 boards with walnut husk the reason is 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.160
 pretty simple it's just for 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.720
 soften the colors the white color 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.940
 is never very aesthetic in a 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.760
 garden once the nutshell summer 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.390
 brushed on our boards we go 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:18.590
 install our square in place and we will 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.600
 to fill it with earth is perhaps 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.690
 also the opportunity for your garden to be there 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.380
 add manure humus if you 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:30.200
 live in the countryside and to complete 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.080
 to enrich our garden square one 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.710
 will put potting soil and 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.380
 compost 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.670
 potting soil can use it more here it 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.670
 is a universal potting soil 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.640
 a general rule when it comes 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.410
 to apply potting mix appropriate 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:53.470
 add more soil 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:56.230
 pack well before sowing 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.910
 completed this phase of the potting soil of this 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.040
 square of vegetable garden I remind him of a 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:04.050
 doctor aside now this square is 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.050
 ready to be sown or planted
