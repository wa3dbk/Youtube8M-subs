00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.850
 and in open 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.190
 Sometimes we like to feel the air on our face 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.730
 you look like a helmet I pour 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.170
 and sometimes a closed helmet helps you a lot with the weather conditions 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.450
 gloves 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.670
