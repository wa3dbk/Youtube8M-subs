and here I laid out the plans here and I
just<00:00:55.350> started<00:00:55.800> building<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:58.550> center

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
just started building the the center

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.479 
just started building the the center
win-win<00:01:00.270> wings<00:01:00.840> center<00:01:01.680> section<00:01:02.219> right<00:01:02.430> there

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
win-win wings center section right there

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.730 
win-win wings center section right there
and<00:01:03.830> to<00:01:04.830> started<00:01:05.220> doing<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.530> here's<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
and to started doing that and here's the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.330 
and to started doing that and here's the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
motor and everything in here and it's an

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.950 
motor and everything in here and it's an
electric<00:01:11.729> motor<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.890> got<00:01:14.540> it's<00:01:15.540> radio

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
electric motor and got it's radio

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:26.960 
electric motor and got it's radio
controlled<00:01:17.090> there's<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:24.950> you<00:01:25.950> here's<00:01:26.759> our

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
controlled there's a you here's our

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.819 
controlled there's a you here's our
control<00:01:27.390> okay<00:01:28.430> there<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.840> that's<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:32.210> so

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
control okay there it is that's a so

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.980 
control okay there it is that's a so
anyway<00:01:34.829> she'll<00:01:35.310> be<00:01:35.430> pretty<00:01:35.610> neat<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.180> I'll

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
anyway she'll be pretty neat and I'll

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.980 
anyway she'll be pretty neat and I'll
learn<00:01:37.170> how<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.500> fly<00:01:39.799> radio<00:01:40.799> control<00:01:41.990> that

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
learn how to fly radio control that

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.410 
learn how to fly radio control that
because<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.470> never<00:01:43.619> flew<00:01:44.130> radio<00:01:44.520> controller

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
because I never flew radio controller

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.710 
because I never flew radio controller
controls<00:01:46.320> all<00:01:47.189> right<00:01:47.399> all's<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.030> did<00:01:48.060> was<00:01:48.299> line

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
controls all right all's I did was line

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.440 
controls all right all's I did was line
control<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.149> new<00:01:51.180> experience

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
control so this this is a new experience

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.380 
control so this this is a new experience
here<00:01:52.229> building<00:01:52.799> planes<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.520> not<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> new

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
here building planes is not in a new

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.520 
here building planes is not in a new
experience<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.350> flying<00:01:56.280> rate<00:01:56.549> RC<00:01:57.180> will<00:01:57.450> be<00:01:57.630> so

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
experience but flying rate RC will be so

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.899 
experience but flying rate RC will be so
hopefully<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.640> don't<00:01:59.790> crack<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.390> up<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.909> this

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
hopefully I don't crack it up and this

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.430 
hopefully I don't crack it up and this
will<00:02:03.119> give<00:02:03.270> me<00:02:03.299> good<00:02:04.880> training<00:02:05.880> for

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
will give me good training for

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
will give me good training for
my<00:02:08.070> piper<00:02:08.369> j-3<00:02:09.320> which<00:02:10.320> I'm<00:02:10.590> working<00:02:10.950> on<00:02:11.070> and
