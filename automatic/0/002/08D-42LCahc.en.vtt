bring<00:02:28.180> this<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.450> bit<00:02:28.810> more<00:02:29.050> okay<00:02:29.770> and<00:02:30.040> it

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
bring this a bit more okay and it

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.140 
bring this a bit more okay and it
doesn't<00:02:30.850> have<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.030> be<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:32.830> can<00:02:33.430> have<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.730> bit

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
doesn't have to be so you can have a bit

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.020 
doesn't have to be so you can have a bit
of<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.390> bend<00:02:34.630> on<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:35.050> okay<00:02:35.920> from<00:02:36.190> here<00:02:36.250> you're

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
of a bend on that okay from here you're

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.839 
of a bend on that okay from here you're
then<00:02:37.239> going<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.569> bubble<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.290> up<00:02:38.849> painting

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
then going to bubble it up painting

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.520 
then going to bubble it up painting
you're<00:02:39.970> gonna<00:02:40.120> wig<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.599> have<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.870> bit<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.380> a

you're gonna wig and have a bit of a

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.340 
you're gonna wig and have a bit of a
bubble<00:02:41.739> cockpit<00:02:42.600> okay<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:43.780> it's<00:02:43.930> going<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.200> go

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
bubble cockpit okay and it's going to go

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.990 
bubble cockpit okay and it's going to go
down<00:02:44.620> about<00:02:45.400> there

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
down about there

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.580 
down about there

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
we're going to draw a little end to this

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.410 
we're going to draw a little end to this
okay<00:02:53.500> in<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.860> propeller<00:02:54.340> it's<00:02:54.970> going<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.299> be

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
okay in the propeller it's going to be

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.960 
okay in the propeller it's going to be
very<00:02:55.660> simple<00:02:56.140> for<00:02:56.530> this<00:02:56.680> we're<00:02:57.519> going<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.760> draw

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
very simple for this we're going to draw

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.410 
very simple for this we're going to draw
a<00:02:58.180> tiny<00:02:58.450> little<00:02:58.840> bit<00:02:59.140> there<00:02:59.470> and<00:03:00.060> then<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.090> nice

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
a tiny little bit there and then a nice

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:09.449 
a tiny little bit there and then a nice
long<00:03:05.069> okay<00:03:06.100> then<00:03:06.459> about<00:03:07.030> here<00:03:08.100> we're<00:03:09.100> going<00:03:09.340> to

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
long okay then about here we're going to

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:17.940 
long okay then about here we're going to
draw<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:10.319> rectangle<00:03:12.930> like<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:15.030> one<00:03:16.030> two<00:03:16.950> three

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.340 
draw a rectangle like that one two three
four<00:03:18.280> okay<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:19.630> then<00:03:19.780> you're<00:03:19.959> going<00:03:20.109> to<00:03:20.170> make

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
four okay and then you're going to make

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.610 
four okay and then you're going to make
it<00:03:20.680> like<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.880> it's<00:03:22.180> done<00:03:22.510> they<00:03:22.959> all<00:03:22.989> start<00:03:23.530> the

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.849 
it like so it's done they all start the
same<00:03:23.769> bit<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:24.579> then<00:03:25.000> extend<00:03:25.600> slightly<00:03:26.049> no

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
same bit and then extend slightly no

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.759 
same bit and then extend slightly no
rubbing<00:03:27.310> out<00:03:27.489> need<00:03:27.970> for<00:03:28.239> this<00:03:28.359> one<00:03:28.660> okay<00:03:29.109> it's

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
rubbing out need for this one okay it's

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.620 
rubbing out need for this one okay it's
easy<00:03:29.980> to<00:03:30.310> do<00:03:30.430> without<00:03:30.640> guidelines<00:03:31.769> so<00:03:33.630> it's

wheel keep your same gonna come down and

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.069 
wheel keep your same gonna come down and
bit<00:04:08.859> halfway<00:04:09.160> between<00:04:09.639> them<00:04:10.090> two<00:04:10.359> you're

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
bit halfway between them two you're

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.129 
bit halfway between them two you're
going<00:04:11.230> to<00:04:11.290> draw<00:04:11.500> a<00:04:11.530> little<00:04:11.799> bubble<00:04:12.900> okay<00:04:13.900> and

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
going to draw a little bubble okay and

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.009 
going to draw a little bubble okay and
then<00:04:14.380> it's<00:04:15.280> going<00:04:15.519> to<00:04:15.609> join<00:04:15.790> it<00:04:16.030> there<00:04:16.209> then

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
then it's going to join it there then

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.770 
then it's going to join it there then
about<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.680> bit<00:04:18.070> between<00:04:18.250> so<00:04:18.849> you're<00:04:19.539> gonna<00:04:19.720> draw

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
about a bit between so you're gonna draw

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.940 
about a bit between so you're gonna draw
without<00:04:22.410> their<00:04:22.710> okay<00:04:24.140> also<00:04:25.140> if<00:04:25.380> you<00:04:25.560> want<00:04:25.830> to

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.140 
without their okay also if you want to
do<00:04:26.220> this<00:04:26.430> she<00:04:26.700> can<00:04:26.880> draw<00:04:27.090> like<00:04:27.390> a<00:04:27.690> little<00:04:29.150> box

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
do this she can draw like a little box

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.290 
do this she can draw like a little box
under<00:04:30.630> there<00:04:31.340> okay<00:04:32.340> which<00:04:32.580> might<00:04:32.880> just<00:04:32.910> make

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
under there okay which might just make

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.820 
under there okay which might just make
it<00:04:33.540> look<00:04:33.690> a<00:04:33.720> bit<00:04:33.870> more<00:04:34.050> realistic<00:04:34.650> okay

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830

hard at the end okay right don't in all

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.730 
hard at the end okay right don't in all
of<00:04:45.240> my<00:04:45.390> drawings<00:04:45.870> I'm<00:04:46.140> going<00:04:46.380> to<00:04:46.440> do<00:04:46.560> it

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
of my drawings I'm going to do it

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.880 
of my drawings I'm going to do it
lighter<00:04:47.250> at<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:47.820> start<00:04:48.210> okay<00:04:48.900> and<00:04:49.350> now<00:04:49.590> we're
