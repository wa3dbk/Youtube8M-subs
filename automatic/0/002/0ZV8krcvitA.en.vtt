00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:09.920
 so this is a sharpening machine let's say 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.710
 I found here 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:19.590
 less often with the help of such a clamping 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:23.810
 forks it happens 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:31.260
 it means you can change very calmly angle 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:33.500
 sharpening more less we take 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:41.540
 mediator 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:48.000
 so replacing the tape clamping hand a. 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:57.860
 fixed it so we have a ribbon 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.860
 grain 120 has a direction of travel 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:45.210
 he keeps everywhere accurate and identical 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.439
 why for the correct selection of abrasive 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.679
 under this particular 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:56.130
 I will not argue because well 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:59.069
 so very sharp to say so 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.380
 cut the paper should still be corrected if 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:05.429
 I have 400. 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.759
 maybe something else is needed by the sword and but in 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.670
 Generally for the kitchen 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.709
 sharpens very well if 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.810
 combine some more certain 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:22.140
 grit abrasive will be generally 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:27.319
 chic so does it mean we have ourselves 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:30.049
 represents means as I have already shown 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:34.349
 spring tensioned 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:36.860
 adjustment here I showed that 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:42.620
 rising lowers changing angle 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:45.510
 motor 075 kilowatt 1400 rpm 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.630
 belt speed of 7 meters 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.410
 second as sharpening very 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.410
 good speed
