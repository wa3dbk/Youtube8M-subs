00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
can actually use hot glue this actually

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.910 
can actually use hot glue this actually
works<00:02:15.530> out<00:02:15.770> just<00:02:15.950> fine<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:18.470> other<00:02:18.500> thing<00:02:18.890> that

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920
