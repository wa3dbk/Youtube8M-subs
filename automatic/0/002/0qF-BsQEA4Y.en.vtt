00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
shopping cart target has sort of a

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.469 
shopping cart target has sort of a
square<00:01:20.080> pattern<00:01:20.770> which<00:01:21.670> doesn't<00:01:22.150> allow<00:01:22.210> the

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
square pattern which doesn't allow the

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.749 
square pattern which doesn't allow the
velcro<00:01:22.960> in<00:01:23.440> the<00:01:23.560> back<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:26.190> line<00:01:27.190> up<00:01:27.400> in<00:01:27.729> the

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
velcro in the back to line up in the

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.730 
velcro in the back to line up in the
back<00:01:27.910> to<00:01:28.390> lock<00:01:28.750> it<00:01:28.930> in<00:01:29.050> place

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
back to lock it in place

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.800 
back to lock it in place
I<00:01:29.770> guess<00:01:30.550> that<00:01:30.729> might<00:01:30.880> work<00:01:31.060> in<00:01:31.270> a<00:01:31.390> regular

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
I guess that might work in a regular

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.990 
I guess that might work in a regular
grocery<00:01:32.320> store<00:01:32.830> shopping<00:01:33.040> cart<00:01:33.460> but<00:01:33.640> not<00:01:33.820> the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
grocery store shopping cart but not the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.290 
grocery store shopping cart but not the
target<00:01:34.240> one<00:01:34.539> and<00:01:35.320> there's<00:01:35.590> a<00:01:35.830> gap<00:01:36.100> like<00:01:37.090> the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
target one and there's a gap like the

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.380 
target one and there's a gap like the
link<00:01:37.539> oh<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.920> shopping<00:01:39.130> cart<00:01:39.550> seat<00:01:39.789> is<00:01:40.030> wider

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
link oh the shopping cart seat is wider

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.260 
link oh the shopping cart seat is wider
than<00:01:40.720> this<00:01:40.899> length<00:01:41.229> so<00:01:41.950> there<00:01:42.130> is<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.280> gap<00:01:42.640> about

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
than this length so there is a gap about

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.469 
than this length so there is a gap about
maybe<00:01:43.869> this<00:01:44.170> much<00:01:44.490> from<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.610> hinge<00:01:45.820> and<00:01:46.300> of

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
maybe this much from the hinge and of

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.310 
maybe this much from the hinge and of
course<00:01:46.780> my<00:01:47.350> son<00:01:48.000> has<00:01:49.000> his<00:01:49.240> toys<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.990> his<00:01:50.050> water

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
course my son has his toys and his water

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.740 
course my son has his toys and his water
bottle<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:50.950> smear<00:01:51.490> sit<00:01:51.789> all<00:01:51.940> over<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.479> parts

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
bottle and smear sit all over the parts

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.960 
bottle and smear sit all over the parts
that<00:01:52.840> are<00:01:53.050> covered<00:01:53.530> so<00:01:54.070> there's<00:01:54.250> no<00:01:54.460> point<00:01:54.700> in

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
that are covered so there's no point in

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.820 
that are covered so there's no point in
using<00:01:55.179> this<00:01:55.600> because<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:56.289> doesn't<00:01:56.470> cover

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
using this because it doesn't cover

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.999 
using this because it doesn't cover
everything<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:58.149> it's<00:01:59.110> since<00:01:59.649> you're

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
everything and it's since you're

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.249 
everything and it's since you're
not<00:02:00.130> able<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.670> velcro<00:02:01.030> it<00:02:01.119> into<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.330> back<00:02:01.539> it

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
not able to velcro it into the back it

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.139 
not able to velcro it into the back it
does<00:02:02.500> work<00:02:02.770> on<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.100> sides<00:02:03.399> you<00:02:03.700> can't<00:02:03.940> bel

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
does work on the sides you can't bel

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.270 
does work on the sides you can't bel
throw<00:02:04.330> it<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.690> sides<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.800> you<00:02:05.979> can't

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
throw it to the sides and you can't

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.490 
throw it to the sides and you can't
velcro<00:02:06.759> the<00:02:06.910> fun<00:02:07.179> to<00:02:07.300> see<00:02:07.479> in<00:02:07.569> there<00:02:07.750> but<00:02:08.380> the

velcro the fun to see in there but the

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.699 
velcro the fun to see in there but the
back<00:02:08.709> you<00:02:08.920> can<00:02:09.130> so<00:02:09.490> it<00:02:09.610> sheds<00:02:10.000> a<00:02:10.270> lot<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:10.929> he

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
back you can so it sheds a lot and he

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.880 
back you can so it sheds a lot and he
moves<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.459> it's<00:02:12.610> just<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:14.260> didn't<00:02:14.470> work<00:02:14.650> out

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
moves and it's just it didn't work out

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.550 
moves and it's just it didn't work out
unfortunately<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:16.000> now<00:02:16.720> I'm<00:02:16.870> going<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.349> try<00:02:17.530> to
