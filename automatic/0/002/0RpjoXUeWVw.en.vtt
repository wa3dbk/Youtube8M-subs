00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.900
 guys today is for a 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.880
 new information video concerning 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.740
 call of duty advance of war in this 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.509
 video joe do a recap of 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.039
 all the cards of that become soffin 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.020
 actually saw that maicon has us 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.000
 formalized the fact that we will have 13 cards 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.429
 in the dance multiplayer finally more 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.320
 one in case of pre-order as at each 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.390
 call of duty for two years now 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.480
 for example with black ops the new 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.910
 saints 2025 a ghost the card stronger 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.420
 so in this case we will have 13 14 maps 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.350
 for those who have pre-ordered 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.640
 so today is the end of 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.590
 presentation about 14 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.510
 brands that are frankly at its 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.890
 great on the environment we can 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.149
 interact a lot with the decor of 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.809
 cards that are really beautiful and 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.250
 light 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.050
 many colors frankly I 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.219
 nothing to say except for that 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.050
 really beautiful maps that we 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.629
 been presented and this year I think 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.100
 that we will have as belmont at the level of 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.869
 this multi joy so not start over with 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.640
 the fan map of the a4 that we have the 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.090
 older is happening after the golden 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.340
 bridge 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.530
 sometimes we have a tsunami that is a 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.119
 little bit via interacting with us in 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.470
 during the game so that's 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.030
 something that I found that quite 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.890
 nice for objective game modes 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.149
 especially if there are flags near the 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.729
 tsunami it can always be 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.530
 interesting for the one who owns or 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.630
 not the flag and so here's a map 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.130
 who honestly will honor the 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.509
 assault rifles and snipers in the 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.250
 gameplay we saw it's 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.569
 mostly sniper and rifle 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.489
 of assault so a map that I have 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.509
 really looking forward to testing especially for 

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:36.369
 cheaters that may be a pleasure 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:40.330
 lessor lab a map that pleased everything 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:43.539
 the world a snow-covered clothing the wires and 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.530
 pump guns and smg are going to be at 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.459
 the honor there it's a map 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.970
 who has a lot of fighting 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:47.770
 close 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.229
 So here we can certainly fun for 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.940
 for players who like to be in the 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.979
 fire of the action and who like to read at 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.349
 chef you are going to be served through 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.759
 this card really really nice riot 

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:59.020
 a cape going on in a prison 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.670
 who will definitely be one of 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.650
 favorite for players of 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.540
 for who have tested to 100 on the end a 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.190
 cellar that will favor the rifles 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.690
 of assault and also the snipers like 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.670
 I say it's a big big map 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.489
 many buildings but sng 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.170
 can also be favor abl in 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.790
 this card is frankly I can not wait 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.050
 to see what it will give you pass 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.880
 now the hassen card is going on 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.870
 in a subway bus stop or I do not know 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.670
 too much what we actually do not know exactly 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.010
 what it may be a shuttle 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.330
 space this card frankly she 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.069
 will have everything in this map we saw 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.050
 sniper gameplays with assault rifle 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.190
 at cmj hours before all a guard 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.080
 which is really versatile we do not want 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.300
 interact too much with the decor but she 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.680
 is nice a lot of brightness and I 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.670
 think that here everyone will have gold to 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.019
 each his way of playing 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.760
 so there are a lot of assault rifles 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.080
 also sng as well as 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.950
 snipers so we'll really have everything 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.940
 on this map and that's some 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.769
 something that is interesting to have some 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.959
 versatile cards this way 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.269
 it's really something I like 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.150
 a lot we then presented the map 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.920
 retreat hygiene a map that is 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.450
 really nice but there will be 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.799
 really ubiquitous sng at 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.340
 level of this map a pretty map 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.630
 small 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.069
 frankly I can not say much 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.260
 at the level of objective game modes 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.090
 service frankly to be very nice on 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.350
 will have a lot of really great gameplay 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.000
 very very tight that's what we like 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.760
 when jean-claude here so I really 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.359
 look forward to seeing this recovery card 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.160
 definitely the best map 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.780
 until now for my taste even though we 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.640
 did not play a red card that will have a 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.900
 volcano and when the volcano comes in 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.120
 blowout must pass the first 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.859
 door to go to the second part of 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.690
 the map so you do not have to be 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.100
 touched by the volcano so after 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.630
 the eruption of volcanoes will all happen 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.670
 behind the door so that frankly 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.380
 will have to play fast and there you have seen the 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.660
 card is just beautiful 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.130
 everything is very very beautiful around the decor 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.140
 frankly the landscape it's just 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.510
 beautifully honestly there is a big 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.290
 interactivity with the volcano is with 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.880
 the characters so that's it 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.890
 frankly also something that I find 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.510
 really interesting the throat card that 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.709
 is the remake of kotka pipelines so 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.350
 this is the card you get when 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.030
 you preorder adventure get you 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.680
 this famous throat map so we did not 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.940
 no need for information on it if we 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.829
 will have extra things the map 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.829
 original or not we just know it's 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.459
 the remake of the cost pipeline map 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.829
 of 4 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.910
 the map to visions who in who is 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.239
 our second and those of my slopes 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.709
 snowy so a great map we saw 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.910
 in this input when frankly 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.359
 it's a map that will really please 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.220
 everybody 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.380
 this time maybe it's snipers 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.700
 who have been favored 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.130
 invited think about those drop to lead to 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.180
 a modern warfare 2 ah but that's right 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.430
 that there are a lot of buildings 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.230
 many authors and frankly the 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.170
 snobs will benefit from the green card 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.790
 bun definitely a very good card 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.620
 colors without stress will make 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.270
 frankly superb a lot of fights 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.280
 in close combat we can see it here 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.960
 it looks like a label to a labyrinth a 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.090
 little so that frankly risk being 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.950
 super we will have very very tight games 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.870
 and very very very nervous about what 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.830
 to have fun and there will be some for 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.720
 everyone so well and this in the 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.820
 simple throws will be dominant on this 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.870
 card it seems a little bit a little 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.490
 not normal but making a card 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.120
 definitely that I find super beautiful 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.790
 at the color level 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.920
 so this zhang card that has been shown 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.300
 So we not yet know the name was 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.860
 of gameplay images of this card 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.090
 but we know that's not the name 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.140
 card that may be very very big 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.130
 she was introduced this is the first 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.690
 multiplayer map that we were 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.630
 presented in the first trailer 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.010
 so you take a card gameplay 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.600
 as I say that is big enough 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.950
 this map plaza we do not know 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.060
 really in name it definitely makes 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.860
 placed in plaza 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.960
 it looks the same and we find 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.310
 now a map that is a map 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.650
 which is going to detroit we do not know 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.180
 still the name we have no shade well 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.260
 obviously but cinema since there 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.930
 a lot of everything green we can really 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.860
 interacts with the killstreaks decor 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.950
 frankly I find it very very very 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.720
 very very friendly card also 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.880
 going on strait in a neighborhood 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.169
 Straits a map that will benefit 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.550
 scenes I have melee so that's 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.900
 serves up in four cases of 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.919
 really like a lot of people and 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.200
 to finish this map that makes me 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.800
 many think of hydro from black up 2 of 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.600
 dlc 1 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.860
 she is beautiful simply from 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.030
 this little one of this little sequence 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.600
 frankly I find it super 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.830
 nice 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.690
 a map that is very very beautiful and 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.220
 here I really wish that accomplice has 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.240
 also interact with the decor is at 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.980
 water level so that's it 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.110
 for the presentation of his fourteen 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.340
 multiplayer maps I hope this 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.510
 little presentation you will have liked it is 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.800
 the cac unleashed a small poucet remedy 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.820
 what you think in comment 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.650
 personally I think we have 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.660
 really great map that might be 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.919
 really a super call of duty at the level 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.180
 of his marks on this I leave you 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.180
 you say ciao bye guys
