00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello everyone came to this new one 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.900
 video to whom I will show you how to perform 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.849
 the root on a samsung galaxy note 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.330
 updated to gelli then been with 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.140
 the latest version of the software ie the 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.820
 4.1.2 to run the root in a manner 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.119
 simple we need a card 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.140
 of external micro sd memory and file 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.400
 that I will go to put in description 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.759
 let's start by turning off ours 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.000
 device 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:38.550
 ok also remember that all this 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.370
 tutorial is for illustrative purposes only e 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.960
 that the undersigned does not assume 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.079
 no responsibility on any 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.520
 damage you could cause during 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.440
 this operation 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.829
 obviously run the root goes to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.710
 void the warranty but re-installing 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.640
 an original firmware this comes 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.160
 reset 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.660
 let's go then taking recovery mode 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.590
 has pressed the volume key in 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.619
 up the menu button and the power button 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.390
 all three at the same time in this 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.000
 in this way with this combination 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.840
 of keys we will go into the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.770
 recovery mode of our device 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.050
 we wait until 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:28.640
 we do not enter into recovery that we believe 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:33.530
 pressed all the keys ok we are on 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.420
 menu unfortunately a lot is written 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.970
 small so I can't get to 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.370
 fire with the webcam you will find 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.490
 surely the images with which 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.400
 you will be able to guess the passages well 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.070
 we must now go to the third item 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:54.770
 ie apply update from external storage 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.840
 then the volume key up and down 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.620
 they are used to navigate inside the 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.960
 menu while the power button is needed 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.570
 to confirm then with stop 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.479
 and let's select the package that 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.399
 we had downloaded and put in 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.950
 main directory of our micro 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:18.660
 sd then the package 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.700
 fu zc wm6 and then the version of 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.730
 software that gets day by day 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.180
 then we press enter 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.940
 now the phone is progressing 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.349
 then the package installation 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.349
 to the extraction of all data 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.120
 we wait until he has finished 15 reappears 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.520
 still at least before 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.450
 let's go back to the first entry 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:50.550
 two slash dots to get back to the level 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.680
 superior and we do reboot system u 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:57.720
 in this way the device comes 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.959
 restarted obviously does not appear on 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.819
 triangle for the counter because with 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.530
 this procedure 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.540
 the counter remember that it does not come 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.250
 absolutely activated so you won't have 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.880
 more need to go to disable it 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.430
 via triangle away is a method 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.340
 very simple if you have the micro 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.760
 sd you can also find it from a jig from 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.640
 2 gb 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.730
 it's not a problem because the file that 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:28.050
 let's go to load it's really small 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.470
 occupies a couple of mega now I go to 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.470
 enter my pin code 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.470
 ok 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:44.650
 and here we are, the device has performed 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.660
 the root to check if we have 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.050
 performed correctly we can 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:56.170
 always go to the play store and download 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:57.790
 an ok looking application 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.020
 he'll simply have to find it in between 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:04.750
 the first he should be checker 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:08.440
 in fact it is the first application that is 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:12.130
 also finds it should be this here 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.960
 perfect we can download it for a 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.209
 quick check so as to be 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.350
 sure you have done it in a manner 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.850
 correct 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.690
 even if there cannot be 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:27.050
 errors during 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.050
 during this process 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:34.090
 ok the update we leave it where it is 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.750
 around shopping should ok 

00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:45.119
 installation in progress 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.740
 so this app what to save 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.840
 simply check if ours 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:59.400
 phone here we make agri so we are 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:02.630
 agree with various things 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:06.870
 ruth checker so we have to go up 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:09.330
 then check the super user status 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.479
 that is the application will ask us to 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.560
 granting access is in fact the 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.849
 result 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.620
 now let's see if we can see 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.800
 concrete race on this device nelspruit 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:23.550
 then access our device to i 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:26.250
 root permissions something are permissions 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.229
 they are not just exactly as he says 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.259
 the very name of the permits that it does yes 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:34.289
 that the various applications we go 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:36.360
 then to install such as well 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.520
 killers etc. have access to 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.520
 reading and writing certain areas of the 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.240
 system that are normally hidden 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.240
 and protected by 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:50.820
 therefore, from access by the user himself 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.300
 also for this guide everything to 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.720
 next 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.720
 bye Bye
