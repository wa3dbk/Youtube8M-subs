00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.779
 and now all is that as I am May bis 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:07.270
 we are still in minecraft and good guys 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.760
 I'm in a new server and as you saw 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.770
 a pretty small house and you know 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.200
 the way we followed although he followed and 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.600
 the world series the world do not throw 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.830
 of more the medieval ones that I already mess 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.320
 you know I have a little memory 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.330
 scarce can be the average server 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.160
 balmain has closed these days and has 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.170
 definitely closed things that good 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.210
 it is normal, it does not end up happening everything 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.190
 that has a beginning has an ending and 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.900
 nothing, I have already searched 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.789
 an alternative to continue with the 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.920
 series as we are here in my little house already 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.359
 this is where he plays a long time ago 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.749
 this server has already brought a video 

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:42.390
 a few months and I played that day and such and 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:44.499
 well , that's what we have gothi kitano 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.030
 so nothing I invite you to do to the 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:48.969
 server will leave us as always the ip 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.219
 down there then to show more of the 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.389
 video as I always do and nothing because 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.489
 we must seize let's make a 

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:56.379
 sort of introduction for all 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.379
 that enter new here as you have 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.850
 been making the measurements of my stone 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.579
 of protection that is the system of 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.530
 protection that is used in the server 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.440
 and I was already living what I have 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.909
 this kid is where more tumbo 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.800
 writes so happy man walks around 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.540
 enemies there is a lot is for me that 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.050
 server is so difficult something like that because 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.270
 there is no current step been here 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.619
 delimiting my my protection not with the 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.740
 stone is diamond that I have here 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.479
 which incidentally costs 30,000 to put it 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.190
 buy the purchase of the 1000 cost but 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.200
 put it to make effect of 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.580
 protection costs 30 thousand vouchers there is more 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.740
 cheap now after we'll see them I'll 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.300
 teach more or less so it would be the 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.400
 spa or me all this kind of stuff in case 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.800
 you want to enter and continue the adventure 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.050
 of medieval magicians with me though this 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.369
 do not be the balmain medium but you have to 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.140
 look for an alternative not because it is 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.509
 help the closed definitely then 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.160
 nothing we continue with our 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.259
 we continue with medieval magicians even though 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.460
 on another server so I do not care 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.110
 I invite all of you who are in the 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.050
 previous server if write to this 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.450
 because you are not invited pretends to 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.399
 I was a while ago that I made a video about 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.759
 this server and the next day the 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.920
 same week they put it premium and clear 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.119
 Well, many people stopped coming in 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.979
 is that many people do not have the 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.870
 minecraft premium good you go to same 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.400
 There are 95 people they have not relocated 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.349
 premium and premium 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.519
 and good to the Generalitat the 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.140
 server has a lot of modes of 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.030
 game not only have survival we are in 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.030
 the spam of his rival but if we put hood 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.450
 here you will see that we have a space with 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.440
 different minigames and the whole roll 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.630

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.180

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.280

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.480

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.220

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.710
 video as I tell you the guests what 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.020
 you are by the server of medial 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.210
 mine and those who follow the series of boats 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.670
 Medieval then why do you come here 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.640
 and we follow each other we make a dragon there 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.250
 superchulo and it's super epic and that 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.650
 It seems super cool here I do not know 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.540
 which ones we have a dragon does not look like 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.970
 one told me it was the world dragon 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.350
 of warcraft or something like me as the played 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.680
 much truth I have no idea not 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.810
 water which craft valera 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.670
 here for this serial spawn of his rival 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.859
 ok today I say you are invited to 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.370
 come I will leave the ip as always 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:37.620
 we show the video and nothing we will see 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.969
 a little bit how was this from the 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.330
 Price protection is around here 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:43.950
 up where I explain it is worth here 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.020
 so that when you enter at least 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.180
 this is a little bit informed you put it 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.890
 all around here but there are people who do not 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.050
 whatever is waiting for us, since what 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.550
 know well this is the system of 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.470
 protection that there is supposed to be now 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.270
 a and also although good I do not know about 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.950
 everything but good if you want to make a 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.200
 little house out there like I 've done and two 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.920
 You reis here, buy it as 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.360
 You see it costs a thousand that you put I go a thousand all 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.130
 But putting them costs what to put 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.140
 down to the is the largest costs 60 thousand 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.570
 I bought this one had 32 thousand 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.800
 millions left peladito so look 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.410
 you can start with a little one 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.840
 five five nine by nine or 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.000
 13 by 13 and as you go going to 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.820
 work that is the same system as in 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.400
 the previous server we were already is 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.960
 like that of mining work 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.420
 Hunter builder or terrorism if 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:35.360
 you put barla jobs and you put browser 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.010
 That's the way it was, all jobs that 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.080
 can you say 3 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.370
 unlike average of main then here 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:48.050
 yes you can leave a job and take 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:49.790
 another so nothing with the following 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.070
 jarote with this this to see what 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.260
 there are your statistics will not be for 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.080
 leave them to leave all and for 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.000
 tell you a post work of the g8 I do not know 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.100
 if you have to spend a day to be able 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.750
 put in a job if you get this other 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.820
 not that not where I tried it the truth 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.220
 so nothing the sense is enough 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.070
 well is looking at several the truth that 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.450
 the point of minecraft is also very 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.240
 well that is another server that I play to 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.610
 times but only premium is worth it so I 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.900
 it seemed better this here since 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.330
 You can also enter what I am a 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.460
 vital man and we can continue with the 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.020
 series then quietly not so what 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.060
 said you are all invited those who 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.940
 you are the world series nice again 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.790
 as not under high average is worth milk and 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.360
 we'll see you in the next video up 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.360
 new guys
