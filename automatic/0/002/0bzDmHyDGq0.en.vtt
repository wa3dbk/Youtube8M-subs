00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
this gameplay did not start from the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.459 
this gameplay did not start from the
beginning<00:00:42.030> that's<00:00:42.719> because<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.200> beginning

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
beginning that's because the beginning

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.139

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
point streak normally would not sure if

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.030 
point streak normally would not sure if
that<00:01:15.270> counts<00:01:15.450> towards<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.830> if<00:01:16.890> somebody

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
that counts towards it but if somebody

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.469 
that counts towards it but if somebody
could<00:01:17.280> confirm<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.119> for<00:01:18.240> me<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.420> the

a<00:02:21.580> specialist<00:02:21.970> class<00:02:22.120> because<00:02:22.300> that's<00:02:22.450> pretty

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
a specialist class because that's pretty

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.229 
a specialist class because that's pretty
much<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.750> best<00:02:23.050> way<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.319> get<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.730> Mobe<00:02:24.910> in<00:02:25.090> my

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
opinion because you can't use

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.020 
opinion because you can't use

nicely<00:03:33.700> too<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.570> it<00:03:34.660> is<00:03:34.780> actually<00:03:34.870> smart<00:03:35.230> if

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
nicely too and it is actually smart if

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.630 
nicely too and it is actually smart if
you<00:03:35.350> think<00:03:35.500> about<00:03:35.530> it<00:03:35.680> so<00:03:36.100> anyways<00:03:36.340> there<00:03:36.519> was

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
you think about it so anyways there was

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.509 
you think about it so anyways there was
a<00:03:36.670> MOBA<00:03:36.970> got<00:03:37.180> it<00:03:37.329> I'm<00:03:37.799> if<00:03:38.799> you<00:03:38.920> didn't<00:03:39.190> see<00:03:39.340> it<00:03:39.459> I

that's<00:04:03.160> pretty<00:04:03.280> much<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.489> I'd<00:04:03.819> go<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.060> little

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
that's pretty much it I'd go a little

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.240 
that's pretty much it I'd go a little
bit<00:04:04.450> more<00:04:04.569> cricket<00:04:04.870> Batman<00:04:04.989> a<00:04:05.200> crazy<00:04:05.590> as<00:04:05.889> table

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
bit more cricket Batman a crazy as table

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.610 
bit more cricket Batman a crazy as table
say<00:04:06.400> killing<00:04:07.389> more<00:04:07.569> guys<00:04:07.750> and<00:04:08.049> one<00:04:08.319> thing<00:04:08.530> I

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
say killing more guys and one thing I

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.470 
say killing more guys and one thing I
think<00:04:08.680> that<00:04:09.280> keeps<00:04:09.639> the<00:04:09.790> smoke<00:04:10.060> gameplay

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
think that keeps the smoke gameplay

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.270 
think that keeps the smoke gameplay
separate<00:04:11.440> from<00:04:11.560> most<00:04:11.739> of<00:04:11.829> the<00:04:11.859> others<00:04:12.069> ones

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
separate from most of the others ones

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.940 
separate from most of the others ones
