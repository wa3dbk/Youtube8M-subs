00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.400
 This is 30 page 31 beige lighthouse 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.400
 It's the fifth song. 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.370
 The code will be Sunday c d7 eimhayi 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:18.590
 The beggar did learned is learned again 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.590
 I 'll show you in the pole g code 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:29.830
 Middle finger and third finger little finger 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:33.190
 And this is not the c code, 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.020
 Using these three fingers, you can use more than one fingertip 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.430
 That's how I do it. 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:42.850
 d-7 When I crossed, I mean the third finger first 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:47.500
 It goes down one line of the middle finger 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:50.309
 And the third finger at the bottom 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.309
 Give me d7 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:57.550
 I am here to 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.540
 In the case of d products, 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:06.199
 They often go up and turn three. 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.199
 If you go underneath it just below it , it becomes a minor. 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:16.010
 The state law is yo waltz. 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:20.530
 It 's not Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da is under. 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.530

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:28.579
 Taan 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:32.960
 Both are named after the helmet is too hard to be old 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.820
 Let's just better to not even care practice to harvest mate code exactly promoting 7:00 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.750
 It's important. 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:44.420
 Yes Law of the State 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:50.289
 Let's listen to a song once practiced. 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.289
 Should not be launched from Earl will need to start from Earl Beam 5 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:59.130

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:56.590

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.560
 The last word 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.070
 I'm going to look at the music as if ah is going to do so in order to form two water 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.190
 I know. 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:12.060
 I just want to find out 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:16.310
 This time, rather than who hit it just so the car jerking 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.310
 So that is going down, but
