00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.470
 and so we continue to repair will 740 left 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.900
 part 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:13.070
 wiring spit there and so 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.140
 further generally now one yellow wire 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.330
 I built up this one that was 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:21.560
 damaged here from i can see 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.570
 insulated soldered wire ramped it up and 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.810
 insulated with all ends 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.600
 like that thermo pencil for clifford 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:34.310
 I didn't like liquid plastic and 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:37.610
 I learned this further in this part 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:41.329
 where is this whole broken block 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:44.930
 connective in general see here there is 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.149
 two yellow wires are therefore mandatory 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.370
 if anyone wants to do repair wiring 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.500
 saw two identical colors mark 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.540
 them here since i am on one yellow wire i 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.960
 stuck two pieces of electrical tape 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:02.930
 on 2 1 did the same with the other 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:05.350
 sides 1 2 pieces of tape so as not to 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.530
 confuse God forbid confuse 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.060
 god knows i don't know how there 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.369
 everybody works right there 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.249
 transistors there all the circuits are in where 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.009
 dashboard or is there all brains and 

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:21.469
 cars in general I am not so subtle 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.600
 I go in and therefore I can't say so but 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:27.259
 maybe on one truth just goes 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.409
 for example 6 volts or 5 on another grandfather 12 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:36.579
 and so you can just have a lot of things in 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:39.109
 so burn the car like this 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.509
 mark on the right let there be one color 

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:44.419
 other wires to different color wiring 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:48.049
 seen here I have because there is bare 

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:51.889
 plots this for example that's pure to have here 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:55.849
 pure mithi is possible here by ether and rotted 

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:59.020
 the wires that is 3 I cut this one 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:01.999
 the insulating material is the main truth 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:06.109
 I looked that there I found where the wires are more 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:08.710
 they are already going well and well and good 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.420
 These are all now I will cut off 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.120
 I will replace the shoe I bought today 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.060
 just walked like a garage 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.310
 I went to the electrical shop and it does not work 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.400
 so the seller hurt I expected half 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.770
 hours and stated than went to the store 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.330
 repair gazelle and parts gazelle and 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.330
 I found the same wonderful pads 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.480
 here are your three columns cost me 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.850
 eat at 150 rubles there is one 55 other 32 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.740
 like this is 32 himself small this 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.310
 4850 24 rubles to one's look here at 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:50.810
 Essentially, it will suit me here because how many 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:53.780
 I have seven wires and then consider them 8 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.459
 but one wire of me will be superfluous that is 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.440
 I will bite them off and replace them here 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.590
 of essence 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.480
 not bad pleased with the purchase that's 50 rubles 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.670
 I donâ€™t remember the original one with this block 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.320
 in general, is expensive on existential I 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.890
 looked you can look at 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.730
 existential here is a block worth 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:20.540
 not bad so here is this chip 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:24.170
 so here are analogs 50 40 rubles you can 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.600
 find and do not need just here what you 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.239
 it will be written here I do not know vulva 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.070
 meant the cliff of the company bosch and now for that 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.430
 we just overpay 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.050
 about 1000 rubles over there because he's well here 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.040
 dive my camera won't be able to shoot there 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:43.340
 articles are written here for this 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.459
 little thing overcharges I do not know there rubles 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:51.170
 500 or some if you can buy for 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:53.959
 10 rubles for 10 and 50 rubles that's just 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:58.239
 I don't know usually saving money on my 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:04:00.950
 look ok ok let's continue on now 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:04.910
 bite off rotten wires build them up 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.860
 by soldering and joining into one 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.959
 the column here though to build up and the house is not 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.239
 it is worth it that everything seems to be here 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.810
 traced anywhere there is no damage therefore 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:19.459
 we'll bite them somewhere well even retreat 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:22.920
 This is how we connect this column 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.200
 already all the wires 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.530
 so bad little flowers of course 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.590
 I wanted the floor here how many times two three 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.870
 4 6 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:38.100
 unfortunately sorry candy the more 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:42.330
 colors all the better okay without it 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:46.770
 we will manage one-color there will be wires at 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:50.360
 we are well, in fact, everything will be clear well 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.360
 ok, now let's figure it out
