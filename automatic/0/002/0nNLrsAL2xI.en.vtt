it's so it's all done before you come
out<00:03:10.989> typically<00:03:11.410> installation<00:03:11.980> only<00:03:12.190> takes

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
out typically installation only takes

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.729 
out typically installation only takes
maybe<00:03:12.670> three<00:03:13.000> hours<00:03:13.180> tops<00:03:13.600> oh<00:03:13.900> wow<00:03:14.110> to<00:03:14.440> finish

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
maybe three hours tops oh wow to finish

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.470 
maybe three hours tops oh wow to finish
so<00:03:14.950> it's<00:03:15.130> all<00:03:15.280> done<00:03:15.519> colors<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.060> all<00:03:16.330> those
