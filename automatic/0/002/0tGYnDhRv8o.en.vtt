00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.290
 in these cases 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.440
 castaignos 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.030
 on the new face 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.630
 of the South rules to what I expect to be a sorting machine 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:13.929
 Look what we're seeing 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.449
 it's medical team 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:17.909
 the presenter 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:20.909
 no excel is worse 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.919
 ourique refrÃªncia is underlined 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.890
 it is the first fact 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.009
 stipulate 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.199
 automatically 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.470
 I know 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.720
 either 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.730
 Maradona and smile 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.730
 She is discussing the program. 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.090
 carlos queiroz 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.980
 a feather 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.230
 warm or cold 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.260
 sancha 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
 the maximum of the garage 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.150
 leaves today 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.340
 for maximum inheritance 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.800
 percentage 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.800
 or else 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.590
 by standard deviation 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.780
 we 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.780
 This page 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.390
 does not have to 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.310
 nothing much different from blood pressure 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.620
 no rest 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.780
 brake size represented here alana initial and current garage 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.750
 on the richter scale the bid 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.790
 she at home at the beginning 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.330
 it's the same as current 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.010
 current is calculated in response 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.930
 ten more - was a risk that certain 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.420
 we can have 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.909
 the expobento speaks in the cel garage because it is on twitter a poorer 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.890
 on the other hand 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:16.529
 big name of the game go 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:19.529
 she laughs 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.540
 here elected - the pressure charts 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.030
 Marcos 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.309
 cross indicates 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:34.519
 the Greeks and we lose 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.049
 What is it? 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.079
 this time while the circuit 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.079
 if we win in seven years 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.079
 if this is the epicent 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.419
 be aware of this action bia have had more 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.809
 or ia 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:53.309
 as for the salt shaker 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:55.399
 csp also more family 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:58.869
 the situation is also open and that of the laity 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:01.189
 They're killing children. 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.599
 if it is unlikely to happen 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.599
 but the writing of the actions says have some confusion 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.099
 of the legality of the same service 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.809
 in this case 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:14.809
 normal would be 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:18.609
 and this scenario 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.609
 to unite 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.159
 this scenario 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:28.889
 This page 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.789
 nothing attractive 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:34.789
 much more listening environmental production 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.269
 which are used endings 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.580
 or more to strike with aspects 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.099
 or you can expect to stay in 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.629
 the crime 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.269
 this to save 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.269
 in function in this story 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.329
 what's new 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.959
 my father 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.459
 is due to exception graphical discussions 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.939
 and before the two actions 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:05.889
 Are you there? 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:07.630
 with producer action 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.209
 in both cases 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.799
 is here 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:11.840
 the concession 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.969
 I feel that here or the pt 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:16.519
 the movement 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.090
 by these actions in percentage terms we have the sector 

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:23.809
 is here 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.590
 coast 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.590
 to 5 years 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.490
 two years ago 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.229

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.539
 Added artur 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.539
 I'm in doubt stone believes the downer 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:01.379
 to start 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:03.430
 no doubt 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.270
 O 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.240
 if I find the 0 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.590
 at first but that's not all except for the cops 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.939
 to score 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:19.959
 to let it be tried in this way when the 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.199
 nucci pictures 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.939
 addresses towers already knows 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:30.240
 are welcome
