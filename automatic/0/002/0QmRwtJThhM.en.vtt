that's a huge huge thing
I<00:02:12.989> also<00:02:13.590> recommend<00:02:14.130> using<00:02:14.489> dumbbells<00:02:14.850> too

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
I also recommend using dumbbells too

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.000 
I also recommend using dumbbells too
much<00:02:15.360> as<00:02:15.540> possible<00:02:15.750> because<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.500> those<00:02:16.680> will

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
much as possible because of those will

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.250 
much as possible because of those will
isolate<00:02:17.220> muscles<00:02:17.910> individually<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.810> force

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
isolate muscles individually and force

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.949 
isolate muscles individually and force
the<00:02:19.440> muscles<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:20.220> working<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:21.269> also<00:02:21.780> work

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
the muscles to working and also work

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.860 
the muscles to working and also work
together<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:23.220> okay<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.000> stabilize<00:02:24.540> your<00:02:24.569> body

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
together to okay and stabilize your body

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.970 
together to okay and stabilize your body
you're<00:02:25.170> gonna<00:02:25.230> get<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.470> lot<00:02:25.650> better<00:02:25.830> results

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
you're gonna get a lot better results

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.210 
you're gonna get a lot better results
from<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.840> make<00:02:27.840> your<00:02:28.019> repetitions<00:02:28.440> slow<00:02:28.950> and

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
from that make your repetitions slow and

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.910 
from that make your repetitions slow and
controlled<00:02:29.370> this<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.390> not<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.600> competition<00:02:30.989> you

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
controlled this is not a competition you

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.349 
controlled this is not a competition you
don't<00:02:31.950> want<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.430> hurt<00:02:32.549> yourself<00:02:32.730> by<00:02:33.090> pushing

don't want to hurt yourself by pushing
too<00:02:33.660> hard

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
too hard

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.420 
too hard
what's<00:02:34.260> most<00:02:34.470> important<00:02:35.070> is<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.190> you're

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
what's most important is that you're

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.900 
what's most important is that you're
flexing<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.030> muscle<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.870> getting<00:02:37.109> the<00:02:37.230> blood

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.340 

definitely<00:02:40.910> is<00:02:41.060> going<00:02:41.300> for<00:02:41.600> about<00:02:41.810> filling
