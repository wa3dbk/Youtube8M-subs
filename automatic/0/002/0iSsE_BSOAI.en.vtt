00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.689
 what the whole band wave of this channel in 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.249
 this new video I'm going to make a 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.600
 small size that I know a lot 

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:10.700
 you will like it and I hope so 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.250
 be 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.719
 Okay, so we are Java games that 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.939
 transformed a scholarship to be able 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.430
 install them on our device and 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.259
 play them freely ok 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.300
 ok in the description of this video you go 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.220
 to find the zip file that contains 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.640
 an emulator that is very necessary that is 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.800
 the numerator java j2ee runner that is very 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.160
 necessary to have it installed and the games 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.079
 to sin ok are 13 games I think it seems to me 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.379
 which are 3 eggs 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.730
 and good steps for installation is 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.010
 very simple first install the 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.320
 emulator and once you have it 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.710
 installed and games are all 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.560
 those who like this come several are 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.180
 I'm going to show it 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.370
 well once you have installed the 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.750
 emulator first the emulator and so 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.970
 will be the games and they will open this 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.620
 it says manager that the same emulator 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.270
 is going to do two applications that is 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:10.600
 this and there is this and it says 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.070
 explorer and app manager good you 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.460
 they will open in manager 2 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.990
 and here you will find all the games 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.060
 that I am going to leave a description 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.070
 obviously if they install them all do not go 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.410
 to find the ones that installed by 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.770
 example was let's open let's open 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:32.440
 this alpha 3 that in 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.510
 in java it was really fun 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.880
 ok and to remove the controls is very 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.280
 simple we will go to the key 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.740
 menu of our device and we're going to 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.690
 give in system in here we will find 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.830
 various options for the game by 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.870
 example we can give them a to the screen 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.420
 to make it wider for example 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.760
 we go there and you saw that the screen 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.390
 it grew we give it again 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.390
 so this menu 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.049
 and we give him where he says a lot of androids and 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.830
 so I live here is then for the screen 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.930
 adjust it up down 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.280
 we press and move it to 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.610
 our taste and for example I will leave 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.500
 there 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.330
 and now they wait a little bit because they 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.819
 will appear a message that says that 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.150
 exist 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.190
 that if you want to confirm the change what 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.110
 let's see that yes 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.230
 and to get the controls back 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.180
 let's go like this menu 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.290
 the controls are these that say that 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.970
 there ipad and I will skate buttons 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.250
 I recommend the ipad 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:41.320
 gates because they are more comfortable not for 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:44.930
 play this although it does cost very little 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.540
 It costs a bit to adapt but still not 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.410
 You have to achieve without sound but play 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.730
 brings sound gives more like a small one 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.080
 quick game because you see that the 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.380
 game works very well and does not have 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.060
 no fails many probably already 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.060
 have to know what is in java 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.340
 I wait for the little dot to load there because 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.590
 How am I recording the screen? 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.420
 this application makes the phone a little 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.160
 slow and therefore causes that also the 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.180
 games open very slowly 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.920
 well this is a race 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.170
 or they can see games work very well 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.260
 the controls are a bit difficult 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.740
 but it will only be a matter of 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.720
 adapt 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.490
 comes out then this is the 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.240
 but I play one of the games that I have 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.700
 left 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.360
 you can install the others can 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.250
 go opening the 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.220
 let's open a very fast right now 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.290
 we are going to open this which is the realization of 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.510
 city crime that is also a great 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.110
 It's a great game because it has a lot 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.370
 similar with gta we must accept and go 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.370
 to remove the controls once 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.560
 because they can not make the 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.860
 screen I'm not going to army very 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.860
 Quick 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.830
 and something very fast for those who like it 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.989
 the gta 3 of android I'm creating a 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.209
 new engine 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.680
 for the game I have already created one and already 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.050
 I've shared them in a video that I made 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.700
 I've been creating you for a while now 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.220
 another but I had a little niggle 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.120
 because as it already has a great advance 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.950
 of the bike was going around 26% of the way 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.560
 it turns out that 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.750
 that I had created him and I bought him 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.710
 Well to save memory 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:46.310
 it turns out that you can open the clan master 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.350
 and according to to optimize the memory of the 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.760
 device and what was the surprise then 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.250
 that deleted all the files and then 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.730
 I had included the mods that already 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.260
 I was about to put in and it could be you rumor 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.970
 but anyway I 'm doing it again 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.280
 getting you the files again 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.280
 and I hope to have it ready in a while 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.199
 as you can see the game is 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.199
 working very well 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.509
 although it is very funny 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.650
 I hope you like it I hope you have them 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:14.810
