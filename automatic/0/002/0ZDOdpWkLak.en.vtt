00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
them up here's this like my whole

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.610 
them up here's this like my whole
mixture<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.830> sugar<00:02:23.860> in<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.610> oriole<00:02:25.030> mixture

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
mixture of sugar in the oriole mixture

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.360 
mixture of sugar in the oriole mixture
next<00:02:26.620> I'm<00:02:26.740> going<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:26.920> take<00:02:27.130> my<00:02:27.310> milk<00:02:27.580> and

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
next I'm going to take my milk and

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.660 
next I'm going to take my milk and
slowly<00:02:30.370> pour<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.239> in<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:32.200> not<00:02:32.440> all<00:02:32.709> of<00:02:32.739> it<00:02:33.130> just

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
slowly pour it in so not all of it just

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.140 
slowly pour it in so not all of it just
a<00:02:33.820> little

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
a little

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.240 
a little
I<00:02:34.330> believe<00:02:34.630> this<00:02:34.810> like<00:02:35.050> half<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.470> teaspoon<00:02:36.040> or

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
I believe this like half a teaspoon or

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.050 
I believe this like half a teaspoon or
something<00:02:36.700> it's<00:02:37.360> one<00:02:37.570> teaspoon<00:02:38.080> so<00:02:39.060> next

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
something it's one teaspoon so next

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.860 
something it's one teaspoon so next
you're<00:02:40.270> going<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.480> blend<00:02:40.720> everything

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
you're going to blend everything

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.070 
you're going to blend everything
together<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:42.220> here<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.150> really<00:02:43.780> well

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
together so here it is really well

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.020 
together so here it is really well
combined<00:02:44.470> I<00:02:44.500> had<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.220> add<00:02:45.400> about<00:02:45.610> half<00:02:46.000> a

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
combined I had to add about half a

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.960 
combined I had to add about half a
teaspoon<00:02:46.300> more<00:02:46.900> of<00:02:47.730> like<00:02:48.730> milk<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:50.530> yeah<00:02:50.980> now

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
teaspoon more of like milk so yeah now

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.900 
teaspoon more of like milk so yeah now

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
and by the way if I didn't mention you

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.100 
and by the way if I didn't mention you
should<00:03:45.630> add<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.320> with<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.680> cream<00:03:47.810> okay<00:03:48.810> and

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
should add it with the cream okay and

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.770 
should add it with the cream okay and
the<00:03:49.560> sugar<00:03:49.800> adds<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.550> little<00:03:50.760> bit<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:51.150> sweetness

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
the sugar adds a little bit of sweetness

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.690 
the sugar adds a little bit of sweetness
it's<00:03:52.200> not<00:03:52.410> like<00:03:52.620> it's<00:03:52.800> going<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:52.980> become<00:03:53.160> huge

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
it's not like it's going to become huge

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.830 
it's not like it's going to become huge
a<00:03:54.090> huge<00:03:54.780> amount<00:03:55.050> of<00:03:55.140> sweetness<00:03:55.560> or<00:03:55.740> something

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
a huge amount of sweetness or something

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.020 
a huge amount of sweetness or something
so<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.350> as<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.830> saw<00:03:59.040> we<00:03:59.280> didn't<00:03:59.580> act<00:03:59.730> any

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
so and as you saw we didn't act any

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.720 
so and as you saw we didn't act any
flour<00:04:00.540> in<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:01.020> and<00:04:01.800> we<00:04:01.980> didn't<00:04:02.280> even<00:04:02.340> add<00:04:02.550> any

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
flour in it and we didn't even add any

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.000 
flour in it and we didn't even add any
butter<00:04:03.030> so<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:03.540> think<00:04:03.690> that's<00:04:04.140> a<00:04:04.260> great<00:04:04.470> way<00:04:04.710> of

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
butter so I think that's a great way of

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.800 
butter so I think that's a great way of
making<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.460> cake<00:04:06.380> except<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:08.070> biscuit<00:04:08.640> had<00:04:09.450> the

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
making a cake except the biscuit had the

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.550 
making a cake except the biscuit had the
flour<00:04:10.110> in<00:04:10.350> it<00:04:11.150> so<00:04:12.150> now<00:04:12.870> I'm<00:04:12.960> going<00:04:13.080> to<00:04:13.140> finish

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
flour in it so now I'm going to finish

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.710 
flour in it so now I'm going to finish
putting<00:04:13.800> everything<00:04:14.340> in<00:04:14.640> here<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.450> I'll<00:04:15.600> be
