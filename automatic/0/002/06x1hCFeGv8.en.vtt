worse<00:01:26.850> or<00:01:27.150> frozen<00:01:29.150> and<00:01:30.150> that's<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.630> sign<00:01:30.869> of

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
worse or frozen and that's the sign of

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.010 
worse or frozen and that's the sign of
just<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.560> really<00:01:32.130> good<00:01:32.310> pbt<00:01:32.939> player<00:01:33.240> Jamie

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
just this a really good pbt player Jamie

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.260 
just this a really good pbt player Jamie
just<00:01:34.350> had<00:01:34.470> an<00:01:34.560> excellent<00:01:34.950> balance<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:36.000> tech

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
just had an excellent balance of tech

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.990 
just had an excellent balance of tech
units<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.200> expansions<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.070> even<00:01:38.430> though<00:01:38.579> it

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
units and expansions and even though it

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.880 
units and expansions and even though it
seemed<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:39.659> Jamie<00:01:40.079> was<00:01:40.259> real<00:01:40.470> slow<00:01:40.740> on

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
seemed like Jamie was real slow on

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.830 
seemed like Jamie was real slow on
expansions<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.700> mean<00:01:41.850> he<00:01:42.000> played<00:01:42.210> really<00:01:42.540> safe

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
expansions I mean he played really safe

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.810 
expansions I mean he played really safe
really<00:01:43.439> conservative<00:01:44.130> he<00:01:44.250> was<00:01:44.369> able<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.640> get

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
really conservative he was able to get

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.149 
really conservative he was able to get
us<00:01:44.939> arbiter<00:01:45.329> attack<00:01:45.570> out<00:01:45.950> really<00:01:46.950> really

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
us arbiter attack out really really

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.010 
us arbiter attack out really really
quickly<00:01:47.759> while<00:01:48.090> still<00:01:48.329> keeping<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.750> pretty

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
quickly while still keeping a pretty

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.080 
quickly while still keeping a pretty
good<00:01:49.200> gateway<00:01:49.470> Colin<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.250> all<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.909> seemed

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
good gateway Colin and all it seemed

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.520 
good gateway Colin and all it seemed
like<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.450> fourth<00:01:51.720> was<00:01:51.930> late<00:01:52.110> at<00:01:52.229> least<00:01:52.380> in

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
like the fourth was late at least in

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.830 
like the fourth was late at least in
comparison<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:53.340> froze<00:01:53.670> Ian's<00:01:54.000> third<00:01:54.270> base<00:01:54.509> but

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
comparison to froze Ian's third base but

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.660 
comparison to froze Ian's third base but
Jamie<00:01:55.049> definitely<00:01:55.590> didn't<00:01:55.829> over<00:01:56.100> expand<00:01:56.520> as

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
Jamie definitely didn't over expand as

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.880 
Jamie definitely didn't over expand as
what<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.850> was<00:01:57.030> saying<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.450> he<00:01:57.540> was<00:01:57.659> really<00:01:57.960> this

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
what I was saying and he was really this

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.459 
what I was saying and he was really this
whole<00:01:59.130> whole<00:02:00.030> 20<00:02:00.420> minutes<00:02:00.719> Jamie<00:02:00.960> was<00:02:01.229> really

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
whole whole 20 minutes Jamie was really

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.620 
whole whole 20 minutes Jamie was really
never<00:02:01.710> vulnerable<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.670> any<00:02:02.820> sort<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.210> timing

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
never vulnerable to any sort of timing

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.389 
never vulnerable to any sort of timing
push<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.079> Jamie<00:02:04.350> did<00:02:04.380> excellent<00:02:04.950> scouting

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
push and Jamie did excellent scouting

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.459 
push and Jamie did excellent scouting
the<00:02:05.520> entire<00:02:05.820> way<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:06.899> played<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> really

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
the entire way and just played a really

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.350 
the entire way and just played a really
safe<00:02:07.829> game<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.459> I'm<00:02:08.520> not<00:02:08.670> really<00:02:08.819> sure<00:02:08.940> what

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
safe game and I'm not really sure what

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.380 
safe game and I'm not really sure what
frozen's<00:02:09.929> game<00:02:10.259> plan<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.590> here<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.009> mean<00:02:11.129> he

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
frozen's game plan is here I mean he

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.510 
frozen's game plan is here I mean he
took<00:02:12.050> his<00:02:12.170> natural<00:02:12.620> pretty<00:02:12.860> standard<00:02:13.340> then

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
took his natural pretty standard then

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.520 
took his natural pretty standard then
took<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.819> really<00:02:14.030> quick<00:02:14.150> third<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:14.990> from<00:02:15.319> there

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
took a really quick third and from there

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.900 
took a really quick third and from there
I<00:02:15.560> mean<00:02:15.709> he's<00:02:15.860> pretty<00:02:16.069> much<00:02:16.220> forced<00:02:16.580> to<00:02:16.760> defend

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
I mean he's pretty much forced to defend

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.910 
I mean he's pretty much forced to defend
defend<00:02:17.540> defend<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:18.050> entire<00:02:18.319> game<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.680> they

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
defend defend the entire game and they

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.800 
defend defend the entire game and they
really<00:02:19.160> never<00:02:19.310> got<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.819> plan<00:02:20.090> anything<00:02:20.270> I

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
really never got to plan anything I

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.870 
really never got to plan anything I
guess<00:02:21.470> he<00:02:21.650> was<00:02:21.740> just<00:02:21.770> at<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.160> point<00:02:22.280> we<00:02:22.550> wanted

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
guess he was just at the point we wanted

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.430 
guess he was just at the point we wanted
to<00:02:22.910> max<00:02:23.209> out<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.630> push<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:24.020> he<00:02:24.140> was<00:02:24.260> probably

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
to max out and push and he was probably

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.890 
to max out and push and he was probably
banking<00:02:25.130> on<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.370> fact<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.700> Jamie<00:02:26.180> was<00:02:26.690> going

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
banking on the fact that Jamie was going

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.570 
banking on the fact that Jamie was going
to<00:02:26.959> go<00:02:27.080> for<00:02:27.260> some<00:02:27.440> sort<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.709> mid<00:02:27.950> game<00:02:28.130> or<00:02:28.340> early

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
to go for some sort of mid game or early

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.010 
to go for some sort of mid game or early
game<00:02:28.760> attack<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:29.480> he<00:02:29.600> could<00:02:29.750> get<00:02:29.900> an

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
game attack so that he could get an

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.990 
game attack so that he could get an
advantage<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.800> then<00:02:30.980> max<00:02:31.220> out<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.610> push<00:02:31.820> and

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
advantage and then max out and push and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.330 
advantage and then max out and push and
do<00:02:32.120> some<00:02:32.330> damage<00:02:32.510> but<00:02:32.750> going<00:02:33.740> into<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.130> late

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
do some damage but going into the late

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.670 
do some damage but going into the late
game<00:02:34.610> versus<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.090> player<00:02:35.990> of<00:02:36.200> Jamie<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.590> think

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
game versus a player of Jamie I think

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.979 
game versus a player of Jamie I think
Jamie<00:02:37.160> even<00:02:37.850> though<00:02:37.940> i<00:02:37.970> would<00:02:38.239> say<00:02:38.360> stork<00:02:38.840> is

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
Jamie even though i would say stork is

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.780 
Jamie even though i would say stork is
probably<00:02:39.350> one<00:02:39.530> of<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.709> better<00:02:39.860> pbt<00:02:40.459> players

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
probably one of the better pbt players

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.479 
probably one of the better pbt players
statistically<00:02:41.720> Jamie's<00:02:42.200> pvt<00:02:42.709> is<00:02:42.890> one<00:02:43.280> of<00:02:43.370> the

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
statistically Jamie's pvt is one of the

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.699 
statistically Jamie's pvt is one of the
strongest<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:44.270> think<00:02:44.390> ever<00:02:44.870> I<00:02:45.020> think<00:02:45.350> Jamie<00:02:45.680> is

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
strongest I think ever I think Jamie is

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.890 
strongest I think ever I think Jamie is
the<00:02:45.890> highest<00:02:46.280> pvt<00:02:46.760> win<00:02:46.940> rate<00:02:47.120> of<00:02:47.239> any<00:02:47.390> Protoss

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
the highest pvt win rate of any Protoss

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.770 
the highest pvt win rate of any Protoss
right<00:02:48.200> oh<00:02:48.320> what<00:02:48.709> a<00:02:48.739> stand<00:02:49.280> Wow<00:02:49.880> good<00:02:50.269> stasis

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
right oh what a stand Wow good stasis

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.199 
right oh what a stand Wow good stasis
there<00:02:50.989> via<00:02:51.590> tanks<00:02:52.040> go<00:02:52.190> down<00:02:52.370> but<00:02:52.670> I<00:02:52.940> mean<00:02:53.090> this

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
there via tanks go down but I mean this

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.880 
there via tanks go down but I mean this
is<00:02:53.390> just<00:02:53.420> a<00:02:53.720> nightmare<00:02:53.900> for<00:02:54.110> frozen<00:02:54.470> there's

is just a nightmare for frozen there's
no<00:02:55.130> way<00:02:55.310> he<00:02:55.459> can<00:02:55.610> defend<00:02:55.850> that<00:02:56.030> base<00:02:56.269> now<00:02:56.570> that

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
no way he can defend that base now that

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.810 
no way he can defend that base now that
Jamie<00:02:57.050> was<00:02:57.290> able<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.680> take<00:02:57.860> out<00:02:58.010> so<00:02:58.280> many<00:02:58.430> units

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
a lot of exciting close games even from

a lot of exciting close games even from
pointers<00:03:19.880> that<00:03:19.910> we<00:03:20.120> really<00:03:20.390> didn't<00:03:20.690> think<00:03:20.720> and

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170

even<00:03:21.799> though<00:03:21.920> this<00:03:22.070> game<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:22.340> think<00:03:22.489> that's

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
even though this game I think that's

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.400 
even though this game I think that's
pretty<00:03:22.940> one-sided<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.720> first<00:03:23.930> game<00:03:24.140> froze

jangbi<00:04:43.700> been<00:04:43.909> playing<00:04:44.210> lately<00:04:44.450> I<00:04:44.720> mean<00:04:45.020> I<00:04:45.200> I

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
jangbi been playing lately I mean I I

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.320 
jangbi been playing lately I mean I I
haven't<00:04:45.890> seen<00:04:46.070> him<00:04:46.190> lose<00:04:46.400> to<00:04:46.640> a<00:04:46.669> Terran<00:04:47.090> in<00:04:47.210> a

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
haven't seen him lose to a Terran in a

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.350 
haven't seen him lose to a Terran in a
long<00:04:47.720> time<00:04:47.960> I<00:04:48.430> really<00:04:49.430> don't<00:04:49.610> think<00:04:49.789> that<00:04:50.000> any

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
long time I really don't think that any

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.450 
long time I really don't think that any
Terran<00:04:50.810> is<00:04:51.080> much<00:04:51.530> of<00:04:51.710> a<00:04:51.800> threat<00:04:51.950> I<00:04:52.250> don't<00:04:52.400> think

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
Terran is much of a threat I don't think

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.640 
Terran is much of a threat I don't think
any<00:04:52.700> Terran<00:04:53.120> in<00:04:53.240> this<00:04:53.360> MSL<00:04:53.780> right<00:04:53.990> now<00:04:54.110> is<00:04:54.320> a

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
any Terran in this MSL right now is a

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.649 
any Terran in this MSL right now is a
threat<00:04:55.070> to<00:04:55.099> take<00:04:55.430> out<00:04:55.640> Jang<00:04:55.909> be<00:04:56.150> I<00:04:56.330> think<00:04:56.570> the

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
threat to take out Jang be I think the

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:59.080 
threat to take out Jang be I think the
only<00:04:56.840> Terran<00:04:57.200> not<00:04:57.710> up<00:04:57.919> because<00:04:58.460> this<00:04:58.700> is<00:04:58.880> not

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090

think<00:05:39.140> in<00:05:39.349> the<00:05:39.470> finals<00:05:39.919> if<00:05:40.130> jangi<00:05:40.490> makes<00:05:40.700> it<00:05:40.880> to

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
think in the finals if jangi makes it to

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.430 
think in the finals if jangi makes it to
the<00:05:41.030> finals<00:05:41.450> I<00:05:41.599> think<00:05:41.780> we're<00:05:41.990> going<00:05:42.110> to<00:05:42.200> see<00:05:42.229> an

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
the finals I think we're going to see an

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.100 
the finals I think we're going to see an
excellent<00:05:43.010> excellent<00:05:43.430> game<00:05:43.789> there's<00:05:44.599> lots<00:05:44.900> of

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
players on the other side of the bracket

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.200 
players on the other side of the bracket
you<00:05:47.120> know<00:05:47.240> Lita<00:05:47.570> vs.<00:05:48.580> Jangi<00:05:49.580> or<00:05:49.820> if<00:05:49.909> we<00:05:50.030> see

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
you know Lita vs. Jangi or if we see

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.750 
you know Lita vs. Jangi or if we see
Savior<00:05:50.810> in<00:05:50.990> the<00:05:51.110> finals<00:05:51.500> vs<00:05:51.860> janky<00:05:52.310> but<00:05:52.340> i

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
Savior in the finals vs janky but i

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.290 
Savior in the finals vs janky but i
think<00:05:53.659> jamie<00:05:54.289> i<00:05:54.500> think<00:05:55.010> is<00:05:55.159> playing<00:05:55.430> stork<00:05:56.000> I

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
think jamie i think is playing stork I

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.420 
think jamie i think is playing stork I
think<00:05:56.630> stork<00:05:57.200> is<00:05:57.380> really<00:05:57.620> the<00:05:57.740> only<00:05:57.890> person

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
think stork is really the only person

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.830 
think stork is really the only person
that<00:05:58.550> would<00:05:58.610> give<00:05:58.760> Jang<00:05:59.000> be<00:05:59.150> a<00:05:59.180> hard<00:05:59.390> time<00:05:59.599> but

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
that would give Jang be a hard time but

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.170 
that would give Jang be a hard time but
if<00:05:59.960> Jamie<00:06:00.169> manages<00:06:00.440> to<00:06:00.860> beat<00:06:01.039> stork<00:06:01.430> I<00:06:01.669> think

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
if Jamie manages to beat stork I think

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.270 
if Jamie manages to beat stork I think
Jane<00:06:02.390> be<00:06:02.539> is<00:06:02.599> a<00:06:02.720> contender<00:06:03.229> for<00:06:03.260> the<00:06:03.650> finals

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
Jane be is a contender for the finals

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.430 
Jane be is a contender for the finals
just<00:06:05.180> this<00:06:05.240> play<00:06:05.450> has<00:06:05.479> been<00:06:05.750> so<00:06:05.930> good<00:06:06.140> when<00:06:06.289> all

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
just this play has been so good when all

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.190 
just this play has been so good when all
around<00:06:06.710> like<00:06:06.950> his<00:06:07.580> pvz<00:06:08.210> is<00:06:08.330> really<00:06:08.690> good<00:06:08.930> too<00:06:09.169> i

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200 
around like his pvz is really good too i

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.770 
around like his pvz is really good too i
mean<00:06:09.500> it's<00:06:09.650> pvp<00:06:10.130> even<00:06:10.400> though<00:06:10.490> it<00:06:10.610> isn't<00:06:10.780> it

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
mean it's pvp even though it isn't it

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.210 
mean it's pvp even though it isn't it
definitely<00:06:12.200> isn't<00:06:12.320> bad<00:06:12.590> but<00:06:12.620> it<00:06:12.950> isn't<00:06:13.190> really

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
definitely isn't bad but it isn't really

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.830 
definitely isn't bad but it isn't really
the<00:06:13.490> s-class<00:06:13.909> level<00:06:14.419> that<00:06:14.539> has<00:06:14.659> other

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
the s-class level that has other

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.700

different<00:06:40.800> his<00:06:41.580> PvP<00:06:42.030> might<00:06:42.300> not<00:06:42.480> be<00:06:42.780> quite<00:06:43.620> as

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
different his PvP might not be quite as

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.710 
different his PvP might not be quite as
close<00:06:44.220> to<00:06:44.580> the<00:06:44.700> other<00:06:44.850> guys<00:06:45.090> as<00:06:45.450> his<00:06:45.600> other

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 
close to the other guys as his other

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.920 
close to the other guys as his other

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
matchups but like I still pick him as a

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.410 
matchups but like I still pick him as a
favorite<00:06:49.440> over<00:06:49.680> anyone<00:06:50.190> other<00:06:50.580> than<00:06:50.820> JC<00:06:51.120> on

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.420

in<00:06:54.270> this<00:06:54.420> msl<00:06:54.930> is<00:06:55.110> store<00:06:55.410> so<00:06:55.860> I<00:06:55.890> guess<00:06:56.190> when<00:06:56.400> I

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 
in this msl is store so I guess when I

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.420 
in this msl is store so I guess when I
said<00:06:56.760> PvP<00:06:57.240> I<00:06:57.270> was<00:06:57.510> kind<00:06:57.720> of<00:06:57.750> relating<00:06:58.140> to

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
said PvP I was kind of relating to

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.530 
said PvP I was kind of relating to
specifically<00:06:59.430> the<00:06:59.670> Jangi<00:07:00.030> verse<00:07:00.210> stork

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:00.540 
specifically the Jangi verse stork

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.720 
specifically the Jangi verse stork
matcha<00:07:00.780> but<00:07:01.140> I<00:07:01.170> agree<00:07:01.590> he's<00:07:02.370> one<00:07:02.550> of<00:07:02.640> those

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:02.730 
matcha but I agree he's one of those

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.340 
matcha but I agree he's one of those
guys<00:07:02.790> and<00:07:03.240> I<00:07:03.270> think<00:07:03.420> I<00:07:03.480> almost<00:07:03.750> compare<00:07:04.230> them

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
guys and I think I almost compare them

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.010 
guys and I think I almost compare them
to<00:07:04.380> store<00:07:04.740> we're<00:07:05.040> like<00:07:05.790> starts<00:07:06.240> pvz<00:07:06.780> it's

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 
to store we're like starts pvz it's

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.660 
to store we're like starts pvz it's
pretty<00:07:07.320> good<00:07:07.590> like<00:07:07.920> so<00:07:08.130> physically<00:07:08.580> it

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:08.670 
pretty good like so physically it

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.250 
pretty good like so physically it
doesn't<00:07:08.700> look<00:07:09.060> as<00:07:09.240> good<00:07:09.420> but<00:07:09.630> I<00:07:09.690> mean<00:07:09.870> stork<00:07:10.170> is

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.260 
doesn't look as good but I mean stork is

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.680 
doesn't look as good but I mean stork is
a<00:07:10.320> guy<00:07:10.530> who<00:07:10.590> constantly<00:07:11.280> finishes<00:07:11.760> so<00:07:12.090> far<00:07:12.450> in

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:12.690 
a guy who constantly finishes so far in

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.380 
a guy who constantly finishes so far in
star<00:07:12.960> leaks<00:07:13.230> into<00:07:13.470> play<00:07:13.770> the<00:07:14.400> best<00:07:14.640> Protoss<00:07:15.180> is

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:15.390 
star leaks into play the best Protoss is

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.540 
star leaks into play the best Protoss is
the<00:07:15.510> best<00:07:15.750> desserts<00:07:16.050> in<00:07:16.290> the<00:07:16.380> world<00:07:16.650> and<00:07:17.010> still

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
the best desserts in the world and still

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.280 
the best desserts in the world and still
keep<00:07:17.790> it<00:07:17.970> above<00:07:18.210> fifty<00:07:18.570> percent<00:07:18.870> win<00:07:19.110> rate

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.290 
keep it above fifty percent win rate

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.620 
keep it above fifty percent win rate
shows<00:07:19.590> that<00:07:19.800> it's<00:07:19.980> still<00:07:20.190> an<00:07:20.670> excellent<00:07:21.180> PvP

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:21.630 
shows that it's still an excellent PvP

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.660 
shows that it's still an excellent PvP
so<00:07:21.840> yeah<00:07:22.020> I<00:07:22.050> mean<00:07:22.140> that<00:07:22.410> wasn't<00:07:22.670> specifically

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:23.670 
so yeah I mean that wasn't specifically

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.100 
so yeah I mean that wasn't specifically
i<00:07:23.790> guess<00:07:24.060> what<00:07:24.240> i<00:07:24.300> was<00:07:24.420> saying<00:07:24.630> and<00:07:24.780> I<00:07:24.840> didn't

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.110 
i guess what i was saying and I didn't

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.300 
i guess what i was saying and I didn't
go<00:07:25.200> out<00:07:25.230> and<00:07:25.530> say<00:07:25.680> it<00:07:25.710> but<00:07:25.950> i<00:07:25.980> would<00:07:26.190> think

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.310 
go out and say it but i would think

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.950 
go out and say it but i would think
store<00:07:26.640> could<00:07:26.850> be<00:07:26.970> the<00:07:27.060> favorite<00:07:27.450> seeing<00:07:27.870> a

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.960 
store could be the favorite seeing a

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.350 
store could be the favorite seeing a
storage<00:07:28.440> angry<00:07:28.860> but<00:07:29.640> you<00:07:29.790> know<00:07:29.880> none<00:07:30.090> of<00:07:30.120> our

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 
storage angry but you know none of our

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.170 
storage angry but you know none of our
group<00:07:30.810> Jamie<00:07:31.200> moves<00:07:31.470> on<00:07:31.770> and<00:07:32.100> so<00:07:32.730> we<00:07:32.880> have<00:07:33.000> two

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 
group Jamie moves on and so we have two

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.540 
group Jamie moves on and so we have two
more<00:07:33.210> games<00:07:33.450> than<00:07:33.900> we<00:07:34.770> have<00:07:34.920> we've<00:07:35.190> seen<00:07:35.340> all

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:35.550 
more games than we have we've seen all

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.430 
more games than we have we've seen all
TVP<00:07:36.060> so<00:07:36.300> far<00:07:36.510> tonight<00:07:36.720> and<00:07:36.990> we<00:07:37.050> actually<00:07:37.350> have

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 
TVP so far tonight and we actually have

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.820 
TVP so far tonight and we actually have
three<00:07:37.680> zor's<00:07:38.070> and<00:07:38.460> a<00:07:39.000> pro<00:07:39.210> tops<00:07:39.480> we<00:07:40.140> have<00:07:40.170> a

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:40.830 
three zor's and a pro tops we have a

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.290 
three zor's and a pro tops we have a
yard<00:07:41.520> vs<00:07:42.090> 0<00:07:42.360> and<00:07:42.750> we<00:07:42.960> have<00:07:43.200> stork<00:07:43.770> vs<00:07:44.220> quadra<00:07:44.700> so

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:45.300 
yard vs 0 and we have stork vs quadra so

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.820 
yard vs 0 and we have stork vs quadra so
I<00:07:45.330> mean<00:07:45.690> unless<00:07:45.900> you<00:07:46.080> have<00:07:46.200> anything<00:07:46.410> else<00:07:46.680> to

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:46.830 
I mean unless you have anything else to

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:47.870 
I mean unless you have anything else to
say<00:07:46.860> I<00:07:47.010> thought<00:07:47.220> that<00:07:47.370> game<00:07:47.580> was<00:07:47.730> pretty

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:47.880 
say I thought that game was pretty

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.310 
say I thought that game was pretty
straightforward<00:07:48.750> i<00:07:48.840> think<00:07:49.050> the<00:07:49.170> better

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:49.320 
straightforward i think the better

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.020 
straightforward i think the better
player<00:07:49.620> moved<00:07:49.890> on<00:07:50.070> and<00:07:50.250> I<00:07:50.340> think<00:07:50.550> we<00:07:50.700> can<00:07:50.850> move

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:51.030 
player moved on and I think we can move
