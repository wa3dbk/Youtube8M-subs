00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.660 
a couple of these recipes just so you
can<00:00:51.750> see<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.379> they're<00:00:52.559> not<00:00:52.710> at<00:00:52.920> all<00:00:53.070> uniform

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260

free plugin and when you install it it

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.569 
free plugin and when you install it it
shows<00:01:48.990> up<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> little<00:01:49.500> icon<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> upper
