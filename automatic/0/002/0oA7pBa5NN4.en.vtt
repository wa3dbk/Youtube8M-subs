00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
you two things number one I have seen

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.870 
you two things number one I have seen
many<00:03:51.840> National<00:03:52.840> Guard<00:03:53.050> vehicles<00:03:53.590> go<00:03:54.250> south<00:03:54.610> on

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
highway 49 which is exactly the highway

I'm<00:03:56.920> standing<00:03:57.220> in<00:03:57.340> front<00:03:57.430> of<00:03:57.580> so<00:03:57.940> they're

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
I'm standing in front of so they're

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.809 
I'm standing in front of so they're
heading<00:03:58.450> down<00:03:58.630> toward<00:03:58.990> the<00:03:59.140> beaches<00:03:59.350> I<00:04:00.220> don't

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.490 
heading down toward the beaches I don't
know<00:04:00.910> why<00:04:01.150> but<00:04:01.569> certainly<00:04:01.900> one<00:04:02.170> would<00:04:02.290> guess

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
know why but certainly one would guess

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
know why but certainly one would guess
that<00:04:02.530> there's<00:04:02.890> a<00:04:02.950> tremendous<00:04:03.280> amount<00:04:03.340> of

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
some of the recent pictures that we've

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.659 
some of the recent pictures that we've
just<00:04:19.720> gotten<00:04:20.079> off<00:04:20.260> of<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:21.040> coast<00:04:21.340> this<00:04:21.609> is

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
just gotten off of the coast this is

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.210 
just gotten off of the coast this is
down<00:04:22.030> in<00:04:22.720> near<00:04:23.169> a<00:04:23.380> Gulfport<00:04:23.950> and<00:04:24.130> Biloxi

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
down in near a Gulfport and Biloxi

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.460 
down in near a Gulfport and Biloxi
Mississippi<00:04:24.820> and<00:04:25.660> what<00:04:25.870> as<00:04:25.960> I<00:04:26.050> guess<00:04:26.200> most

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
Mississippi and what as I guess most

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.590 
Mississippi and what as I guess most
clear<00:04:26.710> here<00:04:27.040> is<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.370> tremendous<00:04:27.760> wave<00:04:28.150> action

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
clear here is the tremendous wave action

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.510 
clear here is the tremendous wave action
the<00:04:28.720> water<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.470> rise<00:04:29.740> in<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.100> water<00:04:30.220> as<00:04:30.490> a

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
the water the rise in the water as a

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.610 
the water the rise in the water as a
result<00:04:30.730> of<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.150> surge<00:04:31.360> remember<00:04:31.870> this<00:04:32.410> is

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
result of the surge remember this is

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.040 
result of the surge remember this is
east<00:04:32.950> of<00:04:33.220> where<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.669> center<00:04:33.850> has<00:04:34.660> come<00:04:34.930> ashore

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
east of where the center has come ashore

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.350 
east of where the center has come ashore
so<00:04:35.890> you<00:04:35.950> are<00:04:36.280> gonna<00:04:36.430> get<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.760> rise<00:04:36.940> in<00:04:37.180> water

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
so you are gonna get the rise in water

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.830 
so you are gonna get the rise in water
perhaps<00:04:37.660> as<00:04:37.960> high<00:04:38.110> as<00:04:38.320> 10<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:39.160> 12<00:04:39.460> feet<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:39.970> my

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
perhaps as high as 10 to 12 feet and my

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.600

on his way down there so we being west
of<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:49.690> center<00:04:49.990> now<00:04:50.140> he<00:04:50.800> went<00:04:50.950> down<00:04:51.220> to

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
of the center now he went down to

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.610 
of the center now he went down to
Gulfport<00:04:51.729> got<00:04:52.150> some<00:04:52.300> calm<00:04:52.600> winds<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.410> then
