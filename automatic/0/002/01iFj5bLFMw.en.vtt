00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.110 

and<00:01:07.900> I<00:01:08.230> think<00:01:08.470> that<00:01:08.620> I<00:01:08.830> don't<00:01:09.520> want<00:01:09.700> me<00:01:09.760> to<00:01:09.940> but

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
and I think that I don't want me to but

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.940 
and I think that I don't want me to but
I<00:01:10.150> think<00:01:10.450> that<00:01:11.250> cleared<00:01:12.250> out<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.700> band<00:01:13.000> enough

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
I think that cleared out the band enough

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.610 
I think that cleared out the band enough
so<00:01:14.950> we<00:01:15.070> were<00:01:15.220> shelling<00:01:15.490> again<00:01:15.700> now
