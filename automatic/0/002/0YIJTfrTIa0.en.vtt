has<00:00:20.760> been<00:00:21.029> actually<00:00:21.270> seen<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:21.840> like<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.560> iOS

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
has been actually seen on like the iOS

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.150 
has been actually seen on like the iOS
platform<00:00:23.189> before<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.590> it's<00:00:25.590> basically<00:00:26.039> a

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
platform before and it's basically a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.609 
platform before and it's basically a
really<00:00:26.580> good<00:00:26.789> replica<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.660> game<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.529> you

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
really good replica of the game so you

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
decrease as you get into some of these

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.979 
decrease as you get into some of these

of them give you things like this which

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.010 
of them give you things like this which
should<00:00:44.280> SAT<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> magnetic<00:00:45.300> field<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.809> will

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
should SAT a magnetic field and will

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.720 
should SAT a magnetic field and will
destroy<00:00:46.469> any<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> blocks<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.910> color

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
destroy any of the blocks of that color

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.250 
destroy any of the blocks of that color

variation of types of blocks like these

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.670 
variation of types of blocks like these
that<00:01:33.600> extend<00:01:34.200> all<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.500> way<00:01:34.710> across<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:40.500> game

is lots of fun and really great to play

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.870 
is lots of fun and really great to play
however<00:01:55.049> there<00:01:56.009> aren't<00:01:56.430> any<00:01:56.640> online

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
however there aren't any online

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.940 
however there aren't any online
leaderboards<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.960> you're<00:01:58.110> stuck<00:01:58.409> with<00:01:58.649> these

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
leaderboards so you're stuck with these

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.940 
leaderboards so you're stuck with these
local<00:01:59.520> leader<00:01:59.729> boards<00:02:00.119> here<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:01.259> otherwise

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
local leader boards here but otherwise

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.520 
local leader boards here but otherwise
is<00:02:02.219> pretty<00:02:02.430> good<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.659> lasting<00:02:04.079> value<00:02:04.229> is

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
is pretty good so the lasting value is

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.609 
is pretty good so the lasting value is
slightly<00:02:04.829> hurt<00:02:05.189> by<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:06.329> just<00:02:07.110> because

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
slightly hurt by that but just because

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.770 
slightly hurt by that but just because
of<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.039> way<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.700> levels<00:02:09.090> actually<00:02:09.390> take

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
of the way that the levels actually take

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.290 
of the way that the levels actually take
a<00:02:09.810> really<00:02:10.289> long<00:02:10.319> time<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.520> play<00:02:11.760> through<00:02:12.030> them

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
a really long time to play through them

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.980 
a really long time to play through them
and

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.750 
and

that<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.940> were<00:02:45.030> just<00:02:45.240> playing<00:02:45.540> which<00:02:45.750> is

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
that you were just playing which is

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.570 
that you were just playing which is
slightly<00:02:46.260> disappointing<00:02:47.130> especially

slightly disappointing especially

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.610 
slightly disappointing especially
because<00:02:48.300> some<00:02:48.570> of<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.720> levels<00:02:48.930> can<00:02:49.290> take<00:02:49.590> a

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
because some of the levels can take a

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.120 
because some of the levels can take a
really<00:02:50.160> long<00:02:50.190> time<00:02:50.960> so<00:02:51.960> overall<00:02:52.500> warp<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:53.100> a

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
really long time so overall warp is a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.470 
really long time so overall warp is a
game<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.670> definitely<00:02:54.060> should<00:02:54.210> check
