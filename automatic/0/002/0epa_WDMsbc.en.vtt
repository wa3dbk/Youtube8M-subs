00:00:00.154 --> 00:00:01.975
 I welcome all fans of photography. 

00:00:02.086 --> 00:00:04.271
 My name is Honza and I work here in Zoner. 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.707
 Today we will introduce one of the ZPS 17 news, which is an exposure transition filter. 

00:00:09.953 --> 00:00:14.847
 (signature tune) 

00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:18.671
 The classic transition filter is screwed onto the front of the lens 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.931
 and helps us darken part of the image, such as the sky. 

00:00:22.182 --> 00:00:26.982
 If you don't have these accessories with you or don't want to take them, 

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:29.868
 then you will be pleased with this new product. 

00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:35.888
 Exposure transition filter is an editor tool, so we opened the image in it. 

00:00:36.182 --> 00:00:41.657
 We chose this photo because it has a light background that we will want to further darken 

00:00:42.096 --> 00:00:47.385
 but it also has a dark foreground that we want to keep the same. 

00:00:47.657 --> 00:00:50.935
 This is an ideal condition for using this tool. 

00:00:51.316 --> 00:00:56.096
 I find the exposure transition filter in the toolbar on the right side of the screen. 

00:00:56.301 --> 00:01:02.935
 It has type (exposure), transition width, and power parameters. 

00:01:03.142 --> 00:01:08.427
 To apply a gradient, I drag the image frame to the mouse 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.282
 and I see the top of my screen darken. 

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:19.004
 To increase the effect, I will reduce its strength. 

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:25.536
 On the contrary, I will extend its range (linearity) to mitigate it. 

00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:30.728
 Alternatively, I change the placement location. 

00:01:31.097 --> 00:01:34.629
 As soon as I am satisfied, I press Apply. 

00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:40.999
 Now we will show the same effect on another example. 

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:46.915
 This image has a well-exposed top of the photo 

00:01:47.186 --> 00:01:53.572
 but it has a dark foreground that we will want to pull out to get more details from it. 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.569
 Check that we have selected the exposure filter and stretch the horizon again. 

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:04.471
 You can see that the tool is trying to lighten the top of the image. 

00:02:04.677 --> 00:02:08.347
 We want the effect opposite so we use the Flip button 

00:02:08.423 --> 00:02:13.348
 and increase strength to get more detail. 

00:02:13.793 --> 00:02:22.742
 Once again, we can move the tool to reduce its effect by stretching it. Finally, we save the effect. 

00:02:23.703 --> 00:02:28.362
 In the end we will show another usage of the filter and the color. 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:33.343
 Let's check that we have selected a color filter type 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.324
 and we stretch the horizon. 

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:46.138
 We see that we used a little aggressive red color, 

00:02:46.406 --> 00:02:52.879
 That is why we change it to orange, which will symbolize the sunset. 

00:02:53.998 --> 00:02:57.092
 The key to applying this effect is to choose the correct mode. 

00:02:57.432 --> 00:03:03.736
 We see a number of them here, but I suggest you start with the veil mode. 

00:03:04.118 --> 00:03:08.950
 He creates a very nice light that can be worked on. 

00:03:09.658 --> 00:03:17.862
 In this case, we will change the location of the tool, expand it and click Apply. 

00:03:19.118 --> 00:03:22.119
 So, that was one of the news Zoner Photo Studio 17, 

00:03:22.373 --> 00:03:26.626
 Thank you for taking the time to look forward to seeing you on other videos. 

00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:29.029
 Have a nice day and good light!
