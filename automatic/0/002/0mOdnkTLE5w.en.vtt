00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.830 
then press them together and then you're
gonna<00:00:41.460> do<00:00:41.610> exactly<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.210> same<00:00:42.420> thing<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
gonna do exactly the same thing on the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.790 
gonna do exactly the same thing on the
other<00:00:42.899> side<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:48.960> two<00:00:49.170> triangles

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
other side so now you have two triangles

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.709 
other side so now you have two triangles
and<00:00:50.100> we're<00:00:50.760> gonna<00:00:50.879> put<00:00:51.090> them<00:00:51.210> together<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
and we're gonna put them together to

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.279 
and we're gonna put them together to
actually<00:00:51.870> make<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.440> star<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:54.140> what<00:00:55.140> you're

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
actually make this star and what you're

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.389 
actually make this star and what you're
going<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.500> do<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.770> you're<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:55.949> gonna<00:00:56.190> glue

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
going to do is you're just gonna glue

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.139 
going to do is you're just gonna glue
them<00:00:56.579> together<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.039> like<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.309> start<00:00:59.579> with

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
them together so I like to start with

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.060 
them together so I like to start with
one<00:01:00.420> side<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.109> make<00:01:01.289> sure<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.590> looks<00:01:01.770> pretty

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
one side and make sure it looks pretty

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.429 
one side and make sure it looks pretty
even<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.670> then<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.019> kind<00:01:04.290> of

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
even and then you can just kind of

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.160 
even and then you can just kind of
carefully<00:01:05.100> lift<00:01:05.369> up<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.150> other<00:01:06.180> pieces<00:01:06.659> while

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
carefully lift up the other pieces while

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.200 
carefully lift up the other pieces while
the<00:01:07.290> glue<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.500> drying<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.369> place<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> little

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the glue is drying and place a little

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.780 
the glue is drying and place a little
bit<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.510> glue<00:01:09.770> underneath<00:01:10.770> one<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.280> each<00:01:11.460> side

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
bit of glue underneath one on each side

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.880 
bit of glue underneath one on each side
so<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:13.110> get<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.729> perfectly<00:01:14.729> symmetrical

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
so that you get a perfectly symmetrical

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.600 
so that you get a perfectly symmetrical
star<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.400> like<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:19.159> the<00:01:20.159> next<00:01:20.369> thing<00:01:20.490> I'm

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610

underneath<00:01:57.600> your<00:01:58.050> star<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.130> we're<00:01:59.940> gonna<00:02:00.030> do

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
underneath your star and we're gonna do

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.070 
underneath your star and we're gonna do
some<00:02:00.420> painting<00:02:01.970> all<00:02:02.970> right<00:02:03.119> it's<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.300> nice<00:02:03.540> blue

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
some painting all right it's a nice blue

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:19.400 
some painting all right it's a nice blue
paint<00:02:17.180> because<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.330> popsicle<00:02:18.840> sticks<00:02:19.110> suck

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
paint because the popsicle sticks suck

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.500 
paint because the popsicle sticks suck
up<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:19.800> much<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.220> paint<00:02:20.520> I<00:02:20.790> think<00:02:21.239> it<00:02:21.360> looks

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
up so much of the paint I think it looks

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.300 
up so much of the paint I think it looks
really<00:02:21.750> pretty<00:02:21.900> we<00:02:22.110> probably<00:02:22.350> need<00:02:22.830> two<00:02:23.040> coats

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
really pretty we probably need two coats

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.920 
really pretty we probably need two coats

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.840 
of paint so let's go over it again to
make<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.260> nice<00:02:25.850> rich<00:02:27.020> blue<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:32.160> then<00:02:32.400> from

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
make it a nice rich blue and then from

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.760 
make it a nice rich blue and then from
there<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.510> can<00:02:33.540> decorate<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.170> any<00:02:34.440> way<00:02:34.620> you

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
there you can decorate it any way you

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.620
