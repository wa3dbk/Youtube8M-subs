00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.190
 rose essential 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.030
 so why the rose simply 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:52.509

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.509
 age you can also put general 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.390

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.930
 grams of hyaluronic acid so I 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.610
 the offers already prepared here so that's 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.740

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.080
 a choice of almost like that it is possible 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.990

 mineral where he relates a rose 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.660
 so we'll do it while stirring 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.870
 so we will really emulsify 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.910
 for at least two minutes she 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.480
