00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
now one of the other key advantages of

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.069 
now one of the other key advantages of
flash<00:01:38.130> memory<00:01:38.159> based<00:01:38.729> devices<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.210> SSD<00:01:39.720> over

flash memory based devices like SSD over

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.569 
flash memory based devices like SSD over
the<00:01:40.170> old<00:01:40.320> mechanical<00:01:40.530> ones<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.040> these<00:01:41.430> ones

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
the old mechanical ones is these ones

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.340 
the old mechanical ones is these ones
can<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.820> actually<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.180> lot<00:01:42.570> smaller<00:01:42.990> than<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
can be actually a lot smaller than the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.050 
can be actually a lot smaller than the
mechanical<00:01:43.560> counterparts<00:01:44.340> that's<00:01:44.759> because

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
mechanical counterparts that's because

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.910 
mechanical counterparts that's because
these<00:01:45.180> ones<00:01:45.390> have<00:01:45.630> spinning<00:01:46.140> devices<00:01:46.560> inside

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
these ones have spinning devices inside

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.889 
these ones have spinning devices inside
and<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.399> read/write<00:01:47.880> head<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> little<00:01:48.659> motor

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
and a read/write head and a little motor

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.630 
and a read/write head and a little motor
that<00:01:49.200> kicks<00:01:49.409> things<00:01:49.619> around<00:01:49.860> whereas<00:01:50.460> these

that kicks things around whereas these

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.330 
that kicks things around whereas these
are<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.090> electronics<00:01:51.869> now<00:01:52.500> typically

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
are just electronics now typically

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.160 
are just electronics now typically
you'll<00:01:53.670> see<00:01:53.729> devices<00:01:54.360> like<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.720> at<00:01:54.930> about

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
you'll see devices like this at about

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.690 
you'll see devices like this at about
the<00:01:55.320> same<00:01:55.500> size<00:01:55.740> when<00:01:55.979> you're<00:01:56.100> using<00:01:56.399> them<00:01:56.579> as

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the same size when you're using them as

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.249 
the same size when you're using them as
a<00:01:56.729> replacement<00:01:57.000> because<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.840> need<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.110> fit

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
a replacement because you need to fit

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.660 
a replacement because you need to fit
into<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.680> same<00:01:58.829> spot<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.399> notebook

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
into the same spot in the notebook

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.920 
into the same spot in the notebook
computer<00:02:00.000> where<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.270> one<00:02:00.390> came<00:02:00.600> out<00:02:00.750> of

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
computer where this one came out of

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.929 
computer where this one came out of
without<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.380> rattling<00:02:01.740> around<00:02:01.890> but<00:02:02.729> these

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
without it rattling around but these

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.700 
without it rattling around but these
devices<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.420> actually<00:02:03.750> be<00:02:03.869> much<00:02:04.229> much

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
devices can actually be much much

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.709 
devices can actually be much much
smaller<00:02:04.770> than<00:02:05.280> these<00:02:05.549> ones<00:02:05.820> which<00:02:06.240> means<00:02:06.479> that

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
smaller than these ones which means that

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.540 
smaller than these ones which means that
a<00:02:06.750> new<00:02:06.990> generation<00:02:07.140> devices<00:02:08.039> when<00:02:08.429> they're

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
a new generation devices when they're

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.100 
a new generation devices when they're
designed<00:02:08.879> around<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.330> solid-state<00:02:09.599> drives

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
designed around the solid-state drives

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.110 
designed around the solid-state drives
not<00:02:10.619> inside<00:02:10.979> cases<00:02:11.400> designed<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.970> replace

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
not inside cases designed to replace

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.160 
not inside cases designed to replace
these<00:02:12.450> can

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
these can

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.860 
these can
actually<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.560> lot<00:02:13.920> smaller<00:02:14.510> another<00:02:15.510> benefit

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
actually a lot smaller another benefit

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.089 
actually a lot smaller another benefit
of<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.050> fact<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.319> there's<00:02:16.590> no<00:02:16.800> moving<00:02:17.010> parts

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
of the fact that there's no moving parts

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.800 
of the fact that there's no moving parts
like<00:02:17.459> in<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.700> old<00:02:17.819> mechanical<00:02:18.030> drives<00:02:18.540> is

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
like in the old mechanical drives is

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.839 
like in the old mechanical drives is
these<00:02:19.230> ones<00:02:19.410> actually<00:02:19.560> can<00:02:19.800> run<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.160> lot<00:02:20.400> cooler

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
these ones actually can run a lot cooler

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.729 
these ones actually can run a lot cooler
because<00:02:21.480> there<00:02:21.720> isn't<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.020> power<00:02:22.380> required

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
because there isn't the power required

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.250 
because there isn't the power required
to<00:02:22.890> spin<00:02:23.160> up<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.310> platter<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.480> move<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.810> motor

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
to spin up a platter and to move a motor

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.559 
to spin up a platter and to move a motor
around<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.920> move<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.459> head<00:02:26.670> around<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.420> get

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
around and move the head around to get

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.150 
around and move the head around to get
to<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.780> right<00:02:27.870> place<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.770> is<00:02:28.860> all<00:02:28.980> just

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
to the right place and this is all just

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.920 
to the right place and this is all just
strictly<00:02:29.430> retrieval<00:02:30.150> electronically

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
strictly retrieval electronically

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.540 
strictly retrieval electronically
speaking<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.560> can<00:02:31.860> actually<00:02:32.010> run<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.310> lot

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
speaking it can actually run a lot

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.670 
speaking it can actually run a lot
cooler<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.270> while<00:02:33.720> there<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.050> little<00:02:34.410> bit<00:02:34.560> of

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
cooler so while there is a little bit of

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.229 
cooler so while there is a little bit of
heat<00:02:34.830> generated<00:02:35.310> it's<00:02:35.489> nowhere<00:02:35.880> near<00:02:36.090> the

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
heat generated it's nowhere near the

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.670 
heat generated it's nowhere near the
amount<00:02:36.270> of<00:02:36.510> heat<00:02:36.690> generated<00:02:37.050> by<00:02:37.170> spinning<00:02:37.590> up

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
amount of heat generated by spinning up

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.090 
amount of heat generated by spinning up
a<00:02:37.770> platter<00:02:38.010> like<00:02:38.220> this<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.700> 7,200<00:02:39.510> rpm<00:02:40.140> takes<00:02:41.010> a

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
a platter like this to 7,200 rpm takes a

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.890 
a platter like this to 7,200 rpm takes a
lot<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.310> energy<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:42.269> other<00:02:42.390> thing<00:02:42.569> is<00:02:42.690> also

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
lot of energy the other thing is also

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.330 
lot of energy the other thing is also
takes<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.260> lot<00:02:43.380> less<00:02:43.530> power<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.099> do<00:02:44.220> that

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
takes a lot less power to do that

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.009 
takes a lot less power to do that
because<00:02:44.550> again<00:02:45.120> there's<00:02:45.360> no<00:02:45.450> moving<00:02:45.660> parts

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
because again there's no moving parts

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.330 
because again there's no moving parts
and<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.170> don't<00:02:46.319> have<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.560> keep<00:02:46.709> powering<00:02:47.250> up

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
and you don't have to keep powering up

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.520 
and you don't have to keep powering up
the<00:02:47.489> drive<00:02:47.760> one<00:02:48.569> other<00:02:48.720> benefit<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.350> lack

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
the drive one other benefit of the lack

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.960 
the drive one other benefit of the lack
of<00:02:49.560> mechanical<00:02:50.190> parts<00:02:50.430> like<00:02:50.519> you've<00:02:50.670> seen<00:02:50.819> an

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
of mechanical parts like you've seen an

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.030 
of mechanical parts like you've seen an
old-school<00:02:51.299> hard<00:02:51.630> drive<00:02:51.870> is<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.830> lack<00:02:53.010> of

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
old-school hard drive is the lack of

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.920 
old-school hard drive is the lack of
susceptibility<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.209> damage<00:02:54.630> when<00:02:54.810> you're

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
susceptibility to damage when you're

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.050 
susceptibility to damage when you're
dropping<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.530> device<00:02:55.830> if<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.370> drop<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.700> device

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
dropping the device if you drop a device

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.550 
dropping the device if you drop a device
like<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.330> notebook<00:02:57.569> computer<00:02:57.720> with<00:02:58.530> a

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
like a notebook computer with a

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.650 
like a notebook computer with a
mechanical<00:02:59.280> drive<00:02:59.459> inside<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.940> while<00:03:00.480> it's

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
mechanical drive inside it while it's

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.449 
mechanical drive inside it while it's
running<00:03:00.780> or<00:03:01.080> reading<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.530> writing<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:02.220> head

now<00:03:21.299> if<00:03:21.390> you've<00:03:21.480> done<00:03:21.630> any<00:03:21.810> shopping<00:03:22.079> on<00:03:22.380> SSD

now if you've done any shopping on SSD
drives<00:03:23.100> you'll<00:03:23.250> know<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.430> one<00:03:23.670> of<00:03:23.700> the

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
downsides is they do tend to be much

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.009

more<00:03:25.890> expensive<00:03:26.100> per<00:03:27.060> capacity<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:27.870> if<00:03:27.930> you

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
more expensive per capacity so if you

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.620 
more expensive per capacity so if you

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
often they do fail completely so you

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.620 
often they do fail completely so you
