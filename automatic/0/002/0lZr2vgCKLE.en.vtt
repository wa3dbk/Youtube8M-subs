went to my local Barnes &amp; Noble store

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.050 
went to my local Barnes &amp; Noble store
and<00:00:25.769> sure<00:00:26.010> enough<00:00:26.039> they<00:00:26.490> just<00:00:26.519> put<00:00:26.939> out<00:00:27.029> some

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
and sure enough they just put out some

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.000 
and sure enough they just put out some
series<00:00:27.539> one<00:00:27.779> which<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.199> was<00:00:28.289> like<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.590> felt<00:00:28.890> so

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
series one which I was like I felt so

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.160 
series one which I was like I felt so
lucky<00:00:29.130> but<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.090> only<00:00:30.210> difference<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.720> now<00:00:30.929> all

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
lucky but the only difference is now all

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.420 
lucky but the only difference is now all
the<00:00:31.349> ones<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.560> Barnes<00:00:31.859> know<00:00:32.040> what<00:00:32.160> they<00:00:32.279> have

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
the ones that Barnes know what they have

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.580 
the ones that Barnes know what they have
in<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.610> box<00:00:32.910> if<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.180> guys<00:00:33.300> will<00:00:33.480> remember

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
in a box if you guys will remember

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.290 
in a box if you guys will remember
series<00:00:34.590> 1<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.860> series<00:00:34.980> 2<00:00:35.280> came<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.670> bag<00:00:35.910> and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
series 1 in series 2 came in a bag and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.880 
series 1 in series 2 came in a bag and
I'm<00:00:36.390> guessing<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:36.989> kind<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.350> kind<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.620> cut

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
I'm guessing this is kind of kind of cut

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.380 
I'm guessing this is kind of kind of cut
down<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.129> people<00:00:38.340> trying<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.610> fill<00:00:38.850> around<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
down on people trying to fill around the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.670 
down on people trying to fill around the
boxes<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.899> figure<00:00:40.110> out<00:00:40.140> what's<00:00:40.320> inside

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
boxes and figure out what's inside

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.139 
boxes and figure out what's inside
so<00:00:41.190> I'm<00:00:41.250> guessing<00:00:41.460> that's<00:00:41.670> why<00:00:41.820> they<00:00:41.910> did<00:00:42.059> this

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
so I'm guessing that's why they did this

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.030 
so I'm guessing that's why they did this
but<00:00:42.329> actually<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.840> box<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.200> better<00:00:43.440> so

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
but actually like the box is better so

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.470 
but actually like the box is better so

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
look so I'm pretty sure these are the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.679 
look so I'm pretty sure these are the
exact<00:01:47.189> same<00:01:47.430> things<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.270> find<00:01:48.509> like

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
exact same things that you can find like

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.969 
exact same things that you can find like
the<00:01:48.810> ones<00:01:48.960> at<00:01:49.079> Hot<00:01:49.200> Topic<00:01:49.229> only<00:01:49.680> these<00:01:49.799> ones

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
the ones at Hot Topic only these ones

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.679 
the ones at Hot Topic only these ones
actually<00:01:50.070> come<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.520> box<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.119> again<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.479> think

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
actually come in a box and again I think

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.960 
actually come in a box and again I think
it's<00:01:51.810> because<00:01:52.369> people<00:01:53.369> were<00:01:53.460> trying<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.790> fill

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
it's because people were trying to fill

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.700 
it's because people were trying to fill
around<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.210> bag<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.439> makes<00:01:55.590> a

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
around the bag and and this just makes a

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.990 
around the bag and and this just makes a
little<00:01:55.799> bit<00:01:55.950> harder<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.610> actually<00:01:56.759> like

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
little bit harder but I actually like

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.550 
little bit harder but I actually like
big<00:01:57.210> black<00:01:57.360> box<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.869> better<00:01:58.079> but<00:01:58.229> look<00:01:58.409> at<00:01:58.500> this

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
big black box is better but look at this
