debts that you might have so that you
don't<00:01:36.210> accrue<00:01:36.630> interest<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.409> doesn't<00:01:37.710> mean

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
don't accrue interest it doesn't mean

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.440 
don't accrue interest it doesn't mean
that<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.280> don't<00:01:38.729> have<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.030> pay<00:01:39.240> them

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
that you just don't have to pay them

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.620 
that you just don't have to pay them
anymore<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.140> need<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.970> at<00:01:41.970> least<00:01:42.030> provide

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
anymore but you need to at least provide

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.510 
anymore but you need to at least provide
that<00:01:43.020> copy<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.439> your<00:01:43.619> order<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.250> they

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
that copy of your order so that they

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.609 
that copy of your order so that they
know<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.790> you're<00:01:45.119> gone<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:45.960> anything<00:01:46.200> is

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
know that you're gone so if anything is

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.580 
know that you're gone so if anything is
to<00:01:46.740> happen<00:01:47.490> they<00:01:48.210> know<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.810> are<00:01:48.840> doing

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
to happen they know that you are doing

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.770 
to happen they know that you are doing
military<00:01:49.829> service<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.450> don't<00:01:51.630> have

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
military service and so you don't have

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.539 
military service and so you don't have
to<00:01:51.899> pay<00:01:52.049> interest<00:01:52.439> while<00:01:52.979> you're<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.280> training

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
to pay interest while you're in training

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.170 
to pay interest while you're in training

able to help pay them for me while I was
at<00:02:09.780> basic<00:02:10.140> training<00:02:10.170> because<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:10.800> don't<00:02:11.550> have

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
at basic training because you don't have

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.890 
at basic training because you don't have
access<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.390> computer

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
access to a computer

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.839 
access to a computer
or<00:02:13.019> anything<00:02:13.439> to<00:02:13.769> pay<00:02:13.950> those<00:02:14.129> bills<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.730> you

or anything to pay those bills for you

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.350 
or anything to pay those bills for you
for<00:02:15.239> yourself<00:02:15.659> you<00:02:16.620> can<00:02:16.799> set<00:02:17.700> your<00:02:17.819> cell<00:02:18.090> phone

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
for yourself you can set your cell phone

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.839 
for yourself you can set your cell phone
to<00:02:18.689> the<00:02:18.840> lowest<00:02:19.319> possible<00:02:19.709> plan<00:02:20.370> because

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
to the lowest possible plan because

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.190 
to the lowest possible plan because
you're<00:02:21.000> not<00:02:21.120> gonna<00:02:21.269> be<00:02:21.420> using<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.840> very<00:02:21.870> often

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
you're not gonna be using it very often

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.350 
you're not gonna be using it very often
I<00:02:22.620> don't<00:02:22.950> recommend<00:02:23.400> turning<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.939> off<00:02:24.030> because

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
I don't recommend turning it off because

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.910 
I don't recommend turning it off because
you<00:02:24.510> can<00:02:24.750> take<00:02:24.959> your<00:02:25.140> phone<00:02:25.319> with<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.709> and

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
you can take your phone with you and

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.979 
you can take your phone with you and
when<00:02:26.069> you<00:02:26.159> have<00:02:26.370> time<00:02:27.060> for<00:02:27.299> phone<00:02:27.480> calls<00:02:27.750> and

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
when you have time for phone calls and

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.349 
when you have time for phone calls and
basic<00:02:28.319> training<00:02:28.709> it's<00:02:28.829> really<00:02:29.189> helpful<00:02:29.459> to

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
basic training it's really helpful to

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.149 
basic training it's really helpful to
use<00:02:30.540> your<00:02:30.720> phone<00:02:30.989> instead<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.530> having<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.010> have

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
use your phone instead of having to have

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.339 
use your phone instead of having to have
a<00:02:32.189> phone<00:02:32.489> card<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.120> using<00:02:33.269> a<00:02:33.450> payphone<00:02:33.689> that's

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
a phone card and using a payphone that's

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.270 
a phone card and using a payphone that's
just<00:02:34.560> annoying

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
just annoying

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.640 
just annoying
so<00:02:35.400> just<00:02:36.359> lower<00:02:36.569> down<00:02:36.689> your<00:02:37.049> plan<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
so just lower down your plan to the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.589 
so just lower down your plan to the
lowest<00:02:37.980> possible<00:02:38.189> plan<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.909> then<00:02:39.000> make<00:02:39.569> sure

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
lowest possible plan and then make sure

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.289 
lowest possible plan and then make sure
you<00:02:39.870> pay<00:02:40.079> off<00:02:40.260> any<00:02:40.560> just<00:02:41.189> outstanding<00:02:41.519> debts

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
you pay off any just outstanding debts

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.879 
you pay off any just outstanding debts
that<00:02:42.569> you<00:02:42.689> might<00:02:42.930> have<00:02:43.200> like<00:02:43.560> library<00:02:44.310> fees<00:02:44.819> or

just unpaid parking tickets things like

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.690 
just unpaid parking tickets things like
that<00:02:48.840> because<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.500> will<00:02:49.739> come<00:02:50.129> back<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.340> get

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700
