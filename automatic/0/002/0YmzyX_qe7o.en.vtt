00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.849
 Everybody is a birthplace piece This time we explain how to use the hopper with Micha of presste No. 3 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.009
 I think that want to go 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:19.320
 A recent update adds a hopper to the Presse 3 Micra 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.020
 If you are playing Micra from Preste 3 , how to use the hopper is 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.620
 do not know 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.280
 Will explain how to use the simple hopper mean do you think that with not a few who say that 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.900
 I will 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:36.720
 Let's take a look at the description of the hopper first 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:43.120
 It says that it is used to put items in and out of the container 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:48.160
 Since I do not understand the meaning honestly, I will explain briefly what can be done with this hopper 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:53.530
 Here is the hotter mechanism The item put in the hopper at the end is 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.000
 All are adapted to be sent to the chest that is the hopper and the chest is in one 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.780
 Connected 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.170
 Let's actually put items in the Netherstar 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.170
 To do 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.830
 Yes the Netherstar was presented to the chest 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:22.790
 In other words, the hopper works to transport things 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:28.149
 But it is not enough just to line up the hoppers 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.149
 It is this that people who are not familiar with mechanical systems often do it 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:37.430
 In this form, can you tell me where the difference is 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:43.460
 All right ones are facing the chest side 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:50.020
 If you make a mistake , all points down The hopper transports the item in the direction it is going to turn 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.020
 Because it works, it does not work properly if placed properly 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:12.350
 This street item is not sent to the chest you want to send 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:17.540
 To make unsuitable the hopper in the desired direction in the left toward the side surface of such a block 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:20.710
 Only this is sent to the chest if the block is a chest 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.700
 Then the practicality of such a hopper is 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:29.490
 You can use a hopper to make various fully automatic machines 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.490
 Let's actually make something 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.170
 Here is a fully automatic egg recovery machine 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:40.880
 The eggs laid by the chicken are automatically collected by the hopper 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.880
 It is a mechanism to enter the chest 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.400
 7 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.800
 goo 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.900
 me 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.900
 What kind of feeling actually 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.190
 Goo 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.910
 Hmm 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:17.310
 Rose-laid eggs are sent to the chest . In this way, the properties of the hopper were effectively used. 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:23.160
 Automatic machine can be made 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:26.750
 The hopper is sometimes contains the items in the hopper does not stop there 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:32.200
 You can also send a pet stone set 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.200
 This item is also added to the update this time 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:41.410
 Use the Red Stone Comparator Let's create an automatic door this time 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.470
 goo 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:53.939
 I put a comparator in this direction in front of the hopper 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.939
 [musics] 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.800
 Well, this is complete 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.800
 Let's use immediately 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.110
 And Choi the diamond 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.180
 It is like this 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.340
 If you take an item, the signal will not be sent 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.010
 It is completion of hopper type automatic door 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:40.040
 Yes this time was an explanatory video about how to use the hopper 

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:45.139
 At some a lot is still techniques that can be in the hopper 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:49.490
 Please make various things using everyone by all means hopper 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:51.650
 Then thank you for watching until the end of everyone 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:56.720
 Please look forward to future videos 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.720
