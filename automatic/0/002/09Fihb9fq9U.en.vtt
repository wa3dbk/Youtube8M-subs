record 1080p and right there is where

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.820 
record 1080p and right there is where
the<00:02:22.890> little<00:02:23.550> wrist<00:02:23.940> loop<00:02:24.180> will<00:02:24.450> go<00:02:24.630> looking<00:02:25.620> on

the little wrist loop will go looking on
the<00:02:26.190> bottom<00:02:26.490> of<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.610> device<00:02:26.850> you'll<00:02:27.150> notice

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
the bottom of the device you'll notice

the bottom of the device you'll notice
the<00:02:27.660> Lightning<00:02:28.110> connector<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.830> middle

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
the Lightning connector in the middle

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.170 
the Lightning connector in the middle
and<00:02:29.570> you'll<00:02:30.570> see<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:30.840> try<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.970> insert<00:02:32.970> the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
and you'll see I try to insert the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.010 
and you'll see I try to insert the
Lightning<00:02:33.600> connector<00:02:33.930> inside<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:36.810> that's

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
Lightning connector inside so that's

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.810 
Lightning connector inside so that's
definitely<00:02:37.260> an<00:02:37.530> improvement<00:02:37.800> in<00:02:38.190> size<00:02:38.430> over

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
definitely an improvement in size over

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.060 
definitely an improvement in size over
the<00:02:38.940> 30<00:02:39.300> pin<00:02:39.540> connector<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:40.140> as<00:02:40.650> Apple

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
the 30 pin connector and as Apple

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.070 
the 30 pin connector and as Apple
mentioned<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:41.550> is<00:02:41.730> finally<00:02:42.240> reversible<00:02:42.900> and

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
mentioned this is finally reversible and

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.920 
mentioned this is finally reversible and
nothing<00:02:43.350> too<00:02:43.530> revolutionary<00:02:43.860> there<00:02:44.580> and

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
nothing too revolutionary there and

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.150 
nothing too revolutionary there and
you'll<00:02:45.930> see<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.380> goes<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.680> both<00:02:46.920> ways

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
you'll see that it goes in both ways

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.470 
you'll see that it goes in both ways
that's<00:02:47.670> what<00:02:47.850> she<00:02:48.090> said<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.750> also<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.950> iPod
