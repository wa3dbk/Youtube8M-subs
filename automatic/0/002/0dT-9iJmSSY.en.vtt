 about 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.610

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.819
 Your way of being gives me 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.939
 Y 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.939
 where you kiss fever when you're here 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.330
 close to me 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.979
 and 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.240
 Numerous strata now 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.600
 once 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.060
 and once not but for contract nobody 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.190
 still I will be your long hand to 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.650
 that this is called me I do not know but I've 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:04.250
 seen silvia that she was living 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.470
 upwards yes yes your veil was called yes 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.580
 no no no I did not say it was an itch that 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.740
 I had back 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.669
 look at the beauty of dora de 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:17.569
 redundant if I feel that the half 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.460
 forward towards the end forgiveness 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:22.889
 he fully dominated the rhythms of time 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.370
 the beginning had two problems the first 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:28.130
 It was 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.710
 that you do not fold the song and it was you 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.889
 subject was presenting doubling 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.919
 the doubling but if I had to put you 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:39.940
 20 would give you 25 for how good it has been 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.940
 handled your body 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.310
 the ear was going 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.310
 something of this 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.760
 let's see a great vedette has to 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:59.780
 also think of musicals in reality 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:05.630
 I liked the bet in some moments 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:07.250
 it did not seem obvious because of nerves this 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.560
 loved the interpretation since 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.500
 you started was increscendo your 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.120
 participation until you broke it with 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.580
 6 by 8 that the movement of cars 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.280
 of hip you had and you were great 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:23.360
 for me but I would put you to 50 to see 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:26.270
 six by eight you know that six by eight 38 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:30.710
 times eight times and that's what I do not 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:33.200
 I knew nothing about '68 because it tells you that 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.750
 start the necessary weight for the musical 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.550
 and the dislocation was brutal, so in 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.580
 you broke up and as I told you a 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.600
 good essay definitely gives a good 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.250
 show what you've done right now 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.030
 I congratulate the list it shows time the 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.030
 trust 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.030
