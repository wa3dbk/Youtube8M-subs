 It is not ethical that you have 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.410

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:59.780
 of educational work in schools 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:01.730

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:24.890
 what the school should answer 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:32.090
 society is to be embodied 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:34.130
 especially in relation to student teacher m2 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.259
 At school, I work as a teacher. 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.390
 this idea of ​​what is a substantive of what is 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.330
 main setter can not be lost 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.229
 What did we see working on? 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.979
 of the school is the teaching work 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:56.170
 the supervisor's job as it is with the 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.170
 supervisor's role in this story 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:08.329
 currently in the state of são paulo and that 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:14.180
 It's up to the 50's and 60's 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:18.829
 we had the figure of the inspector of 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:23.930
 teaching is what makes in the state of são 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:27.620
 the interschool forecast or 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:32.299
 supervisory system that has a function 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:36.100
 constitutional principle of enforcing 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.100
 of national education 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:46.430
 this support that supervisors should 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:50.750
 to give to schools is what they do 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:55.930
 especially in a direct relationship with the 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.930
 director and the steering team coordination 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.950
 then this supervisory work 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.470
 system 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:08.810
 it does not have a function for example of 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:11.480
 to guide a teacher is the literacy 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.720

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.090
 he is there at school that can 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.849
 happening can and can 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.329
 but it will not be so a direct thing 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:27.439

 work the time you need but it's not who 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:32.209
 is working with him every day that 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.909
 pedagogical coordination is the director of 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:40.459

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:42.829
 a server help but you do not 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.379

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.930
 differentiated authority 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:52.129
 you participate with an educator who is 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.919
 also putting hypothesis arguments 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.629
 about a problem is educational that is 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:59.269

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.849
 the supervisor, in addition to asserting 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.370
 the principles of national education as 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.889

 We have to stay with the lion. 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.960
 You do not have to give that advice. 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:42.470
 you give to public school more 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.469
