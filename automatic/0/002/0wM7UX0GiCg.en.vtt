00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
perspective from that side of the lesson

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.730 
perspective from that side of the lesson
but<00:00:30.150> like<00:00:30.359> most<00:00:30.539> other<00:00:30.840> episodes<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.679> season

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
but like most other episodes this season

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.860 
but like most other episodes this season
that's<00:00:32.579> not<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.030> only<00:00:33.059> lesson<00:00:33.510> being

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
head around the degree of practicality

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.590 
head around the degree of practicality
that<00:00:38.010> lies<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:38.460> an<00:00:38.610> apple<00:00:38.940> jack<00:00:39.149> side<00:00:39.420> of

way or another are almost incapable of

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.510 
way or another are almost incapable of
handling<00:02:06.780> themselves<00:02:07.200> as<00:02:07.649> an<00:02:07.890> independent

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
handling themselves as an independent

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.669 
handling themselves as an independent
individual<00:02:09.209> now<00:02:09.390> most<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.050> them<00:02:10.200> still<00:02:10.379> live

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679

with<00:02:10.770> their<00:02:10.830> parents<00:02:10.979> into<00:02:11.610> their<00:02:11.760> late<00:02:11.940> too

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
with their parents into their late too

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.050 
with their parents into their late too
because<00:02:12.980> they<00:02:13.130> don't<00:02:13.340> have<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.580> strength<00:02:13.850> to

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
because they don't have the strength to

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.610 
because they don't have the strength to
do<00:02:14.300> what's<00:02:14.540> necessary<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:15.230> become

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
do what's necessary to become

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.190 
do what's necessary to become
independent<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.730> rest<00:02:17.060> barely<00:02:17.720> live<00:02:17.900> at<00:02:18.050> all

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
independent the rest barely live at all

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.320 
independent the rest barely live at all
so<00:02:18.770> I<00:02:18.800> did<00:02:19.190> what<00:02:19.400> Apple<00:02:19.730> Bloom<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.060> many

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.110 
so I did what Apple Bloom and many
others<00:02:20.690> do<00:02:20.930> eventually<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:22.280> got<00:02:22.430> sick<00:02:22.880> of<00:02:23.000> it

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
others do eventually I got sick of it

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.940 
others do eventually I got sick of it
and<00:02:23.240> rebelled<00:02:23.630> I<00:02:23.840> started<00:02:24.590> going<00:02:24.860> on

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
and rebelled I started going on

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.770 
and rebelled I started going on
adventures<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.730> testing<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.240> limits<00:02:26.330> of<00:02:26.600> my

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
adventures and testing the limits of my

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.290 
adventures and testing the limits of my
abilities<00:02:27.290> in<00:02:27.470> high-risk<00:02:27.830> situations<00:02:28.670> to

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
abilities in high-risk situations to

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.970 
abilities in high-risk situations to
take<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.630> path<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:29.960> least<00:02:30.020> resistance<00:02:30.320> I

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
take the path of least resistance I

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.220 
take the path of least resistance I
usually<00:02:31.490> make<00:02:32.030> sure<00:02:32.270> that<00:02:32.450> my<00:02:32.570> parents<00:02:32.780> didn't

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
usually make sure that my parents didn't

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.870 
usually make sure that my parents didn't
find<00:02:33.440> out<00:02:33.560> about<00:02:33.740> my<00:02:33.980> plans<00:02:34.310> until<00:02:34.700> either

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
find out about my plans until either

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.820 
find out about my plans until either
after<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.480> fact<00:02:35.660> or<00:02:35.930> when<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.410> was<00:02:36.530> already

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
after the fact or when it was already

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.160 
after the fact or when it was already
too<00:02:36.980> late<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.520> change<00:02:37.730> anything<00:02:38.090> after<00:02:38.990> so

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
too late to change anything after so

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.380 
too late to change anything after so
many<00:02:39.350> adventures<00:02:40.010> they<00:02:40.460> saw<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:40.700> I<00:02:40.940> could<00:02:41.030> in

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
many adventures they saw that I could in

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.090 
many adventures they saw that I could in
fact<00:02:41.540> handle<00:02:41.930> myself<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.500> from<00:02:42.890> there

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
fact handle myself and from there

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.830 
fact handle myself and from there
gaining<00:02:43.850> their<00:02:43.970> approval<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:44.660> support

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
gaining their approval and support

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.680 
gaining their approval and support
became<00:02:45.500> much<00:02:45.800> easier<00:02:45.830> these<00:02:46.820> situations<00:02:47.570> can

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
became much easier these situations can

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.390 
became much easier these situations can
make<00:02:47.960> great<00:02:48.260> proving<00:02:48.740> grounds<00:02:49.100> for<00:02:49.280> ourselves

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
make great proving grounds for ourselves

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.640 
make great proving grounds for ourselves
but<00:02:50.360> we<00:02:50.540> all<00:02:50.690> have<00:02:50.720> limits<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.440> it's

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
but we all have limits and it's

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.500 
but we all have limits and it's
important<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.220> know<00:02:52.340> what<00:02:52.520> they<00:02:52.700> are<00:02:52.880> it's

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
important to know what they are it's

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.300 
important to know what they are it's
also<00:02:53.750> important<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.440> know<00:02:54.590> why<00:02:54.860> we're<00:02:55.190> doing

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
also important to know why we're doing

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.970

enough to maintain safety and control
throughout<00:03:02.390> my<00:03:02.660> adventures<00:03:03.230> but<00:03:03.800> there's<00:03:04.070> a

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
throughout my adventures but there's a

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.130 
throughout my adventures but there's a
lot<00:03:04.490> of<00:03:04.520> people<00:03:04.970> out<00:03:05.120> there<00:03:05.150> that<00:03:05.480> repel<00:03:05.900> for
