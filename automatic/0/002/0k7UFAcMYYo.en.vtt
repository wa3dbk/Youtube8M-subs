00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.390
 action at the housing authority for 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.909
 rent increase is justified this is 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.890
 really discover embarrassment because one 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.729
 had done 1-1 in time it's even his 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.360
 suggestion 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.590

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.650
 damaging for

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.580
 mechanism 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.310
 how it's done it's going to be all to 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.840
 does it mean a little bit of a thing 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.840
 I tell people to pay attention 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.560
 incredible note that in Quebec we are 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.210
 able to sign cumin while 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.020
 all the provisions we have 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.380
 explained that one is a smart adult 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.290
 major vaccinate in disposition every 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.400
 means and we are actually allowed but this 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.710
 who is still over eight years old 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.380
 the registered to the law we are allowed to 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.060
 return the signature there is a case you 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.050
 theirs became it's a lease 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.479
 a home 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.910
 and yes, the qatar with which we feel 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.750
 a little in the ten days following his 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.180
 signature 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.490
 I repeat he signed the document he 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.410
 the moon has become aware of them in 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.320
 ten days that can apply to the board 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.070
 housing to challenge his 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.110
 signature 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.430
 while he can challenge the prices of the 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.690
 rent 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.480
 we're talking about making a new lease at 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.519
 Quebec Government 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.500
 that he could move the clause of the che 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.110
 and that reflects this discussion lobaye 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.209
 put it on the first page of the bottom 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.459
 rhin the real problem in quebec 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.780
 these responsible convoys and zellige that's 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.670
 not that the clause is on the first page 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.620
 in 12th in third or fifth 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.450
 is that the clause must disappear on 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.129
 must allow the owners of 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.769
 return your home to the market price 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.200
 that we want to protect the tenant 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.670
 who lives in the building or it's 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.440
 young shoots extremely provisions 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.510
 heavy to wear for homeowners 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.900
 of Quebec buildings but that they 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.000
 request to support the complete industry 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.860
 real estate by protecting not 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.910
 only the qatar who is at home but 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.250
 indeed a housing function is 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.069
 completely free to protect the price 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.560
 rent of this apartment that it did not 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.019
 just meaningless and we have to 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.299
