us through all 12 keys using the circle
of<00:00:45.920> Ford's<00:00:46.480> so<00:00:47.480> let's<00:00:47.690> start<00:00:47.930> off<00:00:48.140> in<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.680> key

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
of Ford's so let's start off in the key

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.920 
of Ford's so let's start off in the key
of<00:00:48.890> C<00:00:49.010> we're<00:00:49.789> going<00:00:49.879> to<00:00:49.940> start<00:00:50.000> on<00:00:50.300> our<00:00:50.390> 2<00:00:50.600> chord

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
of C we're going to start on our 2 chord

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:58.510 
of C we're going to start on our 2 chord
which<00:00:51.200> is<00:00:51.410> d<00:00:51.590> minor<00:00:51.800> 7<00:00:53.710> our<00:00:54.710> 5<00:00:55.340> chord<00:00:56.620> 1<00:00:57.620> C<00:00:58.309> major

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
which is d minor 7 our 5 chord 1 C major

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.000 
which is d minor 7 our 5 chord 1 C major
7<00:00:58.850> or<00:00:59.600> 6<00:00:59.809> chord<00:01:00.140> which<00:01:00.289> would<00:01:00.410> normally<00:01:00.530> be<00:01:00.829> a

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
7 or 6 chord which would normally be a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.450 
7 or 6 chord which would normally be a
minor<00:01:01.309> 7<00:01:01.670> we're<00:01:01.760> going<00:01:01.879> to<00:01:01.940> make<00:01:02.030> a<00:01:02.090> dominant<00:01:02.629> 7

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
minor 7 we're going to make a dominant 7

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:11.370 
minor 7 we're going to make a dominant 7
7<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:04.610> lead<00:01:04.759> us<00:01:04.850> back<00:01:05.059> to<00:01:05.119> the<00:01:05.330> 24

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:24.770 

one<00:01:11.799> more<00:01:11.950> time<00:01:12.130> all<00:01:12.399> the<00:01:12.520> slower<00:01:17.759> Domna<00:01:19.920> 62

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.789 

now<00:01:25.780> we<00:01:25.840> need<00:01:26.020> a<00:01:26.049> cord<00:01:26.350> at<00:01:26.439> the<00:01:26.469> end<00:01:26.649> of<00:01:26.710> this

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
now we need a cord at the end of this

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.770 
now we need a cord at the end of this
progression<00:01:27.219> to<00:01:27.850> help<00:01:28.000> lead<00:01:28.240> us<00:01:28.270> into<00:01:28.630> the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
progression to help lead us into the

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.419 
progression to help lead us into the
next<00:01:28.810> key<00:01:29.259> up<00:01:29.500> a<00:01:29.770> fourth<00:01:30.039> from<00:01:30.220> our<00:01:30.369> original

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
next key up a fourth from our original

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.730 
next key up a fourth from our original
key<00:01:30.909> so<00:01:31.750> our<00:01:31.840> next<00:01:31.960> key<00:01:32.200> is<00:01:32.289> going<00:01:32.439> to<00:01:32.500> be<00:01:32.590> F

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
key so our next key is going to be F

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.800 
key so our next key is going to be F
major<00:01:33.009> but<00:01:33.850> remember<00:01:34.060> we're<00:01:34.390> going<00:01:34.630> to<00:01:34.689> be

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
major but remember we're going to be

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.210 
major but remember we're going to be
starting<00:01:34.990> on<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.380> two<00:01:35.530> chord<00:01:35.829> of<00:01:35.890> F<00:01:36.039> major

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
starting on the two chord of F major

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.510 
starting on the two chord of F major
which<00:01:37.000> would<00:01:37.149> be<00:01:37.270> G<00:01:37.509> minor<00:01:37.750> 7<00:01:38.200> so<00:01:38.920> we<00:01:39.039> need<00:01:39.189> some

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
which would be G minor 7 so we need some

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.740 
which would be G minor 7 so we need some
sort<00:01:39.700> of<00:01:39.789> dominant<00:01:40.240> chord<00:01:40.420> that's<00:01:40.569> going<00:01:40.689> to

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
sort of dominant chord that's going to

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.350 
sort of dominant chord that's going to
lead<00:01:40.929> us<00:01:40.960> to<00:01:41.229> that<00:01:41.259> two<00:01:41.560> chord<00:01:42.299> now<00:01:43.299> the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
lead us to that two chord now the

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.969 
lead us to that two chord now the
easiest<00:01:43.630> thing<00:01:44.110> that<00:01:44.259> I<00:01:44.289> can<00:01:44.380> think<00:01:44.530> of<00:01:44.799> is

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
easiest thing that I can think of is

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.190 
easiest thing that I can think of is
simply<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.399> use<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:46.060> 5<00:01:46.299> of<00:01:46.479> 2<00:01:46.659> which<00:01:46.929> would<00:01:47.080> be

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
simply to use the 5 of 2 which would be

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.719 
simply to use the 5 of 2 which would be
d7<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.990> can<00:01:50.110> think<00:01:50.229> of<00:01:50.349> this<00:01:50.470> as<00:01:50.530> a<00:01:51.009> dominant<00:01:51.520> 2

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
d7 we can think of this as a dominant 2

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.210 
d7 we can think of this as a dominant 2
chord<00:01:52.060> in<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.270> key<00:01:52.360> of<00:01:52.509> C<00:01:52.630> major<00:01:52.810> or<00:01:53.319> a

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
chord in the key of C major or a

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.809 
chord in the key of C major or a
dominant<00:01:54.700> six<00:01:54.939> chord<00:01:55.299> in<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.539> key<00:01:55.810> of<00:01:55.990> F<00:01:56.200> major

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
dominant six chord in the key of F major

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.580 
dominant six chord in the key of F major
so<00:01:57.819> this<00:01:58.000> d7<00:01:58.569> will<00:01:58.720> lead<00:01:58.840> us<00:01:58.959> perfectly<00:01:59.380> to<00:01:59.560> the

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
so this d7 will lead us perfectly to the

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.929 
so this d7 will lead us perfectly to the
two<00:01:59.860> under<00:02:00.220> next<00:02:00.399> game<00:02:00.549> major<00:02:02.039> ok<00:02:03.039> let's<00:02:03.789> take

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
two under next game major ok let's take

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.160 
two under next game major ok let's take
this<00:02:04.060> progression<00:02:04.450> through<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.750> key<00:02:04.899> of<00:02:05.020> F

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
this progression through the key of F

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.539 
this progression through the key of F

then our d 7 64 2 meaning a cord that's

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.870 
then our d 7 64 2 meaning a cord that's
going<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.470> lead<00:02:25.650> us<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:26.010> our<00:02:26.040> two<00:02:26.430> chord<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:26.790> our

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
going to lead us to our two chord in our

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.960 
going to lead us to our two chord in our
next<00:02:27.060> key<00:02:27.270> b-flat<00:02:27.720> major<00:02:27.900> which<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:29.040> C<00:02:29.250> minor<00:02:29.490> 7

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
the crash progression you can simply

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.319 
the crash progression you can simply
think<00:02:42.049> up<00:02:42.349> a<00:02:42.620> whole<00:02:42.829> step<00:02:42.860> from<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.819> one<00:02:43.970> chord

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
think up a whole step from the one chord

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.020 
think up a whole step from the one chord
so<00:02:45.099> so<00:02:46.099> let<00:02:46.250> me<00:02:46.340> show<00:02:46.459> you<00:02:46.489> really<00:02:46.670> quick<00:02:46.909> in

make<00:02:58.159> a<00:02:58.190> dominant<00:02:58.730> chord<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.959> that'll<00:03:00.500> need

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
make a dominant chord and that'll need

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.110 
make a dominant chord and that'll need
is<00:03:00.739> perfectly<00:03:01.129> down<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.340> fifth<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.879> the<00:03:01.909> to

can continue that till you can do it in

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.230 
can continue that till you can do it in
all<00:05:05.080> 12<00:05:05.380> keys<00:05:05.590> and<00:05:05.919> usually<00:05:06.729> I<00:05:06.759> would<00:05:06.880> be<00:05:07.000> doing

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
all 12 keys and usually I would be doing

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.059 
all 12 keys and usually I would be doing
it<00:05:07.449> a<00:05:07.479> little<00:05:07.659> slower<00:05:08.020> somewhere<00:05:08.500> around<00:05:08.590> 60

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:09.069 
it a little slower somewhere around 60

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:10.920 
it a little slower somewhere around 60
beats<00:05:09.220> per<00:05:09.340> minute<00:05:09.669> then<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.389> final<00:05:10.569> exercise

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
beats per minute then the final exercise

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.140 
beats per minute then the final exercise
would<00:05:11.560> be<00:05:11.740> to<00:05:11.979> be<00:05:12.250> able<00:05:12.490> to<00:05:12.669> sing<00:05:12.880> the<00:05:13.000> root

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
would be to be able to sing the root

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.550 
would be to be able to sing the root

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
give myself a simple starting pitch here

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:19.290 
give myself a simple starting pitch here

chord<00:06:02.440> in<00:06:02.500> the<00:06:02.560> key<00:06:02.620> of<00:06:02.770> E<00:06:02.979> flat<00:06:03.219> which<00:06:03.490> would

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
chord in the key of E flat which would

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.249 
chord in the key of E flat which would
be<00:06:03.699> F<00:06:05.310> so<00:06:06.310> it's<00:06:06.520> right<00:06:06.699> on<00:06:06.729> with<00:06:06.969> my<00:06:07.120> pitch<00:06:07.330> okay

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:08.259 
be F so it's right on with my pitch okay

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:10.140 
be F so it's right on with my pitch okay
and<00:06:08.889> you<00:06:08.979> continue<00:06:09.430> seeing<00:06:09.669> that<00:06:09.819> until<00:06:10.120> you

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
and you continue seeing that until you

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.330 
and you continue seeing that until you
could<00:06:10.360> do<00:06:10.449> it<00:06:10.569> in<00:06:10.659> all<00:06:10.810> 12<00:06:11.110> keys<00:06:11.349> and<00:06:12.039> this<00:06:12.130> all

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
could do it in all 12 keys and this all

could do it in all 12 keys and this all
should<00:06:12.520> be<00:06:12.550> done<00:06:12.819> before<00:06:13.270> even<00:06:13.719> trying<00:06:13.840> to

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 
should be done before even trying to

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:17.370 
should be done before even trying to
improvise<00:06:14.409> over<00:06:14.830> the<00:06:14.919> progression
