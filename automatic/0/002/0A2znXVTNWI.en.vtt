that<00:01:36.200> facility<00:01:36.829> was<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.249> whole<00:01:37.759> idea<00:01:37.789> was<00:01:38.390> if

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
that facility was the whole idea was if

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.219 
that facility was the whole idea was if
we<00:01:38.840> could<00:01:39.640> capture<00:01:40.640> some<00:01:41.210> of<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.569> frogs<00:01:41.869> or

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
we could capture some of the frogs or

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.169 
we could capture some of the frogs or
been<00:01:42.439> incident<00:01:42.950> sick<00:01:43.340> frogs<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:43.909> see<00:01:44.030> how<00:01:44.119> to

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
been incident sick frogs and see how to

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.330 
been incident sick frogs and see how to
treat<00:01:44.569> them<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.100> eventually<00:01:46.100> probably

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
treat them and eventually probably

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.429 
treat them and eventually probably
release<00:01:46.729> them<00:01:46.999> in<00:01:47.539> the<00:01:47.659> world<00:01:47.869> if<00:01:47.990> possible<00:01:48.319> or

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
release them in the world if possible or

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.340 
release them in the world if possible or
and<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:48.859> it<00:01:49.249> probably<00:01:49.490> reproduced<00:01:50.350> healthy

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
and and it probably reproduced healthy

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.349 
and and it probably reproduced healthy
mountain<00:01:52.310> chickens<00:01:52.639> that<00:01:52.759> eventually<00:01:53.060> could

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
mountain chickens that eventually could

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:54.969 
mountain chickens that eventually could
be<00:01:53.509> released<00:01:53.780> into<00:01:53.899> well<00:01:54.079> that<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:54.829> whole

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
be released into well that the whole

concert zsl and Darwin actually and go
metal<00:01:59.299> Dominica<00:01:59.749> came<00:01:59.899> together<00:02:00.079> and<00:02:00.350> get<00:02:00.530> the

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
metal Dominica came together and get the

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.989 
metal Dominica came together and get the
facility<00:02:01.159> no<00:02:02.030> we<00:02:02.749> had<00:02:02.959> different<00:02:03.289> milestones

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:03.999 
facility no we had different milestones

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:06.249 
facility no we had different milestones
since<00:02:04.999> we<00:02:05.090> already<00:02:05.179> fast<00:02:05.539> it<00:02:05.719> first<00:02:05.990> we<00:02:06.109> had<00:02:06.229> to

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
since we already fast it first we had to

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.529 
since we already fast it first we had to
actually<00:02:06.469> get<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.100> crickets<00:02:07.579> get<00:02:08.360> them

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
actually get the crickets get them

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.330 
actually get the crickets get them
breathing<00:02:08.690> then<00:02:09.530> we<00:02:09.649> have<00:02:09.770> to<00:02:09.860> get<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.130> frog

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
breathing then we have to get the frog

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.190 
breathing then we have to get the frog
which<00:02:10.550> will<00:02:10.670> be<00:02:10.759> another<00:02:10.940> mile<00:02:11.209> students<00:02:11.569> get

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
which will be another mile students get

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.480 
which will be another mile students get
the<00:02:12.290> Frog<00:02:12.500> to<00:02:12.530> be<00:02:12.709> disease-free

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
the Frog to be disease-free

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.150 
the Frog to be disease-free
then<00:02:13.730> get<00:02:13.940> them<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.120> be<00:02:14.360> healthy<00:02:14.569> then<00:02:15.530> lastly

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
then get them to be healthy then lastly

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.220 
then get them to be healthy then lastly
actually<00:02:16.700> we<00:02:17.060> have<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.330> make<00:02:17.510> what<00:02:17.720> close<00:02:18.200> a

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
actually we have to make what close a

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.480 
actually we have to make what close a
milestone<00:02:18.530> we<00:02:19.070> work

chicken<00:04:02.750> frog<00:04:02.960> is<00:04:03.110> healthy<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:04.280> their

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
chicken frog is healthy that their

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.220 
chicken frog is healthy that their
habitat<00:04:04.940> watch<00:04:05.090> which<00:04:05.390> we<00:04:05.540> create<00:04:05.930> in<00:04:06.170> the

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
habitat watch which we create in the

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.010 
habitat watch which we create in the
facility<00:04:07.010> is<00:04:07.190> a<00:04:07.220> safe<00:04:08.000> and<00:04:08.270> as<00:04:08.480> well<00:04:08.660> this<00:04:08.870> is

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
facility is a safe and as well this is

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.870 
facility is a safe and as well this is
free<00:04:09.230> so<00:04:09.860> we<00:04:09.980> also<00:04:10.100> when<00:04:10.400> we<00:04:10.490> go<00:04:10.610> into<00:04:10.730> the

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
free so we also when we go into the

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.000 
free so we also when we go into the
facility<00:04:11.060> of<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.570> frogs<00:04:11.780> itself<00:04:12.170> we<00:04:12.710> have<00:04:12.860> to

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
facility of the frogs itself we have to

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.590 
facility of the frogs itself we have to
undo<00:04:13.370> a<00:04:13.400> visual<00:04:13.820> inspection<00:04:13.970> to<00:04:14.450> make<00:04:14.480> sure

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
undo a visual inspection to make sure

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.630 
undo a visual inspection to make sure
the<00:04:14.780> frogs<00:04:15.020> look<00:04:15.170> healthy<00:04:15.530> change<00:04:16.370> your<00:04:16.520> water

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
the frogs look healthy change your water

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.130 
the frogs look healthy change your water
bowl<00:04:16.970> to<00:04:17.330> make<00:04:17.480> sure<00:04:17.600> that<00:04:17.720> their<00:04:17.870> nest<00:04:18.080> sites

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
bowl to make sure that their nest sites

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.260 
bowl to make sure that their nest sites
and<00:04:18.590> hiding<00:04:18.830> places<00:04:18.859> are<00:04:19.250> all<00:04:19.370> intact<00:04:19.609> make

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
and hiding places are all intact make

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.480 
and hiding places are all intact make
sure<00:04:20.420> that<00:04:20.540> the<00:04:20.720> inclusions<00:04:21.590> always<00:04:22.190> clean

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
sure that the inclusions always clean

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.940 
sure that the inclusions always clean
and<00:04:22.750> make<00:04:23.750> sure<00:04:23.930> there<00:04:24.110> is<00:04:24.230> I'm<00:04:24.350> enough<00:04:24.680> water

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
and make sure there is I'm enough water

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.100 
and make sure there is I'm enough water
or<00:04:25.070> it's<00:04:25.370> moist<00:04:26.120> enough<00:04:26.480> to<00:04:26.690> make<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:26.900> frog

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
or it's moist enough to make the frog

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.360 
or it's moist enough to make the frog
finger<00:04:27.410> daily<00:04:27.680> forest<00:04:28.010> because<00:04:28.280> you

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
finger daily forest because you

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.580 
finger daily forest because you
replicate<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:29.270> forest<00:04:29.660> as<00:04:29.810> well<00:04:29.840> so<00:04:30.560> I

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
replicate the forest as well so I

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.980 
replicate the forest as well so I
obviously<00:04:30.979> read<00:04:31.250> since

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
obviously read since

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.270 
obviously read since
any<00:04:32.140> hope<00:04:32.290> that<00:04:32.320> we're<00:04:32.590> gonna<00:04:32.710> get<00:04:32.920> breeding

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
any hope that we're gonna get breeding

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.460 
any hope that we're gonna get breeding
that's<00:04:33.490> that's<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:34.060> main<00:04:34.180> goal<00:04:34.240> is<00:04:34.750> to<00:04:34.780> get

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
that's that's the main goal is to get

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.080 
that's that's the main goal is to get
some<00:04:35.710> of<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.890> folks<00:04:36.100> in<00:04:36.250> there<00:04:36.460> to<00:04:36.580> breed<00:04:36.820> and

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
some of the folks in there to breed and

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.560 
some of the folks in there to breed and
then<00:04:37.720> we<00:04:38.110> can<00:04:38.710> take<00:04:39.400> some<00:04:39.460> steps<00:04:39.910> to<00:04:40.000> on<00:04:40.210> decide

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
then we can take some steps to on decide

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.770 
then we can take some steps to on decide
to<00:04:40.720> decide<00:04:41.100> how<00:04:42.100> and<00:04:42.130> where<00:04:42.700> and<00:04:43.030> when<00:04:43.300> to

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
to decide how and where and when to

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.580 
to decide how and where and when to
release<00:04:44.440> those<00:04:45.180> juveniles<00:04:46.180> that<00:04:46.330> that<00:04:47.020> arise

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
release those juveniles that that arise

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.310 
release those juveniles that that arise
out<00:04:47.950> of<00:04:48.070> out<00:04:48.610> of<00:04:48.640> a<00:04:48.850> successful<00:04:49.210> breeding<00:04:49.510> so

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
out of out of a successful breeding so

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.440 
out of out of a successful breeding so
obviously<00:04:50.650> that<00:04:50.800> is<00:04:50.950> the<00:04:51.100> ultimate<00:04:51.250> goal<00:04:51.580> my

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
obviously that is the ultimate goal my

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.880 
obviously that is the ultimate goal my
hope<00:04:52.630> for<00:04:52.660> the<00:04:52.960> project<00:04:53.350> is<00:04:53.440> to<00:04:53.590> rid<00:04:53.770> the

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
hope for the project is to rid the

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.620 
hope for the project is to rid the
mountain<00:04:54.220> chicken<00:04:54.370> successfully

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
mountain chicken successfully

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.020 
mountain chicken successfully
very<00:04:55.840> fastly<00:04:56.170> and<00:04:56.530> to<00:04:57.370> really<00:04:57.640> see<00:04:57.880> them

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
very fastly and to really see them

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.060 
very fastly and to really see them
reintroduce<00:04:58.810> back<00:04:58.990> in<00:04:59.140> the<00:04:59.230> oil<00:04:59.440> and<00:04:59.590> they<00:04:59.710> can

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
reintroduce back in the oil and they can

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.220 
reintroduce back in the oil and they can
actually<00:05:00.220> go<00:05:00.610> back<00:05:00.640> to<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:01.090> numbers<00:05:01.450> or<00:05:01.960> get

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
actually go back to the numbers or get

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.700 
actually go back to the numbers or get
