00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
indoors and look around areas that you

indoors and look around areas that you
don't<00:00:26.760> normally<00:00:26.940> go<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.330> then<00:00:28.320> make<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> list<00:00:28.980> of

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
way down to the cosmetic things you

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.060 
way down to the cosmetic things you
might<00:00:36.989> want<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.320> do<00:00:37.440> throughout<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.890> year

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
might want to do throughout the year

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.250 
might want to do throughout the year
once<00:00:38.970> you<00:00:39.090> have<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.210> list<00:00:39.660> then<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.110> can

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
once you have that list then you can

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.740 
once you have that list then you can
prioritize<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.340> potentially<00:00:42.030> then<00:00:42.210> not<00:00:42.540> be

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
prioritize and potentially then not be

prioritize and potentially then not be
surprised<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.649> things<00:00:44.130> that<00:00:44.280> might<00:00:44.460> pop<00:00:44.700> up<00:00:44.730> in

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
surprised of things that might pop up in

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.220 
surprised of things that might pop up in
the<00:00:45.149> middle<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.540> year<00:00:45.720> that<00:00:45.899> could<00:00:46.079> really

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the middle of the year that could really

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.430 
the middle of the year that could really
cost<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.770> money<00:00:47.570> water<00:00:48.570> leaks<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.200> one<00:00:49.350> of

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
cost you money water leaks can be one of

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.870 
cost you money water leaks can be one of
the<00:00:49.500> biggest<00:00:49.620> hazards<00:00:50.219> around<00:00:50.489> your<00:00:50.700> house

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
the biggest hazards around your house

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.030 
the biggest hazards around your house
and<00:00:51.090> also<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.809> generally<00:00:52.320> cost<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.829> lot

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
and also just generally cost you a lot

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.369 
and also just generally cost you a lot
of<00:00:53.219> money<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.700> simple<00:00:54.090> leaky<00:00:54.629> faucet<00:00:55.170> could

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
of money a simple leaky faucet could

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.549 
of money a simple leaky faucet could
waste<00:00:55.670> 11,000<00:00:56.670> gallons<00:00:56.700> of<00:00:57.390> water<00:00:57.629> every<00:00:57.960> year

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
waste 11,000 gallons of water every year

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.010 
waste 11,000 gallons of water every year
and<00:00:58.739> if<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.340> just<00:00:59.640> fix<00:01:00.000> those<00:01:00.270> leaks<00:01:00.660> you

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
and if you just fix those leaks you

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.779 
and if you just fix those leaks you
could<00:01:01.170> say<00:01:01.320> ten<00:01:01.590> percent<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.039> your<00:01:02.219> water<00:01:02.430> bill

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
could say ten percent on your water bill

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.579 
could say ten percent on your water bill
so<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.180> really<00:01:03.600> important<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.289> not<00:01:04.530> let

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
so it's really important to not let

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.289 
so it's really important to not let
those<00:01:05.189> go<00:01:05.579> undetected<00:01:08.030> most<00:01:09.030> people<00:01:09.210> don't

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
those go undetected most people don't

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.090 
those go undetected most people don't
even<00:01:09.570> ever<00:01:09.720> think<00:01:10.140> about<00:01:10.229> their<00:01:10.560> water<00:01:10.770> heater

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
even ever think about their water heater

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.950 
even ever think about their water heater
until<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.640> course<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.119> not<00:01:12.180> producing<00:01:12.750> hot

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
until of course it's not producing hot

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.870 
until of course it's not producing hot
water<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:13.920> there<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.250> some<00:01:14.520> regular

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
water but there is some regular

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.370 
water but there is some regular
maintenance<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.630> do<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.110> really

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
maintenance you can do that can really

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.830 
maintenance you can do that can really
extend<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.950> life<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.340> your<00:01:17.400> water<00:01:17.760> heater<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
extend the life of your water heater the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.660 
extend the life of your water heater the
biggest<00:01:19.170> culprit<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.890> failure<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.580> your

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
biggest culprit to failure and your

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.609 
biggest culprit to failure and your
water<00:01:20.880> heater<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.330> sediment<00:01:21.869> building<00:01:22.320> up<00:01:22.439> in

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
water heater is sediment building up in

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.230 
water heater is sediment building up in
the<00:01:22.710> water<00:01:22.860> heater<00:01:23.189> which<00:01:23.369> reduces<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the water heater which reduces the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.450 
the water heater which reduces the
amount<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.540> space<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> tank<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:26.159> what<00:01:26.340> you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
amount of space in the tank so what you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.730 
amount of space in the tank so what you
want<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.700> do<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.030> every<00:01:27.450> three<00:01:27.810> months<00:01:28.260> drain

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
want to do is every three months drain

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.500 
want to do is every three months drain
out<00:01:29.010> of<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> bottom<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.790> water<00:01:30.000> here<00:01:30.299> a

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
out of the bottom of the water here a

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.570 
out of the bottom of the water here a
quart<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.990> water<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.619> that's<00:01:32.189> going<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.460> help

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
quart of water and that's going to help

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.520 
quart of water and that's going to help
get<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.150> sediment<00:01:33.600> work<00:01:33.930> through<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.290> water

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
get that sediment work through the water

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.859 
get that sediment work through the water
heater<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.130> give<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.610> much<00:01:35.939> longer<00:01:36.180> life

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.850 

consumers<00:01:39.869> should<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:40.110> their<00:01:40.290> dryer<00:01:40.560> vent

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
consumers should have their dryer vent

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.950 
consumers should have their dryer vent
inspected<00:01:41.340> once<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.820> year<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.299> have<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.600> clean

inspected once a year and have it clean

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.649 
inspected once a year and have it clean
because<00:01:43.650> it's<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.979> leading<00:01:44.700> cause<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.000> fires<00:01:45.479> in
