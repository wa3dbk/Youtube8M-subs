there's<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.230> lot<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.529> causes<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.010> can<00:00:26.250> be

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
there's a lot of causes that can be

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.540 
there's a lot of causes that can be
doing<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.849> but<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.630> main<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.109> our<00:00:28.289> blog<00:00:29.070> pipes

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
so I've taken out the GR valve as you

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.869 
so I've taken out the GR valve as you
can<00:00:40.710> see<00:00:41.000> here<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:43.340> we're<00:00:44.340> going<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.640> be

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
much more cleaner now we're going to put

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.429 
much more cleaner now we're going to put
this<00:01:13.680> back<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.159> also<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.909> are<00:01:15.240> going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.200> want

this back in also you are going to want

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.370 
this back in also you are going to want
to<00:01:16.530> clean<00:01:16.920> out<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.310> EGR<00:01:17.759> valve<00:01:18.060> pipe<00:01:18.450> since

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
to clean out the EGR valve pipe since

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.020 
to clean out the EGR valve pipe since
it's<00:01:19.590> hard<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.950> take<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.280> off<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.610> spray

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
it's hard to take it off just spray

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.020 
it's hard to take it off just spray
inside<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.630> here's<00:01:25.460> two<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.640> pipes

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
inside is it so here's two of the pipes

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.530 
inside is it so here's two of the pipes
that<00:01:27.990> were<00:01:28.140> connected<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> EGR<00:01:29.280> valve<00:01:29.700> as

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
that were connected to the EGR valve as

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.660 
that were connected to the EGR valve as
you<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:30.930> see<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.860> one<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> things<00:01:32.520> I

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
you can see this is one of the things I

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.350 
you can see this is one of the things I
can<00:01:32.729> trigger<00:01:33.030> your<00:01:33.270> check<00:01:33.450> engine<00:01:33.659> light<00:01:35.360> like

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
can trigger your check engine light like

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.060 
can trigger your check engine light like
he<00:01:36.540> does<00:01:36.960> crack<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.590> up

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
he does crack it up

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.310 
he does crack it up
it's<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:38.820> wear<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.240> tear<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.689> starts<00:01:40.049> going

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
it's just wear and tear it starts going

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.560 
it's just wear and tear it starts going
bad<00:01:40.530> over<00:01:40.890> time<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.729> want<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.210> replace

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
bad over time so you want to replace

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.510 
bad over time so you want to replace
these<00:01:42.869> what's<00:01:43.290> what<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.189> new<00:01:44.340> piping<00:01:46.520> so

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
these what's what the new piping so

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.870 
these what's what the new piping so
after<00:01:48.299> reinstalling<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.170> EGR<00:01:49.710> valve<00:01:50.009> putting

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
after reinstalling the EGR valve putting

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.210 
after reinstalling the EGR valve putting
everything<00:01:51.180> back<00:01:51.540> we're<00:01:52.259> going<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.740> go<00:01:52.890> take

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
everything back we're going to go take

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.359 
everything back we're going to go take
it<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:53.970> us

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
it for us

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.139 
it for us
and<00:01:55.799> let's<00:01:56.799> see<00:01:57.009> if<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.460> check<00:01:57.670> engine<00:01:57.880> light

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
and let's see if the check engine light

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.060 
and let's see if the check engine light
comes<00:01:58.420> back<00:01:58.540> on<00:01:58.960> after<00:01:59.200> it's<00:01:59.530> cleared<00:01:59.920> out

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
comes back on after it's cleared out

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.179 
comes back on after it's cleared out
just<00:02:01.000> by<00:02:01.210> turning<00:02:01.659> on<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.049> car<00:02:02.320> I<00:02:02.350> can<00:02:02.799> notice

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
just by turning on the car I can notice

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.300 
just by turning on the car I can notice
a<00:02:03.340> big<00:02:03.549> difference<00:02:04.060> between<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:05.680> sound<00:02:05.979> I<00:02:06.159> was

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
a big difference between the sound I was

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.190 
a big difference between the sound I was
having<00:02:06.610> before<00:02:06.820> versus<00:02:07.509> what<00:02:07.689> I'm<00:02:07.810> having

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
having before versus what I'm having

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.270 
having before versus what I'm having
right<00:02:08.349> now<00:02:08.410> are<00:02:08.950> every<00:02:09.369> step<00:02:09.849> easier<00:02:10.209> 400<00:02:10.840> code

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
right now are every step easier 400 code

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.880 
right now are every step easier 400 code
it<00:02:12.280> was<00:02:12.430> too<00:02:12.640> cold<00:02:12.910> showing<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:14.500> let's<00:02:14.709> see

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
it was too cold showing so let's see

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
what we get no now I've one code which

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.650 
what we get no now I've one code which
is<00:02:19.660> P<00:02:20.170> Zero<00:02:20.200> 400<00:02:20.830> it's<00:02:21.340> still<00:02:21.550> coming<00:02:21.910> but<00:02:22.060> 2<00:02:22.209> PD

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
is P Zero 400 it's still coming but 2 PD

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.680 
is P Zero 400 it's still coming but 2 PD
so<00:02:23.440> as<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:23.800> can<00:02:23.950> see<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.819> check<00:02:25.120> engine<00:02:25.360> light

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
so as you can see the check engine light

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.990 
so as you can see the check engine light
