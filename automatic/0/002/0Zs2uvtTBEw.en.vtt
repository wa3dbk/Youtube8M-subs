 LEATHER HORSE BRONZE as we have iron, gold and diamond, why not have leather? The color of the wool used will be the color of the bumper. 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:36.260
 HANGER Puts the armor. It does not provide protection, but 9 additional storage places. 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:50.980
 PRIMACY Attracts all beings except masters! Every time a creature gets to the cake, it will take a piece. It goes on until the cake is over and the lure becomes useless. 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:00.780
 SALT Just another nutritional option for a balanced diet. 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:16.020

 HANGING HAND will make you see clearly under water and will give you a little extra oily. 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:46.040
 PLASHILO Will hold away the non-hostile creatures from the area. This can help prevent your arable land from crushing. 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:02:01.220
 SENO BALA The balloon is not my idea personally, but I think it should be done.
