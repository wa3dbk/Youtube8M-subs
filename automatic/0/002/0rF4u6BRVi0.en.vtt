00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.000
 The truck market in Brazil is a 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.290
 great lode for the factories there is no 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.480
 the slightest doubt 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.730
 all eyes with a lot of affection for this 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.270
 so much that when you do not have 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.160
 great news look for alternatives 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.560
 daring to seduce the consumer is the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.680
 that ford launching the version rangers 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.230
 sport ie get the basic model 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.810
 slightly increased the visual put 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.000
 some standard equipment stipulated 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.050
 a price to compete with pickup trucks 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.399
 small 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.079
 Look at the result the revenue per 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.350
 put everything that the Brazilian consumer 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.530
 most want a trio electric vehicle 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.649
 sports wheels 16-inch rim with 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.140
 mixed-use grille for shocks 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.739
 rear-view mirrors painted in the 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.430
 bodywork fog lights 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:01.859
 air-conditioning sound with mp3 and a sticker 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.799
 sport here in the bucket a closed package 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.320
 which certainly many people like but the 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.270
 that this closed package is the sale of 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.000
 ranger sport with all these 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.150
 equipment have more or less 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.580
 it is impossible to put a 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.380
 way of reducing the price but 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.080
 people who are worried about 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.380
 security because in this rangers 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.670
 sports or abs system on the brakes and 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.759
 ibec can be placed an unprecedented engine 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.900
 is the 2-point 3-liter with 16 valves 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.540
 which develops 150 horsepower 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.720
 together with a good touch and 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.950
 almost 1,500 kilograms of the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.470
 empty rangers 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.570
 performance is also good even when 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.880
 She is loaded by talking in charge. 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.920
 takes 760 pounds 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.880
 but be wise, this is the value of 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.909
 gross load 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.240
 that is to include the driver and any 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.310
 company 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.829
 the five-speed gearbox 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.369
 help in good performance 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:09.369
 despite having a bit hard hitch in 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.230
 good course it takes consumption of 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.720
 fuel is not the strong of the ranger 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.970
 sport but taking into account the size 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.450
 of the pickup truck is not even a 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.269
 exaggeration it did 6.7 km per liter of 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.519
 gasoline in our test circuit that 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.739
 half road half town 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.250
 But the greatest sin is that still finds 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:33.489
 have flex engine has passed no time 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.410
 the inner finish is asthma simple 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.110
 generally be considered good. 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.019
 exclusively in the cabin version 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.080
 normal arranges sport has only one seat 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.330
 divided in proportion to one third 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.670
 and two-thirds have pitt that driver 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.100
 independent position and can even 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.680
 take a second passenger in the middle but 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.080
 here between us this is the last thing that 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.190
 you must do not only because it is very 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.739
 uncomfortable 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.200
 look here the backrest is the armrest 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.109
 folded and the legs have to stay 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.049
 side but mainly for safety 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:11.200
 the belt is dominal climbing do not have 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:15.370
 headrest or safety for 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.530
 anyone going here is practically zero space 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.109
 inside the cabin just enough to 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.359
 two adults and the bank 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.130
 the luggage space is only slightly larger 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.900
 than the trunk 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.060
 if you are thinking of traveling and 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.060
 take luggage she'll have to come here 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.560
 the bucket and find a way to cover it or 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.170
 so twist not to rain 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.420
 when talking about comfort when turning the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.459
 thing also complicates a little 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.730
 despite the form and have made some 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.139
 modifications to the rear suspension 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.370
 including a new position of the 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.680
 shock absorbers 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.880
 the result was partial instability 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.910
 mainly 4g did even improved 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.549
 on uneven floors the suspension beads 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.310
 it got harder it jumps a lot when 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.760
 No load transferred everything here to 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.920
 inside the cabin 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.909
 a situation that improves when 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.379
 loaded 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.989
 it should not be forgotten that 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.510
 have applied and as such has been 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.870
 designed to walk primarily with 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.790
 cargo and not only as a touring car 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.500
 on the other hand it has practically no 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.139
 noise inside the cabin 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.970
 even when the last wheel on the pavement 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.400
 rangers sport happens with 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.229
 some small company pickup trucks and 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.000
 makes a great temptation for those who 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.979
 like this type of vehicle 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.340
 but do not forget that it continues with 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:38.410
 consumption and maintenance taxes and insurance 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.410
 what is the average shopping mall 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:46.460
 summarizing the look and performance were 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.500
 the positive points for corn and 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.870
 lack of safety equipment 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.860
 comfort and cabin space were the 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.620
 negative 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.570
 The ranger sport costs 52 thousand three hundred and 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.850
 forty-five reais to see the listing 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.949
 complete all equipment 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:05.949
