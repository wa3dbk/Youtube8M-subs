stiffened up so that's good now and I've

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.880 
stiffened up so that's good now and I've
got<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.000> cab<00:00:30.300> mounted<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.349> frame<00:00:31.619> now

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.340 
got the cab mounted on the frame now
I've<00:00:32.070> got<00:00:32.189> all<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.460> gussets<00:00:32.969> welded<00:00:33.870> into<00:00:34.170> my

I've got all the gussets welded into my

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.420 
I've got all the gussets welded into my
frame<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.820> my<00:00:36.120> crossmember<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:36.930> done<00:00:37.430> and

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
frame and my crossmember is done and

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.290 
frame and my crossmember is done and
that<00:00:39.300> cab<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.989> believe<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.500> sitting<00:00:41.210> think<00:00:42.210> I'm

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
that cab I believe is sitting think I'm

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.729 
that cab I believe is sitting think I'm
going<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.540> drop<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.899> back<00:00:43.110> down<00:00:43.379> just<00:00:43.649> a

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
going to drop the back down just a

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.740 
going to drop the back down just a
little<00:00:44.010> because<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.780> want<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.930> gap<00:00:47.750> between

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
little because I want that gap between

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.439 
little because I want that gap between
that<00:00:49.110> steering<00:00:49.469> box<00:00:49.739> mount<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.879> body

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
that steering box mount and the body

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.010 
that steering box mount and the body
it's<00:00:52.460> that<00:00:53.460> gap<00:00:53.699> closed<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.329> little<00:00:54.570> at<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.719> top

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
it's that gap closed a little at the top

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.340 
it's that gap closed a little at the top
and<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.410> should<00:00:55.649> be<00:00:55.770> even<00:00:56.190> all<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> way<00:00:56.489> down

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
and that should be even all the way down

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.689 
and that should be even all the way down
and<00:00:58.350> then<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.829> think<00:00:59.070> that'll<00:00:59.340> look<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.550> little

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
and then I think that'll look a little

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.780 
and then I think that'll look a little
better<00:00:59.879> there's<00:01:00.629> enough<00:01:00.930> rake<00:01:01.260> too<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.129> cab

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.460 

almost<00:01:05.790> with<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> top<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.900> mean<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.200> top

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
almost with just the top I mean that top

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.620 
almost with just the top I mean that top
tapers<00:01:07.920> down<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.430> nice<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.240> don't<00:01:09.360> need

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
tapers down so nice that you don't need

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.300 
tapers down so nice that you don't need
much<00:01:09.869> rake<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.530> cab<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.040> I'm<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.250> to

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
much rake on that cab so I'm going to

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.500 
much rake on that cab so I'm going to
drop<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.640> back<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:12.000> down<00:01:12.180> there<00:01:12.360> I've<00:01:12.479> got

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
drop it back in down there I've got

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.960 
drop it back in down there I've got
washers<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.229> there<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.650> can<00:01:13.890> take<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.700> couple

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
washers in there so I can take a couple

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.760 
washers in there so I can take a couple
out<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.420> adjust<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.869> down<00:01:16.110> until<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.500> get<00:01:16.560> it

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
out and adjust that down until I get it

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.670 
out and adjust that down until I get it
just<00:01:17.009> ever<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:19.110> got<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.439> rear<00:01:19.650> end

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
just ever so and I got that rear end

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.550 
just ever so and I got that rear end
moved<00:01:20.100> up<00:01:20.430> where<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.880> wanted<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:22.380> took

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
moved up where I wanted it and that took

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.859 
moved up where I wanted it and that took
a<00:01:22.710> day<00:01:22.979> can't<00:01:23.759> believe<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.450> did<00:01:24.659> -

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
a day can't believe it but it did -

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.039 
a day can't believe it but it did -
reaiiy<00:01:25.259> had<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.770> rebuild<00:01:26.220> all<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:27.049> shackle

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
reaiiy had to rebuild all the shackle

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.440 
reaiiy had to rebuild all the shackle
mounts<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.070> pulled<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.460> springs<00:01:29.939> off<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
mounts and I pulled the springs off the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.200 
mounts and I pulled the springs off the
front<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.869> 61<00:01:31.560> Ford<00:01:31.860> pickup<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.490> they

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
front of that 61 Ford pickup and they

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.480 
front of that 61 Ford pickup and they
were<00:01:33.270> shorter<00:01:33.810> than<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.170> original<00:01:34.490> Springs

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
were shorter than the original Springs

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.940 
were shorter than the original Springs
on<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:35.850> truck<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.390> allowed<00:01:36.750> me<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.829> mow

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
on this truck so that allowed me to mow

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.730 
on this truck so that allowed me to mow
the<00:01:38.100> rear<00:01:38.340> end<00:01:38.579> up<00:01:38.790> where<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.270> wanted<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.560> now

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
the rear end up where I wanted it so now

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.249 
the rear end up where I wanted it so now
I'm<00:01:40.920> almost<00:01:41.280> back<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.880> same<00:01:42.150> wheelbase

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
I'm almost back to the same wheelbase

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.740 
I'm almost back to the same wheelbase
that<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.920> was<00:01:44.070> originally<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.540> should

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
that it was originally so it should

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.219 
that it was originally so it should
steer<00:01:46.110> okay<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.070> was<00:01:47.369> afraid<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:48.390> was<00:01:48.540> almost<00:01:48.990> a

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
steer okay I was afraid it was almost a

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.020 
steer okay I was afraid it was almost a
foot<00:01:49.439> longer<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:49.950> was<00:01:50.070> afraid<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.610> thing

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
foot longer and I was afraid the thing

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.600 
foot longer and I was afraid the thing
with<00:01:51.180> plough<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.810> corners<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.380> not<00:01:53.280> steer

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
with plough on the corners and not steer

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.340 
with plough on the corners and not steer
very<00:01:53.640> well<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.299> now<00:01:54.750> I've<00:01:54.960> got<00:01:55.140> my<00:01:55.170> original

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
very well so now I've got my original

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.190 
very well so now I've got my original
wheelbase<00:01:56.159> back<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:57.299> steering<00:01:57.719> angle<00:01:58.020> should

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
wheelbase back the steering angle should

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.609 
wheelbase back the steering angle should
be<00:01:58.409> correct<00:01:59.659> I'm<00:02:00.659> going<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.930> Bob<00:02:01.110> some<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
be correct I'm going to Bob some of the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.399 
be correct I'm going to Bob some of the
back<00:02:01.829> end<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.270> can't<00:02:03.270> our<00:02:03.479> bad<00:02:03.840> off<00:02:04.079> so

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
back end of that can't our bad off so

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.700 
back end of that can't our bad off so
that<00:02:04.439> it's<00:02:04.740> same<00:02:05.130> amount<00:02:05.899> behind<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.049> tire<00:02:07.350> as

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
that it's same amount behind the tire as

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.280 
that it's same amount behind the tire as
it<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.849> front<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.360> tire<00:02:10.099> and

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.429 

then<00:02:13.590> I'll<00:02:13.769> slide<00:02:14.129> that<00:02:14.569> bad<00:02:15.569> forward<00:02:16.080> just<00:02:16.319> a

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
then I'll slide that bad forward just a

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.470 
then I'll slide that bad forward just a
little<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:16.980> close<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.640> gap<00:02:17.849> between<00:02:18.090> the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
little and close that gap between the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.539 
little and close that gap between the
bed<00:02:18.689> and<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.959> cab<00:02:19.829> but<00:02:20.069> I<00:02:20.099> want<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.340> drop<00:02:20.489> that

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
bed and the cab but I want to drop that

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.030 
bed and the cab but I want to drop that
cab<00:02:20.909> down<00:02:21.209> before<00:02:21.689> I<00:02:21.959> do<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:22.829> make<00:02:23.010> sure

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
cab down before I do that so make sure

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.670 
cab down before I do that so make sure
that<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.519> cabs<00:02:23.760> in<00:02:23.939> position<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.840> because<00:02:25.560> I

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
that the cabs in position and because I

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.819 
that the cabs in position and because I
can<00:02:25.829> set<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.010> bed<00:02:26.340> anywhere<00:02:27.290> okay<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.560> think

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
can set that bed anywhere okay I think

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.720 
can set that bed anywhere okay I think
that's<00:02:29.159> about<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:29.940> have<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:31.549> steering<00:02:32.549> wheel

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
and I have I built a crossmember under

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.390 
and I have I built a crossmember under
this<00:02:39.030> tranny<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:40.470> support<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.010> back<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.370> that

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
this tranny to support the back of that

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.000 
this tranny to support the back of that
t5<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.480> built<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:42.959> crossmember<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:43.829> that

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
t5 and I built that crossmember so that

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.960 
t5 and I built that crossmember so that
I<00:02:44.069> can<00:02:44.280> take<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.579> out<00:02:44.989> because<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.560> want<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.159> be

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
I can take it out because I want to be

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.809 
I can take it out because I want to be
able<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.269> drop<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.950> tranny<00:02:49.950> from<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.370> bottom

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
able to drop that tranny from the bottom

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.360 
able to drop that tranny from the bottom
if<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.299> ever<00:02:51.420> want<00:02:52.049> to<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:54.180> that's<00:02:54.389> the<00:02:54.599> only

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
if I ever want to and so that's the only

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.039 
if I ever want to and so that's the only
crossmember<00:02:56.370> that's<00:02:56.579> not<00:02:56.790> welded<00:02:57.359> in<00:02:57.599> it's

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
crossmember that's not welded in it's

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.589 
crossmember that's not welded in it's
bolted<00:02:58.409> in<00:02:58.739> so<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.040> can<00:02:59.340> take<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.209> out<00:03:00.829> anyway<00:03:01.829> I
