00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.210
 morocco today 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.210
 a nice selection in the national team the panthers of Gabon 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.119
 this time we came across algeria 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.489
 according to ginette through their South African world cup 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:31.719
 already it's early season can we read exactly I think 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:33.360
 only after one day 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.390
 to receive all 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.430
 so for me personally I go out to milan 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.310
 I started training 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.310
 according to him who left in 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.140
 in milanello 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.380
 with a preparer 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.380
 Hebron Landes 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.640
 for the match against Algeria 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.460
 facal youth a big team made the world cup 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.480
 for the first time 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.810
 a big african team 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.810
 it's a one-way match 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.620
 we give the maximum 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.800
 launched bamba it's a post I got 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.950
 I already played 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.940
 because when I first arrived 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.140
 hannezo million in his debut play like that 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.979
 but my dad always told me about vestiges like that did he support any 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:22.910
 it 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.240
 for me to see I see that it takes it is true that I scored 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.040
 goals with the balance sheet all senses 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.810
 but hey my father was right 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.420
 he had spoken with the coach he had said that I was happy that 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.330
 the defensive midfielder 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.110
 i loved you bo3 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.020
 for me I listened to his job with the coach 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.940
 friends like that 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.940
 I like this statement I prefer to play like that now 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.370
 I am ready to assume that 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.370
 stay in Corsica then improve myself and then with a little experience 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.290
 the more I'm going to work more 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.480
 we feel good 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.480
 sari friendly matches so different that the mathieu 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.509
 but hey we know that 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.679
 we have a goal 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:14.789
 because a big table because we play at home we do not have the right to 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.319
 to see the Gabonese audience 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.009
 we can give the maximum we have always done 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.009
 at night and even more because we can not only have friendly matches 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.599
 it is more difficult 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.599
 we can do more 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:32.729
 from what I saw 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:33.869
 we meet 

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:35.549
 we have a good team 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.549
 it was summer by month 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.849
 we are afraid of fanatics against the race 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.849
 but the group was 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.599
 did you do that to try 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.819
 however to have the profit today 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.819
 we go there to finally win the deep voice tourism 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.579
 reuters syros 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:08.589
 so that's a variant 

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:11.589
 at home it's called closer 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:15.899
 he is anyway she in front of the camera 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:18.129
 and that's not true 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.129
 it's the broker at the south stream 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.389
 play at that position 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:36.409
 tool for many 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:37.139
 What is it about
