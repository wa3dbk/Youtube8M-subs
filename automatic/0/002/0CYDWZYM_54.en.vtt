00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.430
 the production does not stop in warm wafer 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.189
 coming out of the oven at all times the smell is 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.349
 and it is no exaggeration to say that he 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.899
 was one of the determining factors for the 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.200
 success of the biscuit industry 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:32.360
 bacterium 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.280
 the experience of the Vilma and Alexandre couple 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.500
 with business was not good 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.629
 20 years ago they set up a bakery in the 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.879
 land of the family home in sÃ£o bento 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.329
 of a wild Pernambuco 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.670
 this transition was very important 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.670
 In the beginning, we consulted the 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:54.290
 sebrae and they informed us that the 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:57.800
 bakery and it would not work, but ours is 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.989
 the anxiety of our desire to have our 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.610
 own business meant that we did not 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.610
 hear if this advice matters 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.520
 observed gave us in four years 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.770
 we started to have a new idea I 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.210
 I got the flour seller and only I 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.310
 I do not want to spend this month. 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.259
 I'm going to rent a bakery and he insisted 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.420
 very bring a technician and whose 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.479
 technician arrived there he asked if the 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.490
 We had to make a cookie. 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.890
 I'm 21 years old and stayed but did not give much 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.990
 certain not to them that gives me the prescription 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.640
 it will increase this revenue and 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.409
 When did Sabu start? Find a blacksmith. 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.810
 use it all the way through the bakery and even 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.520
 on the street or arrival of the parents in xerÃ©m is 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.540
 This smell is not the ball that 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.850
 is doing here 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.890
 Then he got himself put in a 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.670
 container was to put out the fire started from 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.409
