00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
you're mixing a protein powder in water

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.170 
you're mixing a protein powder in water
and<00:01:34.680> you're<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> consume<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.640> every<00:01:35.970> 2

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
all day long okay what that does is feed

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.399 
all day long okay what that does is feed
the<00:01:39.000> muscles<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.840> you're<00:01:39.990> not<00:01:40.079> going<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.320> be

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
the muscles so you're not going to be

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.109 
the muscles so you're not going to be
drained<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.040> fatigue<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.939> actually

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
drained and fatigue and it actually

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.420 
drained and fatigue and it actually
lowers<00:01:42.659> what's<00:01:43.079> called<00:01:43.320> glycogen<00:01:43.619> levels<00:01:43.950> in

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
lowers what's called glycogen levels in

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.340 
lowers what's called glycogen levels in
the<00:01:44.520> body<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:45.270> actually<00:01:45.329> forces<00:01:46.110> your<00:01:46.229> body

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
the body that actually forces your body

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.590 
the body that actually forces your body
into<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.680> fat<00:01:46.920> burning<00:01:46.979> mode<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.759> day<00:01:48.030> okay

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
into a fat burning mode that day okay

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.149 
into a fat burning mode that day okay
this<00:01:48.899> sets<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> stage<00:01:49.560> for<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.950> fruit

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
this sets the stage for the fruit

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.320 
this sets the stage for the fruit
flushing<00:01:50.610> which<00:01:50.790> starts<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.360> day<00:01:51.420> two

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
flushing which starts on day two

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.120 
flushing which starts on day two
okay<00:01:52.510> so<00:01:52.780> Dave<00:01:53.020> day<00:01:53.320> two<00:01:53.380> is<00:01:53.680> when<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:53.920> crew

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
okay so Dave day two is when the crew

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.040 
okay so Dave day two is when the crew
takes<00:01:54.340> in<00:01:54.580> that<00:01:54.610> route<00:01:55.060> kick<00:01:55.300> then<00:01:55.540> every<00:01:55.900> two

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
takes in that route kick then every two

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.500

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
but I mean this if this would make it

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.880 
but I mean this if this would make it
that<00:03:25.690> much<00:03:25.720> easier<00:03:25.900> I<00:03:26.320> would<00:03:26.530> think<00:03:26.680> if

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
that much easier I would think if

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.380 
that much easier I would think if
somebody<00:03:26.920> is<00:03:27.310> really<00:03:27.430> serious<00:03:27.940> about<00:03:28.060> weight

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
loss to carry you know the good habits

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.330 
loss to carry you know the good habits
beyond<00:03:31.840> that<00:03:31.959> three-day<00:03:32.440> time<00:03:32.680> span<00:03:33.040> yeah

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
beyond that three-day time span yeah

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.910

in<00:03:36.489> three<00:03:36.880> days<00:03:37.060> how<00:03:37.300> good<00:03:37.570> they<00:03:37.690> can<00:03:37.840> feel<00:03:38.110> and

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
in three days how good they can feel and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.460 
in three days how good they can feel and
fantastic<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:40.180> is<00:03:40.330> and<00:03:40.570> how<00:03:40.600> simple<00:03:41.170> it<00:03:41.290> is<00:03:41.410> to
