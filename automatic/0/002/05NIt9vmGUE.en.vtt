on market for the gases 3 and I might

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.189 
on market for the gases 3 and I might
check<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.609> out<00:00:29.760> but<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:30.929> quick<00:00:31.080> little

video here I only do have these two
devices<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.989> one's<00:00:34.200> having<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.530> newer

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
devices so this one's having a newer

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.380 
devices so this one's having a newer
version<00:00:34.890> here<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.370> referring<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.969> jelly<00:00:36.210> bean

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
version here and referring to jelly bean

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.530 
version here and referring to jelly bean
actually<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.370> pretty<00:00:38.370> fresh<00:00:38.640> pretty<00:00:38.940> cool

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
actually so pretty fresh pretty cool

actually so pretty fresh pretty cool
pretty<00:00:39.870> awesome<00:00:41.390> but<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.480> course<00:00:42.719> they<00:00:42.899> don't

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
pretty awesome but of course they don't

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.040 
pretty awesome but of course they don't
have<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.430> dual<00:00:44.430> core<00:00:44.670> processor<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.390> find<00:00:45.899> me<00:00:46.020> a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
have a dual core processor and find me a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.610 
have a dual core processor and find me a
physical<00:00:46.260> camera<00:00:46.910> but<00:00:47.910> how<00:00:48.780> are<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.050> stacking

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
physical camera but how are you stacking

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.229 
physical camera but how are you stacking
up<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:50.100> terms<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.399> speed<00:00:52.550> let's<00:00:53.550> check<00:00:54.090> that

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
up in terms of speed let's check that

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:06.030 
up in terms of speed let's check that
out<00:00:54.300> by<00:00:55.230> doing<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.620> restart<00:00:55.980> here

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.530 

as<00:01:07.040> you<00:01:07.220> see<00:01:07.369> there<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:07.670> galaxy<00:01:08.030> core<00:01:08.210> plus<00:01:08.360> is

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
as you see there the galaxy core plus is

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.440 
as you see there the galaxy core plus is
actually<00:01:08.810> starting<00:01:09.290> first<00:01:09.649> here<00:01:10.299> which<00:01:11.299> is

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
actually starting first here which is

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.840 
actually starting first here which is
pretty<00:01:11.630> cool<00:01:11.890> it's<00:01:12.890> pretty<00:01:12.979> intense<00:01:13.460> actually

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
pretty cool it's pretty intense actually

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:21.130 
pretty cool it's pretty intense actually
I<00:01:14.409> think<00:01:15.409> that's<00:01:15.530> pretty<00:01:15.710> awesome<00:01:19.600> but<00:01:20.600> who<00:01:20.960> is

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
I think that's pretty awesome but who is

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.740 
I think that's pretty awesome but who is
going<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.470> load<00:01:21.649> up<00:01:21.680> here<00:01:22.009> quicker<00:01:22.689> felt<00:01:23.689> the

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
going to load up here quicker felt the

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.029 
going to load up here quicker felt the
vibration<00:01:24.170> here<00:01:24.289> first<00:01:24.560> in<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:24.890> gas

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
vibration here first in the gas

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.529 
vibration here first in the gas
according<00:01:25.490> them<00:01:25.640> instantly<00:01:26.179> here<00:01:26.420> in<00:01:26.479> the

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
according them instantly here in the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:27.999 
according them instantly here in the
gases<00:01:26.899> there<00:01:27.140> is<00:01:27.229> I<00:01:27.350> think<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.649> galaxy<00:01:27.890> s3

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
gases there is I think the galaxy s3

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.570 
gases there is I think the galaxy s3
it's<00:01:28.429> going<00:01:28.580> to<00:01:28.640> win<00:01:28.759> oh<00:01:28.939> my<00:01:29.720> god<00:01:30.250> that<00:01:31.250> is<00:01:31.369> so

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
it's going to win oh my god that is so

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.850 
it's going to win oh my god that is so
cool<00:01:31.850> they're<00:01:32.659> so<00:01:32.869> cool<00:01:33.080> that<00:01:33.320> they<00:01:33.439> start<00:01:33.740> up

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
cool they're so cool that they start up

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.270 
cool they're so cool that they start up
at<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.220> same<00:01:34.549> time<00:01:34.580> I<00:01:35.409> mean<00:01:36.409> you<00:01:36.590> might<00:01:36.830> think

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
at the same time I mean you might think

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.029 
at the same time I mean you might think
that<00:01:37.340> oh<00:01:37.929> well<00:01:38.929> of<00:01:39.080> course<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.440> algae's<00:01:39.799> 3

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
that oh well of course the algae's 3

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.609 
that oh well of course the algae's 3
must<00:01:40.250> be<00:01:40.310> quicker<00:01:40.640> here<00:01:40.789> but<00:01:41.000> now<00:01:41.590> when<00:01:42.590> I

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
must be quicker here but now when I

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.260 
must be quicker here but now when I
start<00:01:42.950> them<00:01:43.039> up<00:01:43.100> here<00:01:43.399> you<00:01:43.789> can<00:01:43.940> see<00:01:44.119> that

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
start them up here you can see that

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.090 
start them up here you can see that
they're<00:01:44.450> running<00:01:44.709> exactly<00:01:45.709> there<00:01:45.860> at<00:01:45.979> the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
they're running exactly there at the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.740 
they're running exactly there at the
same<00:01:46.280> time<00:01:46.750> pretty<00:01:47.750> impressive<00:01:48.080> stuff<00:01:48.729> and

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
same time pretty impressive stuff and

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.210 
same time pretty impressive stuff and
then<00:01:50.750> of<00:01:50.869> course<00:01:50.899> I<00:01:51.200> think<00:01:51.259> that<00:01:51.409> if<00:01:51.709> you're<00:01:52.100> on

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
then of course I think that if you're on

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.980 
then of course I think that if you're on
a<00:01:52.250> body<00:01:52.520> galaxy<00:01:53.000> s3<00:01:53.299> now<00:01:53.479> it's<00:01:53.659> going<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:53.840> be<00:01:53.959> a

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
a body galaxy s3 now it's going to be a

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.230 
a body galaxy s3 now it's going to be a
little<00:01:54.229> bit<00:01:54.319> more<00:01:54.470> expensive<00:01:54.860> than<00:01:55.520> this<00:01:56.030> one

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
little bit more expensive than this one

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.730 
little bit more expensive than this one
I<00:01:56.270> mean<00:01:56.509> you<00:01:56.569> can<00:01:56.840> get<00:01:56.959> some<00:01:57.110> special<00:01:57.530> deals

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
I mean you can get some special deals

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.690 
I mean you can get some special deals
right<00:01:58.100> now<00:01:58.280> on<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.780> the<00:02:00.170> galaxy<00:02:00.649> core<00:02:00.830> plus<00:02:01.159> I

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
right now on the the galaxy core plus I

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.600 
right now on the the galaxy core plus I
will<00:02:02.299> check<00:02:02.509> out<00:02:02.600> tomorrow<00:02:02.959> and<00:02:03.490> devices<00:02:04.490> as
