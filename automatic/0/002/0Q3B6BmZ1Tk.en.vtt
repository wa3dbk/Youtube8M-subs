however<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.800> oddity<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.310> wanted<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.790> point<00:03:11.940> out

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
however the oddity I wanted to point out

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.610 
however the oddity I wanted to point out
is<00:03:13.910> on<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.150> blade<00:03:15.420> right<00:03:15.450> here<00:03:15.720> at<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.200> bottom

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
is on the blade right here at the bottom

is on the blade right here at the bottom
it's<00:03:17.010> stamped<00:03:17.520> Magnum<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.990> it's<00:03:19.140> as<00:03:19.230> Baker

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440

stamped<00:03:23.580> on<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.820> blade<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:24.420> that's<00:03:25.410> kind<00:03:26.160> of

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
stamped on the blade so that's kind of

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.720 
stamped on the blade so that's kind of
bizarre<00:03:27.110> I<00:03:28.110> would<00:03:28.680> say<00:03:28.860> it<00:03:28.980> is<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.130> poker<00:03:29.459> plus<00:03:29.700> a

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
that's the brand I'm thinking of the way

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.879 
that's the brand I'm thinking of the way
it<00:05:22.100> looks<00:05:22.600> I've<00:05:23.600> never<00:05:23.840> owned<00:05:24.020> a<00:05:24.110> Spyderco<00:05:24.620> yet

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
it looks I've never owned a Spyderco yet

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.830 
it looks I've never owned a Spyderco yet
so<00:05:25.220> because<00:05:25.490> I'm<00:05:25.639> pretty<00:05:25.880> new<00:05:26.060> to<00:05:26.090> knives<00:05:26.419> so

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
so because I'm pretty new to knives so

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.320 
so because I'm pretty new to knives so
I'm<00:05:27.800> still<00:05:28.100> focused<00:05:28.250> on<00:05:28.580> the<00:05:28.699> bokor<00:05:29.030> line<00:05:29.180> I'm

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
going to kind of move from one line to

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.870 
going to kind of move from one line to
another<00:05:30.950> and<00:05:31.490> get<00:05:32.479> the<00:05:32.599> knives<00:05:32.750> I<00:05:32.990> like<00:05:33.880> kind
