00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
if that's a good thing or not but a lot

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.159 
if that's a good thing or not but a lot
of<00:04:37.940> people<00:04:38.180> are<00:04:38.240> talking<00:04:38.300> about<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:38.780> Sixers

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
of people are talking about the Sixers

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.680 
of people are talking about the Sixers
being<00:04:39.410> the<00:04:39.470> worst<00:04:39.620> team<00:04:39.889> now<00:04:40.100> we'll<00:04:41.060> see<00:04:41.300> I'm

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
being the worst team now we'll see I'm

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.659 
being the worst team now we'll see I'm
not<00:04:42.080> really<00:04:42.230> sure<00:04:42.380> I<00:04:42.620> think<00:04:42.980> Brett<00:04:43.190> Browns<00:04:43.460> got

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
not really sure I think Brett Browns got

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.940 
not really sure I think Brett Browns got
it<00:04:43.790> got<00:04:44.000> them<00:04:44.150> doing<00:04:44.270> a<00:04:44.419> good<00:04:44.540> job<00:04:44.600> a<00:04:45.050> lot<00:04:45.800> of

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
it got them doing a good job a lot of

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.379 
it got them doing a good job a lot of
teams<00:04:46.160> that<00:04:46.220> were<00:04:46.400> thought<00:04:46.639> to<00:04:46.700> be<00:04:46.880> tanking

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
teams that were thought to be tanking

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.330 
teams that were thought to be tanking
are<00:04:47.570> not<00:04:47.840> really<00:04:48.200> doing<00:04:48.380> that<00:04:48.530> so<00:04:48.980> there's

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
are not really doing that so there's

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.920 
are not really doing that so there's
some<00:04:49.580> more<00:04:49.669> contract<00:04:50.210> stuff<00:04:50.419> that's

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
some more contract stuff that's

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.900 
some more contract stuff that's
definitely<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.620> theme<00:04:51.860> of<00:04:51.889> this<00:04:52.160> video<00:04:52.550> was

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
definitely the theme of this video was

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.570 
definitely the theme of this video was
be<00:04:53.480> smart<00:04:53.780> with<00:04:53.870> your<00:04:53.930> contracts<00:04:54.650> so<00:04:54.980> that's

be smart with your contracts so that's
definitely<00:04:55.880> something<00:04:56.240> you<00:04:56.419> got<00:04:56.630> to<00:04:56.660> consider

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
definitely something you got to consider

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.780 
definitely something you got to consider
