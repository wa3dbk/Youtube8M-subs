00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
liquid fish oil which was by far the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.180 
liquid fish oil which was by far the

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
hardest thing to ever take and after a

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.940 
hardest thing to ever take and after a
few<00:03:43.280> bottles<00:03:43.670> of<00:03:43.910> that<00:03:44.500> we<00:03:45.500> just<00:03:45.710> had<00:03:45.830> to

few bottles of that we just had to

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.090 
few bottles of that we just had to
switch<00:03:46.160> over<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.520> fish<00:03:46.760> oil<00:03:47.060> pills<00:03:47.300> and<00:03:48.230> we're
