00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.000
 visit the mill was 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.760
 a 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.860
 but pleasant surprise because I could not 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.860
 imagine such attention 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.610
 and delicacy within the whole 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.610
 Working process 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:41.180
 which turned out to be almost in terms 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:43.800
 pictorial and perhaps even sculptural to see 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.840
 mix all these balls of 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.610
 different colors to get a single one 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.490
 final gray 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.270
 it seemed like a 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:56.270
 a process so close to the way in which 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.940
 I put together lands of different colors 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.850
 shapes of different colors than later in 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.560
 cooking with a minimum variation of 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.910
 temperature can also take 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.910
 different colors 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.770
 a birth never from a predetermined idea of 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.160
 forms but after a while the hands themselves 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.320
 the fingers that find solutions every 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.390
 single piece for me the autonomy of 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.950
 a sculpture made and finished despite 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.700
 the small dimensions 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.820
 all these pieces then stuffed together 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:34.750
 go to compose wires that installed 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.270
 they occupy a space and an environment 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.369
 become a kind of drawing of 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:45.940
 sculptural design this installation 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.399
 this place made me think 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.009
 to the way the wools probably 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:55.000
 they were laid out to dry and how 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:58.590
 probably still happens today in one 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.590
 establishment like the one of trivero 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.270
 there is often a relationship in my works 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.700
 with the landscape that is landscape 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:14.000
 recounted depicted I picked up in 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.270
 terms of material I find 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.380
 available in this case 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:24.460
 I feel like saying that the landscape 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.670
 appears in a more meditative dimension 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:31.520
 almost tied to the passage of time 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.130
 of natural time that becomes one 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.440
 duration when these jobs began I have 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:42.880
 in front of me days and days days 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.210
 very methodical weeks of work a lot 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.520
 repetitive even when I have the feeling 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:53.180
 that my progress goes hand in hand 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.940
 as time goes by it becomes 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.970
 natural time that becomes alternation of 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:03.680
 day and night of seasons and cycles 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.590
 that the landscape does not repeat therefore 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.510
 it is so much a citation of the many 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:13.340
 natural forms that also appear 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.160
 represented by the small elements in 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.800
 terracotta but more a way of perceiving 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.950
 the environment around and the passing of 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.950
 time
