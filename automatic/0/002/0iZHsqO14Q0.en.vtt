so<00:00:31.710> here<00:00:31.949> are<00:00:32.129> youtube<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> night

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
so here are youtube this is a night

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.170 
so here are youtube this is a night
video<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:34.920> could<00:00:35.010> check<00:00:35.219> out<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.579> LEDs<00:00:36.149> a

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
video so you could check out the LEDs a

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.939 
video so you could check out the LEDs a
little<00:00:36.449> bit<00:00:36.540> better<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.590> 2012<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.579> Iran

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
little bit better on the 2012 of Iran

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.840 
little bit better on the 2012 of Iran
drop<00:00:40.949> this<00:00:41.129> puppy<00:00:43.340> resistors<00:00:44.340> are<00:00:44.519> in<00:00:44.640> there

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
drop this puppy resistors are in there

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.040 
drop this puppy resistors are in there
you'll<00:00:45.360> see<00:00:45.540> that<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.870> description

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
you'll see that in the description

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.299 
you'll see that in the description
another<00:00:46.860> additional<00:00:47.339> picture<00:00:49.250> all<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
another additional picture all the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.149 
another additional picture all the
lights<00:00:50.519> are<00:00:50.640> fine<00:00:51.680> blinkers<00:00:52.680> are<00:00:52.829> not<00:00:52.980> on

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
lights are fine blinkers are not on

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.270 
lights are fine blinkers are not on
obviously<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:54.000> eliminated<00:00:54.540> that<00:00:54.570> wire<00:00:55.280> so

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
obviously we eliminated that wire so

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.530 
obviously we eliminated that wire so
this<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.790> how<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.079> LED<00:00:58.339> looks<00:00:59.339> on<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.269> rear

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
this is how the LED looks on the rear

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.210 
this is how the LED looks on the rear
license<00:01:01.019> plate<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:03.920> think<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:04.979> should<00:01:05.129> be

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
license plate I think it should be

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.300 
license plate I think it should be
enough<00:01:05.489> light<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:06.299> keep<00:01:08.270> you-know-who<00:01:09.270> away

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
enough light to keep you-know-who away

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.749 
enough light to keep you-know-who away
so<00:01:11.310> let's<00:01:11.549> turn<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.210> blinkers<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:13.759> this

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
so let's turn on the blinkers and this

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.539 
so let's turn on the blinkers and this
is<00:01:14.909> very<00:01:15.090> important<00:01:15.570> because<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.930> resistors

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
is very important because the resistors

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.630 
is very important because the resistors
eliminate<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:18.770> security<00:01:19.770> light<00:01:19.950> going<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.400> on

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
eliminate the security light going on on

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.539 
eliminate the security light going on on
the<00:01:21.090> cluster<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.780> couldn't<00:01:22.680> stand<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.340> had

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
the cluster I couldn't stand it so I had

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.399 
the cluster I couldn't stand it so I had
to<00:01:23.640> get<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.909> problem<00:01:24.180> resolved<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.170> let's

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
to get that problem resolved so let's

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.069 
to get that problem resolved so let's
put<00:01:25.829> on<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.189> left<00:01:26.430> linker<00:01:26.970> as<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:28.020> see<00:01:28.340> no

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
put on the left linker as you can see no

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:41.169 
put on the left linker as you can see no
security<00:01:31.079> light<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.869> these<00:01:34.829> are<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> LEDs

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.349 

still<00:01:42.179> visible<00:01:42.749> even<00:01:43.049> though<00:01:43.700> I'm<00:01:44.700> ount<00:01:45.090> it

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359 
still visible even though I'm ount it

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:49.040 
still visible even though I'm ount it
the<00:01:46.219> light

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
the light

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.580 
the light
mirror<00:01:49.590> on<00:01:49.950> it

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.779 

let's<00:01:55.590> take<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> look<00:01:56.280> at<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> rear<00:01:58.549> yeah

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
let's take a look at the rear yeah

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:12.630 
let's take a look at the rear yeah
pretty<00:02:00.090> bright<00:02:00.299> yourself

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:23.030 

and<00:02:13.890> put<00:02:14.890> both<00:02:15.490> on

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.410 

so<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.190> hazards<00:02:24.610> worked<00:02:24.820> perfectly<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:27.420> once

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
so the hazards worked perfectly and once

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.730 
so the hazards worked perfectly and once
again<00:02:28.690> these<00:02:28.870> are<00:02:29.610> low-cost<00:02:30.610> mods<00:02:31.740> literally

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
again these are low-cost mods literally

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.530 
again these are low-cost mods literally
only<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.190> couple<00:02:33.490> bucks<00:02:35.160> looks<00:02:36.160> great<00:02:36.540> gutting

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
only a couple bucks looks great gutting
