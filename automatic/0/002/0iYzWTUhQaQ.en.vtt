00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.150 
the weakness to get my life back but
that<00:01:00.660> gave<00:01:00.840> me<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.020> purpose<00:01:01.559> they<00:01:01.770> gave<00:01:01.949> me<00:01:02.100> a

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
that gave me a purpose they gave me a

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.310 
that gave me a purpose they gave me a
goal<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.640> shoot<00:01:02.670> for<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.359> knew<00:01:03.750> if<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.260> could

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
goal to shoot for I knew if I could

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.080 
goal to shoot for I knew if I could
achieve<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.820> would<00:01:05.850> have

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
achieve that then I would have

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.600 
achieve that then I would have
everything<00:01:06.390> back<00:01:06.830> so<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.890> came<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:08.189> with<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.369> four

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
everything back so I came up with a four

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.570 
everything back so I came up with a four
step<00:01:08.820> formula<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.689> be<00:01:09.810> able<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.200> there

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
step formula to be able to get there

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:40.389 
step formula to be able to get there
first<00:01:12.650> get<00:01:13.650> my<00:01:13.770> rock<00:01:13.979> climbing<00:01:14.400> strength<00:01:14.670> back

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.069 

the<00:01:41.399> second<00:01:41.820> step<00:01:42.000> was<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.450> get<00:01:42.600> my<00:01:42.630> balance

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
the second step was to get my balance

00:01:43.079 --> 00:02:04.240 
the second step was to get my balance
and<00:01:43.200> agility<00:01:43.320> back

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.860 

the<00:02:05.250> third<00:02:05.460> step<00:02:05.729> was<00:02:05.970> to<00:02:06.060> build<00:02:06.300> and<00:02:06.510> train<00:02:06.630> on

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
the third step was to build and train on

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.389 
the third step was to build and train on
obstacles<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.530> had<00:02:07.680> simply<00:02:08.009> never<00:02:08.160> done

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
obstacles that had simply never done

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:36.520 
obstacles that had simply never done
before

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.819 

and<00:02:37.530> finally<00:02:38.220> climb<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.209> rope<00:02:39.569> like<00:02:40.409> it<00:02:40.560> was<00:02:40.680> on

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
and finally climb a rope like it was on

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:50.530 
and finally climb a rope like it was on
fire<00:02:40.860> below<00:02:41.519> me

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.869 

if<00:02:51.540> given<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.019> chance<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.590> will<00:02:52.709> be<00:02:53.189> the<00:02:53.519> first

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
if given the chance I will be the first

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.319 
if given the chance I will be the first
American<00:02:55.129> Ninja<00:02:56.129> would<00:02:56.430> or<00:02:56.670> not<00:02:56.700> be<00:02:57.120> the

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
American Ninja would or not be the

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.799 
American Ninja would or not be the
second<00:02:57.719> American<00:02:58.109> Ninja<00:02:58.769> Warrior
