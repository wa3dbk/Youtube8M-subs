00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
I use this rig for smaller lights of

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.470 
I use this rig for smaller lights of
course<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:36.100> really<00:00:36.280> can<00:00:36.460> actually<00:00:36.820> hold<00:00:36.970> 300

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
course it's really can actually hold 300

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.069 
course it's really can actually hold 300
pounds<00:00:38.340> distributed<00:00:39.340> evenly<00:00:40.059> as<00:00:40.600> you<00:00:40.630> can<00:00:40.840> see

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
pounds distributed evenly as you can see

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.170 
pounds distributed evenly as you can see
here<00:00:41.350> you<00:00:42.160> don't<00:00:42.250> want<00:00:42.430> to<00:00:42.489> ever<00:00:42.670> overload

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
here you don't want to ever overload

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.900 
here you don't want to ever overload
your<00:00:43.329> trust<00:00:43.660> don't<00:00:44.649> recommend<00:00:45.129> it<00:00:45.219> because

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
your trust don't recommend it because

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.580 
your trust don't recommend it because
then<00:00:46.090> you<00:00:46.329> can<00:00:46.450> hurt<00:00:46.719> yourself<00:00:46.870> kill<00:00:47.379> somebody

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590

lights<00:00:57.490> will<00:00:58.000> not<00:00:58.180> be<00:00:58.300> using<00:00:58.630> this<00:00:58.720> rig<00:00:58.960> right

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
lights will not be using this rig right

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.229 
lights will not be using this rig right
here<00:00:59.200> because<00:01:00.480> too<00:01:01.739> cluttered<00:01:02.739> I<00:01:03.040> was<00:01:03.730> using

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
here because too cluttered I was using

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.210 
here because too cluttered I was using
them<00:01:04.540> and<00:01:04.869> my<00:01:05.729> den<00:01:06.729> here<00:01:07.000> for<00:01:08.220> programming

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
them and my den here for programming

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.179 
them and my den here for programming
purposes<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:11.320> I<00:01:11.350> have<00:01:11.560> to<00:01:11.680> do<00:01:11.799> with<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.040> big

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
purposes so I have to do with the big

purposes so I have to do with the big
global<00:01:12.460> trust<00:01:12.759> stuff<00:01:13.060> that's<00:01:13.299> out<00:01:13.540> in<00:01:13.689> the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
global trust stuff that's out in the

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.920 
global trust stuff that's out in the
garage<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:15.280> their<00:01:15.700> storage<00:01:15.970> but<00:01:16.630> anyway

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
garage and their storage but anyway

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.350 
garage and their storage but anyway
we're<00:01:17.229> walking<00:01:17.530> up<00:01:17.649> close<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:17.979> here<00:01:18.280> as<00:01:19.180> you

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
we're walking up close to here as you

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.179 
we're walking up close to here as you
can<00:01:19.479> see<00:01:19.630> we<00:01:19.780> have<00:01:19.990> a<00:01:21.119> cable<00:01:22.119> I<00:01:22.679> say<00:01:23.679> to<00:01:23.740> chain

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
can see we have a cable I say to chain

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:30.239 
can see we have a cable I say to chain
is<00:01:25.179> what<00:01:25.359> it's<00:01:25.509> no<00:01:25.859> safety<00:01:26.859> cable<00:01:29.009> some<00:01:30.009> people

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:30.249 
is what it's no safety cable some people

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:31.230 
is what it's no safety cable some people
call<00:01:30.369> say<00:01:30.579> the<00:01:30.670> change

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
call say the change

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.999 
call say the change
I'll<00:01:31.659> call<00:01:31.869> save<00:01:32.079> the<00:01:32.200> cable<00:01:32.530> so<00:01:32.709> that's<00:01:32.859> what

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
I'll call save the cable so that's what

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.940 
I'll call save the cable so that's what
it<00:01:33.100> is<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.520> cable<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:35.200> can<00:01:35.229> pick<00:01:35.439> these<00:01:35.560> up<00:01:35.619> on

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
it is the cable you can pick these up on

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.029 
it is the cable you can pick these up on
the<00:01:36.009> internet<00:01:37.109> or<00:01:38.109> you<00:01:38.350> can<00:01:38.530> simply<00:01:38.740> make

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
the internet or you can simply make

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.459 
the internet or you can simply make
these<00:01:39.280> yourself<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:42.189> I<00:01:42.219> do<00:01:42.359> recommend

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
these yourself but I do recommend

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.469 
these yourself but I do recommend
running<00:01:44.469> this<00:01:44.770> because<00:01:45.700> you<00:01:45.909> never<00:01:46.119> want<00:01:46.389> to

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
running this because you never want to

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.309 
running this because you never want to
depend<00:01:47.109> on<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.229> any<00:01:48.069> type<00:01:48.249> of<00:01:48.279> clamps<00:01:49.049> I'm<00:01:50.049> gonna

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
depend on a any type of clamps I'm gonna

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.099 
depend on a any type of clamps I'm gonna
write<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.590> on<00:01:50.770> Park<00:01:51.069> hands<00:01:51.369> as<00:01:51.579> well<00:01:52.109> it's

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.109 
write it on Park hands as well it's

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.849 
write it on Park hands as well it's
really<00:01:53.170> important<00:01:53.799> that<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:55.240> safe<00:01:55.649> it's<00:01:56.649> that

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
really important that be safe it's that

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.429 
really important that be safe it's that

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
way if you're at a school dance wedding

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.459 
way if you're at a school dance wedding
or<00:01:59.679> any<00:01:59.889> type<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:00.159> event<00:02:01.109> nobody<00:02:02.109> won't<00:02:02.259> get

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
or any type of event nobody won't get

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.209 
or any type of event nobody won't get
hurt<00:02:02.709> so<00:02:03.340> it's<00:02:03.520> really<00:02:03.729> important<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:04.450> be<00:02:04.599> safe

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
hurt so it's really important to be safe

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.160 
hurt so it's really important to be safe
you<00:02:06.219> don't<00:02:07.029> want<00:02:07.149> any<00:02:07.240> use<00:02:07.509> in<00:02:07.630> your<00:02:07.749> insurance

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
you don't want any use in your insurance

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.330 
you don't want any use in your insurance
if<00:02:08.500> you<00:02:08.560> have<00:02:09.099> insurance<00:02:09.310> most<00:02:09.910> DJ's<00:02:10.240> don't

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
if you have insurance most DJ's don't

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.630 
if you have insurance most DJ's don't
but<00:02:12.810> yeah<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:14.819> recommend<00:02:16.200> some<00:02:17.200> type<00:02:17.440> of<00:02:17.640> safety

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
but yeah I recommend some type of safety

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.220 
but yeah I recommend some type of safety
cable<00:02:19.290> security<00:02:20.290> device<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:21.780> make<00:02:22.780> sure<00:02:23.020> this

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
cable security device to make sure this

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.000 
cable security device to make sure this
light<00:02:23.530> is<00:02:23.739> not<00:02:24.040> going<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.340> hit<00:02:24.519> the<00:02:24.760> ground<00:02:25.590> so

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
light is not going to hit the ground so

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.620 
light is not going to hit the ground so
but<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.340> said<00:02:29.610> yep<00:02:32.390> that's<00:02:33.390> what<00:02:33.510> this

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
but that is said yep that's what this

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.350 
but that is said yep that's what this
video<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:33.900> about<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:35.310> I'll<00:02:35.670> be<00:02:35.850> doing<00:02:36.120> some

video is about and I'll be doing some
future<00:02:36.750> videos<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.490> programming<00:02:38.490> I'll<00:02:39.150> show

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
future videos on programming I'll show

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.790 
future videos on programming I'll show
you<00:02:39.390> what<00:02:39.510> these<00:02:39.630> lights<00:02:39.930> can<00:02:40.170> do<00:02:40.320> in<00:02:40.440> action

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
you what these lights can do in action
