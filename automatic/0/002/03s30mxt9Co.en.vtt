is<00:04:48.250> the<00:04:48.639> Lumia<00:04:48.970> 920<00:04:49.750> refresh<00:04:50.139> rate<00:04:50.410> just<00:04:50.680> looks

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
is the Lumia 920 refresh rate just looks

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.430 
is the Lumia 920 refresh rate just looks
a<00:04:51.100> little<00:04:51.460> bit<00:04:51.699> better<00:04:51.880> than<00:04:52.180> that<00:04:52.419> of<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:52.810> 820

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
a little bit better than that of the 820

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.590 
a little bit better than that of the 820
but<00:04:54.220> that's<00:04:54.370> probably<00:04:54.580> down<00:04:54.880> to<00:04:55.120> what<00:04:55.270> Nokia

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
but that's probably down to what Nokia

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.150 
but that's probably down to what Nokia
have<00:04:55.690> done<00:04:55.870> with<00:04:56.050> regards<00:04:56.470> to<00:04:56.680> the<00:04:56.830> refresh

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
have done with regards to the refresh

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.790 
have done with regards to the refresh
rate<00:04:57.370> of<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.580> screen

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
rate of the screen

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.260

so<00:04:59.800> that's<00:05:00.100> performance<00:05:00.580> and<00:05:00.729> battery<00:05:01.000> life

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
so that's performance and battery life

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.469 
so that's performance and battery life
the<00:05:01.840> Lumia<00:05:02.229> 920<00:05:02.860> will<00:05:03.100> tend<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:03.550> last<00:05:03.880> a<00:05:04.150> full
