00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.790
 Well, you already have 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.360
 alcohol thrown out and as you see I do not know if 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.860
 you see it exceeds the coin up 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.860
 and you do not have to do it is to turn it on 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.100
 is already on and this what it does is 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.350
 that burns the 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.380
 the alcohol that stands out and 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.500
 heat the stove 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.810
 and in a moment then start 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.259
 start let's go massify and jump 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.259
 through the holes 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.150
 the light goes out where everything is seen with the 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.900
 extinguished alcohol 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.900
 that will look better 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.040
 it grips a little on the sides by 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.830
 what you see 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.420
 and it starts to come out of the sides we're going 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.720
 through the holes is already basifying 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.720
 all right 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.369
 and so it goes out all 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.539
 not that I have the pulse like a dove 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.539
 tambourine g 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.700
 another way to understand it if you do not 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.700
 you want to fill to the top 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.969
 they filled whatever you want to put the coin 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.000
 and with a lighter heat the base of the 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:54.030
 screw 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.710
 until it comes gas for the 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.060
 holes then turn on the gas of the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.060
 holes and you're done 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.680
 I think I think that is the most 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.740
 easy to light it fill it up to butt 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.750
 until it sticks up 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.250
 put the coin and turn on the alcohol is 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:16.590
 alcohol heats the stove and starts 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.590
 charge and the gas goes on is already 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.360
 stove made to measure for the 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.540
 speed of pills the little one will have 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.950
 about 20 minutes or so 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.950
 of heat let's go 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.380
 we are not good as you see heats 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.380
 quite knows enough flame 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.010
 I hope it serves as a hello
