for this first stun bomb or stun grenade
that<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.770> throw<00:00:47.219> or<00:00:48.030> shoot<00:00:48.390> at<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:48.870> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
that I throw or shoot at it it's a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.690 
that I throw or shoot at it it's a
little<00:00:49.170> late<00:00:49.500> because<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.160> mortar<00:00:50.460> actually

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
little late because the mortar actually

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.290 
little late because the mortar actually
got<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> shot<00:00:51.090> off

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
got a shot off

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.270 
got a shot off
I<00:00:51.510> was<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:51.870> unsure<00:00:52.020> about<00:00:52.289> how<00:00:52.829> big<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
I was just unsure about how big the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.670 
I was just unsure about how big the
range<00:00:53.550> actually<00:00:53.879> was<00:00:54.180> for<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.510> mortar<00:00:55.050> 3000

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
range actually was for this mortar 3000

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.560 
range actually was for this mortar 3000
as<00:00:55.770> mr.<00:00:56.129> Hammerman<00:00:56.460> calls<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.449> it's

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
as mr. Hammerman calls it but it's

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.540 
as mr. Hammerman calls it but it's
pretty<00:00:58.109> powerful<00:00:58.350> he<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:58.890> take<00:00:59.070> out<00:00:59.190> pretty

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
pretty powerful he can take out pretty

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.889 
pretty powerful he can take out pretty
much<00:00:59.640> any<00:00:59.879> troop<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.480> with<00:01:00.750> this

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
much any troop that I have with this

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.139 
much any troop that I have with this
army<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.500> one<00:01:01.739> shot<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.520> had<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.760> miss<00:01:02.879> click

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
army in one shot and I had to miss click

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.119 
army in one shot and I had to miss click
there<00:01:03.359> by<00:01:03.570> shooting<00:01:04.470> both<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> stun

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
there by shooting both of the stun

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.789 
there by shooting both of the stun
grenades<00:01:05.460> at<00:01:05.700> one<00:01:06.060> time<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.720> thought<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.680> was

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
grenades at one time I thought that was

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.050 
grenades at one time I thought that was
going<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.979> cost<00:01:08.220> me<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> little<00:01:08.610> more<00:01:08.820> than<00:01:08.939> it

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
going to cost me a little more than it

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.270 
going to cost me a little more than it
did<00:01:09.240> but<00:01:09.390> thankfully<00:01:10.140> only<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.680> mortar<00:01:11.010> only

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
did but thankfully only the mortar only

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.310 
did but thankfully only the mortar only
locked<00:01:11.460> down<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.790> my<00:01:11.909> Zucco<00:01:12.720> down<00:01:12.869> or<00:01:13.110> not<00:01:13.229> this

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
locked down to my Zucco down or not this

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.630 
locked down to my Zucco down or not this
would<00:01:13.470> go<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> heavy<00:01:13.920> down<00:01:14.159> at<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> bottom

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
would go the heavy down at the bottom

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.039 
would go the heavy down at the bottom
there<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.000> didn't<00:01:15.540> cost<00:01:15.689> me<00:01:15.869> too<00:01:16.020> much

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
there and didn't cost me too much

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.990 
there and didn't cost me too much
because<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.040> ended<00:01:17.250> up<00:01:17.490> destroying<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
because I ended up destroying the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.060 
because I ended up destroying the
headquarters<00:01:18.420> right<00:01:18.570> there<00:01:18.780> anyways<00:01:19.380> so

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
headquarters right there anyways so

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.649 
headquarters right there anyways so
that's<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.580> easiest<00:01:20.909> way<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.270> found<00:01:21.330> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
that's the easiest way that I found to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.140 
that's the easiest way that I found to
take<00:01:21.869> out<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.140> base<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.830> get<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.119> lot<00:01:24.119> of

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
take out this base and you get a lot of

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.840 
take out this base and you get a lot of
nice<00:01:25.110> crystals<00:01:25.890> or<00:01:26.100> gems<00:01:26.430> or<00:01:26.610> what<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:26.790> you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
nice crystals or gems or what if you

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.310 
nice crystals or gems or what if you
want<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.000> call<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:28.020> build<00:01:28.200> your

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
want to call it for it to build your

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.170 
want to call it for it to build your
statues<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.610> see<00:01:29.729> hammerman's

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
statues and you can see hammerman's

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.810 
statues and you can see hammerman's
pretty<00:01:30.659> mad<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> new<00:01:32.220> update<00:01:32.579> his

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
pretty mad and with the new update his

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.789 
pretty mad and with the new update his
he<00:01:33.450> looks<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.689> little<00:01:33.900> bit<00:01:34.020> different<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.590> like

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
he looks a little bit different I like
