00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
okay here we go now I made some gamma

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.120 
okay here we go now I made some gamma
bill<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:14.009> everywhere<00:00:14.849> oh<00:00:15.740> my<00:00:16.740> god<00:00:16.949> these

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
real quick whenever I talk about gamma

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.720 
real quick whenever I talk about gamma
and<00:00:23.519> Mike<00:00:28.010> but<00:00:29.010> like<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.160> was<00:00:29.279> saying<00:00:29.340> whenever

and Mike but like I was saying whenever
I<00:00:29.820> talk<00:00:30.060> about<00:00:30.179> gamma<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.720> my<00:00:30.840> videos<00:00:31.199> there's

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
I talk about gamma in my videos there's

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.659 
I talk about gamma in my videos there's
always<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.679> bunch<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.009> comments<00:00:32.160> like<00:00:32.399> oh<00:00:32.550> my

god<00:00:32.850> stop<00:00:33.210> talking<00:00:33.480> about<00:00:33.780> gamma<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:34.440> know

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
god stop talking about gamma we know

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.020 
god stop talking about gamma we know
they're<00:00:34.739> paying<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.340> talk<00:00:35.520> about<00:00:35.700> them

and no I do not get paid to talk about

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.770 
and no I do not get paid to talk about
gamma<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.879> my<00:00:38.969> videos<00:00:39.239> that's<00:00:39.329> not<00:00:39.540> how<00:00:39.690> it

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
gamma in my videos that's not how it

works<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.079> talk<00:00:40.379> about<00:00:40.559> gamma<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.010> my<00:00:41.100> videos

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
works I talk about gamma in my videos

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.010 
works I talk about gamma in my videos
because<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.940> love<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:43.489> gonna<00:00:44.489> fucking<00:00:45.300> exploded

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
get paid to talk about gamma in my video

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.310 
get paid to talk about gamma in my video
that's<00:00:51.239> not<00:00:51.360> how<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.600> works<00:00:51.750> whenever<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.140> do
