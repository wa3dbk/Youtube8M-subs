00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.430
 we are often asked what kind of scanner 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.200
 barcode pick today ends 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.790
 especially for you to hold a mini 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.670
 scanner selection experiment 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.309
 barcodes in our test involved two 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.910
 barcode scanner is a laser 1 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.640
 flat barcode scanner and 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.910
 LED photo scanner is also one 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.420
 plane and so we will test 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.390
 him on the hardest products for the rubbed 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.920
 bar codes with mirror bar codes on 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.649
 convex on and on various other 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.510
 label so let's start first with what often 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.250
 entrepreneurs face it 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.649
 rubbed barcode when it is already a little bit 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:50.809
 lay down in our store and his our 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:54.989
 buyers have already touched a little and so 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:58.710
 laser 1 plane cannot 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.590
 deal with it take a photo of the country as 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.640
 we see 10 in favor of the photo scanner 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.590
 the next is the usual toothpicks here 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.100
 the manufacturer has prudently done 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.390
 white background barcode that should improve 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.430
 scanning it with scanners 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.500
 as you see the laser 1 plane 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.040
 the scanner copes with this 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.509
 task in the general as well as photo scanner 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.759
 so at 21 in favor of photo scanners 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:34.049
 the next complicated barcode is on 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:38.820
 mirror substrate take 1 plane 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:43.009
 laser unfortunately he can't 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.009
 handle this barcode adequately 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:50.820
 photo scania as always on top 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:54.380
 the same with a pen about which also 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.380
 there is a mirror image that 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.909
 Sorry, and here the laser one-eyed 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.729
 shows sleep with not very good 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.990
 parties 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:11.680
 the next item of our program is 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:14.040
 costume jewelry and a small bar code well here 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.040
 no options 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:23.410
 Unlike photo scanner small 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.830
 the barcode also scans well 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:32.640
 laser barcode photo with horse 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:36.400
 and laser scanner complicate the task 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:45.360
 the label is in plastic 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:45.360
 underlay and principle everything is enough 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:56.380
 normal barcode in the package 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.890
 if you smooth the packaging in principle 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.109
 everyone is inclined to scan normally 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:06.190
 slightly complicate the task of packing not 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:13.359
 so smoothed laser and and can no longer 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:16.859
 take a photo scanner a little bit better so 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.859
 convex packaging 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.190
 almost immediately scans it 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.930
 photo scanner 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.870
 and unfortunately not so good scan 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.500
 laser 1 plane scanner and 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:43.250
 last experiment 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:47.400
 this is a packaging with a big barcode here and 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:50.400
 1 and 2 scanner should handle well but 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.790
 photo scanner advantage is the distance 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.350
 scan of which he catches 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.720
 barcode ie wider range 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.110
 Well, the data of the presented model can 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.430
 work on coasters 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.420
 the difference is that when setting 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:13.320
 photo scanner on the stand beam turns on 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.360
 automatically in order for this 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.090
 specific model turned on 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.519
 better automatically there is a service 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.410
 the barcode on the stand will scan 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.040
 which the 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.530
 scanner is marked in auto mode 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.479
 so let's summarize 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:34.340
 unconditionally photo scanner showed itself with 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:37.229
 the best side however it is a bit more expensive 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.750
 you should decide what is for you 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.970
 speed or price is more important 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.890
 Thank you all for your attention with you 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.890
