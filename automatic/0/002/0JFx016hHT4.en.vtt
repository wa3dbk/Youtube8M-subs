I've put some pretty good ideas based on
the<00:00:57.329> past<00:00:57.480> Cody<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.170> I've<00:00:58.230> played<00:00:58.469> on

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
the past Cody is that I've played on

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.860 
the past Cody is that I've played on
what<00:00:59.250> these<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.640> what<00:01:00.090> these<00:01:00.239> might<00:01:00.510> represent

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
what these in what these might represent

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.560 
what these in what these might represent
so<00:01:01.829> where<00:01:02.010> they<00:01:02.160> could<00:01:02.430> be<00:01:02.460> perks<00:01:03.090> they<00:01:03.390> could

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
so where they could be perks they could

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.750 
so where they could be perks they could
be<00:01:03.750> kill<00:01:04.049> streaks<00:01:04.409> or<00:01:04.710> def<00:01:05.040> streaks<00:01:05.400> please

something<00:01:08.250> completely<00:01:08.490> new<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:09.180> could<00:01:09.360> be

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
something completely new there could be

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.179 
something completely new there could be
like<00:01:09.659> wild<00:01:10.080> cards<00:01:10.439> they<00:01:10.560> would<00:01:10.740> brand<00:01:11.010> use

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
like wild cards they would brand use

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.700 
like wild cards they would brand use
black<00:01:11.430> ops<00:01:11.610> 2<00:01:11.850> we<00:01:12.299> never<00:01:12.420> saw<00:01:12.630> those<00:01:12.840> before<00:01:12.900> so

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
black ops 2 we never saw those before so

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.080 
black ops 2 we never saw those before so
maybe<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> new<00:01:14.310> system<00:01:14.670> some<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.000> these

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
maybe it's a new system some of these

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.969 
maybe it's a new system some of these
there<00:01:15.330> represents<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.049> different<00:01:16.290> create

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
there represents a different create

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.440 
there represents a different create
class<00:01:17.189> system<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:17.939> haven't<00:01:18.119> seen<00:01:18.210> before

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
class system that we haven't seen before

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.660 
class system that we haven't seen before
but<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.350> let<00:01:19.680> me<00:01:19.740> know<00:01:19.860> what<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.189> guys<00:01:20.369> think

suggestions we very helpful to see in
the<00:01:26.400> comments<00:01:26.729> section<00:01:26.759> maybe<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.270> can

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the comments section maybe we can

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.330 
the comments section maybe we can
together<00:01:27.750> work<00:01:28.500> out<00:01:28.740> what<00:01:29.009> some<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.250> these

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
together work out what some of these

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.429 
together work out what some of these
images<00:01:29.729> might<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.900> ones<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.259> black

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
images might be so the ones in black

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.249 
images might be so the ones in black
boxes<00:01:31.979> look<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.340> lot<00:01:32.490> more<00:01:32.549> important<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.600> kind

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
boxes look a lot more important and kind

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.590 
boxes look a lot more important and kind
of<00:01:34.320> centralized<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.340> me<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.759> then<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.450> look

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
of centralized to me and then it look

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.789 
of centralized to me and then it look
like<00:01:36.780> what<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.170> kind<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.470> be<00:01:37.530> there<00:01:37.650> going<00:01:37.770> to

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
like what is kind of be there going to

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.920 
like what is kind of be there going to
be<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> basis<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.700> your<00:01:38.850> credit<00:01:39.150> class<00:01:39.360> system

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
be the basis to your credit class system

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.770 
be the basis to your credit class system
and<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.979> what<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.159> think<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.820> what<00:01:42.119> my<00:01:42.329> theory<00:01:42.630> is

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
and so what I think is what my theory is

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.109 
and so what I think is what my theory is
is<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.500> these<00:01:43.649> are<00:01:43.950> actually<00:01:43.979> kill<00:01:44.759> streaks

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
is that these are actually kill streaks

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.179 
is that these are actually kill streaks
or<00:01:45.390> score<00:01:45.750> streaks<00:01:46.049> or<00:01:46.229> point<00:01:46.530> streaks<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.040> wish

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
or score streaks or point streaks I wish

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.230 
or score streaks or point streaks I wish
you'd<00:01:47.310> stop<00:01:47.460> changing<00:01:47.790> name<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.030> everything

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
you'd stop changing name of everything

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.700 
you'd stop changing name of everything
but<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.750> think<00:01:48.810> these<00:01:49.020> are<00:01:49.140> going<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.320> be<00:01:49.380> kill

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
but I think these are going to be kill

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.590 
but I think these are going to be kill
streaks<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.189> then<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.880> things<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
streaks and then the things in the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.870 
streaks and then the things in the
smaller<00:01:51.990> boxes<00:01:52.470> could<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:52.920> perks<00:01:53.340> they<00:01:53.640> look

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
smaller boxes could be perks they look

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.399 
smaller boxes could be perks they look
very<00:01:53.909> very<00:01:54.210> much<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.780> parks<00:01:55.079> we've<00:01:55.200> seen

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
very very much like parks we've seen

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.410 
very very much like parks we've seen
before<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.549> first<00:01:56.700> one<00:01:56.880> right<00:01:57.000> here<00:01:57.240> it

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
before so this first one right here it

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.090 
before so this first one right here it
looks<00:01:57.659> somewhat<00:01:58.079> like<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.290> juggle<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.890> looks

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
looks somewhat like a juggle it looks

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.830 
looks somewhat like a juggle it looks
like<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> kind<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.850> beefy<00:02:00.210> guy<00:02:00.360> with<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.630> bit

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
like a kind of a beefy guy with a bit

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.260 
like a kind of a beefy guy with a bit
more<00:02:01.020> kind<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.290> extra<00:02:01.860> layers<00:02:02.520> around<00:02:02.670> him<00:02:03.090> and

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
more kind of extra layers around him and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.090 
more kind of extra layers around him and
it's<00:02:03.420> got<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> knife<00:02:03.840> maybe<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:04.950> sounds

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
it's got a knife maybe this just sounds

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.010 
it's got a knife maybe this just sounds
crazy<00:02:05.490> idea<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:05.969> maybe<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.600> juggernaut

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
crazy idea but maybe it's a juggernaut

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.600 
crazy idea but maybe it's a juggernaut
with<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.229> knife<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.710> get<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.950> run<00:02:08.129> around<00:02:08.160> a

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
with a knife you get to run around a

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.979 
with a knife you get to run around a
little<00:02:08.789> bit<00:02:08.970> extra<00:02:09.179> health<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.690> maybe<00:02:09.840> you

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
little bit extra health and maybe you

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.930 
little bit extra health and maybe you
get<00:02:10.140> some<00:02:10.319> kind<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.560> stealth<00:02:10.920> parks<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.520> then

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
get some kind of stealth parks and then

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.320 
get some kind of stealth parks and then
you<00:02:12.180> get<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.569> run<00:02:12.810> around<00:02:12.870> them

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
you get to run around them

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.570 
you get to run around them
the<00:02:13.570> knife<00:02:13.810> that's<00:02:14.050> just<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.410> thought<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:15.130> only

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
the knife that's just a thought you only

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.610 
the knife that's just a thought you only
use<00:02:15.820> blade<00:02:16.120> style<00:02:16.450> but<00:02:16.780> that's<00:02:17.140> what<00:02:17.320> it<00:02:17.380> looks

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
use blade style but that's what it looks

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.080 
use blade style but that's what it looks
like<00:02:17.800> there's<00:02:18.040> nothing<00:02:18.430> really<00:02:18.580> else<00:02:18.700> may<00:02:19.060> be

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
like there's nothing really else may be

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.020 
like there's nothing really else may be
a<00:02:19.240> ninja<00:02:19.570> but<00:02:20.350> that's<00:02:20.860> just<00:02:21.010> my<00:02:21.310> predictions

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
a ninja but that's just my predictions

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.480 
a ninja but that's just my predictions
and<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.990> one<00:02:23.260> below<00:02:23.470> that<00:02:23.710> this<00:02:23.950> looks<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.460> be

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
and the one below that this looks to be

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.310 
and the one below that this looks to be
air<00:02:24.880> this<00:02:25.090> makes<00:02:25.300> a<00:02:25.480> lot<00:02:25.690> of<00:02:25.870> sense<00:02:25.960> to<00:02:26.170> be<00:02:26.290> a

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
air this makes a lot of sense to be a

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.990 
air this makes a lot of sense to be a
school<00:02:26.590> street<00:02:26.830> because<00:02:27.100> it<00:02:27.220> appears<00:02:27.490> to<00:02:27.640> be<00:02:27.790> a

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
school street because it appears to be a

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.630 
school street because it appears to be a
grenade<00:02:28.540> launcher<00:02:29.170> like<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.830> war<00:02:30.040> machine<00:02:30.400> or

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
grenade launcher like the war machine or

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.670 
grenade launcher like the war machine or
maybe<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:31.000> flamethrower<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:32.050> I<00:02:32.320> can't<00:02:32.560> imagine

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
maybe a flamethrower and I can't imagine

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.440 
maybe a flamethrower and I can't imagine
a<00:02:32.950> grenade<00:02:33.280> launcher<00:02:33.670> being<00:02:33.880> associated<00:02:34.060> with

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
a grenade launcher being associated with

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.180 
a grenade launcher being associated with
the<00:02:34.540> perks<00:02:34.780> that<00:02:34.990> makes<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.260> lot<00:02:35.410> of<00:02:35.440> sense<00:02:35.530> this

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
the perks that makes a lot of sense this

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.860 
the perks that makes a lot of sense this
to<00:02:36.400> be<00:02:36.490> a<00:02:36.520> score<00:02:36.940> streak<00:02:37.270> or<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> kill<00:02:37.750> streak

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
to be a score streak or a kill streak

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.350 
to be a score streak or a kill streak
and<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.280> top<00:02:39.280> black<00:02:39.520> box<00:02:39.760> isn't<00:02:40.000> very

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
and the top black box isn't very

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.410 
and the top black box isn't very
suggestive<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:42.190> looks<00:02:42.400> very<00:02:42.490> identical<00:02:43.060> to

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
suggestive it looks very identical to

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.750 
suggestive it looks very identical to
the<00:02:43.570> Recon<00:02:44.050> perk<00:02:44.350> but<00:02:44.950> today<00:02:45.190> it's<00:02:45.370> missing

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
the Recon perk but today it's missing

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.220 
the Recon perk but today it's missing
the<00:02:45.790> kind<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.240> line<00:02:46.480> in<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.750> very<00:02:46.960> middle

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
the kind of the line in the very middle

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.220 
the kind of the line in the very middle
so<00:02:47.740> it<00:02:47.770> maybe<00:02:48.220> this<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.520> an<00:02:48.610> EMP<00:02:49.240> but<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:50.110> and

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
so it maybe this is an EMP but it and

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.050 
so it maybe this is an EMP but it and
then<00:02:50.350> moving<00:02:50.530> on<00:02:50.770> next<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.280> we<00:02:51.400> have<00:02:51.640> the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
then moving on next to it we have the

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.420 
then moving on next to it we have the
first<00:02:52.240> perk<00:02:52.600> this<00:02:53.410> just<00:02:53.620> has<00:02:53.770> an<00:02:53.920> extra<00:02:54.250> we

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
first perk this just has an extra we

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.130 
first perk this just has an extra we
can't<00:02:54.670> see<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.240> top<00:02:55.480> of<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.660> image<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:56.020> we

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
can't see the top of the image so we

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.050 
can't see the top of the image so we
can't<00:02:56.380> really<00:02:56.470> know<00:02:56.830> what<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.130> is<00:02:57.280> but<00:02:57.490> we<00:02:57.910> do

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
can't really know what it is but we do

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.920 
can't really know what it is but we do
know<00:02:58.090> it's<00:02:58.390> going<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.540> be<00:02:58.600> something<00:02:58.810> that

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
know it's going to be something that

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.780 
know it's going to be something that
cancels<00:02:59.500> out<00:02:59.650> something<00:03:00.070> else<00:03:00.190> or<00:03:00.459> stop

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
cancels out something else or stop

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.850 
cancels out something else or stop
something<00:03:01.090> prevents<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.260> sales<00:03:02.620> ability

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
something prevents it the sales ability

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.580 
something prevents it the sales ability
and<00:03:03.370> maybe<00:03:04.150> it's<00:03:04.330> like<00:03:04.510> dead<00:03:04.780> silence<00:03:05.050> and<00:03:05.500> it

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
and maybe it's like dead silence and it

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.620 
and maybe it's like dead silence and it
stops<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.130> ability<00:03:06.940> for<00:03:06.970> people<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.480> hear

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
stops the ability for people to hear

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.570 
stops the ability for people to hear
your<00:03:07.780> footsteps<00:03:07.930> but<00:03:08.770> this<00:03:09.160> is<00:03:09.280> going<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.520> be

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
your footsteps but this is going to be

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.699 
your footsteps but this is going to be
something<00:03:09.850> that<00:03:10.090> Edna<00:03:10.450> gates<00:03:10.900> something<00:03:11.440> else

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
something that Edna gates something else

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.740 
something that Edna gates something else
so<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.310> then<00:03:12.760> moving<00:03:12.970> on<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.209> this<00:03:13.480> image

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
so and then moving on to this image

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.720 
so and then moving on to this image
right<00:03:13.930> here<00:03:14.010> we<00:03:15.010> have<00:03:15.040> what<00:03:15.340> looks<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.640> be

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
right here we have what looks to be

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.090 
right here we have what looks to be
extreme<00:03:16.300> conditioning<00:03:16.990> but<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.739> does<00:03:18.070> look

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
extreme conditioning but it does look

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.220 
extreme conditioning but it does look
like<00:03:18.610> there's<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.880> magazine<00:03:19.390> a<00:03:19.420> gun<00:03:19.810> magazine

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
like there's a magazine a gun magazine

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.229 
like there's a magazine a gun magazine
next<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.620> them<00:03:20.769> sprinting<00:03:21.400> so<00:03:21.610> maybe<00:03:21.910> what<00:03:22.209> I

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
next to them sprinting so maybe what I

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.420 
next to them sprinting so maybe what I
think<00:03:22.690> is<00:03:22.900> that<00:03:23.200> this<00:03:23.410> is<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.590> faster<00:03:24.100> reload

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
think is that this is a faster reload

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.000 
think is that this is a faster reload
when<00:03:24.700> running<00:03:25.030> or<00:03:25.330> maybe<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:26.290> means<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:26.860> can

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
when running or maybe it means you can

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.190 
when running or maybe it means you can
actually<00:03:27.160> reload<00:03:27.790> while<00:03:28.090> sprinting<00:03:28.630> a<00:03:28.930> lot<00:03:29.110> of

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
actually reload while sprinting a lot of

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.600 
actually reload while sprinting a lot of
first-person<00:03:29.560> shooters<00:03:30.010> actually<00:03:30.370> let<00:03:30.519> you

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
first-person shooters actually let you

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.970 
first-person shooters actually let you
do<00:03:30.820> that<00:03:31.030> that<00:03:31.480> field<00:03:31.750> in<00:03:32.019> particular<00:03:32.350> you're

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
do that that field in particular you're

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.620 
do that that field in particular you're
allowed<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.340> reload<00:03:33.730> while<00:03:33.970> you're<00:03:34.180> sprinting

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
allowed to reload while you're sprinting

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.350 
allowed to reload while you're sprinting
so<00:03:35.200> when<00:03:35.410> maybe<00:03:35.739> for<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.070> first<00:03:36.250> time<00:03:36.519> will

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
so when maybe for the first time will

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.449 
so when maybe for the first time will
actually<00:03:37.660> be<00:03:37.750> allowed<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:38.080> do<00:03:38.320> that<00:03:38.530> and<00:03:38.739> it's

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
actually be allowed to do that and it's

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:40.740 
actually be allowed to do that and it's
something<00:03:39.640> that<00:03:39.790> cause<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.180> want<00:03:40.360> to<00:03:40.420> do<00:03:40.510> make

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
something that cause you want to do make

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.509 
something that cause you want to do make
their<00:03:41.140> games<00:03:41.320> a<00:03:41.470> lot<00:03:41.500> more<00:03:41.769> fast<00:03:42.010> pace<00:03:42.250> and

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
their games a lot more fast pace and

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:43.979 
their games a lot more fast pace and
maybe<00:03:42.760> that's<00:03:43.330> something<00:03:43.570> we'll<00:03:43.840> actually

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
maybe that's something we'll actually

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.250 
maybe that's something we'll actually
see<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:45.239> then<00:03:46.239> blow<00:03:46.420> that<00:03:46.570> we<00:03:46.690> see<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.840> radar

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
see and then blow that we see a radar

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.720 
see and then blow that we see a radar
dish<00:03:47.440> for<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.650> line<00:03:47.830> of<00:03:47.950> strike<00:03:48.190> into<00:03:48.430> it<00:03:48.640> this

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
dish for the line of strike into it this

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.090 
dish for the line of strike into it this
normally<00:03:49.120> represents<00:03:49.630> the<00:03:49.690> counter<00:03:50.050> UAV<00:03:50.200> but

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
normally represents the counter UAV but

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.949 
normally represents the counter UAV but
it<00:03:51.340> as<00:03:51.489> these<00:03:51.760> look<00:03:51.970> like<00:03:52.000> perks<00:03:52.420> I'm<00:03:52.690> going<00:03:52.900> to

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
it as these look like perks I'm going to

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.020 
it as these look like perks I'm going to
say<00:03:53.140> this<00:03:53.320> is<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.530> ghost<00:03:53.920> or<00:03:54.190> assassin<00:03:54.730> or

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
say this is the ghost or assassin or

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.630 
say this is the ghost or assassin or
blind<00:03:55.480> eye<00:03:55.690> or<00:03:56.110> cold-blooded<00:03:56.950> type<00:03:57.160> perk<00:03:57.430> and

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
blind eye or cold-blooded type perk and

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.210 
blind eye or cold-blooded type perk and
then<00:03:58.510> below<00:03:58.660> that<00:03:58.750> we<00:03:59.110> have<00:03:59.140> or<00:03:59.680> where<00:04:00.100> or

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
then below that we have or where or

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.490 
then below that we have or where or
cross<00:04:00.700> that<00:04:00.850> sorry<00:04:01.120> we<00:04:01.510> have<00:04:01.780> that<00:04:02.019> a<00:04:02.050> skull

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
cross that sorry we have that a skull

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.790 
cross that sorry we have that a skull
with<00:04:02.530> some<00:04:03.010> kind<00:04:03.190> of<00:04:03.250> beams<00:04:03.519> coming<00:04:03.820> from<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.330> I

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
with some kind of beams coming from it I

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.350 
with some kind of beams coming from it I
can't<00:04:05.800> really<00:04:06.010> guess<00:04:06.220> what<00:04:06.400> this<00:04:06.519> could<00:04:06.730> be<00:04:07.060> my

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
can't really guess what this could be my

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.870 
can't really guess what this could be my
suggestion<00:04:07.870> would<00:04:08.290> be<00:04:08.350> but<00:04:08.709> it's<00:04:08.980> maybe<00:04:09.280> when

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
suggestion would be but it's maybe when

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.550 
suggestion would be but it's maybe when
someone<00:04:10.239> dies<00:04:10.510> at<00:04:10.780> let<00:04:10.959> off<00:04:11.140> some<00:04:11.320> kind<00:04:11.530> of

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
someone dies at let off some kind of

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.860 
someone dies at let off some kind of
alert<00:04:11.920> maybe<00:04:12.220> it's<00:04:12.430> kind<00:04:12.549> of<00:04:12.640> a<00:04:12.760> sound<00:04:13.030> or<00:04:13.360> it's

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
alert maybe it's kind of a sound or it's

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.990 
alert maybe it's kind of a sound or it's
a<00:04:14.110> heads-up<00:04:14.590> display<00:04:14.950> icon<00:04:15.549> that's<00:04:15.790> very

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
a heads-up display icon that's very

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.330 
a heads-up display icon that's very
bigger<00:04:16.269> than<00:04:16.660> normal<00:04:16.810> kind<00:04:17.169> of<00:04:17.229> deaf<00:04:17.440> icon<00:04:17.890> so

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
bigger than normal kind of deaf icon so

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.190 
bigger than normal kind of deaf icon so
when<00:04:18.519> your<00:04:18.640> teammate<00:04:19.030> dies<00:04:19.330> and<00:04:19.630> you<00:04:19.660> can<00:04:19.930> see

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
when your teammate dies and you can see

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.750 
when your teammate dies and you can see
and<00:04:20.350> you<00:04:20.440> can<00:04:20.590> know<00:04:20.890> very<00:04:21.250> very<00:04:21.280> clearly

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
and you can know very very clearly

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.360 
and you can know very very clearly
someone's<00:04:22.180> died<00:04:22.419> and<00:04:22.660> maybe<00:04:23.530> that's<00:04:23.979> kind<00:04:24.250> of

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
someone's died and maybe that's kind of

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.670 
someone's died and maybe that's kind of
a<00:04:24.550> an<00:04:24.760> indication<00:04:25.510> that<00:04:25.720> when<00:04:25.930> you<00:04:26.140> die<00:04:26.380> all

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
a an indication that when you die all

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.180 
a an indication that when you die all
your<00:04:26.860> team

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
your team

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.550 
your team
aight<00:04:27.250> know<00:04:27.610> about<00:04:27.910> it<00:04:28.210> so<00:04:28.540> where<00:04:28.780> and<00:04:28.960> then

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
aight know about it so where and then

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.440 
aight know about it so where and then
moving<00:04:30.040> down<00:04:30.160> from<00:04:30.340> that<00:04:30.580> we<00:04:30.730> can<00:04:30.880> clearly<00:04:31.150> see

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
moving down from that we can clearly see

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.090 
moving down from that we can clearly see
this<00:04:31.900> is<00:04:32.020> going<00:04:32.140> to<00:04:32.200> be<00:04:32.260> blast<00:04:32.560> shield<00:04:32.860> and

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
this is going to be blast shield and

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.130 
this is going to be blast shield and
this<00:04:34.030> you<00:04:34.240> can<00:04:34.390> see<00:04:34.540> this<00:04:34.690> because<00:04:34.960> it<00:04:35.020> has<00:04:35.110> a

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
this you can see this because it has a

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.560 
this you can see this because it has a
grenade<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:35.770> a<00:04:36.400> shield<00:04:36.820> next<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.330> it<00:04:37.420> it's

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
grenade and a shield next to it it's

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.660 
grenade and a shield next to it it's
going<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:37.840> be<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.170> Infinity<00:04:39.010> Ward<00:04:39.160> equivalent

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
going to be the Infinity Ward equivalent

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.150 
going to be the Infinity Ward equivalent
of<00:04:39.960> flak<00:04:40.960> jackets<00:04:41.470> so<00:04:41.650> it's<00:04:41.830> going<00:04:41.950> to<00:04:42.010> protect

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
of flak jackets so it's going to protect

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.490 
of flak jackets so it's going to protect
you<00:04:42.370> from<00:04:42.460> explosives<00:04:43.180> because<00:04:43.630> as<00:04:44.080> you<00:04:44.440> can

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
you from explosives because as you can

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.200 
you from explosives because as you can
see<00:04:44.590> it<00:04:44.860> looks<00:04:45.100> exactly<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.640> same<00:04:45.700> as<00:04:46.030> all<00:04:46.180> the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
see it looks exactly the same as all the

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.350 
see it looks exactly the same as all the
other<00:04:46.420> icons<00:04:47.050> and<00:04:47.230> all<00:04:47.980> the<00:04:48.280> icons<00:04:48.670> for<00:04:48.910> blast

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
other icons and all the icons for blast

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.330 
other icons and all the icons for blast
shield<00:04:49.600> and<00:04:49.750> so<00:04:50.680> this<00:04:50.800> is<00:04:50.950> going<00:04:51.130> to<00:04:51.220> be

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
shield and so this is going to be

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
shield and so this is going to be
hopefully<00:04:51.700> it's<00:04:51.820> going<00:04:51.910> to<00:04:52.000> be<00:04:52.060> a<00:04:52.090> very<00:04:52.150> good

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
hopefully it's going to be a very good

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.480 
hopefully it's going to be a very good
perk<00:04:52.780> because<00:04:53.140> blast<00:04:53.410> shield<00:04:53.680> always<00:04:54.070> sucks

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
perk because blast shield always sucks

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.980 
perk because blast shield always sucks
it's<00:04:54.760> always<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:55.060> one<00:04:55.210> of<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.360> worst<00:04:55.570> parks

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
it's always the one of the worst parks

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.630 
it's always the one of the worst parks
there<00:04:56.200> is<00:04:56.380> it<00:04:56.560> doesn't<00:04:56.860> do<00:04:56.980> much<00:04:57.190> explode

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
there is it doesn't do much explode

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.760 
there is it doesn't do much explode
isn't<00:04:58.030> protect<00:04:58.330> you<00:04:58.510> from<00:04:58.930> Ashley<00:04:59.260> explosive

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
isn't protect you from Ashley explosive

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.710 
isn't protect you from Ashley explosive
damage<00:04:59.890> at<00:05:00.250> all<00:05:00.280> and<00:05:00.700> then<00:05:01.240> they're<00:05:01.390> never<00:05:01.570> as

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
damage at all and then they're never as

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.570 
damage at all and then they're never as
good<00:05:01.810> as<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:02.200> flak<00:05:02.440> jacket<00:05:02.800> perks<00:05:03.040> were<00:05:03.280> and

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
good as the flak jacket perks were and

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.940 
good as the flak jacket perks were and
black<00:05:03.730> ops<00:05:03.910> 1<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:04.300> 2<00:05:04.480> and<00:05:04.660> then<00:05:05.230> finally<00:05:05.770> blow

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
black ops 1 and 2 and then finally blow

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.410 
black ops 1 and 2 and then finally blow
that<00:05:06.100> we<00:05:06.250> have<00:05:06.460> there<00:05:06.730> what<00:05:06.940> is<00:05:07.030> obviously

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
that we have there what is obviously

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.730 
that we have there what is obviously
scavenge<00:05:07.960> I<00:05:08.050> think<00:05:08.260> we<00:05:08.320> can<00:05:08.410> all<00:05:08.470> recognize

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
scavenge I think we can all recognize

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.040 
scavenge I think we can all recognize
the<00:05:09.160> scavenger<00:05:09.580> logo<00:05:10.000> a<00:05:10.150> vulture<00:05:10.660> with

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
the scavenger logo a vulture with

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.290 
the scavenger logo a vulture with
bullets<00:05:11.530> next<00:05:11.830> to<00:05:11.920> it<00:05:12.070> and<00:05:12.160> they<00:05:12.730> pick<00:05:13.030> up<00:05:13.180> a

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
bullets next to it and they pick up a

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.090 
bullets next to it and they pick up a
moes<00:05:13.570> from<00:05:13.780> dead<00:05:13.990> body<00:05:14.230> so<00:05:14.500> that<00:05:14.530> we<00:05:14.830> have<00:05:14.860> it

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
moes from dead body so that we have it

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.160 
moes from dead body so that we have it
that<00:05:15.250> is<00:05:15.280> there<00:05:15.640> those<00:05:15.820> are<00:05:15.850> my<00:05:16.210> ideas<00:05:16.240> for

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
that is there those are my ideas for

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.780 
that is there those are my ideas for
what<00:05:17.350> these<00:05:17.530> icons<00:05:18.040> mean<00:05:18.100> and<00:05:18.550> what<00:05:18.670> they

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
what these icons mean and what they

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.520 
what these icons mean and what they
might<00:05:18.970> represent<00:05:19.210> obviously<00:05:20.020> I<00:05:20.050> don't<00:05:20.290> know

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
might represent obviously I don't know

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.500 
might represent obviously I don't know
them<00:05:20.770> and<00:05:20.950> this<00:05:21.340> is<00:05:21.490> just<00:05:21.610> my<00:05:21.790> guess<00:05:21.850> is<00:05:22.270> my

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
them and this is just my guess is my

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.360 
them and this is just my guess is my
guess<00:05:22.720> as<00:05:22.900> good<00:05:22.990> as<00:05:23.200> yours<00:05:23.470> so<00:05:23.890> err<00:05:24.100> leave<00:05:24.340> a
