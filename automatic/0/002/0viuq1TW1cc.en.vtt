00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.359
 hi friends how about here juanjo 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.510
 commenting on a chess match 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:15.620
 ok in this case we have 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:19.369
 a position with which we are going to close 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.980
 this series of tactical method based on 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.680
 the elimination of the defending parts 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:31.369
 of other pieces is worth in this case 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:34.250
 concrete we see that this is finally 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.920
 defending the f 6 horse with what 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.470
 which we will do well in this 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.550
 position white takes advantage 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:48.880
 eliminating the defending bishop 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:52.270
 and now if the rules take with the tower 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.840
 well, eh what 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.730
 towers 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.730
 efe 6 and yes 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:08.720
 efe 6 well for 16 and we have here a 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:15.080
 mate where 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.080
 and that we return the position 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.270
 and instead of capturing 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.350
 this tower 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:32.760
 reading this tower with the tower 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.970
 capture with the lady worth 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.150
 whereupon this horse is now 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.900
 off because I love it because it's here at 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:46.100
 end and by x-ray has the diagonal 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.100
 cover voucher 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.510
 what would happen 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:58.150
 because white has the magnificent 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:00.909
 Lady's move to c4 while increasing the 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.470
 pressure on the horse 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.960
 and about the lady 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.140
 I have already been told that this horse is 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.010
 nailed vale 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:16.080
 Black could play C4 for 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:25.250
 remove is like this 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:25.250
 and white would take a tower for efe 6 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.500
 yes to the film for 2 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:41.190
 comes the magnificent play of tower 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:45.400
 h 6 ignoring the capture of it at last 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.950
 It's worth the white moves the tower ah6 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.390
 with which the diagonal 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:55.050
 is open they are playing the piano dh6 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.050
 and the lama 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.860
 they have a magnificent attack 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.100
 the black would move in the pawn 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.430
 16 to avoid 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.420
 attack the lady get in the way of 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:17.030
 action 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:19.440
 and finally by efe 6 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.510
 it does not matter 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.220
 to white because already his position of 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.190
 attack is tremendous 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:32.510
 by efe 6 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.500
 and tower by h 7 on foot 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.500
 the g8 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.840
 and it was six years ago and they are already threatening 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:48.460
 here the mate 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:51.410
 C7 towers to defend the lady 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:55.490
 g6 with check 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:58.080
 the king has to move to 18 at 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:02.900
 interpose to tower 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.900
 single play king f8 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.830
 tower 8 check 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.550
 king 7 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:17.090
 and with a horse of 5 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:20.000
 Check White concludes his advantage 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.200
 because now blacks have to 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.290
 abandon because everything that comes now 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:32.070
 the material wins white or so 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:36.620
 if for example king of 7 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.620
 tower for 8 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.500
 call for 8 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:49.409
 and horse by efe 6 javier giving him 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:55.050
 double to the king to the lady 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:57.509
 and if laugh 7 horse for 8 good friend 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.720
 I hope I liked this last one 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:02.480
 position 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.970
 defense action if you liked the 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.970
 there are favorite shots and even another
