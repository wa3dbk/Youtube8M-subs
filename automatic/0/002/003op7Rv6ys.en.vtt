dragons are sent to create some very
complex<00:05:06.669> chords<00:05:07.449> that<00:05:07.569> are<00:05:07.599> virtually

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
complex chords that are virtually

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.890 
complex chords that are virtually
impossible<00:05:08.409> to<00:05:08.889> play<00:05:09.129> without<00:05:09.669> the<00:05:09.999> pitchfork

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:33.530 

you

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.909 

now<00:05:34.540> a<00:05:34.570> liver<00:05:34.810> the<00:05:34.960> moment<00:05:35.290> I<00:05:35.380> remote<00:05:35.620> for<00:05:35.830> you

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
now a liver the moment I remote for you

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.650 
now a liver the moment I remote for you
guys<00:05:36.070> and<00:05:36.280> that<00:05:36.400> means<00:05:36.669> that<00:05:37.240> you<00:05:37.330> only<00:05:37.480> hear

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
guys and that means that you only hear

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.879 
guys and that means that you only hear
the<00:05:37.750> effect<00:05:38.080> when<00:05:38.230> you're<00:05:38.350> holding<00:05:38.470> the<00:05:38.680> foot

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
the effect when you're holding the foot

00:05:38.889 --> 00:06:11.379 
the effect when you're holding the foot
switch

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.430 

here's<00:06:12.389> another<00:06:12.510> example<00:06:12.810> using<00:06:13.350> the

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
here's another example using the

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.440 
here's another example using the
momentary<00:06:13.889> mode<00:06:14.130> but<00:06:14.340> this<00:06:14.520> time<00:06:14.700> with<00:06:14.880> no<00:06:15.180> dry

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
momentary mode but this time with no dry

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.970 
momentary mode but this time with no dry
guitar<00:06:15.810> sound<00:06:16.139> and<00:06:16.320> I'm<00:06:16.410> using<00:06:16.560> the<00:06:16.770> two

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
guitar sound and I'm using the two

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:34.340 
guitar sound and I'm using the two
octaves<00:06:17.430> up<00:06:17.639> effect

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.350 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.689 

so<00:06:35.350> there<00:06:35.530> you<00:06:35.590> have<00:06:35.650> the<00:06:35.800> pitchfork<00:06:36.520> by

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:36.699 
so there you have the pitchfork by

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:38.250 
so there you have the pitchfork by
electro-harmonix<00:06:37.240> I<00:06:37.570> think<00:06:37.810> this<00:06:37.990> pedal

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260 
electro-harmonix I think this pedal

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.720 
electro-harmonix I think this pedal
really<00:06:38.410> is<00:06:38.680> kind<00:06:38.980> of<00:06:39.010> like<00:06:39.130> a<00:06:39.160> Swiss<00:06:39.520> Army

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:39.730 
really is kind of like a Swiss Army

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.400 
really is kind of like a Swiss Army
knife<00:06:39.940> and<00:06:40.360> I've<00:06:40.720> only<00:06:40.840> touched<00:06:41.050> upon<00:06:41.260> a

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
knife and I've only touched upon a

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.570 
knife and I've only touched upon a
number<00:06:41.620> of<00:06:41.770> sounds<00:06:42.010> that<00:06:42.220> I<00:06:42.310> personally

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
number of sounds that I personally

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.310 
number of sounds that I personally
really<00:06:42.970> like<00:06:43.090> from<00:06:43.449> this<00:06:43.600> pedal<00:06:43.900> but<00:06:43.960> I'm<00:06:44.080> sure

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:44.320 
really like from this pedal but I'm sure

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.990 
really like from this pedal but I'm sure

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
if you spend some time with it there are

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.210 
if you spend some time with it there are
many<00:06:46.270> many<00:06:46.870> more<00:06:47.169> great<00:06:47.500> sounds<00:06:47.860> to<00:06:47.979> be<00:06:48.010> had
