00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
little seal that we have to cut open and

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.499 
little seal that we have to cut open and
we<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.329> do<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:40.320> like<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:41.509> here

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.160 
here's this again so let's see how many
cards<00:03:09.549> there<00:03:09.819> are<00:03:09.850> obviously<00:03:10.450> it's<00:03:10.630> 48<00:03:10.900> but

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
cards there are obviously it's 48 but

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.160 
cards there are obviously it's 48 but
let's<00:03:11.470> see<00:03:11.739> which<00:03:11.889> ones<00:03:12.100> were<00:03:12.280> missing<00:03:13.019> so<00:03:14.019> we

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
let's see which ones were missing so we

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:23.059 
let's see which ones were missing so we
have<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:16.000> 10<00:03:16.660> through<00:03:18.389> Ace<00:03:19.389> of<00:03:19.420> Spades<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:22.209> 9

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
have the 10 through Ace of Spades the 9

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:29.150 
have the 10 through Ace of Spades the 9
through<00:03:24.180> Ace<00:03:25.180> of<00:03:25.209> Diamonds<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:27.760> 9<00:03:28.420> through

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
through Ace of Diamonds the 9 through

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.479 
through Ace of Diamonds the 9 through
actually<00:03:30.160> we<00:03:30.250> had<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.430> 9<00:03:30.639> I<00:03:31.030> thought<00:03:32.130> ok<00:03:33.130> and

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
actually we had the 9 I thought ok and

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.280 
actually we had the 9 I thought ok and
the<00:03:33.700> 9<00:03:33.970> oh<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:36.190> see<00:03:36.549> I<00:03:36.910> see<00:03:37.180> what<00:03:37.569> this<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:37.959> this

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
the 9 oh I see I see what this is this

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.920 
the 9 oh I see I see what this is this
is<00:03:38.349> a<00:03:38.670> very<00:03:39.670> odd<00:03:39.819> deck<00:03:40.090> but<00:03:40.329> if<00:03:40.599> you<00:03:40.660> need

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
is a very odd deck but if you need

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.629 
is a very odd deck but if you need
duplicates<00:03:41.440> this<00:03:41.560> works<00:03:41.829> very<00:03:41.980> well

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
duplicates this works very well

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.300 
duplicates this works very well
look<00:03:43.090> now<00:03:43.269> we<00:03:43.299> have<00:03:43.510> more<00:03:43.780> 9<00:03:44.590> 10<00:03:44.889> Jack<00:03:44.920> Queen

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
look now we have more 9 10 Jack Queen

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.629 
look now we have more 9 10 Jack Queen
Kings<00:03:46.139> so<00:03:47.139> it's<00:03:47.319> basically<00:03:47.650> 9<00:03:47.919> to<00:03:48.069> 10<00:03:48.280> in<00:03:48.459> every

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
Kings so it's basically 9 to 10 in every

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.520 
Kings so it's basically 9 to 10 in every
suit<00:03:48.910> this<00:03:49.510> is<00:03:49.540> pretty<00:03:49.840> cool<00:03:50.079> I<00:03:50.139> mean<00:03:50.410> you

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
suit this is pretty cool I mean you

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.020 
suit this is pretty cool I mean you
can't<00:03:50.709> do<00:03:50.950> really<00:03:51.220> do<00:03:51.370> magic<00:03:51.700> tricks<00:03:51.790> with<00:03:52.000> it

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
can't do really do magic tricks with it

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.150 
can't do really do magic tricks with it
but<00:03:52.299> if<00:03:52.389> you're<00:03:52.510> missing<00:03:52.840> a<00:03:52.900> few<00:03:53.079> cards<00:03:53.530> that

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
but if you're missing a few cards that

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.300 
but if you're missing a few cards that
are<00:03:54.340> from<00:03:54.790> 9<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.840> ace<00:03:55.989> this<00:03:56.290> works<00:03:56.530> really<00:03:56.709> well

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
are from 9 to ace this works really well

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.780 
are from 9 to ace this works really well
and<00:03:57.549> again<00:03:58.269> here's<00:03:58.569> our<00:03:58.810> one<00:03:59.169> and<00:03:59.200> only<00:03:59.790> Joker
