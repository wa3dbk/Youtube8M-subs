process<00:00:59.750> on<00:00:59.930> this<00:01:00.110> symbol<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:01.640> band<00:01:01.820> inside

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
process on this symbol the band inside

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.240 
process on this symbol the band inside
this<00:01:02.660> kind<00:01:02.900> of<00:01:02.989> got<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:03.320> grinding<00:01:03.830> treatment

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
this kind of got the grinding treatment

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.980 
this kind of got the grinding treatment
actually<00:01:04.550> controls<00:01:05.030> a<00:01:05.239> symbol<00:01:05.540> a<00:01:05.630> little<00:01:05.870> bit

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
actually controls a symbol a little bit

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.080 
actually controls a symbol a little bit
so<00:01:06.590> what<00:01:06.770> you're<00:01:06.920> here<00:01:07.160> is<00:01:07.310> a<00:01:07.580> higher

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
so what you're here is a higher

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.120 
so what you're here is a higher
frequency<00:01:08.390> response<00:01:09.140> on<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.470> initial<00:01:09.770> attack

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
frequency response on the initial attack

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.070 
frequency response on the initial attack
and<00:01:10.520> then<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:10.910> lower<00:01:11.150> frequency<00:01:11.420> that<00:01:11.810> kind<00:01:11.990> of

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
and then a lower frequency that kind of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:22.000 
and then a lower frequency that kind of
comes<00:01:12.380> out<00:01:12.590> as<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.979> decay

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.920
