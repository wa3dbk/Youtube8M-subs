00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
the past but it seems like the brake

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.600 
the past but it seems like the brake
lever<00:01:09.930> doesn't<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:11.040> enough<00:01:11.250> preserved

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
lever doesn't have enough preserved

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.250 
lever doesn't have enough preserved
travel<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> rear<00:01:12.840> brake<00:01:13.049> doesn't

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
travel on it and the rear brake doesn't

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.960 
travel on it and the rear brake doesn't
feel<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:13.650> powerful<00:01:14.159> as<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.250> should<00:01:14.580> do<00:01:14.760> I

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
feel as powerful as it should do I

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.700 
feel as powerful as it should do I
suspect<00:01:15.930> may<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:19.170> caliper

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
suspect may be that the the caliper

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.539 
suspect may be that the the caliper
might<00:01:19.920> want<00:01:20.130> looking<00:01:20.520> at<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:22.280> also<00:01:23.280> that

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
might want looking at on that also that

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.850 
might want looking at on that also that
I've<00:01:23.670> noticed<00:01:24.090> them<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.860> exhaust

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
clamps lose their on the exhaust the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.359 
clamps lose their on the exhaust the
exhaust<00:01:28.020> itself<00:01:28.439> doesn't<00:01:28.740> look<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.009> too<00:01:29.159> bad<00:01:29.310> a

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369
