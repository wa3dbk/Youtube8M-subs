00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.010 
matter how you put it on there but um I
like<00:01:58.259> keeping<00:01:58.710> stuff<00:01:59.219> organized<00:01:59.909> I'm<00:02:00.780> a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
like keeping stuff organized I'm a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.870 
like keeping stuff organized I'm a
little<00:02:01.290> OCD

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.600 

and<00:02:04.390> now<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.380> Mexican<00:02:05.950> cheese<00:02:06.250> which<00:02:06.580> is

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
and now the Mexican cheese which is

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.120 
and now the Mexican cheese which is
drier<00:02:07.270> we're<00:02:07.750> gonna<00:02:07.869> spread<00:02:08.830> it<00:02:08.890> around

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
drier we're gonna spread it around

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.600 
drier we're gonna spread it around
everywhere<00:02:10.170> just<00:02:11.170> so<00:02:11.380> you<00:02:11.440> get<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.740> thick

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
everywhere just so you get a thick

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.130 
everywhere just so you get a thick
enough<00:02:12.819> layer<00:02:13.950> but<00:02:14.950> not<00:02:15.190> too<00:02:15.370> much<00:02:15.550> because

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
enough layer but not too much because

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.780 
enough layer but not too much because
when<00:02:17.140> we<00:02:17.410> melt<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:17.980> cheese<00:02:18.250> it's<00:02:18.640> gonna

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
when we melt the cheese it's gonna

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.059 
when we melt the cheese it's gonna
spread<00:02:19.510> all<00:02:19.690> over<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:20.050> place<00:02:22.590> all<00:02:23.590> right<00:02:23.830> so

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
spread all over the place all right so

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.930 
spread all over the place all right so
now<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.280> we<00:02:24.700> have<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.209> cheese<00:02:25.510> all<00:02:25.870> over

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
now that we have the cheese all over

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.180 
now that we have the cheese all over
we're<00:02:27.940> gonna<00:02:28.030> take<00:02:28.360> another<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.470> Fiat<00:02:29.950> and

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
we're gonna take another the Fiat and

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.160 
we're gonna take another the Fiat and
put<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.550> right<00:02:30.580> on<00:02:31.030> top<00:02:31.060> of<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.660> cheese<00:02:31.930> and

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
put it right on top of the cheese and

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.170 
put it right on top of the cheese and
the<00:02:32.739> other<00:02:32.770> thought<00:02:33.160> via<00:02:33.370> kind<00:02:33.910> of<00:02:34.030> like<00:02:34.150> a

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180
