00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.330
 youtube chamber new happy 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.340
 start a bit back to the roots 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.900
 today there are men in hamburg with two 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.000
 short stop I show you two very 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.190
 nice exercise once a cross and 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.870
 a squat and I thought I must 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.840
 again away from all this criticism 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.580
 videos lover videos and commercial videos out there 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.350
 it unfortunately too many times because in the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.330
 The end effect is that they also have one 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.630
 fitness channel and that's why back to the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.420
 roots 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.820
 I think criticism can and should be 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.689
 also be and in the sense of very short 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.520
 I do not mind if somebody 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.469
 trying to earn money with youtube 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.420
 I have to and I can do more 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.149
 want to earn as much as I want 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.440
 Of course no problem one can do business 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.340
 but I think sometime comes 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.290
 maybe also a point where you 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.180
 some values ​​may revive 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.649
 should and should be 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.180
 I should say every shit 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.610
 sell to earn money 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.899
 and maybe also about the people 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.640
 maybe they think about the videos 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.719
 see 15-year-old 16-year-old the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.520
 maybe not so far yet 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.829
 have horizon and then really too 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.840
 Maybe you think you have to be certain 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.570
 buy things and that 's my eyes 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.890
 from my values ​​not quite okay 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.460
 everyone can be lying out again 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.600
 would like to 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.310
 I think there are other examples 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.420
 I watch you sometimes an album while having so 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.890
 I met him from jammer 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.960
 that's still the case today 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.119
 He does not need certain things 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.350
 sell and is easy and i believe 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.939
 it also goes to another way 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.009
 even if has a large reach 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.600
 or even want to get in and yes 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.840
 just think about the two here 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.229
 Exercise squat and yes 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.610
 stand here the other objectively on 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.689
 or tripod in one direction 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.420
 show the exercise here, too 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.740
 Have fun even to the first exercise 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.060
 squat and of course there are 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.290
 here with two short or 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.479
 or with the shorthand 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.009
 several variations you can of course 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.350
 once the act shows here namely 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.799
 Turn that on and then down here already 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.790
 go 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.799
 personal advice sumo squat I would like 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.530
 you were a bit coordinative 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.600
 show more difficult variations and indeed 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.850
 makes me squat in the leg 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.170
 act short and take both in front 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.210
 I do that on my shoulders 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.270
 the whole thing is supposed to look like this before us 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.990
 Never put the dumbbell on the front 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.009
 the dumbbell disc on the scapula 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.119
 or yes nonsense at the front 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.009
 of innocence 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.200
 I take the elbows inside 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.909
 and now have the weight of course 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.170
 more on the axis, yes, if it's up front 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.670
 I really do keep it on the axis 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.019
 is means of course we do not have here 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.120
 the burden is on the increase 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.640
 Of course, more on the thighs 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.230
 balance on the back of the thigh or on 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.909
 the buttocks, the elbows take here 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.190
 bit inside and do the whole thing 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.780
 times before about shoulder width stood 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.180
 Tiptoe points straight out 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.849
 upper body remains straight view also goes 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.970
 forward or chemical down and 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.970
 Let's go 1 and 23 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:52.879
 under 45 67 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.079
 I'll show it again from the beginning 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:03:04.190
 Students both standard place game 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:04.190
 maybe outward in with 123 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.549
 40 15 and that my somewhere 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.750
 variations if you two without further ado and 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.299
 I 've got on both sides too 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.829
 and twelve kilo wanted the coordination 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.959
 that is already very much promoted 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.819
 we are exhausting by alone 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.180
 the execution and the weight of the 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.760
 perfectly okay for me the best squat 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.230
 variation with the short trade so if 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.690
 her home had something for the legs 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.120
 I really do want to try 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.910
 then I have something for the quiet 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.560
 or for the thighs on the 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.209
 upper body lifting a bit cross 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.250
 variation here in the victim the two 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.949
 shorthand in left and right in the 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.510
 hand and look now that we are after 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:49.949
 Going downstairs always have the same 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.650
 shoe size and stick to number 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:54.840
 the dumbbells lead completely to the back 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.510
 close to the upper body over one 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.790
 thighs to below the knees slightly 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.889
 the knees are only slightly bent 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.019
 I do that once before a bit like a 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.530
 end make breast out shoulder blades 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.970
 go and there we go down here 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:13.440
 and pull up the dumbbells again 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:16.169
 to stretch straight down again directly 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.190
 suffering from an eggplant and again 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.519
 high up 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.620
 pull chest out shoulder backwards 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.449
 go down slowly 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.320
 and back out we work now 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.660
 especially with the tensions in the 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.760
 thigh back and in the lower 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.139
 back in the rhön stretch these muscles 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.340
 We should definitely feel it 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:36.840
 show again slow down to 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.340
 and behind your knees and then again 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.030
 up 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.830
 he still has a bit of tempo 91 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.900
 and then down again 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.060
 Two never with a bit more beautiful 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.160
 Of course it works but always pay attention 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.290
 the tension in the addressed 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.540
 musculature in the case here in the 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.550
 thighs and especially lower ones 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.310
 but also the shoulder and 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.840
 neck area is the addressed 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.970
 trade another cross-lifting variation 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.100
 and with these two exercises with the 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.110
 knee bend and the crossover variation 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.300
 can you really at home very much 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.830
 that means you are very complex 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.870
 makes these two practice makes then 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.210
 maybe a few more biceps churches 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.100
 Oar movement and then you have one 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.020
 complete body with this couple over 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.729
 that means if you have little time 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.410
 have at home, he tried it out this 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.240
 exercise and we can 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.289
 really cool workout with only two 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.160
 make short 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.160
 I'm from 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:57.560
 be in japan
