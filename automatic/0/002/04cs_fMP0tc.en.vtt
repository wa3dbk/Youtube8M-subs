00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
it without scavenger that's pretty much

the live with me unless it's the p90
because<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.200> last<00:01:07.740> quite<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> long<00:01:08.010> time<00:01:08.280> but

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.760 
because that last quite a long time but
I<00:01:08.700> mean<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> problem<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.080> especially<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
I mean the problem is especially the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.460 
I mean the problem is especially the
vector<00:01:11.070> which<00:01:11.159> has<00:01:11.310> really<00:01:11.520> low<00:01:11.760> power<00:01:12.470> you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
vector which has really low power you

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.010 
vector which has really low power you
will<00:01:13.710> run<00:01:13.979> out<00:01:14.040> quick<00:01:14.479> you'll<00:01:15.479> see<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.659> only<00:01:15.780> get

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
will run out quick you'll see I only get

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.499 
will run out quick you'll see I only get
like<00:01:16.110> four<00:01:16.350> kills<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.970> admittedly<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.030> wasn't

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
like four kills and admittedly I wasn't

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.289 
like four kills and admittedly I wasn't
very<00:01:18.540> economical<00:01:19.530> than<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> usage<00:01:20.130> but<00:01:20.310> you

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
very economical than the usage but you

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.990 
very economical than the usage but you
get<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.479> point<00:01:21.689> la<00:01:22.680> way<00:01:22.830> pro<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.670> good<00:01:23.880> because

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
get the point la way pro is good because

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.640 
get the point la way pro is good because
lets<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.360> stop<00:01:24.600> running<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.110> take<00:01:25.470> all<00:01:25.590> that

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
lets you stop running and take all that

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.160 
lets you stop running and take all that
guy<00:01:25.799> there<00:01:26.570> scrambler<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.689> always<00:01:27.930> good<00:01:28.080> for

teams<00:03:20.480> ogio<00:03:21.480> things<00:03:21.690> are<00:03:21.810> good<00:03:21.990> but<00:03:22.230> a

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
teams ogio things are good but a

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.460 
teams ogio things are good but a
longer-range<00:03:23.070> like<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.610> it's<00:03:24.470> pretty

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
longer-range like that it's pretty

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.170 
longer-range like that it's pretty
hopeless<00:03:25.680> when<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.280> gets<00:03:26.490> to<00:03:26.610> longer<00:03:26.970> ranges

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
hopeless when it gets to longer ranges

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.760 
hopeless when it gets to longer ranges
because<00:03:27.360> of<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.510> recoil<00:03:27.870> but<00:03:29.990> yeah<00:03:30.990> what<00:03:31.650> else

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
because of the recoil but yeah what else

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.320 
because of the recoil but yeah what else
is<00:03:31.860> going<00:03:32.100> on<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.370> think<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:32.760> got<00:03:32.850> a<00:03:32.880> few<00:03:33.120> videos

whatsoever it's um it made up some
excuse<00:03:52.830> about<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.100> ram<00:03:53.280> but<00:03:53.550> you<00:03:54.000> know<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.120> have

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
excuse about the ram but you know I have

four gigs of ram that's not that should

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.160 
four gigs of ram that's not that should
be<00:03:57.120> more<00:03:57.300> than<00:03:57.360> enough<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.780> render<00:03:57.930> out<00:03:58.140> a

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.730 
quite a few different crazy Helens I
don't<00:04:21.239> know<00:04:21.330> maybe

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
I picked up this guy's a CEO of new tube

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.960 
I picked up this guy's a CEO of new tube
and<00:04:25.110> painkiller<00:04:25.800> saves<00:04:26.160> this<00:04:26.340> guy<00:04:26.520> from<00:04:26.789> the

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
and painkiller saves this guy from the

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.640 
and painkiller saves this guy from the
new<00:04:27.090> tube<00:04:27.360> but<00:04:27.599> often<00:04:28.169> the<00:04:28.259> second<00:04:28.530> one

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
new tube but often the second one

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.749 
new tube but often the second one
clearly<00:04:28.919> and<00:04:30.319> sub<00:04:31.319> base<00:04:31.560> is<00:04:31.889> one<00:04:32.610> of<00:04:32.639> those

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 
clearly and sub base is one of those

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.550 
clearly and sub base is one of those
maps<00:04:33.060> where<00:04:33.240> it<00:04:33.330> can<00:04:33.449> go<00:04:33.479> either<00:04:33.599> way<00:04:33.870> you

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
maps where it can go either way you

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.260 
maps where it can go either way you
could<00:04:34.740> have<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.860> really<00:04:35.099> good<00:04:35.220> game<00:04:35.430> or<00:04:35.789> you

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
could have a really good game or you

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.140 
could have a really good game or you
could<00:04:36.449> do<00:04:36.599> absolutely<00:04:37.020> horrible<00:04:38.150> domination

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
could do absolutely horrible domination

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.219 
could do absolutely horrible domination
is<00:04:39.330> usually<00:04:39.690> where<00:04:39.810> it<00:04:39.900> goes<00:04:39.990> absolutely

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
is usually where it goes absolutely

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.950 
is usually where it goes absolutely
horrible<00:04:40.710> for<00:04:40.919> me<00:04:40.949> because<00:04:41.340> I<00:04:41.569> end<00:04:42.569> up<00:04:42.630> you<00:04:42.810> see

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
horrible for me because I end up you see

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.029 
horrible for me because I end up you see
this<00:04:43.050> little<00:04:43.110> building<00:04:43.349> them<00:04:43.560> in<00:04:43.650> here<00:04:43.830> is

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
this little building them in here is

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.070 
this little building them in here is
pretty<00:04:44.310> much<00:04:44.520> where<00:04:44.880> I<00:04:44.940> end<00:04:45.210> up<00:04:45.360> most<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.810> time

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
pretty much where I end up most the time

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.290 
pretty much where I end up most the time
in<00:04:46.289> sub<00:04:46.470> base<00:04:46.650> especially<00:04:47.580> if<00:04:47.970> you're<00:04:48.120> on<00:04:48.270> a

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
in sub base especially if you're on a

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.969 
in sub base especially if you're on a
team<00:04:48.690> which<00:04:48.870> gets<00:04:49.050> completely<00:04:49.349> dominated<00:04:49.889> by

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
team which gets completely dominated by

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.339 
team which gets completely dominated by
chopper<00:04:50.250> gunners<00:04:50.580> and<00:04:51.270> stuff<00:04:51.750> I<00:04:52.020> think

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
chopper gunners and stuff I think

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:53.570 
chopper gunners and stuff I think
towards<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:52.650> end<00:04:52.800> I<00:04:52.919> actually<00:04:53.039> stayed<00:04:53.370> here

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
towards the end I actually stayed here

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.059 
towards the end I actually stayed here
quite<00:04:53.759> a<00:04:53.789> lot<00:04:53.819> because<00:04:54.620> we<00:04:55.620> end<00:04:55.740> up<00:04:55.830> getting

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069 
quite a lot because we end up getting

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:58.939 
quite a lot because we end up getting
sort<00:04:56.430> of<00:04:56.460> trapped<00:04:56.789> but<00:04:57.470> yeah<00:04:58.470> this<00:04:58.620> is<00:04:58.770> a<00:04:58.800> nice

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
sort of trapped but yeah this is a nice

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.469 
sort of trapped but yeah this is a nice
secure<00:04:59.250> building<00:04:59.639> if<00:04:59.759> you<00:04:59.880> are<00:05:00.030> looking<00:05:00.150> to

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
secure building if you are looking to

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.100 
secure building if you are looking to
you<00:05:01.069> know<00:05:02.069> keep<00:05:02.340> yourself<00:05:02.610> alive<00:05:02.870> not<00:05:03.870> going

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.200 
one thing but I can do okay with most is
you<00:05:18.900> go<00:05:19.020> I<00:05:19.050> mean<00:05:19.610> jack<00:05:20.610> of<00:05:20.729> all<00:05:20.759> trades<00:05:21.090> master

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
you go I mean jack of all trades master

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.200 
you go I mean jack of all trades master
of<00:05:21.509> jack<00:05:21.720> shit<00:05:22.220> but<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.310> ump<00:05:23.699> is<00:05:23.819> easy<00:05:24.000> for

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
of jack shit but the ump is easy for

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.689 
of jack shit but the ump is easy for
anyone<00:05:24.389> really<00:05:24.720> it's<00:05:24.840> the<00:05:25.310> classic<00:05:26.310> Russia

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
anyone really it's the classic Russia

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:29.360 
anyone really it's the classic Russia
gun<00:05:26.940> which<00:05:27.270> is<00:05:27.599> I<00:05:27.870> mean<00:05:28.860> a<00:05:28.889> lot<00:05:28.919> people<00:05:29.070> like<00:05:29.310> to

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
gun which is I mean a lot people like to

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.999 
gun which is I mean a lot people like to
come<00:05:29.490> into<00:05:29.610> this<00:05:29.729> overpower<00:05:30.240> book<00:05:30.509> and<00:05:31.009> I

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 
come into this overpower book and I

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.040 
come into this overpower book and I
don't<00:05:32.219> really<00:05:32.310> know<00:05:32.490> to<00:05:32.550> argue<00:05:32.969> I<00:05:33.180> don't<00:05:33.960> have

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
don't really know to argue I don't have

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.510 
don't really know to argue I don't have
too<00:05:34.199> many<00:05:34.289> problems<00:05:34.469> about<00:05:34.860> other<00:05:35.250> people

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
too many problems about other people

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.909 
too many problems about other people
using<00:05:35.789> a<00:05:35.849> book<00:05:36.000> I<00:05:36.349> guess<00:05:37.349> where<00:05:37.530> suffers

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
using a book I guess where suffers

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:39.830 
using a book I guess where suffers
compared<00:05:38.190> to<00:05:38.250> the<00:05:38.340> other<00:05:38.460> SMGs<00:05:39.270> is<00:05:39.479> that<00:05:39.750> it

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
compared to the other SMGs is that it

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.680 
compared to the other SMGs is that it
doesn't<00:05:40.050> have<00:05:40.139> the<00:05:40.199> rate<00:05:40.349> of<00:05:40.380> fire<00:05:40.710> I<00:05:41.690> mean

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
doesn't have the rate of fire I mean

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.629 
doesn't have the rate of fire I mean
close<00:05:42.900> range<00:05:43.229> now<00:05:43.710> it<00:05:44.039> probably<00:05:44.130> won't<00:05:44.490> cover

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
close range now it probably won't cover

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.420 
close range now it probably won't cover
that<00:05:44.820> quickly<00:05:45.000> compared<00:05:45.389> to<00:05:45.509> the<00:05:45.599> others<00:05:46.430> then

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
that quickly compared to the others then

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.810 
that quickly compared to the others then
again<00:05:47.729> it<00:05:48.000> is<00:05:48.330> almost<00:05:48.599> Rico<00:05:49.229> recoilless<00:05:50.130> sorry

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
again it is almost Rico recoilless sorry

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.270 
again it is almost Rico recoilless sorry
as<00:05:51.599> I<00:05:51.750> kill<00:05:52.409> the<00:05:52.500> sky<00:05:52.680> trying<00:05:52.889> to<00:05:52.949> Commander

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
as I kill the sky trying to Commander

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.689 
as I kill the sky trying to Commander
lunch<00:05:53.460> me<00:05:53.599> it<00:05:54.599> is<00:05:54.960> almost<00:05:55.139> recoilless<00:05:55.919> and<00:05:56.159> it

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 
lunch me it is almost recoilless and it

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:58.670 
lunch me it is almost recoilless and it
does<00:05:57.360> nice<00:05:57.539> damage<00:05:57.750> any<00:05:57.990> range<00:05:58.229> so<00:05:58.440> I<00:05:58.469> guess

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
does nice damage any range so I guess

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.189 
does nice damage any range so I guess
that's<00:05:58.800> why<00:05:58.949> so<00:05:59.130> many<00:05:59.159> people<00:05:59.310> use<00:05:59.699> it<00:06:00.199> what's

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 
that's why so many people use it what's

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.749 
that's why so many people use it what's
a<00:06:01.289> good<00:06:01.380> route<00:06:01.500> also<00:06:02.099> really<00:06:02.460> good<00:06:02.550> with<00:06:02.699> a

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 
a good route also really good with a

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.290 
a good route also really good with a
silencer<00:06:03.180> Ashley<00:06:04.280> now<00:06:05.280> the<00:06:05.340> vector<00:06:05.969> what<00:06:06.180> do<00:06:06.240> I

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
silencer Ashley now the vector what do I

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.670 
silencer Ashley now the vector what do I
think<00:06:06.330> about<00:06:06.479> the<00:06:06.659> vector<00:06:07.050> well<00:06:07.440> if<00:06:07.500> you<00:06:07.560> want

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
think about the vector well if you want

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.110 
think about the vector well if you want
good<00:06:07.860> tips<00:06:08.099> on<00:06:08.219> the<00:06:08.280> vector<00:06:08.550> go<00:06:08.759> watch<00:06:08.940> the

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
good tips on the vector go watch the

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.959 
good tips on the vector go watch the
trout's<00:06:09.419> custom<00:06:09.840> class<00:06:10.020> guide<00:06:10.259> on<00:06:10.409> the<00:06:10.500> vector

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:10.969 
trout's custom class guide on the vector

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:14.540 
trout's custom class guide on the vector
but<00:06:11.969> really<00:06:12.240> I<00:06:12.560> mean<00:06:13.560> ammo<00:06:13.919> is<00:06:14.190> such<00:06:14.310> a<00:06:14.340> big

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
but really I mean ammo is such a big

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.159 
but really I mean ammo is such a big
problem<00:06:14.729> for<00:06:14.940> the<00:06:15.030> vector<00:06:15.330> it<00:06:15.479> it<00:06:15.810> has<00:06:15.960> really

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
problem for the vector it it has really

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:18.980 
problem for the vector it it has really
nice<00:06:16.349> iron<00:06:16.680> sights<00:06:16.949> but<00:06:17.539> you<00:06:18.539> will<00:06:18.750> run<00:06:18.930> out

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
nice iron sights but you will run out

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.439 
nice iron sights but you will run out
quick<00:06:19.319> so<00:06:19.620> extend<00:06:20.550> the<00:06:20.610> magazine<00:06:20.969> scavenger

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 
quick so extend the magazine scavenger

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:22.550 
quick so extend the magazine scavenger
will<00:06:21.539> probably<00:06:21.840> be<00:06:21.930> what<00:06:22.110> I<00:06:22.139> go<00:06:22.289> for<00:06:22.319> in

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
will probably be what I go for in

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.850 
will probably be what I go for in
general<00:06:22.860> but<00:06:23.360> anyway<00:06:24.360> why<00:06:24.930> not<00:06:24.960> score<00:06:25.199> 25<00:06:25.590> and

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
general but anyway why not score 25 and

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.809 
general but anyway why not score 25 and
