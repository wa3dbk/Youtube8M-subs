00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:13.690
 you and you see for example what are the 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.580
 most common blunders of the 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.650
 young people regarding investments or in 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.279
 general in general your finances good in 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.950
 This is about wanting to postpone 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.100
 saving 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.560
 when it comes x things we will say yo 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.170
 I'm going to save but when they give me an increase 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.970
 loose I'm going to save but when 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.090
 I start to work, I will save but 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.160
 when I got married and the problem of this 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.570
 is that as you do not make the habit that 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.760
 time you're losing is a time 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.260
 beautiful where if I put on top 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.510
 money to work then really 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.040
 would advance is very fast and also when 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.739
 you will have more flexible expenses than 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.870
 when you're a kid then you come 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.120
 other expenses much stronger by 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.770
 course mortgage children of 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.130
 commitments if you ask for a loan for 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.810
 mastery or I do not know which ones even 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.110
 submitted that that would be the second 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.170
 error 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.540
 Maybe he gets a lot of people a lot 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.190
 water debts because you do not know how to use 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.840
 cards well that is to say he does not even know when 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.790
 your court date or your payment date if 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.770
 perhaps the birthday of the bride of 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.750
 boyfriend when it is but the dates do not even 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.820
 speak and less that has to do with the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.190
 card or they suddenly give them a 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.420
 card and offer them more more limit of 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.790
 credit and although they know that they do not 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.470
 can pay what do I accept for example 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.479
 be overcome embark with months without 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.770
 interests there are some that then the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.350
 forms that had debt 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.030
 but they are paying minimums only and 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.579
 then they become a debtor then 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.170
 we did a series on the little guy's blog 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.270
 capitalist balance that was called young and 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.009
 bankrupt because the truth is that 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.039
 We received many related questions 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.369
 with the use of credit with that to the 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:50.909
 very best guy your first instrument 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.560
 financial is not an investment account and 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.909
 not even a savings not the first 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.069
 what do you get after they have the 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.959
 payroll account the best is your card 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.479
 of credit when in reality, therefore, 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.159
 better they cite the credit because it is a 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.099
 very useful tool but if you would have 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.989
 to learn to handle first your 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:08.640
 money and save for your goals and 

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:10.229
 then combine it with credit but not 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.120
 start from zero credit because 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.890
 so it 's kind of like 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.140
 artificial capacity payment that is 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.090
 when my actual payment capacity is not 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.829
 modify that you upload thousands of times the 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.829
 credit limit and the third error 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.810
 frequent of young people there maybe 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.849
 a fourth but good the third would be no 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.250
 invest because they become the beautiful 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.870
 boat sleepers and are looking for their 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.850
 account and payroll or your credit card 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.190
 of your debit card there talking the 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.580
 money but not really 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.290
 to see what options this has for two 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.780
 reasons first because money works 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.630
 and second because the younger you are 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.940
 less expensive are going to be hazing 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.580
 obviously I do not know is not the same 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.770
 lose a little piece of your 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.750
 investment when you only have five 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.490
 thousand pesos invested that maybe 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.620
 take a risk when you already have 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.230
 100,000 or 200,000 is the amount that is 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.030
 not if you need to grab callus and that's why 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.470
 it serves to invest you are very young and the 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.930
 last issue has more to do with the 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.660
 economic situation and well with say 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.600
 at the time that we lived to 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.460
 all not many young people are 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.840
 working as a freelancer and they are not 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.580
 starting to build your network 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.900
 security in the sense of not being 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.630
 starting to buy expense insurance 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.860
 doctors who are therefore deductible from 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.330
 taxes to the best already with more 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.730
 limitations from the reform 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.410
 fiscal but still deductible from 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.060
 taxes and they are not saving either 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.920
 discarded for retirement when sometimes 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.830
 If you are freelance, you will not have 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.780
 gaining then anyway to companies 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.760
 freelance you're going to get sick you 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.350
 you are going to retire someday and you are also going to 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.850
 be out of circulation if it reaches you 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.560
 spend something then it is also 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.570
 is to have a network of contacts that 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.040
 can help in case you do not 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.040
 You can meet certain delivery
