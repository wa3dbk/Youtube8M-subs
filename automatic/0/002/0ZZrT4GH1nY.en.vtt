00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 Hi, I'm probably you, Diego. 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.200
 knows of other videos like mine. 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:13.769
 my cousin 's wedding anniversary 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.230
 wedding my time went page on 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.410
 they play the league of honor is not 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.820
 hot in the church to pass shame 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.949
 it did not really hit me 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:30.570
 the first subject I dealt with in 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:32.520
 My therapy was at last a lot of people talk. 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.140
 Right, I know we have to eat. 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.450
 every three hours 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.340
 make small meals if you want 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.710
 For example, we want to lose weight 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.620
 muscle mass and I heard a 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.230
 So that's what I do not know. 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.390
 What a tummy a tumbler I just wanted to ask. 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.000
 leave the nutritionists we go 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.910
 talk about some issues here and there has 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:03.210
 always someone all production has 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:04.739
 click mimi than it then just to 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.990
 make it clear that physical education 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.720
 also understands a lot about nutrition if you 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.510
 It's a little more or less in college. 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.760
 I would go to the bar and say that probably people 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.530
 knows much more attention than you eat 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.150
 No one is here to stay. 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.700
 predicting diet because that is 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.310
 prerogative of the nutritionist and only he 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.400
 neither doctor can do this is it to remember 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.220
 What are we doing today, enjoying the river? 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.140
 Let's explain the difference of the various 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.610
 profiles that the market leaves behind 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.470
 Of course I'm not doing any propaganda. 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.610
 no belly because nobody me 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.320
 said that 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.600
 basically there are three types of 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.729
 bars cereal bars picking 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.770
 fruit that protein bars 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.720
 let's start with the most popular of them 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.560
 cereal bar when the bar of 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.200
 cereal was invented 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.930
 vera has a lot of fiber and that was good 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.210
 practitioner of physical activity because 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.270
 it gives you a greater sense of anxiety 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.310
 it was by me one two barricades in the 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.020
 without eating, but if you 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.420
 look personal information of polka dots 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.849
 nowadays and you will see that many 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.800
 of them no longer have so much fiber and when 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.080
 they realized that fiber did not have the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.430
 very good face and was not very attractive 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.349
 commercially 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.430
 they ended up increasing the bars 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.700
 voting a little more sugar 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.560
 Chocolatinho leaving with Roma 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.830
 This fruit has an example of a bar 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.160
 and is 24 years old and was 89 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.410
 calories and 1.8 grams of fiber 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.470
 only that in the general average this mania of being 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.630
 I 'm much less than 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.790
 fruit bars that line of fruit 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.510
 for example in 27 grams 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.880
 one hundred and nine calories have more fiber than 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.620
 that of cereal she has a point 9 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.319
 grams of fibers 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.140
 besides it is much more delicious there you 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.450
 It's very clever, but you ask me why? 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.760
 hell there is still a cereal bar 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.579
 if you tie the fruit it is much more delicious 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.350
 very tasty have more fiber is branded 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.900
 the free is the smaller it is because it is more 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.720
 guy finally take cereal bath as 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.180
 fruits are good alternatives for you 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.670
 who lost weight keep doing weight 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.670
 That snack and the meals will end. 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.829
 now and the protein stick 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.200
 I do not know if you know who else trains 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.810
 to gain muscle mass and need 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.030
 a larger injection than might protein 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.829
 protein is the raw material of our 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.959
 musician that it happens even though you 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.060
 do a great weight training and 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.880
 not eating right 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.160
 You will not grow, will you? 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.440
 by physical of the throws in the stadium the 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.190
 Brazil will continue to look like a 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.260
 Flamengo 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.689
 scientific books and works 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.390
 Exactly recommend ingestion of two 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.379
 grams of protein per pound of weight 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.939
 corporal 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.590
 if you are trying to gain mass 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:56.560
 muscle so the protein stick 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.150
 and are so advantageous because while a 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.980
 cereal bar and fruit 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:05.560
 you have a 2 gram protein point 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:09.040
 Flemish like that of 40 grams 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.590
 You have 16 grams of protein and one 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.400
 sheath like this with a full 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:19.750

 head here has almost 30 10 with her in 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.479
 network because it is not even the price that 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.750
 they are more expensive but worth 30 in 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:34.449

 ten years to this against me until 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.050
 today 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.630
 The dog is hit in the living room without 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.360

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.220
 also that the navy is now the day
