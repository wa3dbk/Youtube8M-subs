on behalf of expert village in this clip
we're<00:00:05.580> going<00:00:05.609> to<00:00:05.879> look<00:00:06.089> at<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.299> different

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
we're going to look at the different

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.540 
we're going to look at the different
types<00:00:06.839> of<00:00:07.080> audio<00:00:07.440> cables<00:00:07.950> that<00:00:08.160> you're<00:00:08.340> likely

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
types of audio cables that you're likely

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.450 
types of audio cables that you're likely
to<00:00:08.700> run<00:00:08.970> into<00:00:09.000> in<00:00:09.450> doing<00:00:10.200> your<00:00:10.320> own<00:00:10.460> repairs

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
to run into in doing your own repairs

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.760 
to run into in doing your own repairs
and<00:00:12.139> manufacturing<00:00:13.139> your<00:00:13.349> own<00:00:13.410> cables<00:00:14.059> now

microphone<00:00:16.770> cable<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.460> other<00:00:17.880> types<00:00:18.180> of

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
microphone cable and other types of

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.570 
microphone cable and other types of
cable<00:00:18.690> audio<00:00:18.960> cable<00:00:19.320> can<00:00:19.470> also<00:00:19.619> be<00:00:19.859> balanced

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
cable audio cable can also be balanced

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.060 
cable audio cable can also be balanced
and<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.300> advantage<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.750> balanced<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.500> that

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
and the advantage to balanced is that

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.220 
and the advantage to balanced is that
the<00:00:23.189> noise<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.910> typically<00:00:24.510> picked<00:00:24.840> up<00:00:25.019> or

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
the noise that is typically picked up or

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.019 
the noise that is typically picked up or
they<00:00:25.350> can<00:00:25.590> be<00:00:25.710> picked<00:00:25.920> up<00:00:26.039> by<00:00:26.099> an<00:00:26.430> unbalanced

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
they can be picked up by an unbalanced

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.570 
they can be picked up by an unbalanced
cable<00:00:27.390> will<00:00:27.900> actually<00:00:28.320> still<00:00:28.619> be<00:00:28.890> picked<00:00:29.400> up

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
cable will actually still be picked up

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.370 
cable will actually still be picked up
by<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.029> balanced<00:00:30.510> cable<00:00:30.900> but<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.140> will<00:00:31.230> be

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
by the balanced cable but it will be

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.590 
by the balanced cable but it will be
picked<00:00:31.529> up<00:00:31.740> by<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.219> shield<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.850> one<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
conductors and it's almost like magic

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.090 
conductors and it's almost like magic
but<00:00:36.870> at<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> other<00:00:37.110> end<00:00:37.469> they<00:00:37.649> cancel<00:00:38.040> each

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
but at the other end they cancel each

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.860 
but at the other end they cancel each
other<00:00:38.280> out<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:40.250> eliminate<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:42.239> interference

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
other out and eliminate the interference

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.290 
other out and eliminate the interference
or<00:00:43.110> at<00:00:43.469> least<00:00:43.710> squash<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> point<00:00:45.180> where

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
or at least squash it to a point where

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.389 
or at least squash it to a point where
you're<00:00:45.539> not<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.050> hear<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:47.190> most

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
you're not going to hear it in most

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.880 
you're not going to hear it in most
cases

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
cases

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.069 
cases
so<00:00:49.890> microphone<00:00:50.489> cables<00:00:50.879> with<00:00:51.180> XLR<00:00:51.719> s<00:00:51.930> are

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
so microphone cables with XLR s are

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.310 
so microphone cables with XLR s are
typically<00:00:52.440> balanced<00:00:53.719> quarter-inch<00:00:54.719> TRS

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
typically balanced quarter-inch TRS

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.260 
typically balanced quarter-inch TRS
are<00:00:55.559> typically<00:00:56.399> balanced<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:56.940> not<00:00:57.090> always

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
are typically balanced but not always

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.630 
are typically balanced but not always
but<00:00:57.809> anything<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.559> has<00:00:58.800> three<00:00:59.160> contact

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
but anything that has three contact

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.869 
but anything that has three contact
points<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.210> oftentimes<00:01:00.690> if<00:01:01.199> not<00:01:01.410> always

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
points is oftentimes if not always

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.520 
points is oftentimes if not always
balanced<00:01:02.879> now<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> other<00:01:03.780> thing<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.320> it's

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
balanced now the other thing is it's

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.490 
balanced now the other thing is it's
like<00:01:04.589> RCA<00:01:05.129> cable<00:01:05.670> or<00:01:05.820> quarter-inch<00:01:06.600> or<00:01:06.750> guitar

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500

cables<00:01:08.119> instrument<00:01:09.119> cables<00:01:09.420> are<00:01:09.570> typically

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
cables instrument cables are typically

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.530 
cables instrument cables are typically
non<00:01:10.710> balanced<00:01:11.220> they'll<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.580> shield<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
non balanced they'll have a shield and a

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.109 
non balanced they'll have a shield and a
conductor<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.260> that's<00:01:13.439> all<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.189> those<00:01:14.970> are

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
conductor and that's all so those are

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.030 
conductor and that's all so those are
the<00:01:15.210> three<00:01:15.509> types<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:16.200> cables<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.860> you're

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the three types of cables that you're

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.249 
the three types of cables that you're
more<00:01:17.250> likely<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.850> come<00:01:18.119> into<00:01:18.330> now<00:01:18.930> if<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.110> go

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
more likely to come into now if we go

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.429 
more likely to come into now if we go
back<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> speaker<00:01:20.159> cable<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:21.200> is<00:01:22.200> very

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
back to the speaker cable it is very

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.429 
back to the speaker cable it is very
important<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.159> keep<00:01:23.310> your<00:01:23.369> cables

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
important that you keep your cables

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.260 
important that you keep your cables
marked<00:01:25.439> for<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> purpose<00:01:26.400> because<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.820> do<00:01:27.090> not

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
marked for a purpose because you do not

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.109 
marked for a purpose because you do not
want<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.659> use<00:01:27.930> an<00:01:28.170> instrument<00:01:29.130> cable<00:01:29.310> which<00:01:29.909> is

wire<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.500> can<00:01:55.649> damage<00:01:55.890> your

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
wire is that you can damage your

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.980 
wire is that you can damage your
amplifier<00:01:56.729> because<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.479> can't<00:01:57.780> actually

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
amplifier because it you can't actually

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.990 
amplifier because it you can't actually
put<00:01:58.350> enough<00:01:58.619> through<00:01:59.219> here<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.610> so<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.850> tries

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
put enough through here and so it tries

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.179 
put enough through here and so it tries
to<00:02:00.210> give<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.630> thousand<00:02:01.200> watts<00:02:01.409> for<00:02:01.770> low<00:02:01.979> end

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
to give it a thousand watts for low end

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.209 
to give it a thousand watts for low end
frequencies<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:03.000> your<00:02:03.149> amplifier<00:02:04.049> will<00:02:04.320> work

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
frequencies in your amplifier will work

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.999 
frequencies in your amplifier will work
too<00:02:05.399> hard<00:02:05.579> overheat<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.600> eventually<00:02:07.110> go<00:02:07.979> out

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
too hard overheat and eventually go out

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.570 
too hard overheat and eventually go out
on<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.429> now<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.690> has<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:10.259> shield<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:11.250> don't

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
on you now but it has a shield you don't

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.330 
on you now but it has a shield you don't
want<00:02:11.849> to

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
want to

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.160 
want to
who's<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:13.330> other<00:02:13.480> way<00:02:13.629> around<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:14.019> don't

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
who's the other way around you don't

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.960 
who's the other way around you don't
want<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.349> use<00:02:14.470> speaker<00:02:14.950> cable<00:02:15.340> for<00:02:15.519> instrument

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
want to use speaker cable for instrument

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.640 
want to use speaker cable for instrument
cable<00:02:16.239> because<00:02:16.540> there's<00:02:16.720> not<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.930> shield<00:02:17.290> there

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
cable because there's not a shield there

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.290 
cable because there's not a shield there
are<00:02:17.800> two<00:02:17.980> conductors<00:02:18.519> but<00:02:18.670> there's<00:02:18.849> no<00:02:19.000> shield

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
are two conductors but there's no shield

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.180 
are two conductors but there's no shield
and<00:02:19.540> so<00:02:20.050> you're<00:02:20.200> likely<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.560> get<00:02:20.739> some<00:02:20.950> hums

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
and so you're likely to get some hums

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.280 
and so you're likely to get some hums
and<00:02:21.430> buzzes<00:02:21.489> that<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.150> don't<00:02:22.330> want<00:02:22.569> so<00:02:22.870> if

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
and buzzes that you don't want so if

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.839 
and buzzes that you don't want so if
you're<00:02:23.650> getting<00:02:23.769> some<00:02:24.129> audio<00:02:24.459> interference

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
you're getting some audio interference

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.550 
you're getting some audio interference
or<00:02:25.150> whatever<00:02:25.480> make<00:02:25.720> sure<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.050> you<00:02:26.170> check<00:02:26.379> and

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
or whatever make sure that you check and

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.070 
or whatever make sure that you check and
make<00:02:26.650> sure<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:27.010> did<00:02:27.190> not<00:02:27.400> grab<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:28.080> speaker

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
make sure you did not grab a speaker

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.509 
make sure you did not grab a speaker
cable<00:02:29.500> with<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.680> quarter<00:02:30.010> inch<00:02:30.040> on<00:02:30.340> each<00:02:30.459> side

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
cable with a quarter inch on each side

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.729 
cable with a quarter inch on each side
instead<00:02:31.209> of<00:02:31.269> instrument<00:02:31.780> cable<00:02:32.019> by<00:02:32.170> accident

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
instead of instrument cable by accident

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.970 
instead of instrument cable by accident
and<00:02:32.890> those<00:02:33.610> are<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.090> three<00:02:34.360> types<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.410> cables

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
and those are the three types of cables

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.520 
and those are the three types of cables
that<00:02:36.519> you're<00:02:36.760> likely<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.239> run<00:02:37.390> into<00:02:37.569> if<00:02:38.110> you're

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
that you're likely to run into if you're

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.410 
that you're likely to run into if you're
going<00:02:38.739> to<00:02:38.860> do<00:02:38.980> work<00:02:39.190> with<00:02:39.580> your<00:02:39.760> own<00:02:39.970> audio

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
going to do work with your own audio
