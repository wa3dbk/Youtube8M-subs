00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.340
 what kind of fire is this 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.139
 we are alarmed for a big one 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.740
 fire in a thatched farmhouse 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.480
 in the village street then enter a blue 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.730
 farm house farm it is one 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.410
 farmhouse that is right were the people 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.500
 live in the panda 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.720
 the wares went to people present 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.740
 and that idea where and how the fire is 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.869
 arise 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.440
 no that is not yet known which is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.570
 later examined how is deployed 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.129
 we have deployed that with a big fire 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.379
 means the standard three 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.600
 fire engines come and like 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.200
 be known where you transfer to our 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.160
 own tankers so that's why there are more 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.059
 fire trucks are present for ours 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.660
 own water supply and red opposite 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.390
 this farm burns what have you seen 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.260
 well around ten o'clock 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.979
 the can give out the window and into it 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.229
 Light Lantern rome worthy 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.170
 smoking and at first I thought it was one 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.090
 just take the calculated into account 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.320
 belly but the breed that so 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.050
 enter label went forward to the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.080
 street and then I saw across the street 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.869
 that fire already came out of the roof and all 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.180
 pretty pretty big 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.280
 and 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.780
 never heard a few people 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.300
 expensive woman who had in those two years 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.850
 built and they existed a little 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.770
 each and sustainable real care and 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.780
 then the front 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.200
 the flames at the bottom of the ride a day 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.790
 came and the fire that was on the other 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.540
 side of the at the back of the 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.410
 farm and well the fire department was then 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.119
 not yet 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.550
 maybe fifth now let that drop 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.290
 once together and then the 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.250
 oxygen in and do as it no longer 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.440
 not save anymore 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.210
 how many people live in new york 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.860
 the driver from a man and the woman who 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.570
 at the bottom 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.670
 we still testify to them 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.580
 he suspected that giving hope was home 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.430
 at least not but she was still 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.470
 which is quite a bit is doubtful that 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.800
 they are not there like we still do 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.230
 once 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.300
 then there is home then now home so this was it 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.620
 my not sure 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.110
 but afterwards it turned out to be home 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.110
 are in my view not
