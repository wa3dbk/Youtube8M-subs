over<00:00:51.840> my<00:00:52.410> my<00:00:52.800> plants<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.660> don't<00:00:54.660> think<00:00:55.050> I've

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
over my my plants I don't think I've

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.040 
over my my plants I don't think I've
been<00:00:55.380> spraying<00:00:55.740> it<00:00:56.040> with<00:00:56.690> baking<00:00:57.690> soda<00:00:57.930> I

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
been spraying it with baking soda I

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.050 
been spraying it with baking soda I
don't<00:00:58.230> think<00:00:58.440> that's<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> fungus<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.430> think

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
don't think that's the fungus I think

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.260 
don't think that's the fungus I think
that<00:01:00.240> has<00:01:00.390> something<00:01:00.630> to<00:01:00.810> do<00:01:01.050> with<00:01:01.080> the

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
that has something to do with the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.170 
that has something to do with the
mixture<00:01:03.270> they're<00:01:04.110> really<00:01:04.439> good<00:01:04.619> at<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.830> top

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
mixture they're really good at the top

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.490 
mixture they're really good at the top
which<00:01:06.180> led<00:01:06.450> me<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.689> believe<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.259> might<00:01:07.470> be

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
which led me to believe it might be

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.310 
which led me to believe it might be
blight<00:01:08.390> but<00:01:10.009> I'm<00:01:11.009> not<00:01:11.460> sure<00:01:11.700> at<00:01:12.299> any<00:01:12.539> rate<00:01:12.810> I'm

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
blight but I'm not sure at any rate I'm

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.160 
blight but I'm not sure at any rate I'm
getting<00:01:13.560> ready<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.799> trim<00:01:14.100> all<00:01:14.249> these<00:01:14.460> up<00:01:14.759> I

because<00:02:38.069> I'm<00:02:38.340> gonna<00:02:38.430> be<00:02:38.579> going<00:02:38.790> out<00:02:38.909> of<00:02:39.030> town

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150

my wife and Daniel are going to be
taking<00:02:42.750> care<00:02:42.989> of<00:02:43.019> this<00:02:43.879> often<00:02:44.879> so<00:02:45.120> I'm<00:02:45.480> hoping

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
taking care of this often so I'm hoping

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.670 
taking care of this often so I'm hoping
that<00:02:46.459> they<00:02:47.459> can<00:02:47.640> just<00:02:47.849> add<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:48.689> to<00:02:49.500> 20

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
that they can just add this to 20

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.910 
that they can just add this to 20
gallons<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.340> water<00:02:50.549> and<00:02:50.909> my<00:02:51.659> systems<00:02:52.170> clean<00:02:52.769> my

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
gallons of water and my systems clean my

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.559 
gallons of water and my systems clean my
systems<00:02:53.280> out<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.639> put<00:02:53.760> new<00:02:53.970> stuff<00:02:54.239> in<00:02:54.450> it

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
systems out and put new stuff in it

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.830 
systems out and put new stuff in it
every<00:02:55.530> couple<00:02:55.650> weeks<00:02:55.829> while<00:02:56.250> I'm<00:02:56.400> gone

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840

I'm not gonna be gone for extended
periods<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.680> time<00:03:01.889> but<00:03:02.159> if<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.909> falls<00:03:03.180> I'm

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
periods of time but if it falls I'm

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.270 
periods of time but if it falls I'm
trying<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:03.989> set<00:03:04.409> a<00:03:04.439> schedule<00:03:04.650> if<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.040> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
trying to set a schedule if it the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.210 
trying to set a schedule if it the
change<00:03:06.049> for<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.109> nutrient<00:03:07.590> solution<00:03:07.709> falls

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
change for the nutrient solution falls

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.160 
change for the nutrient solution falls
on<00:03:08.609> a<00:03:08.639> time<00:03:08.970> when<00:03:09.150> I<00:03:09.180> am<00:03:09.359> gone<00:03:09.599> they<00:03:09.629> will<00:03:10.019> be

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
on a time when I am gone they will be

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.009 
on a time when I am gone they will be
able<00:03:10.439> to<00:03:10.530> do<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:11.000> but<00:03:12.000> this<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.359> the<00:03:12.569> mixture

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
able to do it but this is the mixture

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.259 
able to do it but this is the mixture
I've<00:03:13.799> already<00:03:14.040> got<00:03:14.159> it<00:03:14.189> I'll<00:03:14.549> figure<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.090> out

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
I've already got it I'll figure it out

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.899 
I've already got it I'll figure it out
for<00:03:15.810> 20<00:03:16.079> gallons<00:03:16.620> actually<00:03:17.549> this<00:03:17.670> one's

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
for 20 gallons actually this one's

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.479 
for 20 gallons actually this one's
figured<00:03:18.209> out<00:03:18.329> for<00:03:18.510> 25<00:03:19.159> because<00:03:20.159> that's<00:03:20.340> what

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
figured out for 25 because that's what

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.819 
figured out for 25 because that's what
I'm<00:03:20.579> putting<00:03:20.879> in<00:03:20.970> here<00:03:23.299> what<00:03:24.299> I<00:03:24.470> do<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.500> I'm

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
support the middle folks I did do it

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.410 
support the middle folks I did do it
over<00:04:31.900> there<00:04:32.020> I<00:04:32.080> took<00:04:32.320> care<00:04:32.500> of<00:04:32.530> that<00:04:32.710> one<00:04:32.890> but

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
over there I took care of that one but

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.180 
over there I took care of that one but
this<00:04:34.420> one<00:04:34.660> failed<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:35.260> when<00:04:35.740> it<00:04:35.830> did<00:04:36.010> it

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
this one failed and when it did it

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.060 
this one failed and when it did it
drained<00:04:36.490> all<00:04:37.000> my<00:04:37.630> nutrient<00:04:38.140> solution<00:04:38.620> out<00:04:38.770> so

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
drained all my nutrient solution out so

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.310 
drained all my nutrient solution out so
I<00:04:39.100> moved<00:04:39.400> it<00:04:39.520> over<00:04:39.580> to<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:39.940> other<00:04:40.030> beds<00:04:40.300> but<00:04:41.290> I

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
I moved it over to the other beds but I

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.070 
I moved it over to the other beds but I
moved<00:04:41.590> everything<00:04:42.100> over<00:04:42.520> here<00:04:42.670> I'm<00:04:43.570> hoping<00:04:43.930> it

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
moved everything over here I'm hoping it

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.690 
moved everything over here I'm hoping it
comes<00:04:44.230> back<00:04:44.500> at<00:04:44.800> support<00:04:45.190> of<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.370> middle

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
comes back at support of the middle

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.940 
comes back at support of the middle
filled<00:04:46.570> it<00:04:46.720> up<00:04:46.840> with<00:04:46.900> some<00:04:47.200> fresh<00:04:47.350> solution

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950
