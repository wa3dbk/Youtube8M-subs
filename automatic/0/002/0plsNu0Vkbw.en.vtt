00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.010
 we start with two red system first beginnings 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.110
 we must be at a gallop 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.340
 secure 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.000
 here we introduce another very thing 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.860
 important 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.430
 before leaving at a gallop we must 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.989
 be sure the trot is accurate 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.700
 the circle is perfect and the horse 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.980
 respect the inner leg that is well 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.480
 supported by external minds well 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.570
 always supported in lightness and me 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.820
 I recommend and that it is not attacked in the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.440
 to the internal network 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.929
 if the horse sticks to the interior 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.940
 as often happens first heaven 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:40.219
 let's take off and then lighten 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.539
 now it seems to me a good balance 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.699
 when you think of the horse it's okay 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.940
 we leave useless to leave if he doesn't know if 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.530
 beauty is not a perfect trot 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.190
 of a nature depends on perfection 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.690
 of the previous nature I teach to 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.420
 young horses galloping away with 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.980
 very little internal contact retinas 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.470
 when you want and for the fall I don't 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.940
 sorry for nothing being good is fine 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:11.460
 I also remember for four years and 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:13.590
 four years then when you return to the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.630
 contact coming back softly, please 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.090
 eh then partner came down and then 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.290
 back to his mouth so very much 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.990
 delicates 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.070
 the 38 very well very well to do it 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.350
 come down down pia viale lenin give up the 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.820
 very good step ok 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.650
 you see that always tends to close a 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.390
 spinning even when it goes down because it was 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.900
 used to doing such a job 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.520
 slowly we will come out here is the exercise 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.590
 of which I spoke earlier 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.940
 so first we have a good trot not 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.480
 be in a hurry to leave if it is not 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.480
 perfect is 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.950
 there gallop without having a trot with 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.950
 full control is absolutely useless 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.040
 ok he had to stimulate her a moment because 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.870
 the mare the mare is very pyre 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.330
 we all know of david inhabitants 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.540
 of oldenburg are very very characters 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.540
 peer 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.850
 well take the reins with your hand 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.200
 external well equal contact working 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.160
 on the large interior for compliance 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.250
 of the leg that does not fall off the inter 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.680
 well well so 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.030
 light internal pressure good 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:37.650
 here he is perfect, very well 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.650
 trot and reins las 30 Jun and Step 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.730
 ok this exercise really a lot 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.590
 very useful that anyone can do because 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.420
 now of the normal this exercise the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.430
 exercises that can really really 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.290
 do anyone except in all this 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.540
 we have neglected a large one 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:06.340
 protagonist is the external leg but how 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:09.010
 you're da fabio unfortunately in a leg 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.330
 external to an external leg and like the 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.820
 he used the big star 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.489
 then when we go to make a 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.910
 for example, they always mark us doing 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:23.550
 what are we turning to the left leg 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:26.980
 internal to the external leg straps are 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.690
 slightly set back very well but 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.180
 because the plague 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:38.290
 to avoid killah horse skidding 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.700
 to the outside but to the horse he drifts 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.040
 outwards 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.540
 so many times so many times no 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.920
 the action of the leg also here is 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.380
 important to understand that the legs do not 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.690
 they must always be active but can 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.720
 being active can be passive 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.330
 they can be there ready along cost 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.610
 to act in the event that the horse 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.000
 do something you shouldn't do 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.530
 therefore society is called laura 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.480
 carousella set back because backward 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.630
 because it contains the hips that go into 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.260
 peace also contains me years of the 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.030
 landing here but it is not said 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.340
 is how many times I have heard that 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.019
 give the inner calm that the version gives 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.609
 the outer leg to contain the drop 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.380
 you must hear it every time you vote 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.810
 from legs to side e 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.780
 forced because it is not necessary 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.510
 leg from date if need then of the 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.820
 natural careers no and to end up in the 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.070
 moment when one of the is needed 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.930
 basic tricks that make trento 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.790
 one of a rider is a rider 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.830

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.620
 want Wednesday afternoon around 4 pm 16 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.750
 type trains what is it? 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.150
 difference that if I internet or 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.090
 intervene at the right time 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.070
 so first a problem is created on 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.320
 horse responds much better and I have not 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.150
 need to do great nations in years 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.980
 forts then sought being seen 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.840
 lose part b with goal lo 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.330
 I straighten out but if I intervene in 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.520
 delay that touched up retouched 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.410
 even more and you started it began 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.940
 fight 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.139
 then we won so this 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.689
 video if anyone has any 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:16.159
