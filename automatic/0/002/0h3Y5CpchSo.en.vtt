00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.820
 Strength 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.800
 i needed 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.490
 In my heart I raised 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.220
 only darkness and the sea of ​​evil. 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.920
 I fell into the abyss 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.820
 losing there is just a way. 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.540
 But then my friends found me 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.300
 and were able to return back. 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.390
 Like a phoenix soar 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.160
 to heaven. 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.600
 I can be different and all for that 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.320
 open eyes. 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.320
 I do not know what is waiting in the future, 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.760
 just hear one thing 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.420
 I am free from the past. 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.910
 After all, what was, then passed. 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.990
 In ambition 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.510
 I believed the power 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.720
 and there was only one way to become free. 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.870
 But now they are gone 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.580
 and I stayed alone 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.470
 But you took me. 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.580
 I know, I need it here. 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.250
 Like a phoenix soar 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.900
 to heaven. 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.820
 I can be different and all for that 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.610
 open eyes. 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.400
 I do not know what is waiting in the future, 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.640
 just hear one thing 

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.400
 I am free from the past. 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.770
 After all, what was, then passed.
