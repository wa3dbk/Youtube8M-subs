up<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.230> up<00:01:01.379> where<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:02.010> would<00:01:02.340> have<00:01:02.520> probably

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
up and up where this would have probably

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.759 
up and up where this would have probably
been<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.359> 8000<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.260> don't<00:01:04.439> really<00:01:04.619> remember

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
but now it's like 11,000 like the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.630 
but now it's like 11,000 like the
numbers<00:01:06.930> are<00:01:07.080> way<00:01:07.710> up<00:01:07.890> there<00:01:07.920> I'm<00:01:08.310> not<00:01:08.369> really

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
numbers are way up there I'm not really

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.210 
numbers are way up there I'm not really
sure<00:01:08.880> why<00:01:09.119> they<00:01:09.150> added<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.049> but<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:11.159> is

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
sure why they added that in but it is

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.770 
sure why they added that in but it is
what<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.970> they<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.150> these<00:01:12.510> things

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
what it is and they have these things

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.440 
what it is and they have these things
called<00:01:12.960> soul<00:01:13.439> stones<00:01:13.830> now<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:15.000> says<00:01:15.270> you

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
called soul stones now so it says you

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.010 
called soul stones now so it says you
can<00:01:15.630> make<00:01:15.780> soul<00:01:16.110> stones<00:01:16.470> using<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:18.060> soul<00:01:18.360> dust

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
can make soul stones using the soul dust

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.410 
can make soul stones using the soul dust
and<00:01:19.530> from<00:01:19.979> what<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.340> figure<00:01:21.030> because<00:01:21.330> I

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and from what I can figure because I

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.270 
and from what I can figure because I
kind<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.689> sped<00:01:22.140> through<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.650> morning<00:01:23.040> but
