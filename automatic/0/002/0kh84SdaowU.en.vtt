lint and they are like I want to say the

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.570 
lint and they are like I want to say the
best<00:00:17.810> low-end<00:00:18.810> brushes<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.920> can<00:00:19.949> buy<00:00:20.279> and

best low-end brushes you can buy and

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.920 
best low-end brushes you can buy and
when<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.760> say<00:00:20.939> Lord<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.390> mean<00:00:21.600> on<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
when I say Lord I mean on the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.560 
when I say Lord I mean on the
inexpensive<00:00:22.740> side<00:00:23.189> these<00:00:23.970> brushes<00:00:24.269> cause

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
inexpensive side these brushes cause

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.830 
inexpensive side these brushes cause
relatively<00:00:25.170> little<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.890> nothing<00:00:26.840> marmalade

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
relatively little to nothing marmalade

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.919 
relatively little to nothing marmalade
cost<00:00:28.080> around<00:00:28.230> twenty<00:00:28.890> bucks<00:00:29.449> now<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.510> reason

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
cost around twenty bucks now the reason

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.220 
cost around twenty bucks now the reason
why<00:00:31.170> I'm<00:00:31.289> thinking<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:31.920> they're<00:00:32.130> so

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
why I'm thinking that they're so

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.350 
why I'm thinking that they're so
inexpensive<00:00:34.230> it's<00:00:34.890> because<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:36.270> know

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
inexpensive it's because you know

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.790 
inexpensive it's because you know
