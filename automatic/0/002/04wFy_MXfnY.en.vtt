00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello here I am again today is the 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.799
 seventeenth october at least felt in 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.480
 reality is the seventeenth of august 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.269
 now come ask a little bit 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.780
 the sun through otherwise we have here 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.029
 autumn storms black clouds the am 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.609
 sky turf had typical 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.490
 autumn weather in principle has it 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.330
 now started very early 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.269
 probably will be even again 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.429
 nice in september or october though 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:32.189
 Of course, that does not work 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.130
 lost summer back neither felt 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.559
 from the feeling still for the harvest around the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.110
 I'll come here now 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.219
 Potatoes on yes has fix in the earth 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.289
 stuck look like this one 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:51.180
 The foliage has died 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:55.440
 meanwhile these were bio potatoes off 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.710
 the supermarket without special names and 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.809
 now I look close were in front 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.280
 everything and everything like that 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.989
 I could have increased this here 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.670
 not at all because 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.210
 nothing comes out i have the very deep 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.680
 set 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.680
 piled up again 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.069
 who have come 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.069
 not up 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.410
 I roughly counted and almost 60 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.130
 with the little ones very big together 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:07.490
 so the biggest one is actually 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:09.590
 yes that's the one she already has here 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.000
 Sixfold, one can say six 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.350
 Potatoes were drinks I could have 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.220
 not thought and not one 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.690
 pitted 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.690
 Unfortunately I have a few at the beginning 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.519
 hurt with the pitchfork then have 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.060
 entrÃ©e does not get that straight anymore 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.430
 to sting purely but rather obliquely 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.350
 as for example that's a shame 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.180
 because I can not camp anymore 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.810
 because I think it's huge for six 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.150
 potatoes 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.760
 There are people who have whole fields 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.080
 they must be full of hundreds of 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.250
 get potatoes out 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:44.030
 But winter will be long 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:47.290
 I'm not always alone 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.290
 the not alone along 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.330
 but more than 20 potatoes i would 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.350
 not stuck in the earth because every day 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.300
 eat potatoes 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.580
 Of course that would also drive me crazy 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.210
 So I can not do that anyway 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.790
 yes, do not cook that often 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.050
 I think that's amazing 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.360
 I'm still guessing which one 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.420
 I'll dig it again too 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.350
 weed out then I want then too 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.640
 put copies on it 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:18.650
 I'm going to buy another hardware store 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:21.320
 garden center big pack blue 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.540
 flowering curls around them still to glow 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.210
 I do not know if it does 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.800
 again mild autumn gives then that can 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.480
 that they lie again if not 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.110
 also not an issue that's the point 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.850
 only a few should be there and is here 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.850
 to enrich the earth nitrogen 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.830
 I will be back next year 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.730
 I'll turn six cards in again 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.000
 the earth is stuck 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.950
 the leave actually would I know 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.500
 not exactly where I store them 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.450
 to be honest i have to go like this anyway 34 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.280
 I have to eat right away I hurt 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:06:00.200
 Actually, I have now here as once 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.480
 Potatoes grown two years ago 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.250
 is forward where I now flowers too 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.990
 there were those of the voles 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.010
 very eaten and then I have 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.130
 also no make up 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:14.600
 since I was not so interrupted 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:17.169
 potatoes it actually I have now 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.080
 try this year again 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:25.129
 I do not have a single one of them 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.599
 the mouse and I think that will be now 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:29.569
 I'm going to be next year 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:32.629
 Swap where the broccoli is eating now 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:36.199
 because the potato now comes the raw 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:37.969
 potato was the broccoli I am there 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:39.739
 Now again this will also soon 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:41.889
 then come out a little something 

00:06:39.739 --> 00:06:41.889
 tuned 

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:55.149
 that was with the potato harvest today 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:55.149
 have nice blood because of your house
