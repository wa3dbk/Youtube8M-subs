00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.610
 today I bring you a fresh recipe and 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.610
 original lots owns watermelon 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.010
 for the base of the sponge cake we are going to 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.520
 need 125 grams of margarine 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.010
 tulip 125 grams of wheat flour 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.680
 125 gr of sugar 5 ml of essence of 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.860
 vanilla 2 eggs and green coloring in 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.860
 gel 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.070
 and here we have the sugar the eggs the 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.570
 vanilla essence the dye the 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.850
 flour and tulip margarine 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.030
 The first thing we are going to do is sift 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.030
 the flour 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.980
 Y 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.260
 and once sifted we reserve it by 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.530
 Moreover we will separate whites 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.530
 the yolk 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.650
 i 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.780
 and once we have the clear ones for a 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.860
 side and the yolks for another let's beat 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.860
 the whites on the verge of snow 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.790
 when they are ready we are going to add 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.560
 the yolks one by one that is to say we add 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.300
 one we keep beating until it 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.920
 fully incorporate and then 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.920
 we add the following 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.340
 and when we have a creamy mix what 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.130
 let's reserve a few minutes while 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.110
 we prepare the next step 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.210
 so on the other hand we're going to put in 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.100
 a bowl the sugar together with the 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.990
 tulip margarine and with the help of a 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.570
 electric blender let's beat up 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.610
 we have left a creamy mixture I 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.220
 I use tulip margarine since it gives more 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.900
 fluffiness to this sponge cake 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.990
 and then whisking let 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.000
 to add the essence of vanilla now 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.610
 that we already have two mixtures we're going to 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.680
 add the mixture of whites and yolks to the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.750
 mixture of tulip margarine and with help 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.840
 of a mixing spoon we are going to 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.780
 mix with enveloping movements 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.929
 next we are going to add the flour 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.929
 sifted 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.510
 Y 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.909
 and once we have a uniform mixture 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:26.569
 we only have to add the coloring 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:28.159
 green gel to taste when baking it goes to 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:33.409
 lose one or two tones so no 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:35.060
 be afraid to add coloring and a 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.040
 Once we have the mixture and a tone 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.170
 we will mark it on the 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.930
 mold that we have chosen I recommend 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.730
 a mold of 23 centimeters since what 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.430
 we want to get is a very 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.950
 now we only have to look at it 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.950
 for 30 minutes at 175 degrees 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.110
 once baked we are going to unmold 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.330
 and now with the help of a cut tarts 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.330
 we are going to eliminate the rind of the sponge cake 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.939
 once we have it we take our 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:24.450
 push-up mounted and we're going to cut the 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.450
 Biscuit 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.099
 once cut we press carefully 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.099
 that does not break to the base 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.239
 and once we have it in the base we are going to 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.370
 do the same procedure since 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.370
 let's put two layers of sponge cake 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.760
 i 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:09.710
 and as you see here we already have them all 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.740
 Now let's prepare the cream cheese 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:16.190
 and we're going to need 200 ml of cream to 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:19.630
 assemble 125 gr of cream cheese 45 grams 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.630
 of sugar and 3 sheets of gelatin 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.330
 and here we have the cream jellies the 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.160
 sugar and cream cheese first thing 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.770
 let's do is put in a saucepan 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.540
 the cream along with the sugar and we're going to 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.540
 stir for the sugar to dissolve 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.009
 while we are going to take a bowl with 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.759
 very cold water and we will put to hydrate 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.759
 the gelatin sheets 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.460
 when we see that the cream is ready 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.620
 of boiling let's take the leaves of 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.010
 We are going to drain gelatin and 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.010
 we add 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.210
 and with the help of the stirring rods 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.310
 until they dissolve and finally 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.530
 when the gelatins have dissolved 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.420
 we add the cream cheese and we're going to 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.020
 continue mixing until we are left 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.020
 a creamy mix 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.090
 when we have it ready we remove it 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.000
 of the fire and let it cool now 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.920
 we are going to dump a small amount of 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.780
 our cream cheese on the sponge cake 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.140
 that we just put inside our 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.140
 push up 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:45.330
 and we 're going to let him qualify 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.330
 approximately one hour 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.080
 while we are preparing the decoration 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:58.249
 and we're going to need a thick slice of 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.249
 watermelon and chocolate nuggets 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.340
 and here we have the pips and the watermelon 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.900
 When the cream has qualified puig 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.700
 let's cut the slice of watermelon and 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.310
 let's do it in the same way that 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.050
 we have cut the cake I recommend 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.640
 that if you have a cutter of the same 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:22.800
 size that push up do it with a 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:24.330
 cutter as it will be lot easier 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.280
 Once we have it we do a little bit of 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.680
 pressure on the watermelon so that it is 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:32.810
 on top of the cream and with the help of a 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.810
 knife we are going to eliminate the excess 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.270
 and the final touch is missing the seeds 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.810
 of chocolate 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.810
 i 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.770
 Well nothing loves you know how to prepare
