00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
mine on eBay so have a look at the hinge

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.069 
mine on eBay so have a look at the hinge
and<00:00:54.210> then<00:00:55.170> have<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> look<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:55.890> websites<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.079> buy

and then have a look on websites and buy

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.869 
and then have a look on websites and buy
a<00:00:58.109> similar<00:00:58.590> one<00:00:58.739> there<00:00:59.190> they<00:00:59.399> are<00:00:59.430> fairly

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
a similar one there they are fairly

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.939 
a similar one there they are fairly
standard<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:01.079> make<00:01:01.230> sure<00:01:01.260> they<00:01:01.590> look<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
standard but make sure they look the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
Mike's out inside and then that would

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.730 
Mike's out inside and then that would
screw<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.909> outer<00:01:15.060> door<00:01:15.630> I'll<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.590> show

we'll support the door you can use up
some<00:02:18.490> tears<00:02:18.850> up<00:02:19.150> here<00:02:19.630> but<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:20.290> can<00:02:20.470> support

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
some tears up here but you can support

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.320 
some tears up here but you can support
the<00:02:20.950> door<00:02:21.160> with<00:02:21.430> something<00:02:21.700> while<00:02:22.150> you're

the door with something while you're
doing<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:22.750> rather<00:02:23.110> than<00:02:23.260> strain<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.310> hinge

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
doing it rather than strain the hinge

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.900

and<00:02:25.500> what<00:02:26.500> we<00:02:26.680> need<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:26.920> do<00:02:27.190> is<00:02:27.340> simply<00:02:27.700> take

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
and what we need to do is simply take

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.800 
and what we need to do is simply take
the<00:02:28.090> door<00:02:28.300> off<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.780> so<00:02:30.210> that's<00:02:31.210> supported

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
the door off and so that's supported

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.950 
the door off and so that's supported
under<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.200> tins<00:02:32.470> so<00:02:32.860> if<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.490> unscrew<00:02:33.970> these<00:02:35.370> so

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
under the tins so if I unscrew these so

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.390 
under the tins so if I unscrew these so
I'm<00:02:37.960> screwed<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:41.080> quite<00:02:41.350> thick<00:02:41.709> chunky

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:56.070 
screws on this way or unscrew those I'm
doing<00:02:47.320> this<00:02:47.410> in<00:02:47.590> reverse<00:02:47.920> order<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:54.840> I'll<00:02:55.840> see

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
doing this in reverse order so I'll see

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.960 
doing this in reverse order so I'll see
the<00:02:56.200> doors<00:02:56.410> being<00:02:56.650> supported<00:02:57.310> by<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.550> tins

if you have any problems with that you
always<00:03:55.690> leave<00:03:55.959> it<00:03:56.170> but<00:03:56.379> you<00:03:56.590> should<00:03:56.770> put<00:03:56.980> a

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
always leave it but you should put a

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.430 
always leave it but you should put a
screw<00:03:57.310> in<00:03:57.340> there<00:03:57.840> should<00:03:58.840> never<00:03:59.020> get<00:03:59.140> screwed

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
screw in there should never get screwed

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.979 
screw in there should never get screwed
over<00:03:59.560> and<00:03:59.860> to<00:04:00.010> do<00:04:00.190> that<00:04:00.400> okay<00:04:01.060> so<00:04:01.510> in<00:04:01.690> this<00:04:01.780> case

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
over and to do that okay so in this case

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.080 
over and to do that okay so in this case
we're<00:04:02.140> done<00:04:02.290> screw<00:04:02.620> that<00:04:02.860> and<00:04:03.700> I'll<00:04:03.819> screw

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
we're done screw that and I'll screw

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.640 
we're done screw that and I'll screw
this<00:04:04.269> one<00:04:04.480> then<00:04:04.720> we<00:04:04.810> take<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.140> bracket<00:04:05.500> off

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
this one then we take the bracket off

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.380 
this one then we take the bracket off
and<00:04:05.890> simply<00:04:06.099> replace<00:04:06.430> it<00:04:06.819> with<00:04:06.910> a<00:04:06.940> new<00:04:07.150> bracket

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
and simply replace it with a new bracket

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.900 
and simply replace it with a new bracket
and<00:04:07.900> then<00:04:08.830> then<00:04:09.099> put<00:04:09.370> it<00:04:09.459> all<00:04:09.550> back<00:04:09.700> together

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
and then then put it all back together

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.650 
and then then put it all back together
so<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:11.340> put<00:04:12.340> it<00:04:12.430> back<00:04:12.580> together<00:04:12.790> it's<00:04:13.390> a

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
so and put it back together it's a

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.940 
so and put it back together it's a
simple<00:04:14.319> case<00:04:14.500> of<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:17.079> reverse<00:04:17.410> to<00:04:17.650> what<00:04:17.769> we've

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
simple case of the reverse to what we've

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:24.450 
simple case of the reverse to what we've
just<00:04:17.979> done<00:04:18.370> so<00:04:18.790> we<00:04:19.150> pull<00:04:19.359> out<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.660> brackets<00:04:23.460> we

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
just done so we pull out the brackets we

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.690 
just done so we pull out the brackets we
just<00:04:24.700> sit<00:04:24.910> that<00:04:24.940> in<00:04:28.650> you<00:04:29.650> go<00:04:29.800> screw<00:04:30.130> daddy<00:04:30.340> I
