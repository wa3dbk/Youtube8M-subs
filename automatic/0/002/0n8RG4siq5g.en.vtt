00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.499 
back a little bit then I just need to
let<00:01:42.350> it<00:01:42.530> dry<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:43.100> I<00:01:43.700> will<00:01:43.880> have<00:01:44.119> something

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.169 
let it dry and I will have something
that<00:01:45.020> looks<00:01:45.049> like<00:01:45.560> this<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.700> this<00:01:46.880> has<00:01:47.030> already

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
that looks like this so this has already

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.899 
that looks like this so this has already
been<00:01:47.329> dry<00:01:47.689> and<00:01:47.959> I<00:01:48.319> just<00:01:48.529> tore<00:01:48.859> the<00:01:49.459> piece<00:01:49.670> in

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
been dry and I just tore the piece in

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.359 
been dry and I just tore the piece in
half<00:01:50.299> so<00:01:51.170> then<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.499> next<00:01:51.649> thing<00:01:51.829> I<00:01:52.039> can<00:01:52.219> do<00:01:52.340> is

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
half so then the next thing I can do is

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.359 
half so then the next thing I can do is
start<00:01:52.969> mixing<00:01:53.329> up<00:01:53.689> my<00:01:54.039> mixture<00:01:55.039> for

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
start mixing up my mixture for

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.609 
start mixing up my mixture for
stenciling<00:01:55.969> and<00:01:56.209> I'm<00:01:56.719> going<00:01:56.990> to<00:01:57.049> use<00:01:57.409> a<00:01:57.439> little

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
chocolate you can get it out now because

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.750

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
means that sometimes you can kind of

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.910 
means that sometimes you can kind of
forget

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
forget

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.980 
forget
about<00:02:18.010> them<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:18.819> I'm<00:02:18.910> going<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.120> mix<00:02:19.360> this<00:02:19.480> with

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
about them so I'm going to mix this with

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.170 
about them so I'm going to mix this with
a<00:02:20.050> little<00:02:20.349> bit<00:02:20.560> of<00:02:20.620> embossing<00:02:21.400> paste<00:02:21.790> white

embossing paste to stencil through and
the<00:02:24.610> reason<00:02:24.819> I'm<00:02:25.120> doing<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.569> because<00:02:25.810> I

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
the reason I'm doing that is because I

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.559

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
deluded in color otherwise I could have

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.220 
deluded in color otherwise I could have
mixed<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.370> with<00:02:48.489> white<00:02:48.730> paint<00:02:49.000> but<00:02:49.780> as<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:50.050> can

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
mixed it with white paint but as you can

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.380 
mixed it with white paint but as you can
see<00:02:50.440> on<00:02:50.590> here<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:50.890> color<00:02:51.100> is<00:02:51.340> very<00:02:51.700> true<00:02:52.150> to

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
see on here the color is very true to

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.330 
see on here the color is very true to
the<00:02:52.510> chalk<00:02:52.810> as<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.410> what<00:02:53.530> I've<00:02:53.650> got<00:02:53.680> on<00:02:53.830> here

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
the chalk as to what I've got on here

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.300 
the chalk as to what I've got on here
and<00:02:54.489> I<00:02:55.090> didn't<00:02:55.420> want<00:02:55.569> it<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.750> be<00:02:55.989> too<00:02:56.019> watery<00:02:56.890> to

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
and I didn't want it to be too watery to

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.949 
and I didn't want it to be too watery to
seek<00:02:57.549> underneath<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.150> stencil<00:02:58.540> so<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:58.690> didn't

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
seek underneath the stencil so I didn't

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.070 
seek underneath the stencil so I didn't
mix<00:02:59.080> it<00:02:59.230> with<00:02:59.380> water<00:02:59.410> so<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:01.330> next<00:03:01.540> thing<00:03:01.720> to

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
mix it with water so the next thing to

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.840 
mix it with water so the next thing to
try<00:03:02.290> would<00:03:02.530> be<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.920> white<00:03:03.130> embossing<00:03:03.459> paste

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
try would be the white embossing paste

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.870 
try would be the white embossing paste

embossing<00:03:40.959> paste<00:03:41.410> looks<00:03:42.070> kind<00:03:42.459> of<00:03:42.519> like<00:03:42.609> this

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
embossing paste looks kind of like this

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.180 
embossing paste looks kind of like this
so<00:03:43.390> as<00:03:43.600> I'm<00:03:44.109> holding<00:03:44.290> my<00:03:44.500> palette<00:03:44.950> knife<00:03:45.100> you

so as I'm holding my palette knife you

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.979 
so as I'm holding my palette knife you
can<00:03:45.220> see<00:03:45.489> it's<00:03:45.609> not<00:03:45.730> dripping<00:03:46.209> off<00:03:46.480> or<00:03:46.690> sliding

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
can see it's not dripping off or sliding

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.380 
can see it's not dripping off or sliding
off<00:03:47.200> it's<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.500> nice<00:03:47.739> texture<00:03:48.280> this<00:03:49.030> is<00:03:49.209> what's

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
off it's a nice texture this is what's

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.410 
off it's a nice texture this is what's
going<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.720> give<00:03:50.049> my<00:03:50.760> chalk<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.790> little<00:03:52.180> bit<00:03:52.299> of

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
going to give my chalk a little bit of

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.009 
going to give my chalk a little bit of
texture<00:03:52.750> as<00:03:52.959> well<00:03:53.430> so<00:03:54.430> again<00:03:55.299> you<00:03:55.510> don't<00:03:55.750> need

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
texture as well so again you don't need

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.130 
texture as well so again you don't need
to<00:03:56.200> mix<00:03:56.440> up<00:03:56.739> very<00:03:57.340> much<00:03:57.459> just<00:03:58.090> enough<00:03:58.359> to<00:03:58.690> get

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
to mix up very much just enough to get

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.170 
to mix up very much just enough to get
whatever<00:03:59.620> portion<00:04:00.070> of<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.400> stencil<00:04:00.850> you<00:04:00.970> want

using the palette knife for this I find
just<00:04:50.680> doesn't<00:04:51.069> give<00:04:51.159> me<00:04:51.280> as<00:04:51.460> much<00:04:51.729> control<00:04:52.240> as

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
just doesn't give me as much control as

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.409 
just doesn't give me as much control as

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
in and I can also tell a little bit

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.689 
in and I can also tell a little bit
better<00:04:59.349> when<00:04:59.470> I<00:04:59.530> use<00:04:59.740> my<00:04:59.770> finger<00:05:00.340> if<00:05:00.520> I'm

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
better when I use my finger if I'm

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.909 
better when I use my finger if I'm
getting<00:05:00.940> around<00:05:01.300> all<00:05:01.569> of<00:05:01.750> those<00:05:01.900> circle<00:05:02.440> areas

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
getting around all of those circle areas

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.689 
getting around all of those circle areas
or<00:05:03.729> if<00:05:03.819> I<00:05:03.969> need<00:05:04.150> to<00:05:04.360> come<00:05:04.629> back<00:05:04.659> and<00:05:05.669> add<00:05:06.669> a

or if I need to come back and add a
little<00:05:06.969> bit<00:05:07.180> more<00:05:07.919> so<00:05:08.919> you<00:05:09.009> could<00:05:09.430> do<00:05:09.669> all<00:05:09.699> of

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:09.969 
little bit more so you could do all of

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:11.879 
little bit more so you could do all of
the<00:05:10.300> dots<00:05:10.509> you<00:05:10.810> could<00:05:10.990> do<00:05:11.139> some<00:05:11.409> of<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.680> dots

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
the dots you could do some of the dots

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.010
