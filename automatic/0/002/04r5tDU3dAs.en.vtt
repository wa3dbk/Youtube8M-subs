know kind of feeling games we've changed

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.930 
know kind of feeling games we've changed
our<00:00:34.410> presentation<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.160> number<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.489> times<00:00:35.730> and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
our presentation a number of times and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.000 
our presentation a number of times and
we've<00:00:36.090> spanned<00:00:36.809> over<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.230> cross<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.890> know

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
we've spanned over the cross of you know

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.850 
we've spanned over the cross of you know
for<00:00:38.730> consoles<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.660> an<00:00:39.870> arcade<00:00:40.260> game<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.770> know

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
for consoles and an arcade game you know

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.979 
for consoles and an arcade game you know
so<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.399> think<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:42.030> haven't<00:00:42.210> been<00:00:42.420> afraid<00:00:42.719> to

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
so I think we haven't been afraid to

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.319 
so I think we haven't been afraid to
change<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.710> formula<00:00:44.040> while<00:00:44.610> keeping<00:00:45.000> kind<00:00:45.210> of

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
change the formula while keeping kind of

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.600 
change the formula while keeping kind of
the<00:00:45.390> things<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.870> really<00:00:45.899> give<00:00:46.440> keep<00:00:47.309> Mortal

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the things that really give keep Mortal

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.790 
the things that really give keep Mortal
Kombat<00:00:47.969> identity<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.930> think<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.530> know

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
Kombat identity so I think it's you know

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.520 
Kombat identity so I think it's you know
not<00:00:50.730> being<00:00:50.969> afraid<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.270> change<00:00:51.530> that's

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
not being afraid to change that's

you perform it with the the d-pad and
the<00:06:08.719> buttons<00:06:09.020> but<00:06:09.289> you<00:06:09.680> don't<00:06:09.830> have<00:06:09.919> the

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:10.009 
the buttons but you don't have the

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:11.290 
the buttons but you don't have the
button<00:06:10.310> input<00:06:10.639> that<00:06:10.759> you<00:06:10.789> have<00:06:10.969> to<00:06:11.180> worry

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
button input that you have to worry

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.749 
button input that you have to worry
about<00:06:11.449> so<00:06:11.750> it's<00:06:11.779> a<00:06:11.960> lot<00:06:12.110> more<00:06:12.729> accessible<00:06:13.729> to

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 
about so it's a lot more accessible to

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.279 
about so it's a lot more accessible to
players<00:06:14.029> who<00:06:14.240> just<00:06:14.270> don't<00:06:14.630> have<00:06:14.870> that<00:06:15.050> kind<00:06:15.229> of

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
players who just don't have that kind of
