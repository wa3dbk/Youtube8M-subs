I've<00:03:23.870> tried<00:03:24.109> really<00:03:24.680> hard<00:03:24.829> to<00:03:25.190> give<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:25.459> a

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
I've tried really hard to give it a

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.610 
I've tried really hard to give it a

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
feeling of space now part of that is

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.069 
feeling of space now part of that is
down<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.220> light<00:03:28.609> colours<00:03:29.180> in<00:03:29.359> here<00:03:29.660> but

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
down to the light colours in here but

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.470 
down to the light colours in here but
also<00:03:30.230> look<00:03:31.040> at<00:03:31.160> these<00:03:31.250> concave<00:03:31.970> cupboards

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
also look at these concave cupboards

also look at these concave cupboards
they<00:03:32.600> really<00:03:32.900> do<00:03:33.140> give<00:03:33.650> an<00:03:33.799> extra<00:03:34.220> feeling<00:03:34.790> of

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
they really do give an extra feeling of

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.849 
they really do give an extra feeling of
spice<00:03:35.180> in<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.510> vehicle<00:03:35.900> but<00:03:36.230> there's<00:03:36.440> still<00:03:36.709> a

spice in the vehicle but there's still a

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.949 
spice in the vehicle but there's still a
decent<00:03:37.280> amount<00:03:37.579> of<00:03:37.910> storage<00:03:38.209> inside<00:03:38.480> and

vehicles 45,000 pounds which is a

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.379 
vehicles 45,000 pounds which is a
sensible<00:03:45.260> price<00:03:45.530> but<00:03:45.829> it's<00:03:46.000> competing<00:03:47.000> with

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
sensible price but it's competing with

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.900 
sensible price but it's competing with
van<00:03:47.630> conversions<00:03:48.230> often<00:03:48.620> it<00:03:48.739> at<00:03:49.069> more<00:03:49.430> more

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
van conversions often it at more more

money than that and yet it's got a

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.530 
money than that and yet it's got a
little<00:03:51.680> bit<00:03:51.889> extra<00:03:52.220> now<00:03:52.819> you<00:03:52.880> can<00:03:53.120> see<00:03:53.359> that

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
little bit extra now you can see that

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.240 
little bit extra now you can see that
this<00:03:53.690> is<00:03:53.870> a<00:03:53.900> narrow<00:03:54.200> bodied<00:03:54.620> vehicle<00:03:55.010> and<00:03:55.160> if

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
there is a compromise it's in the

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.629 
there is a compromise it's in the
