transitional period you know when you go
from<00:00:57.890> one<00:00:58.210> landscape<00:00:59.210> of<00:00:59.360> one<00:00:59.510> topic<00:00:59.960> to

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820

whoever the photographer was who made
the<00:02:03.310> photograph<00:02:03.820> I<00:02:04.320> first<00:02:05.320> understood<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
the photograph I first understood the

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.660 
the photograph I first understood the
idea<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:07.960> how<00:02:08.110> good<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.530> collaboration<00:02:09.220> can<00:02:09.550> be

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
idea of how good a collaboration can be

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.880 
idea of how good a collaboration can be
between<00:02:09.850> a<00:02:10.060> scientist<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:10.959> an<00:02:11.260> artist<00:02:11.620> when<00:02:11.860> I

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
between a scientist and an artist when I

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.590 
between a scientist and an artist when I
started<00:02:12.370> working<00:02:12.549> on<00:02:12.730> volcanoes<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.540> I

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
started working on volcanoes and I

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.990 
started working on volcanoes and I
started<00:02:13.959> doing<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.230> in<00:02:14.560> 2000<00:02:15.220> scientists

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
started doing that in 2000 scientists

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.090 
started doing that in 2000 scientists
are<00:02:16.060> very<00:02:16.090> generous<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.019> I<00:02:17.709> think<00:02:17.950> it's

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
are very generous and I think it's

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.220 
are very generous and I think it's
because<00:02:18.459> they<00:02:19.000> think<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.510> artists<00:02:19.930> are<00:02:19.989> so

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
because they think that artists are so

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.680 
because they think that artists are so
different<00:02:20.769> that<00:02:21.190> they<00:02:21.820> like<00:02:22.060> us<00:02:22.299> and<00:02:22.570> I've

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
different that they like us and I've

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.509 
different that they like us and I've
been<00:02:22.900> very<00:02:23.049> evidence<00:02:23.650> great<00:02:23.860> relationships

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
been very evidence great relationships

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.280 
been very evidence great relationships
with<00:02:24.580> scientists<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:25.299> think<00:02:25.480> we<00:02:25.840> have<00:02:25.959> a<00:02:25.989> lot<00:02:26.170> in

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
with scientists I think we have a lot in

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.910 
with scientists I think we have a lot in
common

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
common

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.250 
common
I<00:02:26.950> do<00:02:27.040> science<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:28.000> extremely<00:02:28.510> creative<00:02:29.080> I

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
I do science is extremely creative I

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.940 
I do science is extremely creative I
love<00:02:30.690> understanding<00:02:31.690> how<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.320> world<00:02:32.500> works

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
love understanding how the world works

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.130 
love understanding how the world works
and<00:02:33.250> that's<00:02:33.820> what<00:02:34.060> scientists<00:02:34.690> do<00:02:34.840> especially

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
and that's what scientists do especially

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.580 
and that's what scientists do especially
geologists<00:02:36.360> landscape<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.290> way<00:02:38.410> the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
geologists landscape and the way the

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.360 
geologists landscape and the way the
earth<00:02:38.799> is<00:02:39.130> built<00:02:39.519> just<00:02:39.940> fascinates<00:02:40.540> me<00:02:40.690> so

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
earth is built just fascinates me so

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.830 
earth is built just fascinates me so
scientists<00:02:42.370> geologists<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:43.450> you<00:02:43.720> know

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
scientists geologists and you know

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.479 
scientists geologists and you know
there's<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.200> great<00:02:44.380> rapport<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:44.890> think<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.370> we

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
there's a great rapport I think that we

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.380 
there's a great rapport I think that we
have<00:02:45.700> with<00:02:45.880> each<00:02:46.030> other<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:46.930> treasure<00:02:47.260> it
