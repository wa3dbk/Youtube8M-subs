light I'll show you the part numbers
here<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:28.920> just<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.160> moment<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> dubrow

superlight 3 inch wheels I know 3 inch

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.160 
superlight 3 inch wheels I know 3 inch
is<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> little<00:00:32.489> overkill<00:00:32.850> but<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:33.989> not

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
is a little overkill but it's not

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.280

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
you're gonna put in there so the wheels

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.040 
you're gonna put in there so the wheels

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
these planes there's been a lot of

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.750 
these planes there's been a lot of
complaints<00:01:01.469> about<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.250> changed<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.730> up

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
complaints about that so I changed it up

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.719 
complaints about that so I changed it up
for<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> dubrow<00:01:03.539> landing<00:01:04.260> gear<00:01:04.489> I'll<00:01:05.489> show<00:01:05.670> you

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
for a dubrow landing gear I'll show you

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.830 
for a dubrow landing gear I'll show you
the<00:01:05.820> parts<00:01:06.030> for<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.210> as<00:01:06.420> well

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
the parts for that as well

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.370 
the parts for that as well
the<00:01:07.439> front<00:01:08.070> landing<00:01:08.369> gear<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:09.229> actually<00:01:10.229> just

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the front landing gear is actually just

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.350 
the front landing gear is actually just
bent<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.070> put<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> vice<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.970> normally

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
bent I just put it on a vice it normally

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.100 
bent I just put it on a vice it normally
comes<00:01:12.510> straight

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
comes straight

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.320 
comes straight
it's<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:13.770> normally<00:01:14.010> straight<00:01:14.280> down<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.299> I

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
it's just normally straight down so I

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.910 
it's just normally straight down so I
basically<00:01:15.659> put<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.960> vice<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.229> bent<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.770> at<00:01:16.890> a

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
basically put on a vice and bent it at a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.690 
basically put on a vice and bent it at a
90<00:01:17.130> degrees<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:20.250> sand<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.549> down<00:01:20.580> a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
90 degrees and I just sand it down a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.490 
90 degrees and I just sand it down a
little<00:01:20.909> bit<00:01:21.030> on<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.270> top<00:01:21.509> right<00:01:21.869> inside<00:01:22.200> there

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
little bit on the top right inside there

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.260 
little bit on the top right inside there
so<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.220> way<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.580> collar<00:01:23.820> would<00:01:24.060> have

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
so that way that collar would have

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.480 
so that way that collar would have
something<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.600> actually<00:01:25.040> butt<00:01:26.040> up<00:01:26.159> against

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
something to actually butt up against

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.719 
something to actually butt up against
and<00:01:26.820> same<00:01:27.450> thing<00:01:27.659> they're<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:28.640> collar<00:01:29.640> on

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
and same thing they're just a collar on

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.149 
and same thing they're just a collar on
the<00:01:29.939> side<00:01:30.150> there<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.840> one<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> side<00:01:31.860> there

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the side there and one on the side there

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.350 
the side there and one on the side there
and<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.840> only<00:01:33.930> changes<00:01:34.350> after<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.860> I

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
and the only changes after that I

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.420 
and the only changes after that I
believe<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.900> would<00:01:37.530> always<00:01:37.710> advise<00:01:38.159> take

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
believe is I would always advise take

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.219 
believe is I would always advise take
these<00:01:38.670> zip<00:01:38.850> ties<00:01:38.880> here<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.020> get<00:01:40.140> them

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
these zip ties here you can get them

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.859 
these zip ties here you can get them
anywhere<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.890> put<00:01:41.549> them<00:01:43.610> on<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:45.450> these<00:01:45.689> little

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
anywhere and put them on on these little

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.260 
anywhere and put them on on these little
line<00:01:46.140> basically<00:01:46.950> these<00:01:47.159> control<00:01:47.520> horns<00:01:47.880> they

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
line basically these control horns they

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.999 
line basically these control horns they
don't<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> very<00:01:48.899> good<00:01:49.170> big<00:01:49.470> pivot<00:01:49.649> entity

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
don't have a very good big pivot entity

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.740
