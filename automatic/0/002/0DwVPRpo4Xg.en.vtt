00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.660
 hello to all of you it's never 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.390
 we meet again for a new breakfast 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.430
 as usual we are Friday and 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.410
 who says Friday necessarily says a good 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.360
 little treat before the little weekend 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.430
 so this is the last day of the 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.900
 school week rather for those who 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.939
 are going on I understand you tonight 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.380
 it means weekend so I 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.480
 opens a premium shock poster for 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.130
 the opportunity always the same series because 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.930
 that this is the series that will come out 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.700
 it's the one I like most 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.070
 want to discover and I think you 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.510
 so that I do not do it again except 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.550
 that today we will change a little bit of 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.800
 copper and wholesale which since we are going to 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.989
 look at the illustration of mega the 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.090
 kings look at me how to help handsome 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.590
 besides I told the series finally I 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.390
 said in yesterday's breakfast that the 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.769
 series was really red and blue but 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.750
 it's not just red and blue 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.550
 look and we can see that premium where is 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.800
 written in gray so it's a little 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.629
 reference to the steel type is therefore brought 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.280
 gaga kings it's a little twinkling 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.019
 that's pretty good 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.150
 pokemon goes well with who groudon 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.000
 frankly it really has it all for 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.440
 to please with its devastating force 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.050
 spectacular it's really strength 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.640
 brute in equality 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.830
 so here is the back of booster man like 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.420
 usually and me personally I 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.830
 goes to 100 opening I can not wait to 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.120
 see what we will discover as 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.850
 new map because for the moment 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.560
 I have not opened tons yet 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.940
 every new booster I discover at 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.740
 less a new illustration 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.450
 and I think today it will be 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.150
 still the case we will see 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.580
 go we left with this new 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.100
 booster and today we will start 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.930
 by that roquier well psy type he 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.760
 is not fighting type of course 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.110
 I said that in my opening of 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.550
 four booster but I had not done 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.370
 attention and I apologize for that 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.590
 good let's see the next map 1 co which 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.480
 perlent hockey behind we will have a 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.100
 nest of oran in females one still has 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.660
 not seen the bad I do not know 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.240
 if there really is an evil in this series 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.070
 there we go on with a bag of knots 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.830
 that one we already met quite a lot of 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.540
 once a him want me I'm not 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.890
 sure to have seen it before but I'm not 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.619
 not a fan of illustration 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.660
 good not bad anyway like pokemon of 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.700
 rats I did not think to find him 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.890
 to observe it from the observations of the 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.970
 seco teacher as a trainer knows that is 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.560
 the name that I gave to my name 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.819
 will 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.200
 led by this play so it makes me a little 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.870
 smile now every time I 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.489
 see this teacher behind us will have 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.310
 an unusual funeral 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.560
 not bad I feel he is at 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.090
 bottom of the abyss besides these attacks 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.340
 are a bit odd since he does not decide 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.440
 it does not require an electric type 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.920
 while it is electric type and at 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.260
 ok ok normal we will chained behind 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.060
 with flo viougeas of an organic flow it is 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.840
 super this pokemon and I would like to 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.239
 shoot the discontent 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.910
 we continue with a rivers upstairs she 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.440
 is beautiful she is very beautiful so he 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.790
 is the river but it's a map 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.410
 that we call very ancient I have them 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.910
 discovered thanks to you since in the 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.540
 comments in the first video on 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.670
 first shock 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.110
 you made me understand that I 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.670
 did not have good knowledge of 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.930
 this series since I never had 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.640
 discovered again before that was the 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.470
 first time and you told me all 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.630
 that these cards are called cards very 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.519
 ancient so I think it has a name 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.040
 a little weird it's just me 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.989
 but now they will be called the map 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.209
 very antique semi art crowd good we're going 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.340
 to say very ancient and it's sorry a 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.900
 little with the new design this is it 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.060
 a little like scarves except that it 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.350
 only occupies for small pokemon 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.970
 such as common the unusual 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.040
 not necessarily ultra small fashion 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.170
 threats like frog who had in 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.760
 anyway here in my opinion it's even a 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.260
 holographic it's a holographic 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.120
 very antique I do not really know 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.859
 how to formulate it but in any case 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.549
 case it's a nice card that I think 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.920
 we agree 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:44.489
 let's see if we will be spoiled again 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.200
 behind attention 1 2 3 1 2 it will be 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.760
 a simple rare yeah well we do not care 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.310
 of the rare in fact we will linger on 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.569
 flying car open is so beautiful good 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.260
 still not some you are 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.500
 maybe see art 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.030
 it's about crazy standards that looks like 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.170
 throw something in my opinion it's 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.150
 something that is hanging on to him 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.970
 normally his arm or I do not know what 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.639
 good good good good this not an illustration 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.989
 quest I hang at 100% but behind 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:11.760
 voltaire in super super mode beautiful map 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.440
 it is not enough to have necessarily a 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.959
 renting the rivers can all you give 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.150
 you see a great pokemon brazier 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.799
 indomitable yeah super nice card 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.810
 frankly I hang every ruck 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.330
 I hang very good booster I am 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.880
 good game good we spreads the little 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.240
 kart the little pile of cards on the side 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.169
 that's it for this breakfast that lasted 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.759
 by the way a little longer than 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.710
 usually in four minutes 22 it's me 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:35.180
 does not look like I hope he'll have you 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.229
 more and you will enjoy 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.880
 by the way it was still hot 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.440
 hot hot a flight because in small mode 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.000
 already I do not understand what he 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.380
 came to do but in any case we 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.840
 always discover new cards 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.789
 it fascinates me and I love it I hope 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.050
 that you too will meet tomorrow 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.039
 for a new breakfast 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.720
 normally there may be a new 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.840
 video that will come out in the afternoon a 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.009
 be vigilant it's possible but me 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.289
 in any case you are sure that tomorrow 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:00.620
 you'll have a breakfast that's innate 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.180
 changeable under his defense yes that's it in 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.229
 Any case wear well until tomorrow
