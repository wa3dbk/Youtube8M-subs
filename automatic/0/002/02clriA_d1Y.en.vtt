significantly impacted when the uterus

significantly impacted when the uterus
is<00:01:07.680> removed<00:01:08.130> because<00:01:08.640> there's<00:01:09.030> two<00:01:09.270> primary

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
is removed because there's two primary

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.590 
is removed because there's two primary
pathways<00:01:10.320> for<00:01:11.159> blood<00:01:11.399> flow<00:01:11.759> to<00:01:11.820> your<00:01:12.060> ovaries

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
pathways for blood flow to your ovaries

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.249 
pathways for blood flow to your ovaries
one<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:14.040> through<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.399> aorta<00:01:14.969> and<00:01:15.180> two<00:01:15.960> is

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
one is through the aorta and two is

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.770 
one is through the aorta and two is
through<00:01:16.829> the<00:01:16.920> uterus<00:01:17.310> when<00:01:18.149> the<00:01:18.240> uterus<00:01:18.539> has

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
through the uterus when the uterus has

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.889 
through the uterus when the uterus has
removed<00:01:19.289> the<00:01:19.740> blood<00:01:20.369> flow<00:01:20.789> to<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> ovaries

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
removed the blood flow to the ovaries

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.920 
removed the blood flow to the ovaries
lessens<00:01:22.590> significantly<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.930> consequently

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
lessens significantly and consequently

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.560 
lessens significantly and consequently
your<00:01:25.439> hormone<00:01:26.039> production<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.820> reduced<00:01:27.829> now

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
your hormone production is reduced now

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.760 
your hormone production is reduced now
following<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.780> removal<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.229> your<00:01:31.409> uterus

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
following the removal of your uterus

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.120 
following the removal of your uterus
your<00:01:32.369> ovaries<00:01:32.969> will<00:01:33.180> initially<00:01:33.570> try<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.950> their

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
your ovaries will initially try to their

your ovaries will initially try to their
best<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.850> usual<00:01:36.689> jump<00:01:37.100> but<00:01:38.100> within<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.549> early

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
best and usual jump but within as early

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.510 
best and usual jump but within as early
as<00:01:39.570> two<00:01:40.079> years<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.710> hysterectomy<00:01:41.369> that

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
as two years of the hysterectomy that

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.170 
as two years of the hysterectomy that
can<00:01:42.000> begin<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.509> atrophy<00:01:42.689> or<00:01:43.380> shrink<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
can begin to atrophy or shrink and the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.289 
can begin to atrophy or shrink and the
hormone<00:01:45.689> output<00:01:45.869> becomes<00:01:46.679> minimal<00:01:47.369> or<00:01:47.549> none

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
hormone output becomes minimal or none

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.919 
hormone output becomes minimal or none
by<00:01:49.020> about<00:01:49.259> five<00:01:49.679> years<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.340> many<00:01:51.119> many<00:01:51.539> women

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
by about five years in many many women

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.490 
by about five years in many many women
as<00:01:52.289> we<00:01:52.530> said<00:01:52.770> 50%<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.820> fact<00:01:54.810> I've<00:01:55.140> talked<00:01:55.380> to

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
as we said 50% in fact I've talked to

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.980 
as we said 50% in fact I've talked to
some<00:01:55.770> GYN<00:01:56.399> doctors<00:01:56.850> who<00:01:57.060> say<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.479> ovarian

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
some GYN doctors who say that ovarian

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.800 
some GYN doctors who say that ovarian
function<00:01:58.200> can<00:01:58.890> cease<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.609> early<00:02:00.149> as<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.479> first

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
function can cease as early as the first

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.580 
function can cease as early as the first
year<00:02:01.350> after<00:02:02.100> hysterectomy<00:02:03.090> well<00:02:04.049> then<00:02:04.289> what

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
year after hysterectomy well then what

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.639 
year after hysterectomy well then what
then<00:02:05.520> your<00:02:05.939> adrenal<00:02:06.600> glands<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.380> take

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
then your adrenal glands have to take

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.830 
then your adrenal glands have to take
over<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.220> do<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.820> job<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> hormone

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
over and do the job of the hormone

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.070 
over and do the job of the hormone
production<00:02:10.310> however<00:02:11.310> as<00:02:12.150> most<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.050> know

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
production however as most of you know

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.229 
production however as most of you know
we<00:02:13.590> live<00:02:13.769> in<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.980> stressful<00:02:14.280> environment<00:02:14.519> and

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
we live in a stressful environment and

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.590 
we live in a stressful environment and
our<00:02:15.360> adrenals<00:02:16.050> are<00:02:16.140> very

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
our adrenals are very

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.260 
our adrenals are very
busy<00:02:17.110> making<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.680> stress<00:02:18.040> hormone<00:02:18.520> cortisol

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
busy making that stress hormone cortisol

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.040 
busy making that stress hormone cortisol
and<00:02:19.620> therefore<00:02:20.620> they<00:02:21.040> do<00:02:21.100> not<00:02:21.490> make<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.480> lot<00:02:23.020> of

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
and therefore they do not make a lot of

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.840 
and therefore they do not make a lot of
the<00:02:23.290> steroid<00:02:23.860> hormones<00:02:24.280> which<00:02:24.550> is<00:02:24.700> your

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
the steroid hormones which is your

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.240 
the steroid hormones which is your
estrogen<00:02:25.300> your<00:02:25.930> progesterone<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.950> your
