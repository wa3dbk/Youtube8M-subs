00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.059
 after an hour before the match always finds fun 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.630
 certainly here 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.630
 very nice stadium ansell the competition center 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.429
 that is what makes the stadium so special 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.589
 vianen the next I think it's too far 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.800
 It is not known who played the role of nearly four tons 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.960
 it is 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.100
 does not mean the beach tent or twins but I love the company 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.460
 statements there gives a role 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.460
 but nice weather 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.510
 this is a the bottom of 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.920
 be assured of success always for 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.210
 all 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.700
 traditional places on wembley 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.930
 but the message 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.680
 oosterpark 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.650
 but still just this find this so much better 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.850
 and I have forgotten the oosterpark actually it is strong that strongest 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.049
 Obama did this is so much better rider everyone has questions about 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.980
 this was very successful 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.630
 presumably it is as a footballer 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.790
 that you play your own stadium with its two suspicious men who only 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.120
 be for you 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.110
 yes that is a woman the victim a romanian of the field remains the same 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.650
 yet 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.950
 that is where you feel you are 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.090
 more cozy at home with you she doesn't know 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.880
 you have no orientation world to achieve that this would be familiar 10 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.569
 but good they are also if you have a very good team that put right there 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.469
 i thought i was ajax for half an hour the whole big time 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.060
 the crossing of the zoo 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.260
 that typical guitar pleasure a cross in belgrade for under german man the 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.430
 lots of cheating you know you can get something out of it 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.980
 the prologue in Amsterdam 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.540
 but I also liked it 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.240
 but I was just not as good as Clijsters at slightly less in ten years 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.929
 not driven 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.209
 Little Ryanair too 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.129
 then you have to be very strong if you want 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.999
 attacking it actually turned out that ajax would drop when it smells how come that 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:22.159
 You never forget you played two more games 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.909
 yes those years that there is interest 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.679
 He wants me to talk to her for two minutes 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:32.779
 I think he was a fence man, the car clashed with measures 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:35.779
 all for your time shows i only have an award 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:40.439
 but the one I was maybe not so good at the time, but Anderlecht only looked at it 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.119
 signals 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:45.149
 the tastes differed there 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:47.989
 and I honestly will too 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.979
 rather to a top club than her five years ago 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.539
 year 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.500
 who thought no more was over 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.620
 but yes i want to go to a top club hand 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.259
 I won't let him go 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:03.469
 vw's CEO has two five years 2 when ajax van vliet will 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:03.879
 fall
