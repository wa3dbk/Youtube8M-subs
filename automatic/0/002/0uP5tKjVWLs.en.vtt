00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.589

 I did not want to resume open a 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.359
 michael could open an office since the nintendo controls 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.369
 prompted the products have a type of screw 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.670
 very weird I do not know what kind of disarmed savior is needed but van antonsson 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.230
 its use this danger control 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.460
 once the data is not mine we open it 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.680
 We were going to the plate just like any other control of any other console 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.740
 the process does the same in analyzed sections 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.090
 here we have percent 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.450
 the metal plates divided in two 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.360
 what the presenting buttons part 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.060
 tx and greek 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.560
 stacy let's solder the buttons 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.640
 Well, as you know, it's the metal plate and in two 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.090
 p in each half 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.160
 let's let go 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.740
 percent 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.740
 a cable that will be headed asia 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.790
 the button then here we have the first tomes omar the buttons 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.730
 here is the start button is exactly the same a split plate 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.890
 in two metal 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.210
 for the movements we are going to use the 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.990
 and if we look at it, it's exactly the same 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.179
 metal plate and two brave soldiers make 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.620
 to each half 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.810
 a cable that veiga our 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.340
 button 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.800
 external 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.030
 p inc 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.770
 bottom up 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.410
 Left Right 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.560
 just like with those buttons is exactly the same only these 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.670
 they are going to direct 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.840
 or what 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.700
 yesterday we prayed the fireman or the z button of the quinqui oo and he decides 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.580
 clean 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.840
 i here are this would the button be both 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.390
 i efe just like the van persie 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.260
 in the xbox 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.539
 let's go hoist these two dots 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.439
 welding 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:17.900
 i in them we are going to face in each one a cable that is going to go to our 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.179
 external button 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:23.169
 it's the same procedure as any other button we just observe 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:25.889
 use these two 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:27.809
 p welding spot 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.889
 because the one that we only lack the castles 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.889
 the triggers are very easy to 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:36.649
 of welding 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:39.649
 bean that's the left trigger 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:43.839
 from this side 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:45.139
 we have 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.489
 the right trigger and if they are fixed it is exactly the same 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:50.989
 a metal plate 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.989
 divided in two that the one that uses us to weld 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.809
 and in banamex case it would be all the analysis d a control of kim ki-duk 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.999
 the procedure is the only thing that neither another video 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:05.269
 and good 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.269
 good luck for those who want artistic pacers 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.159
 with a control and that in chile
