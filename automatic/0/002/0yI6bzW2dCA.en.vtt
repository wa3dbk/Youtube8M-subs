00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 and that he told himself the rails and we 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.859
 found fallen boxing of the ps4 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.360
 with the big pack theft auto 5 so we 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:15.049
 will proceed right away unpacking 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:18.049
 and here we go, white card 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.049
 here 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.960
 and so that's it so I had you 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.390
 says it's the grand theft auto pack 5 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.809
 what is the famous aschoff 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.379
 4 and yes the dualshock 4 who still 

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:36.739
 continued in the nave of improvement 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:40.070
 colors so here we will remove the 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.629
 protections here's the protection and 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.059
 here and frankly she is very beautiful 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.829
 we can observe the LED which calais of 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.680
 each fuller that replaces the numbers 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.750
 the new touchpad that 's more fine 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.640
 who remains supported and the new jacket 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.390
 dear so that's going to be it's going to allow 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.149
 to send to his friends on facebook 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.489
 parties that you finally worship gods 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.330
 boots for call of and chew and one 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.100
 can observe a niekro usb crisis that 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.020
 is also visible on phones 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.880
 portable the joystick they were 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.950
 dug so still we have it better in 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.280
 hand we have a kind of grid that is 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.440
 not bad 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.840
 we really care about it 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.710
 hand is a great team and we can 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.490
 see that the triggers there down they 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.590
 were dug what before the summer enough 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.850
 round curvy and suddenly we tend to 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.880
 slide for the big gamer who 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.320
 was sweating so that's not really 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.570
 slip more so it's still a 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.820
 advantage and we talked about cables 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.820
 so with a power cable that 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.840
 is pretty late really very small month 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.909
 he is not very far 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.479
 frankly he is short he must not 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.039
 do a lot of things wait, we'll see that 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.210
 no it's really not long we can 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.939
 see it's really not really not 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.259
 long then we will watch the cable ah 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.850
 that's it to reload the controller 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.200
 we 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.880
 so that's for the charge of the controller 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.250
 as we can see it's the micro usb 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.100
 so the joystick 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.540
 this is forgiveness I am voices rise 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.340
 in Europe 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.300
 and that's it plugs into usb it's not 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.239
 not very far either huh 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.069
 frankly if we want to play we have the case 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.700
 which is still very important 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.940
 the cable hdmi then we'll have it 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.220
 you'll get there is it's really the 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.860
 basic trick we put that in the ear the 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.739
 little micro here and now we pass 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.810
 we really big with the big 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.930
 machine with the beautiful machine plants 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.550
 waited so that's still the part 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.840
 the most important because if we have 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.840
 all about the ps4 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.580
 it may not be too much to do it myself 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.290
 she's going really well packed ya a lot 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.299
 of cartons and the polystyrene we have 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.060
 used to see her skates and oil 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.760
 buttons then there must be seen between them 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.220
 between here and there I saw you via the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.140
 button to open and the button to 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.000
 turn it on so we have two usb sockets on 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.280
 will keep prices what's behind 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.410
 the rebound observed taking hdmi that's it 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.690
 the internet and that 's it's an auxiliary 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.410
 and there we can observe the taking 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.820
 frankly feed the mouth on 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.579
 will say it and attacked it frankly 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.770
 it is very beautiful console and that's his life 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:18.950
 a day of gta 5 we can see 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:23.200
 and ska agree and well I tell you 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.200
 ciao hello hi next
