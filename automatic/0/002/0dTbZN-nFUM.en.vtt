close<00:00:25.630> tonight<00:00:26.490> when<00:00:27.490> you<00:00:27.580> power<00:00:27.820> it<00:00:27.880> up<00:00:28.030> all

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
close tonight when you power it up all

sort of mode you can wind up following

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.740 
sort of mode you can wind up following
his<00:00:32.800> pickle<00:00:33.100> point<00:00:33.340> and<00:00:34.270> just<00:00:34.300> get<00:00:34.660> an

sudden you'll go into a walk and when he
gets<00:00:39.699> up<00:00:39.910> to<00:00:40.120> full<00:00:40.749> speed<00:00:40.899> to<00:00:41.199> see<00:00:41.379> things<00:00:41.620> that

00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:41.679 
gets up to full speed to see things that

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:45.110 
gets up to full speed to see things that
he<00:00:41.800> wants<00:00:42.129> all<00:00:42.879> of<00:00:43.239> a<00:00:43.269> sudden<00:00:43.570> will<00:00:43.659> go<00:00:43.809> into<00:00:43.989> a

the<00:00:56.469> remote<00:00:56.679> control<00:00:57.039> is<00:00:57.219> again<00:00:57.489> PlayStation

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
the remote control is again PlayStation

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.329 
the remote control is again PlayStation
2<00:00:58.300> styling<00:00:58.749> and<00:00:58.960> it<00:00:59.440> allows<00:00:59.589> me<00:00:59.769> to<00:00:59.800> have<00:01:00.010> full

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.810 

reset<00:01:10.810> them<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:11.049> the<00:01:11.110> top<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:12.430> cool<00:01:12.670> thing

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
reset them to the top the cool thing

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.730 
reset them to the top the cool thing
about<00:01:12.880> it<00:01:13.119> is<00:01:13.180> that<00:01:13.210> can<00:01:13.509> also<00:01:13.600> select<00:01:13.960> remote

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
about it is that can also select remote

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.830 
about it is that can also select remote
control<00:01:15.130> where<00:01:15.490> it<00:01:15.610> is<00:01:15.700> that<00:01:15.850> it<00:01:15.939> goes<00:01:16.090> so

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
control where it is that it goes so

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.670 
control where it is that it goes so
follow<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.469> pickle<00:01:17.770> point<00:01:18.009> until<00:01:18.880> you<00:01:18.969> will

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
follow the pickle point until you will

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.980 
follow the pickle point until you will
turn<00:01:20.680> as<00:01:20.829> you<00:01:20.860> see<00:01:21.250> and<00:01:22.060> where<00:01:22.240> that<00:01:22.479> goes

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
turn as you see and where that goes

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.270 
turn as you see and where that goes
that's<00:01:23.140> where<00:01:23.320> you'll<00:01:23.469> go<00:01:23.710> eventually<00:01:24.009> as

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
that's where you'll go eventually as

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.990 
that's where you'll go eventually as
well<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.890> remote<00:01:27.070> control<00:01:27.399> basically<00:01:27.759> is

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
well the remote control basically is

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.730 
well the remote control basically is
okay<00:01:28.329> but<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.630> fact<00:01:28.659> this<00:01:28.930> is<00:01:29.049> not<00:01:29.200> necessary

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
okay but the fact this is not necessary

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.639 
okay but the fact this is not necessary
if<00:01:30.310> you<00:01:30.430> pull<00:01:30.700> on<00:01:30.939> the<00:01:31.060> toy<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:32.560> is

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
if you pull on the toy it is

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.740 
if you pull on the toy it is
electrically<00:01:33.100> pull<00:01:33.399> the<00:01:33.490> tail<00:01:33.729> you<00:01:34.630> can

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
electrically pull the tail you can

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.899 
electrically pull the tail you can
tickle<00:01:34.899> them<00:01:35.079> under<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.320> chin<00:01:35.640> guess<00:01:36.640> this

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
tickle them under the chin guess this

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.270 
tickle them under the chin guess this
one's<00:01:37.210> not<00:01:37.450> through<00:01:37.920> you're<00:01:38.920> foolish<00:01:39.189> enough

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
one's not through you're foolish enough

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.969 
one's not through you're foolish enough
to<00:01:39.430> put<00:01:39.670> your<00:01:39.759> finger<00:01:40.060> in<00:01:40.180> his<00:01:40.210> mouth<00:01:40.710> he<00:01:41.710> will

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
to put your finger in his mouth he will

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:48.389 
to put your finger in his mouth he will
bite<00:01:42.549> and<00:01:42.759> chew<00:01:46.530> responds<00:01:47.530> directionally<00:01:48.250> to

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
bite and chew responds directionally to

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:57.240 
bite and chew responds directionally to
sound<00:01:52.890> what<00:01:53.890> was<00:01:54.009> potential<00:01:54.460> signal<00:01:56.250> then

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
sound what was potential signal then

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.499 
sound what was potential signal then
evening<00:01:57.520> out<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.729> remote<00:01:57.909> control<00:01:58.240> though<00:01:58.450> is

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
evening out the remote control though is

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.749 
evening out the remote control though is
that<00:01:58.780> white<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.469> the<00:01:59.530> box<00:01:59.740> is<00:01:59.920> a<00:01:59.950> wild<00:02:00.310> dinosaur

that white of the box is a wild dinosaur
is<00:02:01.119> after<00:02:01.479> exploring

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
is after exploring

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.109 
is after exploring
he<00:02:02.350> also<00:02:02.469> has<00:02:02.649> a<00:02:02.710> curious<00:02:03.070> mode<00:02:03.340> but<00:02:03.909> the<00:02:03.999> up

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
he also has a curious mode but the up

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.370 
he also has a curious mode but the up
pants<00:02:04.420> really<00:02:04.600> need<00:02:04.780> is<00:02:04.960> you<00:02:05.109> can<00:02:05.259> actually

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
pants really need is you can actually

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.709 
pants really need is you can actually
change<00:02:05.829> the<00:02:06.159> way<00:02:06.280> he<00:02:06.429> basically<00:02:06.700> thinks<00:02:06.999> so

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
change the way he basically thinks so

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:09.240 
change the way he basically thinks so
for<00:02:07.899> example<00:02:08.229> if<00:02:08.289> I<00:02:08.380> don't<00:02:08.560> have<00:02:08.770> to<00:02:08.860> fight<00:02:09.070> my

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
for example if I don't have to fight my
