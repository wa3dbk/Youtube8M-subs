level 16 is going to be backstab and

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.690 
level 16 is going to be backstab and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
then 17 and 18 are going to be magnified

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.450 
then 17 and 18 are going to be magnified
paint<00:01:51.500> we<00:01:52.500> come<00:01:52.680> back<00:01:52.799> over<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.189> the

paint we come back over to the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.950 
paint we come back over to the
bladedancer<00:01:53.670> tree<00:01:54.270> for<00:01:54.479> our<00:01:54.570> additional

bladedancer tree for our additional
point<00:01:55.229> we're<00:01:55.680> going<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.829> put<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.130> in

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
point we're going to put that in

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.859 
point we're going to put that in
reprisal<00:01:56.549> there<00:01:58.070> then<00:01:59.070> moving<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.869> four

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
reprisal there then moving on four

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.109 
reprisal there then moving on four
levels<00:02:01.049> 19<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.890> 20<00:02:02.250> we're<00:02:02.549> going<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.729> put<00:02:02.880> two

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
levels 19 and 20 we're going to put two

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.840 
levels 19 and 20 we're going to put two
points<00:02:03.479> into<00:02:03.659> cruel<00:02:04.170> vengeance<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.799> level<00:02:05.520> 21

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
points into cruel vengeance and level 21

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.490 
points into cruel vengeance and level 21
we're<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.390> come<00:02:06.570> up<00:02:06.659> here<00:02:06.689> for<00:02:06.899> improved

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
we're going to come up here for improved

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.160 
we're going to come up here for improved
stealth<00:02:07.860> which<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:09.060> best<00:02:09.330> thing<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:10.020> this

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
stealth which is the best thing in this

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.630 
stealth which is the best thing in this
tree<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.649> makes<00:02:11.129> yourself<00:02:11.550> last<00:02:11.910> permit

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
tree it makes yourself last permit

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.170 
tree it makes yourself last permit
so<00:02:13.330> that's<00:02:13.510> really<00:02:13.690> good<00:02:14.950> our<00:02:15.430> extra<00:02:15.880> point

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
so that's really good our extra point

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.240 
so that's really good our extra point
will<00:02:16.600> come<00:02:16.780> over<00:02:16.930> here<00:02:17.260> for<00:02:17.500> blade<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:17.980> fury

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
will come over here for blade and fury

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.270 
will come over here for blade and fury
would<00:02:19.000> been<00:02:19.210> there<00:02:19.830> then<00:02:20.830> levels<00:02:22.500> 22<00:02:23.500> we're

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
would been there then levels 22 we're

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.060 
would been there then levels 22 we're
going<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.430> put<00:02:24.640> one<00:02:24.820> in<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:25.060> foul<00:02:25.270> play

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070

23 is going to be subterfuge and 24 is

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.340 
23 is going to be subterfuge and 24 is
going<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.070> finish<00:02:30.280> up<00:02:30.490> subterfuge<00:02:31.140> will<00:02:32.140> come

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
going to finish up subterfuge will come

back over to the blade dancer tree look

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.960 
back over to the blade dancer tree look
at<00:02:34.570> one<00:02:34.780> point<00:02:34.960> blade<00:02:35.410> in<00:02:35.560> theory<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.130> then

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
at one point blade in theory and then

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.390 
at one point blade in theory and then
move<00:02:37.240> on<00:02:37.450> back<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.990> tree<00:02:38.290> here<00:02:38.530> the

move on back to the tree here the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.550 
move on back to the tree here the
assassin<00:02:39.790> tree<00:02:39.970> now<00:02:40.660> in<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.020> assassin<00:02:41.410> tree

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
assassin tree now in the assassin tree

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.750 
assassin tree now in the assassin tree
there's<00:02:41.740> a<00:02:41.830> couple<00:02:41.980> things<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.370> could<00:02:42.550> do<00:02:42.640> at

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
there's a couple things you could do at

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.060 
there's a couple things you could do at
this<00:02:42.880> point<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.709> recommend<00:02:44.709> putting<00:02:44.890> the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
this point I recommend putting the

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.910 
this point I recommend putting the
additional<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.670> last<00:02:46.150> 25<00:02:46.930> point<00:02:47.290> into<00:02:47.709> cruel

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
additional the last 25 point into cruel

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.190 
additional the last 25 point into cruel
vengeance<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:49.090> we'll<00:02:49.240> do<00:02:49.360> that<00:02:50.520> 26<00:02:51.520> and<00:02:51.760> 27<00:02:52.450> are

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
vengeance so we'll do that 26 and 27 are

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.790 
vengeance so we'll do that 26 and 27 are
going<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.620> be<00:02:53.739> in<00:02:54.010> advanced<00:02:54.550> flanking<00:02:55.030> and

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
going to be in advanced flanking and

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.920 
going to be in advanced flanking and
then<00:02:56.800> we<00:02:57.190> come<00:02:57.370> back<00:02:57.520> over<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.850> a<00:02:58.000> tree<00:02:58.480> here

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
then we come back over to a tree here

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.810 
then we come back over to a tree here
for<00:02:59.350> our<00:02:59.440> additional<00:02:59.890> point<00:03:00.130> put<00:03:00.550> a<00:03:00.580> point

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
for our additional point put a point

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.240 
for our additional point put a point
into<00:03:01.060> blue<00:03:01.209> in<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.260> Blade<00:03:02.440> Dancer<00:03:02.620> tree<00:03:02.920> under

you're going to put points the points

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.260 
you're going to put points the points
and<00:03:13.270> poies<00:03:13.540> poison<00:03:14.230> potency<00:03:14.940> we'll<00:03:15.940> come<00:03:16.120> back

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
and poies poison potency we'll come back

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.880 
and poies poison potency we'll come back
to<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.510> bladedancer<00:03:16.720> tree<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.470> finish<00:03:17.739> up

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
to the bladedancer tree and finish up

to the bladedancer tree and finish up
strike<00:03:18.190> back<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.730> then<00:03:19.510> for<00:03:19.930> level<00:03:20.200> 31<00:03:20.590> we'll

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
strike back and then for level 31 we'll

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.150 
strike back and then for level 31 we'll
put<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.730> point<00:03:21.970> in<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.269> slip<00:03:22.510> away<00:03:23.010> now<00:03:24.010> at

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
put the point in to slip away now at

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.610 
put the point in to slip away now at
this<00:03:24.310> point<00:03:24.580> you<00:03:25.030> basically<00:03:25.600> maxed<00:03:26.290> out<00:03:26.410> your

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
this point you basically maxed out your

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.620 
this point you basically maxed out your
assassin<00:03:27.130> tree<00:03:27.310> if<00:03:27.549> you<00:03:28.090> feel<00:03:28.299> like<00:03:28.480> it

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
assassin tree if you feel like it

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.940 
assassin tree if you feel like it
there's<00:03:28.840> other<00:03:28.959> points<00:03:29.320> you<00:03:29.380> could<00:03:29.530> put<00:03:29.769> in

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
there's other points you could put in

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.280 
there's other points you could put in
here<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.370> honestly<00:03:30.940> don't<00:03:31.299> recommend<00:03:31.810> it<00:03:31.930> the

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
here I honestly don't recommend it the

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.070 
here I honestly don't recommend it the
tree<00:03:32.560> that<00:03:32.799> is<00:03:33.040> set<00:03:33.730> up<00:03:33.880> here<00:03:34.180> is<00:03:34.420> probably<00:03:34.870> one

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
tree that is set up here is probably one

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.900 
tree that is set up here is probably one
of<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.200> quickest<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.799> most<00:03:36.250> efficient<00:03:36.760> ways

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
of the quickest and most efficient ways

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.110 
of the quickest and most efficient ways
to<00:03:36.940> level<00:03:37.360> the<00:03:37.510> assassin<00:03:38.580> so<00:03:39.580> at<00:03:39.730> this<00:03:39.880> point

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
to level the assassin so at this point

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.580 
to level the assassin so at this point
you<00:03:40.420> can<00:03:40.570> start<00:03:40.660> putting<00:03:40.930> your<00:03:41.140> additional

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
you can start putting your additional

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.550
