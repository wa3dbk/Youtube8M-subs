00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.649
 we still have a chest is not so you can 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.490
 peel them 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:34.610
 something even try to find a 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.049
 someone is trying to climb up to 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.840
 Cheat chests that are already about an and 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:47.970
 they are no longer trying but maybe butane and me 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:51.479

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.079

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:16.040

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:24.319
 lighter on me thanks guys so well 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.980
 and go right down now 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:32.930
 neatly and somehow here what 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.980
 there lies something in my opinion this is some kind 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.670
 so and armor 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.070
 report h happened here wonder why 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.740
 it lies here maybe some 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.590
 trap 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.970
 like no that's all i have i don't 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:55.350
 only enough helmet I will be completely 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:58.770
 iron armor so in general then i will go 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:03.000
 look for a helmet where can I find it 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:06.060
 here the sword has a fishing pole 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.040
 in general, I need to train my skill 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:13.980
 baker so somewhere else here was 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.400
 little chest of his grandfather he was 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.650

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.840
 really why I'm running around so 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.049
 then trying to find here 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:29.400
 Yes, you can safely go very all 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:33.780
 merge like thread gently 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:37.560
 so as not to merge yet 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.220
 I guess I'll go after me 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.220
 still no one 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:49.140
 somewhere here saw one dude and where 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.019
 he went somewhere to 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:56.959
 Wow look ka Sneak 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:04:04.620
 undetected probably and maybe not already 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:07.639
 Worldwide I noticed not noticed not 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:13.970

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.599
 nobody used me for an hour 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:42.930
 but now that I have one diamond 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.440
 two lighters a bunch of things let's 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.270
 probably 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:52.950
 somewhere we will burn unnecessary things but also 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:56.280
 the golden carrot was there like that 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:59.520
 here we start to burn it all yes of course 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:04.140

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:08.540
 the map is awesome just got everything we 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:10.920

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.400

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:20.280
 I didn't notice this guy right now 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:22.070
 salt will start that match so me 30 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.880
 arrows 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:28.320
 spend them not really want we run up to 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.760
 I don't want him either 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:35.149

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:40.939

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:07.759
 the last arrow released and Dima just 

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:12.449
 so me ingot was an arrow helmet 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:13.979
 here's a helmet well, in general, nothing more 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:17.549
 especially he did not have two 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:21.389
 lighters crafted I've probably all 

00:06:17.549 --> 00:06:24.989
 do not have time though why not we can 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:27.370
 try to find a workbench here yet 

00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:29.990
 30 seconds whole 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:34.370
 The action that the water hour I can be 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:38.420

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:43.010
 no workbench thats very bad walkers 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:46.970

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:53.890
 emissions and crafted himself another 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:56.180
 and nothing else the collapse of them turns out all 

00:06:53.890 --> 00:07:00.080
 I can’t sort out the rest 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:02.030

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.890
