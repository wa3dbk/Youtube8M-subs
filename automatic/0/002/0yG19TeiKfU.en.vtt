the type that way they announced it and

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.659 
the type that way they announced it and
since<00:00:26.910> we<00:00:27.720> want<00:00:27.899> to<00:00:28.079> be<00:00:28.200> fair<00:00:28.559> the<00:00:29.040> highest<00:00:29.309> and

to be struck and the three rest of the
scores<00:00:35.250> are<00:00:35.430> going<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.820> added<00:00:36.149> together

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
scores are going to be added together

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.030 
scores are going to be added together
and<00:00:36.719> then<00:00:36.870> multiplied<00:00:37.380> with<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.680> degree<00:00:38.010> of

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
and then multiplied with the degree of

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.130 
and then multiplied with the degree of
difficulty<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.850> each<00:00:39.000> dive<00:00:39.239> harder<00:00:39.960> dive

obviously as a higher degree of

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:50.020 
obviously as a higher degree of
difficulty<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.059> can<00:00:42.269> get<00:00:42.390> more<00:00:42.570> points
