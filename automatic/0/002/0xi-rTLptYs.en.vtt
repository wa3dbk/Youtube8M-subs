00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 after the iphone 6 or 6 plus state 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.870
 hunted so scandalous news 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.280
 through the net one of them was that 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.019
 new equipment supposedly very very 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.610
 should be sensitive fast farc 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.980
 scratch and so on 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.529
 myspace the iphone 6 I use now 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.390
 about two months a day often 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.770
 even without protective cover or similar 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.449
 and i want to give you a quick one 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.609
 tell experiences and of course 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.609
 the current state show a lot of fun 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.140
 the color variant space woman should be loud 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.059
 various messages even 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.290
 be more sensitive than the silver one 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.719
 Model because of scratches and damage 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.090
 that is, we have got much stronger here 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.309
 the most vulnerable iphone 6, so to speak 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.800
 I can confirm that we are all 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.570
 but not really my iphone 6 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.789
 looks almost as new and 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.850
 almost synonymous because it when filming the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.469
 corresponding reviews unfortunately once 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.989
 fell off about 1 meter 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.390
 20 higher on stone everything was there 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.649
 happened are two minimal marks 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.270
 which you only look at exactly 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.369
 Realizes that I actually think so 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.869
 quite considerable because from the height up 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.470
 I would definitely have something worse with stone 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.330
 expected 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.040
 After my experiences you should join 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.689
 normal use so no actually 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.640
 problems with scratches and marks 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.320
 except to treat the device 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.360
 not tidy or just leaves it 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.220
 fall etc but that is now times 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.060
 own fault and that should anyway 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.799
 be clear 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.080
 also at the display there was initially 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.909
 messages partly with video evidence that 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.220
 the glass only through the pocket or 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.710
 a simple cleaning cloth really extreme 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.840
 so scratched many many fine scratches 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.060
 get it right so far that the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.040
 Display glass is not so super scratch resistant 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.900
 as it should but in my 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.729
 so far, I only have one 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.560
 this one helped a scratch on the iphone 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.149
 and you really only see it when 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.460
 you look for him and the iphone just 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.049
 fits against the light otherwise holds 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.100
 Absolutely impossible to see and also 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.259
 not felt 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.579
 my personal conclusion and that 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.710
 of course only related to that 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.869
 iphone what i have here is other reference 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.189
 device-I course is not so 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.780
 that the media here again 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.670
 exaggerate a bit and often 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.469
 little things to alleged scandals 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.850
 High push is not misunderstand 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.099
 Of course, that's not okay 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.080
 display for example is not so scratchy 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.460
 is as it should be but it is 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.140
 definitely not 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.420
 as sensitive as it is often shown 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.340
 as long as you are neat with the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.260
 device bypasses and I think that 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.870
 Most of them are sold at a price 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.640
 In any case, 700 euros will do 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.040
 the iphone also in a few months yet 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.720
 look like new respectively 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.310
 have minimal traces of use as well as that 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.270
 actually with every commodity 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.220
 the case is 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.650
 Of course I'm curious if 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.090
 it your iphone 6 or 6 plus 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.250
 it works equally well or is it bigger 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.540
 problems with that wrote me that 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.470
 so definitely in the 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.780
 Comments 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.730
 and still as a little tip if you 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.320
 really have problems, for example, just 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.640
 this scratch on the display then 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.800
 just turn to the apple 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.990
 support in the normal case are very 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.120
 Kulant what any error products 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.130
 angeht reported you just describes 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.420
 your problem neat and I'm mine 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.340
 pretty sure you guys are there too 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.990
 you can also help me 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.030
 times in the comments write something 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.770
 such cases have come around too 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.090
 Of course, that interests me very much 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.160
 and then are again at the end 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.600
 this videos arrived if it you 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.280
 I liked to show it 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.510
 a thumbs up or as I said 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.860
 with a comment 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.940
 and then we'll see each other next time 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.940
 it makes people happy again
