squeeze them together and tighten with

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.880 
squeeze them together and tighten with
the<00:01:14.280> provided<00:01:14.820> Lynch<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.990> let's<00:01:16.200> do<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:20.659> and

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
the provided Lynch so let's do that and

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.100 
the provided Lynch so let's do that and
and<00:01:22.890> see<00:01:23.790> how<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:23.970> slides<00:01:24.450> around<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.990> little

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
and see how that slides around a little

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.590 
and see how that slides around a little
that's<00:01:25.650> only<00:01:25.920> really<00:01:26.640> because<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.299> haven't

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that's only really because I haven't

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.670 
that's only really because I haven't
used<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.259> tape<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.340> here<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.650> see

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
used the tape on here so you can see

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.569 
used the tape on here so you can see
that's<00:01:32.040> installed<00:01:32.430> pretty<00:01:33.210> easy<00:01:34.310> it's<00:01:35.310> pretty

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
that's installed pretty easy it's pretty

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.090 
that's installed pretty easy it's pretty
firm<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.180> there<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.960> will<00:01:37.140> slide<00:01:37.619> slightly

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
firm in there it will slide slightly

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.740 
firm in there it will slide slightly
like<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.369> said<00:01:38.579> because<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:39.000> does<00:01:39.180> not<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
like I said because it does not have the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.670 
like I said because it does not have the
tape<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.310> but<00:01:41.310> over<00:01:41.579> overall<00:01:42.180> not<00:01:42.210> an<00:01:42.509> issue

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
tape on it but over overall not an issue

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.030 
tape on it but over overall not an issue
once<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.860> tapes<00:01:45.020> securely<00:01:46.020> fastened<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
once that tapes securely fastened and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.830 
once that tapes securely fastened and

did<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.120> review<00:03:03.390> on<00:03:03.450> fairly<00:03:03.840> recently<00:03:04.290> and

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
did a review on fairly recently and

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.759 
did a review on fairly recently and
thought<00:03:06.510> we'd<00:03:06.720> try<00:03:06.870> this<00:03:06.989> out<00:03:07.290> now<00:03:07.560> they<00:03:07.709> do

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
thought we'd try this out now they do

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.259 
thought we'd try this out now they do
make<00:03:08.069> this<00:03:08.220> connector<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.700> little<00:03:08.970> bit<00:03:09.060> higher

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
make this connector a little bit higher

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.940 
make this connector a little bit higher
than<00:03:09.299> normal<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.989> accommodate<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.620> depth<00:03:10.829> of

the<00:03:11.069> case<00:03:11.310> which<00:03:11.640> is<00:03:11.819> great<00:03:12.299> well<00:03:12.989> thought<00:03:13.230> out

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
the case which is great well thought out

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.050 
the case which is great well thought out
and<00:03:13.769> here<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.489> sits<00:03:14.670> in<00:03:14.959> and<00:03:15.959> that's<00:03:16.379> it<00:03:17.060> you

we<00:03:43.919> have<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.160> seat<00:03:44.370> right<00:03:44.609> here<00:03:44.639> and<00:03:45.180> this<00:03:45.569> is

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
we have the seat right here and this is

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.440 
we have the seat right here and this is
a<00:03:45.780> little<00:03:46.049> bit<00:03:46.169> smaller<00:03:46.919> car<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:48.239> want<00:03:48.389> to

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
a little bit smaller car you want to

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.180 
a little bit smaller car you want to
make<00:03:48.540> sure<00:03:48.599> that<00:03:48.840> whoever<00:03:49.620> sitting<00:03:50.040> here

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
make sure that whoever sitting here

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.069 
make sure that whoever sitting here
their<00:03:50.340> legs<00:03:50.549> don't<00:03:50.669> hit<00:03:51.000> this<00:03:51.180> so<00:03:51.450> if<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:51.930> have

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
their legs don't hit this so if you have

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.809 
their legs don't hit this so if you have
it<00:03:52.200> up<00:03:52.290> here<00:03:52.319> it's<00:03:52.590> too<00:03:52.769> high<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.489> other<00:03:53.609> thing

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
it up here it's too high the other thing

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.849 
it up here it's too high the other thing
to<00:03:53.940> keep<00:03:54.060> in<00:03:54.239> mind<00:03:54.299> is<00:03:54.750> when<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:55.380> turn<00:03:55.590> your

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
to keep in mind is when you turn your

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.909 
to keep in mind is when you turn your
car<00:03:56.069> on<00:03:56.099> you<00:03:56.459> bring<00:03:56.669> the<00:03:56.790> shifter<00:03:57.150> down

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
car on you bring the shifter down

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.890 
car on you bring the shifter down
whether<00:03:58.919> it<00:03:59.069> be<00:03:59.160> stick<00:03:59.489> shift<00:03:59.790> that<00:04:00.660> won't

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
whether it be stick shift that won't

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.990 
whether it be stick shift that won't
matter<00:04:01.319> as<00:04:01.620> much<00:04:01.650> but<00:04:02.220> if<00:04:02.340> it's<00:04:02.489> a<00:04:02.609> stick<00:04:02.970> shift

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
matter as much but if it's a stick shift

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.470 
matter as much but if it's a stick shift
or<00:04:03.569> a<00:04:03.630> or<00:04:04.349> manual<00:04:04.889> or<00:04:05.190> automatic<00:04:06.090> when<00:04:06.389> you

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
bring this down to drive it can obscure

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.030 
bring this down to drive it can obscure
this<00:04:09.540> so<00:04:10.049> you<00:04:10.139> really<00:04:10.349> want<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.590> find<00:04:10.799> that
