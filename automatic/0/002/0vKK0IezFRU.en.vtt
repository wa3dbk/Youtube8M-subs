now<00:02:07.270> you<00:02:07.329> can<00:02:07.479> also<00:02:07.600> use<00:02:07.869> this<00:02:07.990> setup<00:02:08.259> without

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
now you can also use this setup without

now you can also use this setup without
any<00:02:08.890> external<00:02:09.280> decks<00:02:09.640> if<00:02:09.880> you<00:02:10.000> choose<00:02:10.240> to<00:02:10.390> do

any external decks if you choose to do
so<00:02:10.539> that<00:02:11.200> way<00:02:11.350> you<00:02:11.410> can<00:02:11.530> just<00:02:11.710> use<00:02:11.860> your<00:02:12.010> mixer

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
so that way you can just use your mixer

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.390 
so that way you can just use your mixer
alone<00:02:13.540> in<00:02:13.840> order<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.170> mix<00:02:14.740> back<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.160> forth

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
alone in order to mix back and forth

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.340 
alone in order to mix back and forth

nice effects that they have in the

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.220 
nice effects that they have in the
system<00:03:32.340> you<00:03:32.459> can<00:03:32.519> only<00:03:32.700> do<00:03:32.910> one<00:03:33.420> effect<00:03:33.930> per

really<00:03:36.360> combine<00:03:36.780> any<00:03:37.110> of<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.260> effects<00:03:37.590> but

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
really combine any of the effects but

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.190 
really combine any of the effects but
you<00:03:38.070> do<00:03:38.280> get<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.519> nice<00:03:38.700> bare-bones<00:03:39.480> style

cross 2.0 software like I described to

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.620 
cross 2.0 software like I described to
you<00:04:19.799> earlier<00:04:19.829> you<00:04:20.160> go<00:04:20.310> on<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.519> website<00:04:20.700> after

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
you earlier you go on the website after

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.659 
you earlier you go on the website after
you<00:04:21.750> entering<00:04:22.260> all<00:04:22.380> your<00:04:22.740> serial<00:04:23.160> numbers<00:04:23.460> and

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
you entering all your serial numbers and

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.760 
you entering all your serial numbers and
they'll<00:04:24.210> give<00:04:24.450> you<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:24.630> new<00:04:24.720> key<00:04:25.080> for<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.620> new

they'll give you a new key for the new
cross<00:04:26.150> 2.0<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:27.750> basically<00:04:28.169> all<00:04:28.350> you<00:04:28.470> need<00:04:28.620> to

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
cross 2.0 and basically all you need to

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.969 
cross 2.0 and basically all you need to
do<00:04:28.860> is<00:04:29.130> hook<00:04:29.520> your<00:04:30.240> turntables<00:04:31.080> up<00:04:31.289> into<00:04:31.830> the

do is hook your turntables up into the

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.550 
do is hook your turntables up into the
inputs<00:04:32.490> you'll<00:04:33.419> put<00:04:33.660> your<00:04:33.750> channel<00:04:34.110> 1<00:04:34.320> into

pretty much ready to go after that you

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.820 
pretty much ready to go after that you
go<00:04:58.390> into<00:04:58.630> software<00:04:59.140> and<00:04:59.260> it's<00:04:59.350> already<00:04:59.560> set<00:04:59.800> up

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
go into software and it's already set up

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.450 
go into software and it's already set up

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
for vinyl or CD timecode control so it

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.220 
for vinyl or CD timecode control so it
was<00:05:03.610> very<00:05:03.880> easy<00:05:04.180> to<00:05:04.300> set<00:05:04.570> up<00:05:04.600> I<00:05:04.840> didn't<00:05:05.020> have<00:05:05.140> to

was very easy to set up I didn't have to

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.350 
was very easy to set up I didn't have to
really<00:05:05.350> fuss<00:05:05.860> with<00:05:06.070> any<00:05:06.190> of<00:05:06.370> the<00:05:06.490> actual

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
digital vinyl system was very work very

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.630 
digital vinyl system was very work very
well<00:05:19.630> comes<00:05:19.930> with<00:05:20.080> two<00:05:20.560> digital<00:05:21.310> vinyl

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
well comes with two digital vinyl

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.190 
well comes with two digital vinyl
records<00:05:22.000> and<00:05:22.090> we<00:05:22.240> did<00:05:22.420> use<00:05:22.630> this<00:05:22.810> in<00:05:23.020> the

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
records and we did use this in the

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.220 
records and we did use this in the
analog<00:05:23.650> setup<00:05:24.160> with<00:05:24.370> vinyl<00:05:25.000> records<00:05:25.540> and<00:05:25.660> we

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
analog setup with vinyl records and we

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.010 
analog setup with vinyl records and we
had<00:05:26.350> very<00:05:26.710> very<00:05:26.860> good<00:05:27.300> playback<00:05:28.330> we<00:05:28.660> had<00:05:28.780> great

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
had very very good playback we had great

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.200 
had very very good playback we had great
scratching<00:05:29.740> there<00:05:30.190> wasn't<00:05:30.580> any<00:05:30.700> times<00:05:31.000> where

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
scratching there wasn't any times where

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.970 
scratching there wasn't any times where
we<00:05:31.330> heard<00:05:31.480> any<00:05:31.810> type<00:05:32.080> of<00:05:32.110> noise<00:05:32.440> that<00:05:32.710> was<00:05:32.800> out

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
we heard any type of noise that was out

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.680 
we heard any type of noise that was out
of<00:05:33.010> pocket<00:05:33.310> or<00:05:33.670> anything<00:05:33.820> that<00:05:34.090> we<00:05:34.390> didn't

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
of pocket or anything that we didn't

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.080 
of pocket or anything that we didn't
expect<00:05:35.080> everything<00:05:35.800> sounded<00:05:36.250> sounded<00:05:36.850> great

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
expect everything sounded sounded great

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.510 
expect everything sounded sounded great
and<00:05:37.360> it<00:05:37.900> just<00:05:38.110> worked<00:05:38.350> just<00:05:38.680> almost<00:05:38.890> just<00:05:39.400> like

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
and it just worked just almost just like

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.730 
and it just worked just almost just like
real<00:05:39.730> vinyl<00:05:40.150> so<00:05:40.690> we<00:05:40.930> have<00:05:41.050> no<00:05:41.230> grasp<00:05:41.500> of<00:05:41.620> the

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
real vinyl so we have no grasp of the

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.500 
real vinyl so we have no grasp of the
system<00:05:42.100> the<00:05:42.310> latency<00:05:42.790> was<00:05:42.970> great<00:05:43.300> and

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
system the latency was great and

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.080 
system the latency was great and
everything<00:05:44.140> just<00:05:44.560> was<00:05:45.190> right<00:05:45.430> it<00:05:45.640> just<00:05:45.820> felt

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
everything just was right it just felt

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.400 
everything just was right it just felt
right<00:05:46.270> it<00:05:46.450> felt<00:05:46.480> like<00:05:46.810> you<00:05:46.900> were<00:05:46.930> using<00:05:47.110> real

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
right it felt like you were using real

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.980 
right it felt like you were using real
vinyl<00:05:47.770> here<00:05:47.920> same<00:05:48.670> with<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:48.970> CDs<00:05:49.360> we<00:05:49.540> also<00:05:49.720> use

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
vinyl here same with the CDs we also use

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.280 
vinyl here same with the CDs we also use
the<00:05:50.110> CDJ<00:05:50.650> we<00:05:50.890> use<00:05:51.010> the<00:05:51.160> DNS<00:05:51.880> 3900<00:05:52.690> with<00:05:52.900> just

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
the CDJ we use the DNS 3900 with just

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.040 
the CDJ we use the DNS 3900 with just
the<00:05:53.440> CDs<00:05:53.830> and<00:05:54.130> that<00:05:54.640> worked<00:05:54.880> out<00:05:55.060> just<00:05:55.330> as<00:05:55.750> good

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
the CDs and that worked out just as good

as<00:05:56.380> when<00:05:56.890> it<00:05:57.070> was<00:05:57.100> on<00:05:57.430> vinyl<00:05:57.910> so<00:05:58.840> this<00:05:58.990> is<00:05:59.080> a

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170 
as when it was on vinyl so this is a

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.990 
as when it was on vinyl so this is a
good<00:05:59.380> system<00:05:59.830> it's<00:06:00.010> a<00:06:00.070> good<00:06:00.220> setup<00:06:00.490> I<00:06:00.760> think

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000
