but<00:00:50.250> my<00:00:50.489> old<00:00:50.700> man<00:00:50.910> believed<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.690> anything

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
but my old man believed that anything

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.080 
but my old man believed that anything
that<00:00:53.039> didn't<00:00:53.370> involve<00:00:55.430> plowing<00:00:56.430> land<00:00:56.730> or

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
that didn't involve plowing land or

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.000 
that didn't involve plowing land or
cutting<00:00:57.449> down<00:00:57.629> trees<00:00:57.930> or<00:00:58.350> building<00:00:58.739> bridges

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
cutting down trees or building bridges

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.360

over<00:00:59.550> rivers<00:00:59.579> or<00:01:00.120> erecting<00:01:00.719> other<00:01:01.710> buildings

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
over rivers or erecting other buildings

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.939

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
he looked upon that as a waste of time

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.140 
he looked upon that as a waste of time
and<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.750> he<00:01:06.960> didn't<00:01:07.560> encourage<00:01:08.189> my<00:01:08.610> reading<00:01:09.030> at

was going to be a journalist he just
looked<00:03:13.530> at<00:03:13.620> me<00:03:13.799> he<00:03:13.889> said<00:03:13.949> don't<00:03:14.430> be<00:03:14.669> a<00:03:14.699> bloody

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
looked at me he said don't be a bloody

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.979

fool<00:03:15.269> you'll<00:03:15.810> starve<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.439> death<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:17.579> so<00:03:18.150> I

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
fool you'll starve to death and so I

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.149 
fool you'll starve to death and so I
went<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.669> took<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.449> the<00:03:21.659> accountancy<00:03:22.319> and<00:03:22.680> I

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
went and took that the accountancy and I

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.770 
went and took that the accountancy and I
think<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.879> he<00:03:24.060> did<00:03:24.299> me<00:03:24.479> a<00:03:24.509> great<00:03:24.659> favor

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
think that he did me a great favor

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.179 
think that he did me a great favor
because<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:25.889> believe<00:03:26.639> that<00:03:28.009> journalism<00:03:29.009> and

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:29.189 
because I believe that journalism and

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.240 
because I believe that journalism and
creative<00:03:29.970> writing<00:03:30.000> or<00:03:30.659> not<00:03:30.870> easy<00:03:31.349> bedfellows

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
creative writing or not easy bedfellows

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.270 
creative writing or not easy bedfellows
they<00:03:32.659> required<00:03:33.659> different<00:03:34.379> techniques<00:03:34.979> I

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
they required different techniques I

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.330 
they required different techniques I
think<00:03:35.579> you're<00:03:35.699> right<00:03:36.290> it's<00:03:37.290> like<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.949> tennis

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
think you're right it's like a tennis

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.670 
think you're right it's like a tennis
player<00:03:38.609> and<00:03:38.849> a<00:03:38.909> squash<00:03:39.150> player<00:03:39.479> you<00:03:40.229> play<00:03:40.470> the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
player and a squash player you play the

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.520 
player and a squash player you play the
game<00:03:40.919> with<00:03:40.970> with<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.000> racquet<00:03:42.569> and<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.810> ball<00:03:43.079> but

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
game with with a racquet and a ball but

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.210 
game with with a racquet and a ball but
the<00:03:43.979> technique<00:03:44.489> is<00:03:44.669> different<00:03:45.199> and<00:03:46.199> so<00:03:46.739> he<00:03:47.040> did

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
the technique is different and so he did

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.020 
the technique is different and so he did
me<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.400> big<00:03:47.459> favor<00:03:47.639> there<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.389> also<00:03:49.139> when

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
me a big favor there and also when

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.479 
me a big favor there and also when
sending<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:51.150> competency<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:52.250> learned<00:03:53.250> how<00:03:53.459> to

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
sending a competency I learned how to

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.129

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
things which later on became quite

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.249
