00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.780

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.179
 windows games on your mac good this 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.849
 method works for both games 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.180
 and for general programs 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:22.470
 you will not have any limitation by 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.300
 part of this is for starters they will have 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.230
 you download an app so called 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:32.040
 if you read that the contest was the emulator 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:35.130
 time is not quite a regulator but I go 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:40.969
 leave the strong area inscription link 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:48.899
 download this file and download it 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:51.239
 unpack and here and here is this 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:59.010
 files in which this application 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:01:00.710
 new application team comes here subscribed 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.739
 if you point to baby 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.619
 Good, what will you need to run? 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.250
 the games of ac models good without needing 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.299
 of installation installation sorry for the game 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.259
 installed 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.540
 already on windows good if you do not have the 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.500
 windows there thing that I find very difficult 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.130
 to happen 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.009
 You can use the crossover that I already 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.250
 CNAA taught the channel I did a video 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.829
 about it and you can use it I did 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:38.220
 including to make a video to the dossier 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:41.579
 It's about the son you can use. 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.570
 to install and get the files 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:50.310
 installed will need them 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:55.020
 good, I just remember that the sider 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.990
 be emulated also windows nÃ© 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.960
 it may fail some errors 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.630
 They may occur're not performance 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.250
 It's going to be the same, it's going to be good looking, but 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.439
 It's not going to be the same as it's going to be. 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.729
 of what I can not see but it will not be 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.290
 same as windows 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.050
 OK 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:17.440
 errors are not acceptable let's say so 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:22.210
 because he is a side right 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:28.000
 Good, I'll get a game here. 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:29.770
 for speed hot hot hot pursuit guide 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.840
 I know exactly in this book that speaks 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.840
 sorry for the legislation 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:42.070
 and he is a demonstration for him because he 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.770
 is lightweight is easy to copy because it has not 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.380
 a very large pendrive then that was 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.420
 quick to copy but also 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.370
 works like many others for example 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.690
 here my control troicki also a 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.480
 side via Syria 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.800
 shown here is also one side and the 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.530
 Syria and all the video games I 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.320
 put the channel are regulated my 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.900
 sinder except gta 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.200
 this is it or it seems I do not know how you 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.960
 they talk but he went one side of another 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.200
 method that I intend to learn yet 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:20.290
 To pass on to you, okay, I'll go. 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.570
 starting here is how to set up the first 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.520
 time you will right click on 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.240
 the application of the eyelash show 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.240
 package contents 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:41.920
 Then you will follow this path. 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:44.709
 glad is transgaming drive in this 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.550
 folder here is where you will paste the 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:53.020
 actually drag your game folder 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:56.530
 copied from windows live 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:00.190
 everything is a game including UN 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.900
 executable copy here and more 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.160
 nothing prevents you from copying everything that is 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.760
 inside back here in has not 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.980
 no difference 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.470
 it is even easier to copy everything that is 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.160
 in here straight through this way 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.900
 Here's what I think more is best for. 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.820
 me good 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.410
 after you have done this you will not open the 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.910
 drum here again and show content 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.760
 of the package 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.210
 I get happy and opens here O 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.750
 plist info does not need this problem 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.620
 here o 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:36.430
 fish Edith pro okay I'll let the 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.590
 link to his installation which is a 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.740
 Program okay but I will find 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.100
 still put it in the precise description 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.150
 Downloading and what are you going to do here? 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.200
 the next 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.760
 in these two directors here these two 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.370
 business I do not know the name 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.440
 You'll have to enter this first one. 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.060
 if you do not put the name in the folder you 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.240
 will be the directory of your game where 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.580
 is the executable that will stay on the scene 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.930
 it is failures that this folder here is 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:11.070
 inside this folder here that I put 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:15.130
 copy and paste 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.800
 Ready do not go down here is the name 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:21.210
 do not put that does not change 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.210
 zin business that is here 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.470
 here put the folder name and the 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.820
 The name of the executed one is inside that in my 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:37.030
 if this one has to have everything until the 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:40.510
 point x is not to put the hand inverted and 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.880
 go a put this done they can 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.310
 dictate some other things here in a 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:51.750
 I see no need 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:55.150
 but it's just that part here things 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:58.300
 Lie do not touch it, you can not give it here. 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.890
 I have already done this and I have 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.260
 very angry because I know that the earth 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.390
 had done nothing wrong but it was only 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:10.650
 because I got involved in these things in Mexico and 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:10.650
 no, because it's better you do not know the date 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:22.710
 close close party performing 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:27.700
 remembering that the game can give a buggy and 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:29.979
 iso is not common but is not common but is 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.770
 something that can occur for example 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:33.740
 with the troika gives nothing here or 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.169
 luanda 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.569
 none of the programs I have there give 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.229
 an error and this may not be 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:41.660
 chosen 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:42.770
 I do not know if it will not double click. 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:47.180
 to open it 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:54.919
 but this business opened here began to 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:59.630
 and this is what I think it is 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:07:04.539
 functioning is a process relatively 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.539
 Simple, I just knew how to do it. 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:27.039
 in the end but it has no importance 

00:07:27.099 --> 00:07:33.110
 what do you do later if you want to change 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:35.380
 How did I make a video lesson about 

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:39.500
 how to change the programs icon 

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:41.840
 even works in your silence of 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:51.469
 many programs here like for example 

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:57.530
 lack of control and any doubt is 

00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:59.810
 to seek to resolve and also if you 

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:02.509
 have any idea of video 

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:05.240
 awesome of maps a doubt of the mec 

00:08:02.509 --> 00:08:07.340
 Such a thing of the mech system 

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:13.340
 You can put it there, it's going to be 

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:16.639
 big help you there is something is 

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:20.050
 click I did not like it please and this is it 

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:20.050
 galley earned even more
