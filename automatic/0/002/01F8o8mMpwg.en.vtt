00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.519
 October 14, 2013 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.530
 here I am again my video unfortunately 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.320
 because the video I did before 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.059
 we have not been registered so that's it 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.720
 so I was doing some 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.410
 double reset on my ds at once my 3ds 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.300
 parents and my 3ds xl pokemon this is I 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.250
 sweet and sour hunt since now 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.260
 three days and I finally got it 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.840
 found so that's it's not on this 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.430
 version wants to find them on so I have 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.620
 bought both versions I found them 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.899
 on the y it's not a main party 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.160
 but it does not matter I 'll do the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.260
 charges as soon as possible 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.850
 so here I came across a 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.200
 gorgeous chagny frog wait i 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.530
 will tell you after five hundred 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.629
 sixty that's after 573 is I 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.480
 came across this beautiful frog 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.980
 shiny here is there is a little blue 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.129
 paler than usual this is at 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.430
 last of 573 is is search 14h12 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.680
 so that took me three days 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.890
 here we are, so let's know it's me 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.950
 that's usual at number 07 on the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.090
 pokedex grenoux smala good game level 6 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.820
 because unfortunately as I you 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.369
 I said I already made a video before 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.490
 a video that has been erased 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.869
 So I redo the video so here 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.350
 I have a little bit of progress in 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.090
 the adventured of not many these are these 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.320
 frogs I wanted to show it in 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.920
 summary and that's so it's rigid to 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.540
 nature is meeting and watercolorist 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.729
 he is proud of his power so that I 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.430
 believe that it increases the tacc here 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.320
 that's fine it's fine then frog 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.619
 chagny ben voila my first pokemon 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.530
 shiny here for this sixth 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.049
 generation with x and y 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.490
 my first pokemon chagny that 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.630
 I was waiting for I was waiting 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.340
 so glad to have it you can 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.520
 not know 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.200
 this is always long reset in 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.360
 same time everything is known that 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.649
 respects the already knows 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.300
 it takes arts hours the problem 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.830
 is that starters is even more 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.330
 annoying I explain why because 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.730
 that in fact 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.870
 if we really want his starter we can 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.190
 not to advance in the adventurous 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.840
 so we're stuck we can do nothing 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.670
 else and that's what's annoying 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.480
 it's not like looking for a pokemon in 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.300
 the tall grass we can always 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.650
 put it back later or what am I 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.700
 really happy to have it because it 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.140
 did the third day and I had 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.270
 really want to move finally into the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.040
 adventure so here I go now 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.230
 to do a fight that's why I had a 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.850
 little bit advanced story to get there 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.890
 where there is also said yesterday I ride the 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:43.370
 it's worth fighting my first 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.650
 pokemon shine to good frogs then 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.410
 before I want to clarify a little 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.720
 info it's been over two years that I 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.780
 hunting pokemon shiny so it's not 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.980
 really my first but let's say that 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.450
 it's my first officially because 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.800
 I already changed my nickname 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.770
 now my name is rent know 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.570
 before I had a different nickname and 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.730
 this is my other shiny I gave them to 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.390
 my little cousin who adore and pokemon 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.040
 whose cities loved is absolutely 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.520
 I said to myself anyway I repeat 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.820
 in hand I restart at zero by many 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.580
 and that's what I did here 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.340
 animal frog first pokemon 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:31.220

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:34.200

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.180
