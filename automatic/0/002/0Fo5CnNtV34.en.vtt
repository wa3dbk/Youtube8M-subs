hence<00:03:14.690> a<00:03:14.810> lot<00:03:14.959> about<00:03:15.170> how<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.380> two<00:03:15.620> of<00:03:15.650> them

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
hence a lot about how the two of them

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.949 
hence a lot about how the two of them
look<00:03:16.100> alike<00:03:16.250> and<00:03:16.640> I've<00:03:17.030> always<00:03:17.209> wondered<00:03:17.510> if

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
look alike and I've always wondered if

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.440 
look alike and I've always wondered if
PLL<00:03:18.920> is<00:03:19.040> gonna<00:03:19.220> go<00:03:19.430> along<00:03:19.700> with<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.000> books<00:03:20.239> and

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
PLL is gonna go along with the books and

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.479 
PLL is gonna go along with the books and
do<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.660> twin<00:03:20.959> theory<00:03:21.410> so<00:03:21.890> I<00:03:21.920> don't<00:03:22.250> know<00:03:22.340> if

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
do the twin theory so I don't know if

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.699 
do the twin theory so I don't know if
they're<00:03:22.610> gonna<00:03:22.730> say<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.480> this<00:03:24.230> is<00:03:24.440> her

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
they're gonna say that this is her

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.650 
they're gonna say that this is her
actual<00:03:25.310> sister<00:03:25.610> like<00:03:25.820> Cece<00:03:26.180> and<00:03:26.269> Ali<00:03:26.450> or

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
actual sister like Cece and Ali or

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.290 
actual sister like Cece and Ali or
actual<00:03:26.989> sister<00:03:27.560> slash<00:03:27.950> twins<00:03:28.370> or<00:03:28.730> if<00:03:29.150> they're

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
actual sister slash twins or if they're

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.660

she definitely means business I guess we

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.710 
she definitely means business I guess we

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
were to assume that she was the one who

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.690 
were to assume that she was the one who
shot<00:05:43.990> Ezra<00:05:44.350> correct<00:05:44.800> and<00:05:45.190> she's<00:05:45.490> talking

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
shot Ezra correct and she's talking

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
seasons ago I think she may have started

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.400 
seasons ago I think she may have started
the<00:05:51.610> fire<00:05:51.640> so<00:05:52.480> I'm<00:05:52.660> trying<00:05:52.930> to<00:05:52.960> figure<00:05:53.080> out<00:05:53.230> her
