first<00:05:38.430> thing<00:05:38.580> you<00:05:38.670> notice<00:05:38.940> about<00:05:38.970> an<00:05:39.300> emo<00:05:39.690> LPG

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
first thing you notice about an emo LPG

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.070 
first thing you notice about an emo LPG
van<00:05:40.800> it's<00:05:40.980> quieter

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.469

hasn't quite at the same torque reducing

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.540 
hasn't quite at the same torque reducing
of<00:05:47.569> course

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
of course

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.860 
of course
she<00:05:49.759> wasn't<00:05:50.030> going<00:05:50.660> 50<00:05:51.229> SEC<00:05:51.440> couple<00:05:51.800> you'll<00:05:51.949> go

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
she wasn't going 50 SEC couple you'll go

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.330 
she wasn't going 50 SEC couple you'll go
very<00:05:53.870> sweet

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.830 

so<00:05:58.850> it<00:05:58.970> is<00:05:59.090> a<00:05:59.120> punch<00:05:59.360> to<00:05:59.480> the<00:05:59.510> left<00:05:59.720> to<00:05:59.810> the

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
so it is a punch to the left to the

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.740 
so it is a punch to the left to the
right<00:06:00.400> it<00:06:01.400> breaks<00:06:01.730> nice<00:06:02.090> and<00:06:02.360> straight<00:06:02.600> of

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
right it breaks nice and straight of

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.460 
right it breaks nice and straight of
course<00:06:02.780> a<00:06:03.230> brand-new<00:06:03.740> dis<00:06:05.470> three

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
58

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:33.360 
58
we<00:06:23.400> wanted<00:06:24.400> positions

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.370 

so<00:06:34.370> that<00:06:35.060> concludes<00:06:35.210> the<00:06:35.539> short<00:06:35.570> test<00:06:36.139> drive

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
so that concludes the short test drive

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.320 
so that concludes the short test drive
