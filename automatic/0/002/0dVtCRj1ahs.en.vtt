associated b44 buggy so well don't put

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.790 
associated b44 buggy so well don't put
it<00:00:16.850> in<00:00:16.939> the<00:00:17.000> technical<00:00:17.390> specs<00:00:17.630> and<00:00:18.110> as<00:00:18.410> usual

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
it in the technical specs and as usual

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.470 
it in the technical specs and as usual
well<00:00:19.430> take<00:00:19.670> the<00:00:19.760> shell<00:00:19.970> off<00:00:20.000> here<00:00:20.270> and<00:00:20.360> let

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
well take the shell off here and let

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.370 
well take the shell off here and let
Brandon<00:00:20.720> jump<00:00:20.930> right<00:00:21.050> in

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
Brandon jump right in

Brandon jump right in
well<00:00:22.160> we<00:00:22.369> bought<00:00:22.490> this<00:00:22.670> as<00:00:22.850> the<00:00:22.970> kit<00:00:23.180> so<00:00:23.449> we<00:00:23.539> did

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
well we bought this as the kit so we did

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.880 
well we bought this as the kit so we did
build<00:00:23.810> it<00:00:23.869> from<00:00:23.960> scratch<00:00:24.050> and<00:00:24.530> I<00:00:24.590> can<00:00:24.710> say

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
build it from scratch and I can say

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.859 
build it from scratch and I can say
honestly<00:00:25.070> I<00:00:25.520> got<00:00:25.850> no<00:00:26.060> complaints<00:00:26.480> of<00:00:26.570> this<00:00:26.690> one

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
honestly I got no complaints of this one

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.560 
honestly I got no complaints of this one
really<00:00:27.470> well<00:00:27.710> engineered<00:00:27.980> you<00:00:28.580> got<00:00:28.760> basic

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
really well engineered you got basic

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.500 
really well engineered you got basic
basic<00:00:30.380> components<00:00:30.770> top<00:00:31.130> plates<00:00:31.400> bottom<00:00:32.300> plate

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
basic components top plates bottom plate

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.820 
basic components top plates bottom plate
and<00:00:32.840> that's<00:00:33.020> it<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.379> drive<00:00:33.559> line<00:00:33.680> goes

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:33.830 
and that's it the drive line goes

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.810 
and that's it the drive line goes
through<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.040> middle<00:00:34.280> I<00:00:34.370> mean<00:00:34.520> you<00:00:34.610> got<00:00:34.730> to

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
through the middle I mean you got to

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.880 
through the middle I mean you got to
work<00:00:34.940> on<00:00:35.120> it<00:00:35.150> just<00:00:35.989> a<00:00:36.050> few<00:00:36.230> minutes<00:00:36.500> at<00:00:36.620> a<00:00:36.710> time

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
work on it just a few minutes at a time

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.040 
work on it just a few minutes at a time
there's<00:00:37.190> no<00:00:37.370> no<00:00:37.970> real<00:00:38.150> hard<00:00:38.330> stuff<00:00:38.600> I'd<00:00:38.780> say<00:00:38.960> in

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
there's no no real hard stuff I'd say in

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.840 
there's no no real hard stuff I'd say in
terms<00:00:39.230> of<00:00:39.380> skill<00:00:39.590> level<00:00:39.860> if<00:00:40.250> you're<00:00:40.430> starting

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
terms of skill level if you're starting

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.889 
terms of skill level if you're starting
out<00:00:40.940> you<00:00:41.120> probably<00:00:41.270> ought<00:00:41.540> to<00:00:41.570> build<00:00:41.780> this

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
out you probably ought to build this

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.270 
out you probably ought to build this
yourself<00:00:42.140> if<00:00:42.590> you<00:00:42.649> had<00:00:42.739> a<00:00:42.770> little<00:00:42.950> bit<00:00:43.100> of<00:00:43.160> help

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
yourself if you had a little bit of help

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.860 
yourself if you had a little bit of help
in<00:00:43.399> patience<00:00:43.850> for<00:00:44.300> those<00:00:44.390> who<00:00:44.540> have<00:00:44.630> built<00:00:44.780> a

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
in patience for those who have built a

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.389 
in patience for those who have built a
kit<00:00:45.020> before<00:00:45.170> it's<00:00:45.440> gonna<00:00:45.559> be<00:00:45.649> no<00:00:45.739> problem<00:00:45.860> sure

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
kit before it's gonna be no problem sure

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.240 
kit before it's gonna be no problem sure
and<00:00:46.700> the<00:00:47.390> carbon<00:00:47.660> fiber<00:00:47.870> is<00:00:48.050> a<00:00:48.110> nice<00:00:48.260> touch<00:00:48.500> in

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
and the carbon fiber is a nice touch in

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.799 
and the carbon fiber is a nice touch in
terms<00:00:49.489> of<00:00:49.700> you<00:00:50.239> know<00:00:50.329> I<00:00:50.390> don't<00:00:50.540> know<00:00:50.600> if<00:00:50.690> that

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
terms of you know I don't know if that

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.110 
terms of you know I don't know if that
goes<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.110> technical<00:00:51.530> or<00:00:51.649> durability<00:00:51.950> but<00:00:52.340> you

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
goes the technical or durability but you

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.459 
goes the technical or durability but you
know<00:00:53.239> you've<00:00:53.390> got<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.899> threaded<00:00:54.230> shocks

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
know you've got the threaded shocks

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.170 
know you've got the threaded shocks
you've<00:00:54.800> got<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.160> carbon<00:00:55.460> fiber<00:00:55.670> you<00:00:55.940> get<00:00:56.090> the

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
you've got the carbon fiber you get the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.440 
you've got the carbon fiber you get the
blue<00:00:56.329> a<00:00:56.360> denies<00:00:56.719> parts<00:00:57.140> that<00:00:58.300> really<00:00:59.300> really

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
blue a denies parts that really really

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.000 
blue a denies parts that really really
help<00:00:59.660> it<00:00:59.780> pop<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:00.200> obviously<00:01:00.590> add<00:01:00.710> to<00:01:00.890> the

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
help it pop and obviously add to the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.729 
help it pop and obviously add to the
durability<00:01:01.520> and<00:01:01.610> lightness<00:01:02.440> nimbleness<00:01:03.440> and

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
durability and lightness nimbleness and

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.079 
durability and lightness nimbleness and
we<00:01:03.800> saw<00:01:03.950> that<00:01:03.980> on<00:01:04.160> the<00:01:04.250> track<00:01:04.520> when<00:01:04.699> we<00:01:04.789> ran<00:01:04.970> it

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
we saw that on the track when we ran it

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:05.590 
we saw that on the track when we ran it
for<00:01:05.210> sure

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
for sure

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.350 
for sure
right<00:01:05.840> yeah<00:01:06.280> other<00:01:07.280> technical<00:01:07.729> aspects<00:01:08.060> you

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
right yeah other technical aspects you

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.359 
right yeah other technical aspects you
will<00:01:08.509> have<00:01:08.630> to<00:01:08.750> get<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:08.960> saddle<00:01:09.200> packs<00:01:09.500> one

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
will have to get the saddle packs one

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.160 
will have to get the saddle packs one
one<00:01:10.729> downside<00:01:11.209> I<00:01:11.240> suppose<00:01:11.600> but<00:01:11.840> at<00:01:11.959> the<00:01:12.050> same

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
one downside I suppose but at the same

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.449 
one downside I suppose but at the same
time<00:01:12.380> that's<00:01:12.619> what<00:01:12.709> makes<00:01:12.860> this<00:01:12.979> thing<00:01:13.039> handle

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:13.459 
time that's what makes this thing handle

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.040 
time that's what makes this thing handle
so<00:01:13.580> well<00:01:13.729> you<00:01:14.119> get<00:01:14.270> a<00:01:14.300> perfectly<00:01:14.630> balanced

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
so well you get a perfectly balanced

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.590 
so well you get a perfectly balanced
pack<00:01:15.520> standard<00:01:16.520> ten<00:01:16.670> scale<00:01:16.940> system<00:01:17.330> you<00:01:17.509> don't

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
pack standard ten scale system you don't

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.790 
pack standard ten scale system you don't
have<00:01:17.780> to<00:01:17.840> invest<00:01:18.080> a<00:01:18.170> whole<00:01:18.259> lot<00:01:18.410> of<00:01:18.500> money<00:01:18.619> into

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
have to invest a whole lot of money into

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.120 
have to invest a whole lot of money into
it

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
it

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.800 
it
we're<00:01:19.369> running<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:19.789> can<00:01:19.910> see<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.179> Sidewinder

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
we're running you can see the Sidewinder

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.900 
we're running you can see the Sidewinder
ESC<00:01:21.289> just<00:01:21.770> by<00:01:21.890> happenstance<00:01:22.069> what<00:01:22.640> we<00:01:22.759> had

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
ESC just by happenstance what we had

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.580 
ESC just by happenstance what we had
that<00:01:23.119> day<00:01:23.360> and<00:01:23.630> this<00:01:23.929> is<00:01:24.080> just<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:24.380> standard

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
that day and this is just the standard

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.740 
that day and this is just the standard
cast<00:01:25.039> on<00:01:25.250> mama<00:01:25.429> Mac's<00:01:25.729> motor<00:01:26.030> I<00:01:26.330> think<00:01:26.539> it's<00:01:26.660> a

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
cast on mama Mac's motor I think it's a

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.469 
cast on mama Mac's motor I think it's a
5700<00:01:27.530> kV<00:01:27.890> yeah<00:01:28.399> we'll<00:01:28.580> definitely<00:01:28.670> it's

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
5700 kV yeah we'll definitely it's

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:30.669 
5700 kV yeah we'll definitely it's
probably<00:01:29.840> right<00:01:29.990> if<00:01:30.080> you're<00:01:30.229> inside<00:01:30.530> you're

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
probably right if you're inside you're

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
heating issues with the ESC now in terms

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.320 
heating issues with the ESC now in terms
of<00:01:36.289> cost<00:01:36.500> of<00:01:36.619> operation<00:01:37.160> pretty<00:01:37.789> darn<00:01:37.970> cheap<00:01:38.030> I

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
of cost of operation pretty darn cheap I

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.359 
of cost of operation pretty darn cheap I
think<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:38.599> kit<00:01:38.810> very<00:01:39.080> very<00:01:39.380> affordable<00:01:39.890> now

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
think the kit very very affordable now

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.910 
think the kit very very affordable now
if<00:01:40.490> you're<00:01:40.610> looking<00:01:40.849> at<00:01:40.910> the<00:01:41.000> beef<00:01:41.149> 44.1<00:01:41.899> now<00:01:42.410> I

if you're looking at the beef 44.1 now I

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.249 
if you're looking at the beef 44.1 now I
definitely<00:01:43.520> noticed<00:01:43.970> a<00:01:44.090> pretty<00:01:44.450> steep<00:01:44.990> price

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
definitely noticed a pretty steep price

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.770

increase<00:01:45.649> like<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.610> kit<00:01:46.910> I<00:01:47.090> thought<00:01:47.330> was<00:01:47.509> very

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
increase like the kit I thought was very

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.380 
increase like the kit I thought was very
expensive<00:01:48.200> for<00:01:48.590> what<00:01:48.979> it<00:01:49.009> was<00:01:49.220> but<00:01:49.970> in<00:01:50.119> terms

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
expensive for what it was but in terms

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.240 
expensive for what it was but in terms
of<00:01:50.479> durability<00:01:51.080> I<00:01:51.349> don't<00:01:51.920> have<00:01:52.069> many

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
over at RC nightmare we jumped it quite

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.920 
over at RC nightmare we jumped it quite
a<00:02:13.400> few<00:02:13.610> times<00:02:13.849> landed<00:02:14.420> pretty<00:02:14.569> hard<00:02:14.689> on<00:02:14.870> the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
a few times landed pretty hard on the

a few times landed pretty hard on the
nose<00:02:15.079> no<00:02:15.560> issues<00:02:15.860> at<00:02:16.010> all<00:02:16.129> had<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.819> probably

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
nose no issues at all had it probably

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.940 
nose no issues at all had it probably
four<00:02:17.420> hours<00:02:17.750> on<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.900> track<00:02:18.230> no<00:02:18.560> problems

four hours on the track no problems

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.380 
four hours on the track no problems
there<00:02:19.099> so<00:02:19.129> durability<00:02:19.790> is<00:02:19.849> really<00:02:20.060> good

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
there so durability is really good

after coming from driving two-wheel

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.380 
after coming from driving two-wheel
drive<00:03:27.860> buggies<00:03:28.190> are<00:03:28.310> kind<00:03:28.489> of<00:03:28.580> machine

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
drive buggies are kind of machine

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.850 
drive buggies are kind of machine
erasing<00:03:29.660> they're<00:03:30.080> kind<00:03:30.230> of<00:03:30.320> underwhelming

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
erasing they're kind of underwhelming

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.949 
erasing they're kind of underwhelming
but<00:03:30.950> this<00:03:31.160> thing<00:03:31.370> just<00:03:31.610> owns<00:03:31.910> with<00:03:32.570> the<00:03:32.690> Mamba

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
but this thing just owns with the Mamba

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.960 
but this thing just owns with the Mamba
system<00:03:33.290> powering<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.860> it's<00:03:34.400> got<00:03:34.550> power<00:03:34.760> to

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
system powering it it's got power to

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.180 
system powering it it's got power to
spare<00:03:35.060> and<00:03:35.450> uh<00:03:35.510> just<00:03:35.989> loads<00:03:36.350> of<00:03:36.410> fun<00:03:36.590> yeah<00:03:37.010> I

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
spare and uh just loads of fun yeah I

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.410 
spare and uh just loads of fun yeah I
think<00:03:37.250> we<00:03:37.459> really<00:03:37.670> underestimated<00:03:37.910> the

does exceptionally well yeah you make a

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.430 
does exceptionally well yeah you make a
good<00:03:55.880> point<00:03:55.940> that's<00:03:56.300> one<00:03:56.450> thing<00:03:56.630> I<00:03:56.780> was<00:03:57.410> going

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
good point that's one thing I was going

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.160 
good point that's one thing I was going
to<00:03:57.620> mention<00:03:57.739> it's<00:03:58.190> it's<00:03:58.820> we<00:03:59.209> bashed<00:03:59.480> it<00:03:59.750> but<00:03:59.930> it

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
to mention it's it's we bashed it but it

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.660 
to mention it's it's we bashed it but it
was<00:04:00.290> winter<00:04:00.560> time<00:04:00.590> right<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:01.040> we<00:04:01.310> had<00:04:01.430> a<00:04:01.459> lot<00:04:01.640> of

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
was winter time right so we had a lot of

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.380 
was winter time right so we had a lot of
options<00:04:02.150> in<00:04:02.270> terms<00:04:02.300> of<00:04:03.670> smooth<00:04:04.670> flat<00:04:04.940> surfaces

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
options in terms of smooth flat surfaces

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.970 
options in terms of smooth flat surfaces
and<00:04:05.600> things<00:04:05.780> like<00:04:05.900> that

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
and things like that

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.580 
and things like that
onto<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.060> value<00:04:08.420> it's<00:04:08.870> hard<00:04:09.080> to<00:04:09.170> really<00:04:09.320> value

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
onto the value it's hard to really value

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.190 
onto the value it's hard to really value
a<00:04:09.709> kit<00:04:10.040> I<00:04:10.220> think<00:04:10.760> it's<00:04:10.910> strong<00:04:11.209> value<00:04:11.750> in<00:04:12.050> terms

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
a kit I think it's strong value in terms

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.780 
a kit I think it's strong value in terms
of<00:04:12.440> getting<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:12.860> threaded<00:04:13.160> shocks<00:04:13.430> the

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
of getting the threaded shocks the

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.610 
of getting the threaded shocks the
carbon<00:04:14.120> fiber<00:04:14.390> the<00:04:15.050> price<00:04:15.260> point<00:04:15.530> you're

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
carbon fiber the price point you're

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.560 
carbon fiber the price point you're
picking<00:04:15.890> up<00:04:15.950> this<00:04:16.070> kit<00:04:16.340> yeah<00:04:17.060> right<00:04:17.330> and<00:04:17.510> you

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
picking up this kit yeah right and you

picking up this kit yeah right and you
get<00:04:17.660> the<00:04:17.720> added<00:04:18.049> value<00:04:18.169> of<00:04:18.350> just<00:04:18.530> knowing<00:04:18.919> your

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
get the added value of just knowing your

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.530 
get the added value of just knowing your
kit<00:04:19.250> that<00:04:19.400> much<00:04:19.549> better<00:04:19.790> an<00:04:19.970> experience<00:04:20.480> you

kit that much better an experience you
get<00:04:20.630> from<00:04:20.690> building<00:04:20.900> it<00:04:21.169> now<00:04:21.200> if<00:04:21.440> you're<00:04:21.560> not

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
get from building it now if you're not

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
someone who likes to build don't buy the

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.730 
someone who likes to build don't buy the
kit<00:04:23.570> you're<00:04:23.690> gonna<00:04:23.780> hate<00:04:23.990> it<00:04:24.050> then<00:04:24.290> you'll

kit you're gonna hate it then you'll

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.350 
kit you're gonna hate it then you'll
hate<00:04:24.830> any<00:04:25.040> good<00:04:25.250> but<00:04:25.460> yeah<00:04:25.760> I<00:04:25.790> liked<00:04:26.090> it<00:04:26.210> a<00:04:26.270> lot

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
they they do a really good job team

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.230 
they they do a really good job team
associated<00:04:27.890> great<00:04:28.310> manuals<00:04:28.700> for<00:04:28.820> building<00:04:29.120> it

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
associated great manuals for building it

the<00:04:29.600> value<00:04:29.990> aspect<00:04:30.410> if<00:04:30.530> you're<00:04:30.620> gonna<00:04:30.740> take<00:04:30.950> it

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
the value aspect if you're gonna take it

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.040 
the value aspect if you're gonna take it
on<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.250> track<00:04:31.330> it's<00:04:32.330> no<00:04:32.510> doubt<00:04:32.690> I<00:04:32.750> mean<00:04:32.900> you

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
on the track it's no doubt I mean you

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
on the track it's no doubt I mean you
absolutely<00:04:33.380> love<00:04:33.530> it

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
absolutely love it

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.070 
absolutely love it
yeah<00:04:34.220> and<00:04:34.370> then<00:04:34.460> in<00:04:34.580> terms<00:04:34.730> of<00:04:35.050> you<00:04:36.050> know

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
yeah and then in terms of you know

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.950 
yeah and then in terms of you know
performance<00:04:36.740> it<00:04:37.580> dominates<00:04:38.030> right<00:04:38.300> I<00:04:38.330> mean<00:04:38.540> at

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
performance it dominates right I mean at

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.660 
performance it dominates right I mean at
the<00:04:39.110> track<00:04:39.350> there<00:04:39.680> wasn't<00:04:39.980> a<00:04:40.010> there<00:04:40.400> wasn't<00:04:40.520> a

10 scale buggy and a skill surprisingly
buggies<00:04:44.690> were<00:04:44.810> having<00:04:45.050> a<00:04:45.110> big<00:04:45.290> a<00:04:45.560> hard<00:04:45.980> time

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
buggies were having a big a hard time

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.620 
buggies were having a big a hard time
now<00:04:46.340> it's<00:04:46.460> a<00:04:46.520> smaller<00:04:46.790> track<00:04:47.060> certainly<00:04:47.510> with

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
now it's a smaller track certainly with

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.180 
now it's a smaller track certainly with
some<00:04:47.780> longer<00:04:48.050> straightaways<00:04:48.830> they<00:04:48.980> probably

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
some longer straightaways they probably

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.800 
some longer straightaways they probably
would<00:04:49.370> have<00:04:49.430> made<00:04:49.580> made<00:04:50.300> up<00:04:50.450> for<00:04:50.750> the

would have made made up for the

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.050 
would have made made up for the

it's very predictable in the air mm-hmm

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.010 
it's very predictable in the air mm-hmm

an<00:05:05.090> imperfectly<00:05:05.600> we<00:05:05.810> were<00:05:05.900> chasing<00:05:06.320> the<00:05:06.380> tales

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
an imperfectly we were chasing the tales

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.500 
an imperfectly we were chasing the tales
of<00:05:06.740> a<00:05:06.830> skills<00:05:07.160> all<00:05:07.310> day<00:05:07.490> I<00:05:07.520> didn't<00:05:07.940> up<00:05:08.240> on<00:05:08.360> with

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
of a skills all day I didn't up on with

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.600 
of a skills all day I didn't up on with
it<00:05:08.720> sure<00:05:08.900> yeah<00:05:09.380> I<00:05:09.410> think<00:05:09.770> that<00:05:09.920> was<00:05:10.010> a<00:05:10.040> lot<00:05:10.580> of

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
it sure yeah I think that was a lot of

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.480 
it sure yeah I think that was a lot of
fun<00:05:10.850> so<00:05:11.390> we<00:05:12.350> go<00:05:12.470> Bill<00:05:12.680> and<00:05:12.830> Ted<00:05:12.980> on<00:05:13.100> this<00:05:13.250> and

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
fun so we go Bill and Ted on this and

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.610 
fun so we go Bill and Ted on this and
jump<00:05:13.700> in<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:13.850> phone<00:05:14.030> booth<00:05:14.240> do<00:05:15.050> I<00:05:15.110> go<00:05:15.260> back<00:05:15.290> in

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
jump in the phone booth do I go back in

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.400 
jump in the phone booth do I go back in
and<00:05:15.950> get<00:05:16.340> it<00:05:16.490> again<00:05:16.730> yeah<00:05:17.510> for<00:05:17.780> sure<00:05:17.960> you<00:05:18.290> know

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
and get it again yeah for sure you know

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.290 
and get it again yeah for sure you know
I<00:05:18.440> definitely<00:05:18.560> I<00:05:19.130> stick<00:05:19.520> with<00:05:19.640> the<00:05:19.700> 44<00:05:20.120> if<00:05:20.210> you

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
I definitely I stick with the 44 if you

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.480 
I definitely I stick with the 44 if you
can<00:05:20.420> still<00:05:20.630> get<00:05:20.840> it<00:05:20.990> honestly<00:05:21.410> I<00:05:21.620> don't<00:05:22.010> see<00:05:22.460> a

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
can still get it honestly I don't see a

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.040 
can still get it honestly I don't see a
heck<00:05:22.700> of<00:05:22.730> a<00:05:22.880> lot<00:05:22.970> of<00:05:23.090> need<00:05:23.210> to<00:05:23.330> get<00:05:23.510> the<00:05:23.690> dot<00:05:23.870> one

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
heck of a lot of need to get the dot one

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.280 
heck of a lot of need to get the dot one
now<00:05:24.290> they're<00:05:24.470> our<00:05:25.360> cases<00:05:26.360> like<00:05:26.540> I'm<00:05:26.690> a<00:05:26.720> before

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
now they're our cases like I'm a before

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.410 
now they're our cases like I'm a before
or<00:05:27.590> that<00:05:27.620> I<00:05:27.890> think<00:05:27.950> the<00:05:28.190> value<00:05:28.580> of<00:05:29.090> going<00:05:29.300> to

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
or that I think the value of going to

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.660 
or that I think the value of going to
the<00:05:29.480> dot<00:05:29.630> one<00:05:29.870> makes<00:05:30.260> a<00:05:30.350> lot<00:05:30.440> of<00:05:30.470> sense<00:05:30.740> the<00:05:30.950> 44

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
the dot one makes a lot of sense the 44

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.340 
the dot one makes a lot of sense the 44
for<00:05:31.850> some<00:05:32.030> reason<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.390> price<00:05:32.870> difference<00:05:33.230> is

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
for some reason the price difference is

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.960 
for some reason the price difference is
just<00:05:33.410> too<00:05:33.740> much<00:05:33.890> for<00:05:34.190> me<00:05:34.340> that's<00:05:34.640> just<00:05:34.730> my

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
just too much for me that's just my

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:35.410 
just too much for me that's just my
opinion

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
opinion
