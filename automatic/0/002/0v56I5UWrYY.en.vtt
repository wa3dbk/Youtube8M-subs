00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.020 

we're<00:02:12.950> going<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:13.220> create<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.459> new<00:02:13.610> folder

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
we're going to create a new folder

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.600 
we're going to create a new folder
called<00:02:14.209> lid<00:02:14.769> and<00:02:15.769> then<00:02:15.920> that<00:02:16.099> folder<00:02:16.459> we're

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
called lid and then that folder we're

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.670 
called lid and then that folder we're
going<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.819> create<00:02:17.000> two<00:02:17.239> new<00:02:17.269> folders<00:02:17.840> the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
going to create two new folders the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.910 
going to create two new folders the
first<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.099> going<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.340> be<00:02:19.459> cold<00:02:19.730> jars<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:20.989> the

first is going to be cold jars and the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.860 
first is going to be cold jars and the
second<00:02:22.250> is<00:02:22.340> going<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.610> be<00:02:22.730> cold<00:02:22.940> natives

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
second is going to be cold natives

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.069 
second is going to be cold natives
windows<00:02:26.769> going<00:02:27.769> over<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.160> WinRAR<00:02:28.660> we<00:02:29.660> can<00:02:29.840> copy

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
windows going over to WinRAR we can copy

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:37.000 
windows going over to WinRAR we can copy
the<00:02:30.459> jar<00:02:31.459> file<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.690> utility<00:02:33.170> file<00:02:36.010> can

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
the jar file and the utility file can

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.940 
the jar file and the utility file can
also<00:02:37.099> go<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:38.000> native<00:02:38.900> folder<00:02:39.260> native

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
also go to the native folder native

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.220 
also go to the native folder native
windows<00:02:40.489> and<00:02:40.730> copy<00:02:40.880> all<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.269> DLLs<00:02:41.690> into<00:02:42.109> the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
windows and copy all the DLLs into the

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.309 
windows and copy all the DLLs into the
native<00:02:42.410> windows<00:02:42.980> folder<00:02:46.690> so<00:02:47.690> in<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.109> jars

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
native windows folder so in the jars

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.000 
native windows folder so in the jars
file<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.799> have<00:02:48.980> two<00:02:49.370> jar<00:02:49.609> files<00:02:50.709> but<00:02:51.709> we<00:02:51.859> also

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
file you have two jar files but we also

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.250 
file you have two jar files but we also
need<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.400> add<00:02:52.549> the<00:02:52.579> slick<00:02:53.090> little<00:02:53.480> jar<00:02:53.810> folder

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
need to add the slick little jar folder

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.970 
need to add the slick little jar folder
to<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.799> jars<00:02:55.040> folder<00:02:59.380> so<00:03:00.380> let's<00:03:00.410> go<00:03:00.680> back<00:03:00.829> into

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
to the jars folder so let's go back into

to the jars folder so let's go back into
your<00:03:01.130> clips<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.790> open<00:03:02.569> up<00:03:02.660> our<00:03:02.810> project

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
your clips and open up our project

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.220 
your clips and open up our project
properties<00:03:04.180> let's<00:03:05.180> go<00:03:05.359> to<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.630> Java<00:03:05.900> build

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
properties let's go to the Java build

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.740 
properties let's go to the Java build
path<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:06.889> add<00:03:07.639> some<00:03:07.880> external<00:03:08.209> jars<00:03:10.480> so<00:03:11.480> hover

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
running but just to test it we're going

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.260 
running but just to test it we're going
to<00:03:35.170> create<00:03:35.320> another<00:03:35.410> class<00:03:36.990> and<00:03:37.990> call<00:03:38.140> it<00:03:38.290> name

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
to create another class and call it name

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
to create another class and call it name
and<00:03:42.030> in<00:03:43.030> this<00:03:43.150> class<00:03:43.420> we're<00:03:44.080> going<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.550> type<00:03:46.290> in

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
and in this class we're going to type in

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.440 
and in this class we're going to type in
the<00:03:48.190> main<00:03:48.310> method<00:03:48.490> displayed<00:03:49.300> create<00:03:51.210> to<00:03:52.210> try

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
the main method displayed create to try

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.130 
the main method displayed create to try
a<00:03:52.480> loop<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:56.580> once<00:03:57.580> I<00:03:57.730> run<00:03:57.940> this<00:03:58.120> it<00:03:58.420> should

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
a loop and once I run this it should

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.550 
a loop and once I run this it should
show<00:03:59.980> a<00:04:00.010> window<00:04:00.580> and<00:04:01.110> then<00:04:02.110> it<00:04:02.230> should<00:04:02.410> also

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
show a window and then it should also

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.140 
show a window and then it should also
immediately<00:04:03.160> despair<00:04:03.850> again<00:04:08.850> so<00:04:09.850> there<00:04:10.000> we<00:04:10.090> go

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
immediately despair again so there we go

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.700 
immediately despair again so there we go
it<00:04:10.450> works<00:04:11.280> thanks<00:04:12.280> for<00:04:12.370> watching
