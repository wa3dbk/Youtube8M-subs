of our grinding here you can see on this

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.470 
of our grinding here you can see on this
we<00:00:16.139> have<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.289> real<00:00:16.529> flat<00:00:16.920> grind<00:00:17.400> on<00:00:17.699> these

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
we have a real flat grind on these

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.550 
we have a real flat grind on these
blades<00:00:19.640> see<00:00:20.640> here<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.150> one's<00:00:21.420> flat<00:00:21.779> as<00:00:22.020> well

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.759

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
show you how we get that started I like

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.990 
show you how we get that started I like
to<00:00:28.980> start<00:00:29.250> out<00:00:29.429> hollow<00:00:30.179> grinding<00:00:30.750> them<00:00:30.900> and

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
to start out hollow grinding them and

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.170 
to start out hollow grinding them and
then<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.030> can<00:00:34.010> remove<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.160> lot<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.489> material

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
then I can remove a lot of that material

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.110 
then I can remove a lot of that material
after<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.390> get<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> hollow<00:00:39.870> ground<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:41.000> can<00:00:42.000> go

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
after I get a hollow ground I can go

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.660 
after I get a hollow ground I can go
ahead<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.480> start<00:00:42.719> flat<00:00:43.020> grinding<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:46.460> this<00:00:47.460> is

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
ahead and start flat grinding it this is

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:56.870 
ahead and start flat grinding it this is
just<00:00:47.700> your<00:00:48.120> basic<00:00:48.149> stock<00:00:48.840> removal<00:00:49.200> procedure

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.660 

I've<00:00:57.570> got<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> little<00:00:57.990> jig<00:00:58.320> set<00:00:58.650> up<00:00:58.830> or<00:00:59.190> into<00:00:59.550> our

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
I've got a little jig set up or into our

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.510 
I've got a little jig set up or into our
hollow<00:00:59.850> grinding<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:03.920> seems<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.070> lot<00:01:05.190> of<00:01:05.309> time

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
hollow grinding on seems a lot of time

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.220 
hollow grinding on seems a lot of time
and<00:01:05.790> frustration<00:01:08.540> let's<00:01:09.540> head<00:01:09.750> back<00:01:09.780> there

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
and frustration let's head back there

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:19.020 
and frustration let's head back there
and<00:01:11.040> we'll<00:01:11.220> get<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.520> grinding

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.770 

a<00:01:20.220> square<00:01:21.220> wheel<00:01:21.460> do<00:01:22.090> all<00:01:22.240> of<00:01:22.270> our<00:01:22.510> hollow

a square wheel do all of our hollow

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.560 
a square wheel do all of our hollow
grinding<00:01:23.320> on<00:01:23.500> this<00:01:24.460> basically<00:01:25.000> just<00:01:25.180> gives<00:01:25.390> us

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
grinding on this basically just gives us

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:36.849 
grinding on this basically just gives us
a<00:01:25.690> good<00:01:25.840> starting<00:01:26.320> point

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.330 

I<00:03:20.240> continued<00:03:21.240> grinding<00:03:21.750> on<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.080> now<00:03:23.070> I<00:03:23.100> get

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
I continued grinding on this now I get

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.060 
I continued grinding on this now I get
it<00:03:23.460> down<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:23.880> thickness<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.570> I<00:03:24.630> like<00:03:25.070> stop

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
it down to a thickness that I like stop

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.420 
it down to a thickness that I like stop
more<00:03:26.400> like<00:03:26.640> this<00:03:27.530> but<00:03:28.530> you<00:03:28.620> can<00:03:28.650> see<00:03:29.010> that's<00:03:29.220> a

more like this but you can see that's a
good<00:03:29.580> hollow<00:03:29.910> in<00:03:30.180> there<00:03:30.390> for<00:03:30.630> not<00:03:30.810> wheel<00:03:31.520> was

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
good hollow in there for not wheel was

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.890 
good hollow in there for not wheel was

after I grind on that for a while this

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.240 
after I grind on that for a while this
is<00:05:14.389> about<00:05:14.810> the<00:05:15.050> result<00:05:15.410> we're<00:05:15.620> looking<00:05:15.949> for

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
is about the result we're looking for

you want that to be a nice flat going

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.580 
you want that to be a nice flat going
through<00:05:19.190> there<00:05:19.690> I'll<00:05:20.690> take<00:05:20.930> it<00:05:21.080> over<00:05:21.350> we<00:05:21.500> have

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
through there I'll take it over we have

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.550 
through there I'll take it over we have
another<00:05:22.330> bigger<00:05:23.330> bader<00:05:23.690> that<00:05:24.050> I'll<00:05:24.199> go<00:05:24.380> and

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
another bigger bader that I'll go and

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.260 
another bigger bader that I'll go and
clean<00:05:24.770> this<00:05:24.979> up<00:05:25.220> on<00:05:26.050> and<00:05:27.430> after<00:05:28.430> I<00:05:28.490> do<00:05:28.580> that<00:05:28.970> I

think we'll be ready start doing some

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.330 
think we'll be ready start doing some
heat<00:05:32.030> treating<00:05:32.479> we<00:05:32.630> got<00:05:33.500> to<00:05:33.590> do<00:05:33.710> a<00:05:33.740> taper<00:05:34.070> in

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
heat treating we got to do a taper in

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.379 
heat treating we got to do a taper in
this<00:05:34.520> tank<00:05:34.820> still<00:05:36.250> but<00:05:37.250> that's<00:05:37.400> how<00:05:37.669> it<00:05:37.820> goes

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
this tank still but that's how it goes

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.259 
this tank still but that's how it goes
