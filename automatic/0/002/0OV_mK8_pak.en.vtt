00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
started first thing I'm going to do is

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.959 
started first thing I'm going to do is
take<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.210> all<00:02:00.390> enriched<00:02:01.170> flour<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:02.670> can

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
take that all enriched flour you can

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.399 
take that all enriched flour you can
choose<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.450> sift<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.200> particular

choose to sift it in this particular

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.649 
choose to sift it in this particular
case<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.130> did<00:02:05.430> not<00:02:05.579> do<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.299> add<00:02:06.600> your

incorporated and ultimately what we're
looking<00:02:40.380> for<00:02:40.590> here<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.070> essentially<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.090> ball

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
looking for here is a essentially a ball

looking for here is a essentially a ball
that<00:02:42.930> we<00:02:43.050> can<00:02:43.230> work<00:02:43.440> with<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.950> then<00:02:44.100> roll<00:02:44.430> out

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
that we can work with and then roll out

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.470 
that we can work with and then roll out
and<00:02:45.090> cut<00:02:45.720> into<00:02:45.960> three<00:02:46.740> inch<00:02:46.980> by<00:02:47.940> three<00:02:48.450> inch

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
and cut into three inch by three inch

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.860 
and cut into three inch by three inch
squares<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:49.950> again<00:02:50.520> I've<00:02:50.640> got<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.210> what<00:02:51.690> is

useful<00:04:06.690> skill<00:04:06.900> so<00:04:07.320> okay<00:04:07.560> we've<00:04:07.740> got<00:04:07.890> it<00:04:07.920> into<00:04:08.280> a

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
useful skill so okay we've got it into a

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.400 
useful skill so okay we've got it into a
ball<00:04:08.580> at<00:04:08.850> this<00:04:09.300> point<00:04:09.600> what<00:04:10.140> you're<00:04:10.200> going<00:04:10.380> to

to roll this baby out you're looking for

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.930 
to roll this baby out you're looking for
about<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.460> quarter<00:04:14.910> inch<00:04:15.090> thickness<00:04:15.870> is

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
about a quarter inch thickness is

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.520 
about a quarter inch thickness is
ultimately<00:04:17.940> what<00:04:18.210> we<00:04:18.330> were<00:04:18.420> looking<00:04:18.780> for<00:04:19.049> now

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
ultimately what we were looking for now

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.159 
ultimately what we were looking for now
with<00:04:19.680> this<00:04:19.830> recipe<00:04:20.100> I<00:04:20.870> specifically<00:04:21.870> used

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
with this recipe I specifically used

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.530 
with this recipe I specifically used
four<00:04:22.710> cups<00:04:23.070> of<00:04:23.280> flour<00:04:23.610> you<00:04:23.940> can<00:04:23.970> again<00:04:24.330> use

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
four cups of flour you can again use

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.860 
four cups of flour you can again use
four<00:04:24.840> to<00:04:24.930> five<00:04:25.169> cups<00:04:25.560> of

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
four to five cups of

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.030 
four to five cups of
our<00:04:25.960> uh<00:04:26.490> and<00:04:27.490> then<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.330> water<00:04:28.690> is<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.770> one

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
our uh and then the water is the one

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.129 
our uh and then the water is the one
thing<00:04:30.340> that<00:04:30.610> I<00:04:30.880> will<00:04:31.090> tell<00:04:31.300> you<00:04:31.479> that

depending on where you're viewing this

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.150 
depending on where you're viewing this
from<00:04:33.460> you<00:04:33.910> know<00:04:34.030> again<00:04:34.810> if<00:04:35.620> you're<00:04:35.770> viewing<00:04:35.949> us

from you know again if you're viewing us
from<00:04:36.340> a<00:04:36.430> place<00:04:36.669> like<00:04:37.030> Denver<00:04:37.650> you're<00:04:38.650> talking

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
from a place like Denver you're talking

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.350 
from a place like Denver you're talking
about<00:04:39.070> I<00:04:39.190> know<00:04:39.310> yeast<00:04:39.699> is<00:04:39.940> affected

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
about I know yeast is affected

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.780 
about I know yeast is affected
differently<00:04:40.690> but<00:04:40.990> arid<00:04:41.500> climates<00:04:42.040> as<00:04:42.190> well<00:04:42.460> it

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
differently but arid climates as well it

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.180 
differently but arid climates as well it
affects<00:04:43.150> it<00:04:43.300> differently<00:04:43.600> my<00:04:44.260> suggestion<00:04:45.040> to

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
affects it differently my suggestion to

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.129 
affects it differently my suggestion to
those<00:04:45.580> people<00:04:45.850> where<00:04:46.240> humidity<00:04:46.600> is<00:04:46.900> not<00:04:47.110> a

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
those people where humidity is not a

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.580 
those people where humidity is not a
factor<00:04:47.650> would<00:04:48.370> be<00:04:48.610> less<00:04:49.300> is<00:04:49.479> more<00:04:49.720> you<00:04:50.470> could

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
factor would be less is more you could

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.830 
factor would be less is more you could
always<00:04:50.800> add<00:04:51.220> a<00:04:51.280> little<00:04:51.550> bit<00:04:51.850> more<00:04:51.880> water<00:04:52.210> play

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
always add a little bit more water play

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.210 
always add a little bit more water play
with<00:04:53.050> it<00:04:53.169> because<00:04:53.260> ultimately<00:04:53.620> what<00:04:54.070> you're

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
with it because ultimately what you're

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.219 
with it because ultimately what you're
wanting<00:04:54.460> to<00:04:54.520> do<00:04:54.729> is<00:04:54.850> completely<00:04:55.240> dehydrate

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
wanting to do is completely dehydrate

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.070 
wanting to do is completely dehydrate
this<00:04:56.440> so<00:04:57.190> this<00:04:57.400> is<00:04:57.550> a<00:04:57.720> piece<00:04:58.720> of<00:04:58.750> material

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
this so this is a piece of material

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.670 
this so this is a piece of material
essentially<00:04:59.830> that<00:05:00.039> you<00:05:00.100> will<00:05:00.370> have<00:05:00.789> to

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
essentially that you will have to

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.120 
essentially that you will have to
rehydrate<00:05:02.699> and<00:05:04.110> it<00:05:05.110> will<00:05:05.199> be<00:05:05.320> a<00:05:05.350> better

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
rehydrate and it will be a better

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.830 
rehydrate and it will be a better
product<00:05:06.520> and<00:05:06.910> lasts<00:05:07.210> longer

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
product and lasts longer

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.230 
product and lasts longer
alright<00:05:08.770> so<00:05:08.949> now<00:05:09.130> what<00:05:09.280> I've<00:05:09.400> done<00:05:09.430> I've<00:05:09.760> cut

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
alright so now what I've done I've cut

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.719 
alright so now what I've done I've cut
up<00:05:10.449> all<00:05:10.690> these<00:05:11.080> little<00:05:11.260> pieces<00:05:11.560> here<00:05:12.100> we've

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
up all these little pieces here we've

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.029 
up all these little pieces here we've
got<00:05:13.030> one<00:05:13.419> two<00:05:13.660> three<00:05:13.690> four<00:05:14.050> five<00:05:14.530> six<00:05:14.800> seven

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
got one two three four five six seven

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.070 
got one two three four five six seven
eight<00:05:15.310> nine<00:05:15.370> ten<00:05:15.850> eleven<00:05:16.180> twelve<00:05:16.300> so<00:05:16.930> we've

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
eight nine ten eleven twelve so we've

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.469 
eight nine ten eleven twelve so we've
got<00:05:17.260> roughly<00:05:17.620> twelve<00:05:18.130> portions<00:05:18.760> these

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
got roughly twelve portions these

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.740 
got roughly twelve portions these
portion<00:05:19.990> sizes<00:05:20.410> right<00:05:20.590> here<00:05:20.830> are<00:05:20.979> about<00:05:21.750> 77

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
portion sizes right here are about 77

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.529 
portion sizes right here are about 77
calories<00:05:23.350> and<00:05:23.789> so<00:05:24.789> that<00:05:25.000> gives<00:05:25.150> you<00:05:25.300> an<00:05:25.389> idea

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
calories and so that gives you an idea

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:29.400 
calories and so that gives you an idea
based<00:05:26.110> on<00:05:26.320> a<00:05:26.550> 2,000<00:05:27.550> calorie<00:05:27.610> diet<00:05:28.090> per<00:05:28.840> person

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
based on a 2,000 calorie diet per person

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.529 
based on a 2,000 calorie diet per person
per<00:05:29.650> day<00:05:29.940> again<00:05:30.940> this<00:05:31.210> is<00:05:31.419> about

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
per day again this is about

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.480 
per day again this is about
sustainability<00:05:32.500> and<00:05:32.740> this<00:05:33.130> is<00:05:33.280> not

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
sustainability and this is not

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.450 
sustainability and this is not
necessarily<00:05:34.060> about<00:05:34.150> comfort<00:05:34.780> but<00:05:35.349> play<00:05:35.800> with

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
necessarily about comfort but play with

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.520 
necessarily about comfort but play with
this<00:05:36.820> recipe<00:05:37.510> by<00:05:37.720> adding<00:05:37.750> some<00:05:38.500> things

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
this recipe by adding some things

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.589 
this recipe by adding some things
alright<00:05:39.010> so<00:05:39.250> at<00:05:39.490> this<00:05:39.910> point<00:05:40.120> we've<00:05:40.360> cut<00:05:40.539> them

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
alright so at this point we've cut them

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:41.879 
alright so at this point we've cut them
in<00:05:40.690> squares<00:05:40.870> the<00:05:41.200> next<00:05:41.380> thing<00:05:41.470> you<00:05:41.560> want<00:05:41.740> to<00:05:41.770> do

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
in squares the next thing you want to do

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.710 
in squares the next thing you want to do
is<00:05:42.039> you<00:05:42.190> want<00:05:42.370> to<00:05:42.430> poke<00:05:42.610> holes<00:05:42.940> this<00:05:43.450> can<00:05:43.660> be

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
is you want to poke holes this can be

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.270 
is you want to poke holes this can be
done<00:05:43.900> a<00:05:43.930> number<00:05:44.260> of<00:05:44.349> ways<00:05:44.560> everybody<00:05:45.099> has<00:05:45.250> a

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
done a number of ways everybody has a

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.950 
done a number of ways everybody has a
fork<00:05:45.610> at<00:05:45.760> home<00:05:45.910> but<00:05:46.060> a<00:05:46.090> chopstick<00:05:46.720> works

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
fork at home but a chopstick works

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.300 
fork at home but a chopstick works
really<00:05:47.380> really<00:05:47.590> good<00:05:47.740> so<00:05:47.889> something<00:05:48.280> like

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
really really good so something like

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.610 
really really good so something like
that<00:05:48.700> going<00:05:49.300> all<00:05:49.479> the<00:05:49.810> way<00:05:49.930> through<00:05:50.260> the<00:05:50.410> dough

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
that going all the way through the dough

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.379 
that going all the way through the dough
if<00:05:50.889> you<00:05:51.280> can<00:05:51.400> almost<00:05:51.580> get<00:05:51.789> the<00:05:51.910> impression<00:05:51.940> on

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
if you can almost get the impression on

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:53.610 
if you can almost get the impression on
the<00:05:52.450> other<00:05:52.570> side<00:05:52.810> again<00:05:53.050> it's<00:05:53.200> going<00:05:53.320> to<00:05:53.410> make

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
the other side again it's going to make

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.500 
the other side again it's going to make
it<00:05:53.800> aerate<00:05:54.220> quicker<00:05:54.490> dry<00:05:54.849> out<00:05:55.060> quicker<00:05:55.300> and

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
it aerate quicker dry out quicker and

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.270 
it aerate quicker dry out quicker and
ultimately<00:05:56.169> again<00:05:56.860> it's<00:05:56.979> going<00:05:57.099> to<00:05:57.160> make<00:05:57.250> a

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
ultimately again it's going to make a

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.400 
ultimately again it's going to make a
better<00:05:57.520> product<00:05:57.820> if<00:05:58.210> it's<00:05:58.840> completely

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
better product if it's completely

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.800 
better product if it's completely
completely<00:06:00.130> dried<00:06:00.370> out<00:06:00.400> so<00:06:00.729> okay<00:06:01.000> this<00:06:01.510> is<00:06:01.690> the

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
completely dried out so okay this is the

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.960 
completely dried out so okay this is the
before<00:06:02.139> what<00:06:02.470> happens<00:06:02.830> next<00:06:03.039> is<00:06:03.340> these<00:06:03.669> go<00:06:03.849> in

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
before what happens next is these go in

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:04.500 
before what happens next is these go in
the<00:06:04.000> oven

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
the oven

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.279 
the oven
it<00:06:04.840> goes<00:06:05.020> in<00:06:05.199> the<00:06:05.289> oven<00:06:05.639> there<00:06:06.639> is<00:06:06.820> some

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
it goes in the oven there is some

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:10.379 
it goes in the oven there is some
discrepancies<00:06:08.289> but<00:06:08.500> I<00:06:08.530> would<00:06:08.770> say<00:06:09.389> 375

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
discrepancies but I would say 375

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.629 
discrepancies but I would say 375
degrees<00:06:10.810> for<00:06:11.110> the<00:06:11.199> first<00:06:11.440> half<00:06:11.740> hour<00:06:11.979> and<00:06:12.370> then

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 
degrees for the first half hour and then

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.189 
degrees for the first half hour and then
flip<00:06:13.120> them<00:06:13.449> and<00:06:13.690> then<00:06:14.760> 350<00:06:15.760> degrees<00:06:16.120> for<00:06:17.080> the

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 
flip them and then 350 degrees for the

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:19.409 
flip them and then 350 degrees for the
last<00:06:17.440> half<00:06:17.800> hour<00:06:17.979> so<00:06:18.340> if<00:06:18.669> you<00:06:18.940> get<00:06:19.060> that<00:06:19.210> right

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
last half hour so if you get that right

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:20.520 
last half hour so if you get that right
and<00:06:19.690> we're<00:06:19.900> going<00:06:20.020> to<00:06:20.050> put<00:06:20.199> that<00:06:20.320> up<00:06:20.410> on<00:06:20.470> the

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
and we're going to put that up on the

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.890 
and we're going to put that up on the
screen<00:06:20.860> for<00:06:20.889> you<00:06:21.160> that's<00:06:21.389> 375<00:06:22.389> degrees<00:06:22.750> for

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
screen for you that's 375 degrees for

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.460

the<00:06:22.990> first<00:06:23.020> half<00:06:23.380> hour<00:06:23.530> flip<00:06:24.039> them<00:06:24.660> then<00:06:25.660> 350

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
the first half hour flip them then 350

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.439 
the first half hour flip them then 350
on<00:06:26.680> the<00:06:26.830> other<00:06:27.039> side<00:06:27.430> ultimately<00:06:28.150> is<00:06:28.270> going<00:06:28.389> to

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
on the other side ultimately is going to

these little foil wrappers like this and

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.060 
these little foil wrappers like this and
seal<00:06:42.700> them<00:06:42.820> on<00:06:43.230> better<00:06:44.230> if<00:06:44.620> you<00:06:44.800> don't<00:06:44.980> have

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.070 
seal them on better if you don't have

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.470 
seal them on better if you don't have
oxygen<00:06:45.220> on<00:06:45.639> anything<00:06:45.880> it's<00:06:46.150> going<00:06:46.270> to<00:06:46.330> be<00:06:46.389> the

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:46.480 
oxygen on anything it's going to be the

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.879 
oxygen on anything it's going to be the
best<00:06:46.600> way<00:06:46.780> to<00:06:46.840> do<00:06:46.960> it<00:06:47.050> but<00:06:47.169> again<00:06:47.230> just<00:06:47.590> that<00:06:47.740> is

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:47.889 
best way to do it but again just that is

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:49.920 
best way to do it but again just that is
going<00:06:48.610> to<00:06:48.669> be<00:06:48.730> something<00:06:48.940> that<00:06:49.090> boom<00:06:49.630> fits

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930 
going to be something that boom fits

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.600 
going to be something that boom fits
right<00:06:50.139> in<00:06:50.260> a<00:06:50.320> cargo<00:06:50.680> pocket<00:06:50.889> anywhere<00:06:51.520> you

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
right in a cargo pocket anywhere you

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.490 
right in a cargo pocket anywhere you
want<00:06:51.760> to<00:06:51.790> put<00:06:51.970> it<00:06:52.090> and<00:06:52.270> then<00:06:52.450> it's<00:06:52.750> it's<00:06:53.290> really

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500 
want to put it and then it's it's really

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.930 
want to put it and then it's it's really
good<00:06:53.650> to<00:06:53.740> go<00:06:53.800> I<00:06:53.830> cannot<00:06:54.250> kid<00:06:54.490> you<00:06:54.610> these<00:06:54.790> are

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.610 
good to go I cannot kid you these are
that<00:06:55.090> tough<00:06:55.330> these<00:06:55.510> are<00:06:55.720> that<00:06:55.840> hard<00:06:56.080> the

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620 
that tough these are that hard the

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.190 
that tough these are that hard the
suggestion<00:06:57.520> to<00:06:57.730> eating<00:06:58.330> these<00:06:58.510> is<00:06:58.810> a

00:06:59.190 --> 00:06:59.200 
suggestion to eating these is a

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.700 
suggestion to eating these is a
rehydration<00:06:59.830> process<00:07:00.400> I<00:07:00.550> used<00:07:00.790> a<00:07:01.530> ginger<00:07:02.530> and

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:02.710 
rehydration process I used a ginger and

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.530 
rehydration process I used a ginger and
Chia<00:07:03.220> in<00:07:03.430> these<00:07:03.639> with<00:07:04.000> the<00:07:04.120> thought<00:07:04.360> of

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:04.540 
Chia in these with the thought of

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.720 
Chia in these with the thought of
boiling<00:07:04.960> some<00:07:05.169> tea<00:07:05.380> dipping<00:07:06.100> in<00:07:06.190> those<00:07:06.400> and

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:06.730 
boiling some tea dipping in those and

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.760 
boiling some tea dipping in those and
then<00:07:06.970> and<00:07:07.330> then<00:07:07.510> using<00:07:07.870> that<00:07:07.900> as<00:07:08.050> a<00:07:08.350> as<00:07:08.710> a

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770 
then and then using that as a as a

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.010 
then and then using that as a as a
survival<00:07:09.340> meal<00:07:09.490> for<00:07:09.730> myself<00:07:09.850> so<00:07:10.300> again<00:07:10.870> this
