always had the problem of getting ear

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.690 
always had the problem of getting ear
buds<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.110> they<00:01:10.110> would<00:01:10.979> either<00:01:11.130> fall<00:01:11.490> out<00:01:11.670> of

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700

my<00:01:11.820> ear<00:01:12.240> or<00:01:14.000> they<00:01:15.000> would<00:01:15.150> hurt<00:01:15.360> my<00:01:15.540> ear<00:01:15.840> because

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
my ear or they would hurt my ear because

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.609 
my ear or they would hurt my ear because
I<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.650> could<00:01:17.400> never<00:01:17.610> find<00:01:17.909> some<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:19.020> fit

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.270 
and then you send it back to ultimate
ears<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.399> believe<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.820> takes<00:01:45.950> well<00:01:46.950> less

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
ears and I believe it takes well less

ears and I believe it takes well less
less<00:01:47.909> than<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.210> month<00:01:48.420> for<00:01:48.899> them<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.290> build<00:01:49.530> your

less than a month for them to build your

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.330 
less than a month for them to build your

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
some that the price range is between 400

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.380 
some that the price range is between 400
and<00:02:06.560> $1600<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.340> pretty<00:02:08.520> wide<00:02:08.759> price<00:02:09.090> range

would say that these custom molded in

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:28.649 
would say that these custom molded in
ear<00:02:21.340> monitors<00:02:24.510> would<00:02:25.510> be<00:02:27.090> definitely<00:02:28.090> worth
