00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
soldier or a coal and this is a quick

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.159 
soldier or a coal and this is a quick
route<00:00:24.369> that<00:00:24.579> I<00:00:24.610> like<00:00:24.820> to<00:00:24.939> take<00:00:25.150> once<00:00:25.660> you<00:00:25.840> spawn

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
route that I like to take once you spawn

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.859 
route that I like to take once you spawn
in<00:00:26.380> and<00:00:26.619> the<00:00:27.340> reason<00:00:27.640> for<00:00:27.790> this<00:00:27.939> is<00:00:28.149> that<00:00:28.270> Wang

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
in and the reason for this is that Wang

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.810 
in and the reason for this is that Wang
that<00:00:29.169> I'm<00:00:29.259> shooting<00:00:29.500> at<00:00:29.710> right<00:00:29.950> now<00:00:30.160> you<00:00:30.669> can

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
that I'm shooting at right now you can

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.310 
that I'm shooting at right now you can
always<00:00:30.849> bounce<00:00:31.329> a<00:00:32.430> booshka<00:00:33.430> round<00:00:34.180> on<00:00:35.020> that

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
always bounce a booshka round on that

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.799 
always bounce a booshka round on that
wall<00:00:35.530> and<00:00:36.100> eventually<00:00:36.250> it<00:00:36.910> will<00:00:37.030> get<00:00:37.210> a<00:00:37.480> couple

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
wall and eventually it will get a couple

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.310 
wall and eventually it will get a couple
of<00:00:38.050> kills<00:00:38.289> the<00:00:39.280> reason<00:00:39.579> is<00:00:39.820> cuz<00:00:40.149> most<00:00:40.690> enemies

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
of kills the reason is cuz most enemies

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.620 
of kills the reason is cuz most enemies
take<00:00:41.710> cover<00:00:42.010> right<00:00:42.460> behind<00:00:42.789> that<00:00:42.940> vent<00:00:43.329> and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
take cover right behind that vent and

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.729 
take cover right behind that vent and
they<00:00:44.470> don't<00:00:44.680> really<00:00:45.010> pay<00:00:45.460> attention<00:00:46.180> to<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
they don't really pay attention to the

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.190 
they don't really pay attention to the
round<00:00:48.040> that's<00:00:48.250> being<00:00:48.520> shot<00:00:48.970> over<00:00:49.540> them<00:00:49.690> so

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
round that's being shot over them so

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.510 
round that's being shot over them so
they'll<00:00:50.500> think<00:00:50.620> that<00:00:50.920> it's<00:00:51.190> just<00:00:51.399> going

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
they'll think that it's just going

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.400 
they'll think that it's just going
someplace<00:00:51.820> else<00:00:52.420> for<00:00:52.630> some<00:00:52.840> reason<00:00:53.140> even

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
someplace else for some reason even

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.510 
someplace else for some reason even
though<00:00:53.590> there's<00:00:53.739> a<00:00:53.800> wall<00:00:53.950> right<00:00:53.980> behind<00:00:54.340> them

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
though there's a wall right behind them

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.639 
though there's a wall right behind them
it's<00:00:54.730> gonna<00:00:54.820> bounce<00:00:55.060> back<00:00:55.420> and<00:00:55.630> hurt<00:00:56.500> them<00:00:56.620> you

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
it's gonna bounce back and hurt them you

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.200 
it's gonna bounce back and hurt them you
know<00:00:56.829> it's<00:00:57.070> gonna<00:00:57.160> either<00:00:57.610> hurt<00:00:57.850> him<00:00:57.970> or<00:00:58.090> kill

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
know it's gonna either hurt him or kill

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.069 
know it's gonna either hurt him or kill
him<00:00:58.239> now<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.730> thing<00:01:01.000> with<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:01.660> bush<00:01:01.840> gun

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
using coal you have to use your

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.940 
using coal you have to use your
surroundings<00:01:04.360> like<00:01:05.049> I'm<00:01:05.199> just<00:01:05.439> bouncing<00:01:05.799> on<00:01:05.890> a

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
little note here I've been shooting a

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.949 
little note here I've been shooting a
lot<00:01:29.889> of<00:01:30.039> rounds<00:01:30.639> into<00:01:30.789> the<00:01:30.939> spawning<00:01:31.569> area

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:31.959 
lot of rounds into the spawning area

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:34.289 
lot of rounds into the spawning area
where<00:01:32.350> they<00:01:32.499> come<00:01:32.709> out<00:01:32.829> from<00:01:33.009> and<00:01:33.399> I<00:01:33.700> noticed

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
where they come out from and I noticed

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.599 
where they come out from and I noticed
that<00:01:34.539> it<00:01:34.749> doesn't<00:01:35.139> work<00:01:35.319> it<00:01:35.679> what<00:01:36.310> ends<00:01:36.549> up

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
that it doesn't work it what ends up

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.099 
that it doesn't work it what ends up
happening<00:01:36.670> is<00:01:37.119> that<00:01:37.299> the<00:01:37.450> kre-o<00:01:37.689> end<00:01:37.959> up

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
happening is that the kre-o end up

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:39.899 
happening is that the kre-o end up
eating<00:01:38.529> that<00:01:38.799> shot<00:01:39.069> so<00:01:39.279> don't<00:01:39.459> waste<00:01:39.579> ram

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
eating that shot so don't waste ram

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.760

way<00:01:55.810> I<00:01:55.840> like<00:01:56.259> playing<00:01:56.529> as<00:01:56.740> her<00:01:57.310> is<00:01:57.549> to<00:01:57.700> stay

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
way I like playing as her is to stay

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.879 
way I like playing as her is to stay
back<00:01:58.119> or<00:01:58.329> user<00:01:58.599> as<00:01:58.779> a<00:01:58.840> distraction<00:01:59.289> because<00:01:59.709> I

00:01:59.879 --> 00:01:59.889 
back or user as a distraction because I

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:01.620 
back or user as a distraction because I
have<00:02:00.009> a<00:02:00.039> sawed-off<00:02:00.310> now<00:02:01.209> it<00:02:01.329> doesn't<00:02:01.450> do

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
have a sawed-off now it doesn't do

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.019 
have a sawed-off now it doesn't do
damage<00:02:02.169> damage<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.889> a<00:02:02.919> modern<00:02:03.369> like<00:02:03.669> I<00:02:03.789> would

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:04.029 
damage damage to a modern like I would

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:07.859 
damage damage to a modern like I would
think<00:02:04.299> and<00:02:05.429> it's<00:02:06.429> great<00:02:06.700> against<00:02:07.060> grenadiers

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
think and it's great against grenadiers

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.940 
think and it's great against grenadiers
I've<00:02:08.140> noticed<00:02:08.410> that<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:10.500> like<00:02:11.500> I<00:02:11.590> said<00:02:11.650> it's

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
I've noticed that and like I said it's

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.530 
I've noticed that and like I said it's
not<00:02:12.040> that<00:02:12.099> great<00:02:12.520> against<00:02:12.849> Mahler's<00:02:13.239> or<00:02:13.390> maybe

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
and Sophia can actually go against a

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.020 
and Sophia can actually go against a
countess<00:02:33.500> in<00:02:33.740> my<00:02:33.920> opinion<00:02:34.310> still<00:02:34.550> feels<00:02:34.820> way

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
countess in my opinion still feels way

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.670 
countess in my opinion still feels way
more<00:02:36.670> stronger<00:02:37.670> than<00:02:37.820> countess<00:02:38.270> or<00:02:38.680> better

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
more stronger than countess or better

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.490 
more stronger than countess or better
than<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:39.980> Candace<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.640> should<00:02:40.820> say<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.500> she

you just shoot them once and they can't
do<00:03:52.310> anything<00:03:52.519> so<00:03:52.790> that's<00:03:53.750> really<00:03:54.019> good<00:03:54.260> again

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
do anything so that's really good again

do anything so that's really good again
stickers<00:03:54.950> and<00:03:55.190> again<00:03:55.910> screener<00:03:56.239> dears<00:03:56.450> it's

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
stickers and again screener dears it's

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.140 
stickers and again screener dears it's
also<00:03:56.930> well<00:03:57.260> from<00:03:57.680> far<00:03:57.860> distances<00:03:58.310> as<00:03:58.519> you<00:03:59.030> can

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
also well from far distances as you can

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.479 
also well from far distances as you can
see<00:03:59.299> their<00:03:59.660> most<00:04:00.380> locusts<00:04:00.920> or<00:04:01.010> most<00:04:01.250> grand

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
see their most locusts or most grand

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.160 
see their most locusts or most grand
ears<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:01.880> the<00:04:02.000> bland<00:04:02.329> train<00:04:02.600> from<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.900> sides

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
ears and the bland train from the sides

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.220 
ears and the bland train from the sides
and<00:04:03.410> it's<00:04:03.890> actually<00:04:04.549> a<00:04:05.060> good<00:04:05.570> idea<00:04:05.630> to<00:04:06.019> have<00:04:06.170> a

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
and it's actually a good idea to have a

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.250 
and it's actually a good idea to have a
marks<00:04:06.560> are<00:04:06.769> looking<00:04:07.070> between<00:04:07.820> the<00:04:08.239> having<00:04:09.170> no

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
marks are looking between the having no

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.900 
marks are looking between the having no
position<00:04:09.680> in<00:04:09.799> the<00:04:09.890> middle<00:04:10.160> that<00:04:10.310> way<00:04:10.640> you<00:04:10.700> can

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
position in the middle that way you can

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.310 
position in the middle that way you can
see<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.390> right<00:04:11.570> side<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:11.989> the<00:04:12.079> left<00:04:12.110> side

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
see the right side and the left side

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.440 
see the right side and the left side
because<00:04:13.070> eventually<00:04:13.489> you<00:04:13.790> have<00:04:13.940> grenadiers

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
because eventually you have grenadiers

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.289 
because eventually you have grenadiers
is<00:04:14.600> just<00:04:14.900> Lance<00:04:15.860> ringing<00:04:16.250> from<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.549> side<00:04:16.729> but

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
is just Lance ringing from the side but

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.060 
is just Lance ringing from the side but
moving<00:04:17.630> on<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:17.989> engineer<00:04:18.410> class<00:04:18.530> buried

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
moving on to the engineer class buried

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.130 
moving on to the engineer class buried
now<00:04:19.459> I<00:04:19.489> think<00:04:19.729> his<00:04:20.120> characters<00:04:20.570> use<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:20.989> most

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
now I think his characters use the most

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.810 
now I think his characters use the most
and<00:04:21.290> overrun<00:04:21.739> just<00:04:22.070> because<00:04:22.280> you<00:04:22.520> could<00:04:22.669> get<00:04:22.760> a

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
and overrun just because you could get a

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.790 
and overrun just because you could get a
lot<00:04:23.030> of<00:04:23.150> support<00:04:23.270> points<00:04:23.840> just<00:04:24.080> by<00:04:24.200> preparing

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
lot of support points just by preparing

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.100 
lot of support points just by preparing
various<00:04:25.370> like<00:04:25.640> here<00:04:25.850> but<00:04:26.240> not<00:04:26.330> only<00:04:26.510> that<00:04:26.660> but

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
various like here but not only that but

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.690 
various like here but not only that but
it<00:04:27.260> helps<00:04:27.470> against<00:04:27.770> locusts<00:04:28.220> as<00:04:28.370> well<00:04:28.520> as<00:04:28.580> like

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
it helps against locusts as well as like

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.460 
it helps against locusts as well as like
the<00:04:28.790> rager<00:04:29.000> you<00:04:29.540> know<00:04:29.690> a<00:04:29.720> ranger<00:04:30.169> with<00:04:30.320> down

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
the rager you know a ranger with down

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.200 
the rager you know a ranger with down
you<00:04:30.710> instant<00:04:31.190> or<00:04:31.280> kill<00:04:31.460> you<00:04:31.550> instantly<00:04:31.850> in<00:04:32.090> one

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
you instant or kill you instantly in one

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.409 
you instant or kill you instantly in one
hit<00:04:32.390> melee<00:04:33.169> if<00:04:33.410> it's<00:04:33.620> enraged<00:04:34.190> so<00:04:34.970> it's<00:04:35.270> a<00:04:35.330> good

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
hit melee if it's enraged so it's a good

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.050 
hit melee if it's enraged so it's a good
idea<00:04:35.479> to<00:04:35.690> repair<00:04:36.169> your<00:04:36.260> barriers

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
idea to repair your barriers

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.760 
idea to repair your barriers
the<00:04:37.210> century<00:04:37.600> gun<00:04:37.840> is<00:04:37.990> like<00:04:38.169> your<00:04:38.290> best<00:04:38.500> friend

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
the century gun is like your best friend

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.980 
the century gun is like your best friend
it's<00:04:39.040> really<00:04:39.760> really<00:04:40.030> strong<00:04:40.360> it'll<00:04:40.690> kill

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
it's really really strong it'll kill

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.080 
it's really really strong it'll kill
enemies<00:04:41.800> as<00:04:42.040> quick<00:04:42.340> as<00:04:42.460> possible

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
enemies as quick as possible

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.250 
enemies as quick as possible
and<00:04:43.830> buried<00:04:44.830> in<00:04:45.280> my<00:04:45.430> opinion<00:04:45.820> should<00:04:46.090> be<00:04:47.050> able

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
and buried in my opinion should be able

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.620 
and buried in my opinion should be able
to<00:04:47.440> hold<00:04:47.620> down<00:04:47.800> one<00:04:48.100> side<00:04:48.340> by<00:04:48.550> itself<00:04:48.970> in<00:04:49.240> a<00:04:49.600> way

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
to hold down one side by itself in a way

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.020 
to hold down one side by itself in a way
because<00:04:50.440> that<00:04:50.470> century<00:04:51.010> would<00:04:51.310> destroy<00:04:51.850> it

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
because that century would destroy it

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.240 
because that century would destroy it
like<00:04:52.060> a<00:04:52.210> whole<00:04:52.570> group<00:04:52.840> as<00:04:53.020> you<00:04:53.680> can<00:04:53.800> see<00:04:53.919> here<00:04:54.220> I

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
like a whole group as you can see here I

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.640 
like a whole group as you can see here I
just<00:04:54.490> run<00:04:54.880> in<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:55.330> end<00:04:55.840> up<00:04:55.960> dying<00:04:56.260> because<00:04:56.530> of

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
just run in and end up dying because of

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.420 
just run in and end up dying because of
grenade

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
grenade

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.490 
grenade
I've<00:04:57.550> always<00:04:57.730> died<00:04:58.000> by<00:04:58.180> a<00:04:58.210> grenade<00:04:58.360> not<00:04:59.260> really

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
I've always died by a grenade not really

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.340 
I've always died by a grenade not really
but<00:04:59.650> I<00:05:00.270> find<00:05:01.270> myself<00:05:01.389> getting<00:05:01.660> blown<00:05:02.020> up<00:05:02.050> a<00:05:02.230> lot

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
but I find myself getting blown up a lot

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.680 
but I find myself getting blown up a lot
when<00:05:02.500> I'm<00:05:02.590> using<00:05:02.710> bird<00:05:03.010> and<00:05:03.310> see<00:05:04.300> you<00:05:04.480> could

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
when I'm using bird and see you could

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.050 
when I'm using bird and see you could
hold<00:05:04.930> down<00:05:05.020> one<00:05:05.410> spot<00:05:05.590> by<00:05:05.919> himself<00:05:06.250> and<00:05:06.520> if

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
hold down one spot by himself and if

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.300 
hold down one spot by himself and if
there's<00:05:07.270> a<00:05:07.360> campus<00:05:07.780> like<00:05:08.590> in<00:05:08.800> this<00:05:09.040> scenario

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
there's a campus like in this scenario

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.280 
there's a campus like in this scenario
you<00:05:09.910> have<00:05:09.940> to<00:05:10.210> go<00:05:10.330> for<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.630> countess<00:05:10.990> don't<00:05:11.169> go

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
you have to go for the countess don't go

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.810 
you have to go for the countess don't go
for<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.560> modern<00:05:11.889> there<00:05:12.280> was<00:05:12.370> a<00:05:12.400> model<00:05:12.760> right

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
for the modern there was a model right

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.670 
for the modern there was a model right
there<00:05:13.060> but<00:05:13.300> I'm<00:05:13.389> just<00:05:13.570> avoiding<00:05:14.260> the<00:05:14.350> modern

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
there but I'm just avoiding the modern

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.469 
there but I'm just avoiding the modern
now<00:05:15.490> the<00:05:15.580> reason<00:05:15.820> for<00:05:15.850> this<00:05:16.030> is<00:05:16.270> because

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
now the reason for this is because

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.060 
now the reason for this is because
Kansas<00:05:16.840> is<00:05:17.110> just<00:05:17.290> going<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:17.470> be<00:05:17.560> killing<00:05:17.950> them

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
Kansas is just going to be killing them

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.890 
Kansas is just going to be killing them
over<00:05:18.430> and<00:05:18.550> over<00:05:18.820> so<00:05:19.000> if<00:05:19.360> you're<00:05:19.570> an<00:05:19.690> engineer

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
over and over so if you're an engineer

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.150 
over and over so if you're an engineer
you<00:05:20.560> might<00:05:21.520> as<00:05:21.669> well<00:05:21.820> just<00:05:22.030> go<00:05:22.180> for<00:05:22.360> the<00:05:23.160> Cantus

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
you might as well just go for the Cantus

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.420 
you might as well just go for the Cantus
because<00:05:24.460> it's<00:05:24.790> impossible<00:05:25.300> to<00:05:26.100> kill<00:05:27.100> a<00:05:27.160> modder

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
because it's impossible to kill a modder

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.850 
because it's impossible to kill a modder
if<00:05:27.639> there's<00:05:27.880> a<00:05:27.940> conscious<00:05:28.360> presence<00:05:28.860> here's

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
if there's a conscious presence here's

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.560 
if there's a conscious presence here's
another<00:05:30.070> thing<00:05:30.280> I<00:05:30.370> want<00:05:30.520> to<00:05:30.610> cover<00:05:30.700> I<00:05:31.030> know<00:05:31.419> a

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
another thing I want to cover I know a

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.760 
another thing I want to cover I know a
lot<00:05:31.720> of<00:05:31.750> people<00:05:32.020> don't<00:05:32.139> like<00:05:32.380> using<00:05:32.620> the

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
lot of people don't like using the

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
lot of people don't like using the
turning<00:05:33.130> because<00:05:33.310> they're<00:05:33.460> afraid<00:05:33.669> of

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
turning because they're afraid of

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.340 
turning because they're afraid of
getting<00:05:33.910> blown<00:05:34.300> up<00:05:34.330> or<00:05:34.630> getting<00:05:34.780> head<00:05:35.020> shot<00:05:35.229> it

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
getting blown up or getting head shot it

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.210 
getting blown up or getting head shot it
but<00:05:35.940> they're<00:05:36.940> really<00:05:37.300> easily<00:05:38.080> avoidable<00:05:38.740> as

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
but they're really easily avoidable as

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.200 
but they're really easily avoidable as
you<00:05:39.340> can<00:05:39.430> see<00:05:39.550> there's<00:05:39.729> a<00:05:39.760> grenade<00:05:39.880> right

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
you can see there's a grenade right

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.930 
you can see there's a grenade right
there<00:05:40.419> I<00:05:40.450> just<00:05:40.750> run<00:05:40.930> away<00:05:41.140> and<00:05:41.640> that's<00:05:42.640> pretty

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
there I just run away and that's pretty

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.460 
there I just run away and that's pretty
much<00:05:43.090> it<00:05:43.300> you<00:05:43.419> don't<00:05:43.600> really<00:05:43.900> have<00:05:44.140> to<00:05:44.260> worry

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
much it you don't really have to worry

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.779 
much it you don't really have to worry
that<00:05:44.680> much<00:05:44.860> about<00:05:44.919> a<00:05:45.130> grenade<00:05:45.400> unless<00:05:45.610> it

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
that much about a grenade unless it

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.640 
that much about a grenade unless it
sticks<00:05:46.000> in<00:05:46.150> your<00:05:46.180> face<00:05:46.419> somehow<00:05:46.810> a<00:05:47.020> miracle

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
sticks in your face somehow a miracle

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.560 
sticks in your face somehow a miracle
grenade<00:05:47.919> and<00:05:48.100> as<00:05:48.610> for<00:05:48.789> the<00:05:48.880> breach<00:05:49.060> shot<00:05:49.360> it's

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
grenade and as for the breach shot it's

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.510 
grenade and as for the breach shot it's
really<00:05:50.080> difficult<00:05:50.440> for<00:05:50.830> someone<00:05:51.130> using<00:05:51.460> a

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
really difficult for someone using a

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.550 
really difficult for someone using a
breach<00:05:51.729> shot<00:05:52.000> to<00:05:52.210> headshot<00:05:52.720> you<00:05:52.870> and<00:05:53.080> most<00:05:53.440> of

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
breach shot to headshot you and most of

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.719 
breach shot to headshot you and most of
the<00:05:53.620> time<00:05:53.800> you'll<00:05:53.950> be<00:05:54.070> able<00:05:54.160> to<00:05:54.310> take<00:05:54.490> them<00:05:54.610> out

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
the time you'll be able to take them out

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.880 
the time you'll be able to take them out
like<00:05:54.880> I<00:05:55.000> did<00:05:55.060> there<00:05:55.450> and<00:05:55.630> not<00:05:56.350> only<00:05:56.470> that<00:05:56.620> but

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
like I did there and not only that but

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.170 
like I did there and not only that but
you<00:05:56.979> could<00:05:57.070> get<00:05:57.220> a<00:05:57.250> good<00:05:57.580> amount<00:05:57.820> of<00:05:57.970> kills

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
you could get a good amount of kills

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.350 
you could get a good amount of kills
just<00:05:58.570> by<00:05:58.720> using<00:05:59.410> a<00:05:59.620> turret<00:05:59.950> you<00:06:00.150> just<00:06:01.150> have<00:06:01.270> to

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
just by using a turret you just have to

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.469 
just by using a turret you just have to
watch<00:06:01.750> out<00:06:02.340> how<00:06:03.340> far<00:06:03.610> I've<00:06:03.789> been<00:06:03.820> angle<00:06:04.180> or<00:06:04.300> how

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
watch out how far I've been angle or how

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.629 
watch out how far I've been angle or how
much<00:06:04.630> of<00:06:04.690> an<00:06:04.870> angle<00:06:05.050> you<00:06:05.320> have<00:06:05.350> because<00:06:06.310> let's

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
much of an angle you have because let's

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:08.129 
much of an angle you have because let's
say<00:06:06.760> you<00:06:06.820> look<00:06:07.060> at<00:06:07.180> the<00:06:07.270> barrier<00:06:07.570> to<00:06:07.750> my<00:06:07.870> left

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.139 
say you look at the barrier to my left

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.520 
say you look at the barrier to my left
where<00:06:08.620> the<00:06:08.850> one<00:06:09.850> of<00:06:09.940> my<00:06:10.060> teammates<00:06:10.270> at<00:06:10.539> your

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
where the one of my teammates at your

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.290 
where the one of my teammates at your
and<00:06:11.740> it<00:06:11.860> angle<00:06:12.220> with<00:06:12.340> the<00:06:12.430> breach<00:06:12.669> shot<00:06:13.030> could

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
and it angle with the breach shot could

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.820 
and it angle with the breach shot could
actually<00:06:13.510> shoot<00:06:13.930> you<00:06:14.139> so<00:06:14.320> you<00:06:14.380> need<00:06:14.620> to<00:06:14.710> be

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
actually shoot you so you need to be

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.860 
actually shoot you so you need to be
careful<00:06:15.039> here's<00:06:15.729> a<00:06:15.820> great<00:06:16.000> example<00:06:16.030> coming<00:06:16.660> up

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
careful here's a great example coming up

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.170 
careful here's a great example coming up
I<00:06:17.050> think<00:06:17.350> in<00:06:17.470> just<00:06:17.650> a<00:06:17.800> couple<00:06:17.950> of<00:06:18.160> seconds<00:06:18.580> but

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
I think in just a couple of seconds but

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.870 
I think in just a couple of seconds but
I'm<00:06:19.810> looking<00:06:20.080> to<00:06:20.169> my<00:06:20.260> left<00:06:20.289> and<00:06:20.850> eventually<00:06:21.850> I

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
I'm looking to my left and eventually I

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.150 
I'm looking to my left and eventually I
get<00:06:22.180> my<00:06:22.389> hip<00:06:22.539> hop<00:06:22.720> so<00:06:23.139> you<00:06:23.530> do<00:06:23.740> have<00:06:23.770> to<00:06:23.950> be

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
get my hip hop so you do have to be

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.610 
get my hip hop so you do have to be
careful<00:06:24.310> and<00:06:24.729> I'm<00:06:25.600> also<00:06:25.840> doing<00:06:26.020> the<00:06:26.320> locus

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
careful and I'm also doing the locus

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.010 
careful and I'm also doing the locus

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
guys can see about the breach shot and
