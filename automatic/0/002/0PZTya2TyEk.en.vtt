kind of wanted to address some of the

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.650 
kind of wanted to address some of the
things<00:00:07.230> that<00:00:07.710> I've<00:00:08.010> found<00:00:08.389> messin<00:00:09.389> with<00:00:09.510> this

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
things that I've found messin with this

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.410 
things that I've found messin with this
guy<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.900> little<00:00:10.170> that<00:00:10.920> are<00:00:11.639> kind<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.150> need<00:00:12.360> of

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
guy a little that are kind of in need of

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.020 
guy a little that are kind of in need of
a<00:00:13.080> little<00:00:13.650> bit<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:14.009> fix<00:00:14.250> namely<00:00:14.670> like<00:00:14.849> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
a little bit of a fix namely like the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.439 
a little bit of a fix namely like the
squeaky<00:00:15.509> hips<00:00:15.949> but<00:00:16.949> notably<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.730> fix<00:00:18.150> will

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
squeaky hips but notably that fix will

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.080 
squeaky hips but notably that fix will
cause<00:00:18.779> this<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.289> be<00:00:19.470> more<00:00:20.100> loose<00:00:20.400> than<00:00:20.430> when

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
cause this to be more loose than when

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.740 
cause this to be more loose than when
you<00:00:21.270> were<00:00:21.660> actually<00:00:21.900> able<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.410> squeak<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:23.750> it

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
you were actually able to squeak it it

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.570 
you were actually able to squeak it it
has<00:00:24.869> pros<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.470> cons<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.949> haven't<00:00:26.400> actually

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
has pros and cons I haven't actually

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.240 
has pros and cons I haven't actually
seen<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.090> affect<00:00:27.720> how<00:00:27.930> he's<00:00:28.170> able<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.590> stand<00:00:29.010> it

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
seen it affect how he's able to stand it

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.190 
seen it affect how he's able to stand it
all<00:00:30.980> so<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.309> mean<00:00:32.550> he<00:00:32.640> still<00:00:32.850> holds<00:00:33.200> positions

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
all so I mean he still holds positions

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.590 
all so I mean he still holds positions
very<00:00:34.410> well<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:34.920> don't<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:36.120> know<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.329> hasn't

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
very well so I don't you know it hasn't

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.920 
very well so I don't you know it hasn't
really<00:00:36.719> been<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.230> hindrance<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.520> me<00:00:38.670> and

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
really been a hindrance to me and

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.600 
really been a hindrance to me and
frankly<00:00:39.930> if<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.110> keeps<00:00:40.260> going<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.829> squeaking

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
frankly if it keeps going and squeaking

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.430 
frankly if it keeps going and squeaking
eventually<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.300> plastics<00:00:42.809> gonna<00:00:43.020> wear<00:00:43.230> away

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
eventually that plastics gonna wear away

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.979 
eventually that plastics gonna wear away
anyway<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.250> he's<00:00:44.550> gonna<00:00:44.730> end<00:00:44.879> up<00:00:45.030> flop<00:00:45.809> in

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
anyway and he's gonna end up flop in

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.650 
anyway and he's gonna end up flop in
anyway<00:00:46.399> so<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.730> fix<00:00:47.969> most<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.539> is

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
anyway so for this fix most of it is

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.619 
anyway so for this fix most of it is
gonna<00:00:48.809> be<00:00:49.190> screwdriver<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:51.120> really<00:00:51.449> like

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
gonna be screwdriver and I really like

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.610 
gonna be screwdriver and I really like
to<00:00:51.660> use<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.640> 80<00:00:53.640> weight<00:00:53.969> silicon<00:00:54.629> shackle

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
to use this 80 weight silicon shackle

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.599 
to use this 80 weight silicon shackle
it's<00:00:56.579> basically<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.239> model<00:00:57.510> car<00:00:57.750> RC<00:00:58.530> cars<00:00:58.859> to

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
it's basically for model car RC cars to

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.520 
it's basically for model car RC cars to
lubricate<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.420> springs<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.050> stuff<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.440> works

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
lubricate the springs and stuff it works

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.250 
lubricate the springs and stuff it works
really<00:01:01.890> well<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.399> don't<00:01:02.430> need<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> lot<00:01:03.260> I've

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
really well you don't need a lot I've

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.380 
really well you don't need a lot I've
had<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.650> for<00:01:04.920> years<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.640> used<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.090> many

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
had it for years and used it on many

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.109 
had it for years and used it on many
transformers<00:01:07.260> s.h.figuarts<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.939> can

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
transformers s.h.figuarts and you can

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.859 
transformers s.h.figuarts and you can
see<00:01:09.270> I've<00:01:09.450> barely<00:01:10.970> broke<00:01:11.970> into<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.390> at<00:01:12.570> all

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
see I've barely broke into it at all

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.859 
see I've barely broke into it at all
so<00:01:13.350> yeah<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:14.430> real<00:01:14.610> easy<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.030> do<00:01:15.420> most<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.780> these

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
so yeah it real easy to do most of these

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.010 
so yeah it real easy to do most of these
fixes<00:01:17.150> so<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> first<00:01:18.540> thing<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.810> want<00:01:18.990> to

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
fixes so the first thing I want to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.660 
fixes so the first thing I want to
address<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.470> just<00:01:19.710> how<00:01:19.830> difficult<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
address is just how difficult it is to

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.230 
address is just how difficult it is to
actually<00:01:21.330> move<00:01:21.570> his<00:01:21.960> head<00:01:22.229> here<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.850> do

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
actually move his head here you can do

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.030 
actually move his head here you can do
this<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> couple<00:01:24.570> different<00:01:25.229> ways<00:01:25.259> if<00:01:25.770> you're

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
this a couple different ways if you're

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.740 
this a couple different ways if you're
not<00:01:26.159> comfortable<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:26.850> using<00:01:27.330> any<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
not comfortable with using any of the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.840 
not comfortable with using any of the
lubricant<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:28.920> simply<00:01:29.310> loosen

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
lubricant on here you can simply loosen

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.899 
lubricant on here you can simply loosen
the<00:01:30.450> screw<00:01:30.810> under<00:01:30.960> here<00:01:31.470> like<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> quarter<00:01:32.729> turn

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
the screw under here like a quarter turn

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.819 
the screw under here like a quarter turn
or<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.960> will<00:01:34.020> make<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.350> easier<00:01:34.680> it's

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
or so and that will make it easier it's

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.550 
or so and that will make it easier it's
still<00:01:35.009> gonna<00:01:35.130> be<00:01:35.310> tough<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:36.090> uh<00:01:36.170> yeah<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.380> will

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
still gonna be tough but uh yeah it will

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.460 
still gonna be tough but uh yeah it will
make<00:01:37.710> everything<00:01:38.009> easier<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:39.119> way<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.470> really

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
make everything easier the way I really

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.280 
make everything easier the way I really
recommend<00:01:41.009> doing<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.490> though<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:43.049> take

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
recommend doing it though and you take

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.350 
recommend doing it though and you take
this<00:01:43.439> screw<00:01:43.740> out<00:01:43.799> once<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.790> get<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> screw

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
this screw out once you get the screw

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.510 
this screw out once you get the screw
out<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.659> can<00:01:45.810> actually<00:01:46.130> carefully<00:01:47.130> wiggle

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
out you can actually carefully wiggle

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.450 
out you can actually carefully wiggle
his<00:01:47.670> face<00:01:47.939> off<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.899> post<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.740> you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
his face off of this post here and you

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.569 
his face off of this post here and you
can<00:01:50.610> see<00:01:50.790> it's<00:01:51.270> all<00:01:51.479> painted<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.320> there<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.399> if

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
can see it's all painted on there so if

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.010 
can see it's all painted on there so if
this<00:01:53.700> wasn't<00:01:53.970> painted<00:01:54.479> we<00:01:54.600> wouldn't<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:54.990> a

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
this wasn't painted we wouldn't have a

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.789 
this wasn't painted we wouldn't have a
problem<00:01:55.250> so<00:01:56.250> we<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.490> then<00:01:56.610> go<00:01:56.850> ahead<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.240> take

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
problem so we can then go ahead and take

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.889 
problem so we can then go ahead and take
actually<00:01:58.799> I'm<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.130> noticing<00:01:59.399> here<00:01:59.899> this

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
actually I'm just noticing here this

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.539 
actually I'm just noticing here this
could<00:02:01.079> also<00:02:01.290> be<00:02:01.439> causing<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.040> problem<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.430> we

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
could also be causing a problem and we

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.209 
could also be causing a problem and we
got<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.729> little<00:02:02.939> bit<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.270> mold<00:02:03.509> flashing<00:02:04.219> looks

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
got a little bit of mold flashing looks

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.920 
got a little bit of mold flashing looks
like<00:02:05.399> left<00:02:05.909> over<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.390> there<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.840> could

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
like left over on there so you could

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.300 
like left over on there so you could
probably<00:02:07.140> sand<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.740> away<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.129> make<00:02:08.280> it

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
probably sand that away and make it

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.279 
probably sand that away and make it
easier<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:09.300> we<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.539> go<00:02:09.810> ahead<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.140> take

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
easier but we can just go ahead and take

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.680 
easier but we can just go ahead and take
our<00:02:10.500> shot<00:02:11.160> coil<00:02:11.430> here

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
our shot coil here

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.580 
our shot coil here
put<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.840> little<00:02:13.020> drop<00:02:13.770> on<00:02:14.040> here<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.780> then

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
put a little drop on here and then

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.150 
put a little drop on here and then
basically<00:02:17.130> whoops<00:02:18.530> all<00:02:19.530> right<00:02:19.830> sorry<00:02:20.130> about

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
basically whoops all right sorry about

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.980 
basically whoops all right sorry about
that<00:02:20.340> dropped<00:02:20.790> his<00:02:20.940> head<00:02:21.090> on<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.360> floor<00:02:21.390> but

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
that dropped his head on the floor but

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.570 
that dropped his head on the floor but
basically<00:02:22.410> after<00:02:22.590> we<00:02:22.800> get<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.310> can<00:02:23.460> go

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
basically after we get that you can go

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.730 
basically after we get that you can go
ahead<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.000> put<00:02:24.420> his<00:02:24.540> head<00:02:24.720> on<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.110> give<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.590> a

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
ahead and put his head on and give it a

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.040 
ahead and put his head on and give it a
couple<00:02:25.950> good<00:02:26.250> turns<00:02:26.940> around<00:02:27.210> like<00:02:27.570> that<00:02:27.780> and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
couple good turns around like that and

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.620 
couple good turns around like that and
you<00:02:28.530> can<00:02:28.680> see<00:02:28.830> just<00:02:28.860> how<00:02:29.190> free<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:30.030> head<00:02:30.480> is

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
you can see just how free that head is

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.230 
you can see just how free that head is
moving<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.590> once<00:02:31.830> we're<00:02:32.040> done<00:02:32.700> with<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.030> we

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
moving and once we're done with that we

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.940 
moving and once we're done with that we
go<00:02:33.360> ahead<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.600> put<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.020> screw<00:02:34.260> right<00:02:34.500> back<00:02:34.710> in

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
go ahead and put the screw right back in

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.710 
go ahead and put the screw right back in
and<00:02:35.280> you'll<00:02:35.610> have<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.820> nice<00:02:36.000> free<00:02:36.300> head<00:02:36.540> and

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
and you'll have a nice free head and

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.690 
and you'll have a nice free head and
just<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:37.020> reference<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.560> put<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.920> screw<00:02:38.190> back<00:02:38.220> in

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
just a reference I put the screw back in

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.330 
just a reference I put the screw back in
and<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.540> could<00:02:39.690> just<00:02:39.900> see<00:02:40.110> look<00:02:40.980> how<00:02:41.100> easy

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
and you could just see look how easy

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.580 
and you could just see look how easy
that<00:02:41.550> is<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.910> turn<00:02:42.090> for<00:02:42.330> me<00:02:42.450> now<00:02:42.600> not<00:02:42.990> a<00:02:43.290> problem

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
that is to turn for me now not a problem

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.930 
that is to turn for me now not a problem
at<00:02:43.890> all<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.640> very<00:02:45.270> easy<00:02:45.510> fix<00:02:46.550> so<00:02:47.550> next<00:02:47.730> we'll

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
at all so very easy fix so next we'll

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.790 
at all so very easy fix so next we'll
talk<00:02:48.090> about<00:02:48.270> how<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.630> fix<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.170> squeaky<00:02:49.590> hips

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
talk about how to fix the squeaky hips

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.390 
talk about how to fix the squeaky hips
he<00:02:50.610> has<00:02:50.790> two<00:02:51.090> screws<00:02:51.450> on<00:02:51.600> each<00:02:51.810> side<00:02:51.840> here<00:02:52.410> one

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
he has two screws on each side here one

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.060 
he has two screws on each side here one
on<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.730> back<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:55.670> one<00:02:56.670> on<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:57.060> front<00:02:57.360> here<00:02:58.070> I

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
on the back and one on the front here I

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.700 
on the back and one on the front here I
did<00:02:59.580> take<00:02:59.760> this<00:02:59.910> whole<00:03:00.180> toy<00:03:00.510> apart<00:03:00.960> trying<00:03:01.560> to

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
did take this whole toy apart trying to

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.470 
did take this whole toy apart trying to
figure<00:03:01.980> out<00:03:02.130> because<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.610> didn't<00:03:03.120> see<00:03:03.300> this

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
figure out because I didn't see this

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.560 
figure out because I didn't see this
front<00:03:03.750> screw<00:03:04.050> at<00:03:04.410> first<00:03:04.740> and<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.240> thought<00:03:06.240> that

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
front screw at first and I thought that

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.690 
front screw at first and I thought that
these<00:03:06.930> sides<00:03:07.200> were<00:03:07.410> actually<00:03:07.770> stuck<00:03:08.100> in<00:03:08.460> the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
these sides were actually stuck in the

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.250 
these sides were actually stuck in the
torso<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.510> took<00:03:09.630> them<00:03:09.840> all<00:03:09.990> the<00:03:10.080> way<00:03:10.170> apart

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
torso so I took them all the way apart

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.250 
torso so I took them all the way apart
but<00:03:11.010> it's<00:03:11.130> not<00:03:11.280> so<00:03:11.910> once<00:03:12.330> again<00:03:12.630> once<00:03:13.020> you<00:03:13.170> have

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
but it's not so once again once you have

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.020 
but it's not so once again once you have
that<00:03:13.470> off<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.100> just<00:03:14.130> pull<00:03:14.460> this<00:03:14.580> out<00:03:14.760> and

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
that off you can just pull this out and

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.120 
that off you can just pull this out and
you<00:03:15.120> can<00:03:15.240> see<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.600> put<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:16.170> pretty<00:03:16.920> healthy

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
you can see I put a pretty healthy

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.490 
you can see I put a pretty healthy
amount<00:03:17.580> of<00:03:17.700> lubricant<00:03:18.330> on<00:03:18.510> there<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:19.320> can

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
amount of lubricant on there you can

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.530 
amount of lubricant on there you can
probably<00:03:19.740> get<00:03:20.010> away<00:03:20.130> with<00:03:20.250> less<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.240> just

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
probably get away with less I just

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.760 
probably get away with less I just
didn't<00:03:21.750> want<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:21.959> hear<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.230> squeak<00:03:22.500> at<00:03:22.650> all

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
didn't want to hear the squeak at all

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.250 
didn't want to hear the squeak at all
but<00:03:23.670> you<00:03:23.850> know<00:03:23.940> basically<00:03:24.330> lubricate<00:03:24.959> that

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
but you know basically lubricate that

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.120 
but you know basically lubricate that
pole<00:03:25.800> in<00:03:25.980> this<00:03:26.130> hole<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:27.110> you<00:03:28.110> know<00:03:28.230> reattach

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
pole in this hole and you know reattach

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.070 
pole in this hole and you know reattach
everything<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.820> there<00:03:29.970> will<00:03:30.060> be<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.660> squeak

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
everything and there will be that squeak

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.860 
everything and there will be that squeak
taken<00:03:31.500> care<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:32.000> now<00:03:33.000> before<00:03:33.300> I<00:03:33.330> go<00:03:33.540> on<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.690> the

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
taken care of now before I go on to the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.230 
taken care of now before I go on to the
next<00:03:34.080> part<00:03:34.350> I<00:03:34.680> know<00:03:35.250> I'm<00:03:35.640> gonna<00:03:35.760> get<00:03:35.970> someone

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
next part I know I'm gonna get someone

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.840 
next part I know I'm gonna get someone
asking<00:03:36.600> can<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:36.959> use<00:03:37.230> wd-40<00:03:38.130> as<00:03:38.340> opposed<00:03:38.700> to

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.170 
point out in this fix video for now and
I<00:05:01.860> plan<00:05:01.919> on<00:05:02.280> trying<00:05:02.490> to<00:05:02.639> figure<00:05:02.880> out<00:05:02.940> how<00:05:03.150> to

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
I plan on trying to figure out how to

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.390 
I plan on trying to figure out how to
make<00:05:03.449> these<00:05:03.630> hinges<00:05:04.110> work<00:05:04.289> better<00:05:04.590> but<00:05:05.250> right

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
make these hinges work better but right

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.920 
make these hinges work better but right
now<00:05:05.520> I've<00:05:05.639> got<00:05:05.819> a<00:05:05.849> little<00:05:06.210> bit<00:05:06.539> of<00:05:06.630> a<00:05:06.690> problem

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
now I've got a little bit of a problem

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.540 
now I've got a little bit of a problem
with<00:05:07.259> my<00:05:07.319> swoop<00:05:08.180> specifically<00:05:09.180> as<00:05:09.919> I<00:05:10.919> tried<00:05:11.520> to

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
with my swoop specifically as I tried to

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.300 
with my swoop specifically as I tried to
transform<00:05:12.300> it<00:05:12.560> that<00:05:13.560> ended<00:05:13.949> up<00:05:14.039> breaking

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
transform it that ended up breaking

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.219 
transform it that ended up breaking
right<00:05:14.699> off<00:05:14.940> and<00:05:15.240> I<00:05:15.479> know<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:15.870> probably

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
right off and I know you probably

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:19.999 
right off and I know you probably
thought<00:05:16.380> it<00:05:16.440> just<00:05:16.680> broke<00:05:17.009> but<00:05:17.310> no<00:05:18.409> this<00:05:19.409> is<00:05:19.740> so

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 
thought it just broke but no this is so

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.140 
thought it just broke but no this is so
jammed<00:05:20.759> in<00:05:21.210> here<00:05:22.250> it's<00:05:23.250> like<00:05:23.340> gonna<00:05:23.550> basically

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
jammed in here it's like gonna basically

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.350 
jammed in here it's like gonna basically
rip<00:05:24.419> my<00:05:24.599> fingernail<00:05:25.139> off<00:05:25.380> trying<00:05:25.830> to<00:05:26.240> get<00:05:27.240> it

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
out of there I pretty much need a

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.700 
out of there I pretty much need a
screwdriver<00:05:29.220> to<00:05:30.229> even<00:05:31.229> make<00:05:31.409> it<00:05:31.469> tempt<00:05:33.710> to

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
screwdriver to even make it tempt to

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.310 
screwdriver to even make it tempt to
unplug<00:05:35.159> that<00:05:35.400> and<00:05:35.610> you<00:05:35.699> can<00:05:35.880> see<00:05:36.180> actually<00:05:37.169> on

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
unplug that and you can see actually on

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.010 
unplug that and you can see actually on
the<00:05:37.530> piece<00:05:37.770> that<00:05:38.610> that<00:05:38.669> Chrome<00:05:39.330> has<00:05:39.360> actually

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
the piece that that Chrome has actually

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.930 
the piece that that Chrome has actually
flaked<00:05:40.380> away<00:05:40.759> so<00:05:41.759> it's<00:05:42.240> not<00:05:42.560> the<00:05:43.560> top<00:05:43.830> tab<00:05:44.219> or

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
flaked away so it's not the top tab or

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.209 
flaked away so it's not the top tab or
the<00:05:45.180> middle<00:05:45.659> tab<00:05:45.870> that<00:05:46.199> actually<00:05:46.590> binds<00:05:46.949> this

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:47.219 
the middle tab that actually binds this

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:49.520 
the middle tab that actually binds this
thing<00:05:47.460> and<00:05:47.639> risks<00:05:48.030> this<00:05:48.180> thing<00:05:48.419> cracking<00:05:48.870> it's

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
thing and risks this thing cracking it's

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.529 
thing and risks this thing cracking it's
the<00:05:49.800> bottom<00:05:50.130> one<00:05:50.310> so<00:05:50.789> much<00:05:51.000> so<00:05:51.210> that<00:05:51.419> I've

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
the bottom one so much so that I've

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.990 
the bottom one so much so that I've
heard<00:05:51.719> from<00:05:52.409> a<00:05:52.590> friend<00:05:52.710> who<00:05:53.070> was<00:05:53.430> plugging<00:05:53.759> his

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
heard from a friend who was plugging his

NE<00:05:54.240> pushed<00:05:54.599> here<00:05:54.900> and<00:05:55.080> started<00:05:55.440> cracking<00:05:55.889> on

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
NE pushed here and started cracking on

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.719 
NE pushed here and started cracking on
his<00:05:56.280> so<00:05:56.940> what<00:05:57.690> you<00:05:57.870> really<00:05:58.139> need<00:05:58.440> to<00:05:58.469> do<00:05:58.740> and<00:05:59.580> I

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
his so what you really need to do and I

his so what you really need to do and I
don't<00:05:59.940> even<00:06:00.000> know<00:06:00.240> if<00:06:00.270> you<00:06:00.449> need<00:06:00.659> to<00:06:01.909> I'm<00:06:02.909> not

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
don't even know if you need to I'm not

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.909 
don't even know if you need to I'm not
sure<00:06:03.180> I<00:06:03.539> haven't<00:06:03.840> done<00:06:04.229> this<00:06:04.380> yet<00:06:04.440> because<00:06:04.710> I'm

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
sure I haven't done this yet because I'm

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.469 
sure I haven't done this yet because I'm
waiting<00:06:05.130> to<00:06:05.310> see<00:06:05.370> if<00:06:05.550> I<00:06:05.669> can<00:06:05.880> get<00:06:06.030> this<00:06:06.210> piece

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
waiting to see if I can get this piece

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.330 
waiting to see if I can get this piece
replaced<00:06:07.080> or<00:06:07.349> the<00:06:07.469> leg<00:06:07.680> or<00:06:07.949> if<00:06:08.009> I'm<00:06:08.130> gonna<00:06:08.219> have

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
replaced or the leg or if I'm gonna have

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.939 
replaced or the leg or if I'm gonna have
to<00:06:08.430> replace<00:06:08.699> all<00:06:08.940> of<00:06:08.969> Mysore<00:06:09.949> because

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:10.949 
to replace all of Mysore because

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:12.920 
to replace all of Mysore because
basically<00:06:11.190> first<00:06:11.699> time<00:06:11.969> I<00:06:12.240> tried<00:06:12.659> to<00:06:12.810> do

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
basically first time I tried to do

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.740 
basically first time I tried to do
anything<00:06:13.400> proper<00:06:14.400> it<00:06:14.550> just<00:06:14.759> snapped<00:06:15.569> right

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
anything proper it just snapped right

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.399 
anything proper it just snapped right
out<00:06:16.020> of<00:06:16.050> there

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.409 
out of there

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:20.510 
out of there
so<00:06:16.590> that<00:06:16.740> wasn't<00:06:16.919> good<00:06:17.240> but<00:06:18.240> anyway<00:06:19.460> take<00:06:20.460> a

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
so that wasn't good but anyway take a

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.240 
so that wasn't good but anyway take a
like<00:06:21.419> a<00:06:21.449> hobby<00:06:22.789> a<00:06:23.789> hobby<00:06:24.330> file<00:06:24.930> and<00:06:25.229> file<00:06:25.979> the

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
like a hobby a hobby file and file the

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.920 
like a hobby a hobby file and file the
top<00:06:26.490> surface<00:06:26.729> because<00:06:27.120> it's<00:06:27.270> the<00:06:27.419> top<00:06:27.599> surface

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
top surface because it's the top surface

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.730 
top surface because it's the top surface
of<00:06:28.380> this<00:06:28.789> it's<00:06:29.789> gonna<00:06:29.909> be<00:06:30.090> hard<00:06:30.270> to<00:06:30.389> see<00:06:30.599> but<00:06:30.990> if

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
of this it's gonna be hard to see but if

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.860 
of this it's gonna be hard to see but if
you<00:06:32.009> can<00:06:32.219> kind<00:06:32.460> of<00:06:32.550> get<00:06:32.759> in<00:06:32.909> there<00:06:33.090> it's<00:06:33.659> the

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
you can kind of get in there it's the

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.439 
you can kind of get in there it's the
top<00:06:34.080> surface<00:06:34.440> that<00:06:34.830> actually<00:06:35.190> catches<00:06:35.760> on<00:06:35.969> the

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:36.449 
top surface that actually catches on the

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:39.540 
top surface that actually catches on the
top<00:06:37.409> of<00:06:37.589> the<00:06:37.650> leg<00:06:37.889> so<00:06:38.099> either<00:06:38.339> file<00:06:38.639> this<00:06:38.880> one

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
top of the leg so either file this one

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.040 
top of the leg so either file this one
or<00:06:39.729> file<00:06:40.270> this<00:06:40.840> hole<00:06:41.139> up<00:06:41.440> here<00:06:41.710> a<00:06:42.190> little<00:06:42.669> bit

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
or file this hole up here a little bit

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.589 
or file this hole up here a little bit
or<00:06:44.050> and<00:06:44.590> I<00:06:45.220> don't<00:06:45.460> really<00:06:45.729> think<00:06:45.970> that<00:06:46.090> it's<00:06:46.330> a

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:46.599 
or and I don't really think that it's a

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:49.260 
or and I don't really think that it's a
very<00:06:47.050> important<00:06:47.530> piece<00:06:47.710> I<00:06:48.009> might<00:06:48.639> end<00:06:48.849> up<00:06:49.030> if

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
very important piece I might end up if

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.809 
very important piece I might end up if
this<00:06:49.599> still<00:06:50.169> causes<00:06:50.620> resistance<00:06:50.949> I<00:06:51.430> might<00:06:51.669> end

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:51.819 
this still causes resistance I might end

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:53.790 
this still causes resistance I might end
up<00:06:52.000> with<00:06:52.060> either<00:06:52.780> this<00:06:53.050> one<00:06:53.319> or<00:06:53.349> the

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
up with either this one or the

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.339 
up with either this one or the
replacement<00:06:54.069> whatever<00:06:54.669> ends<00:06:54.940> up<00:06:55.000> happening

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:55.349 
replacement whatever ends up happening

flyout filing this this tab off because

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.379 
flyout filing this this tab off because
it's<00:06:59.229> not<00:06:59.379> really<00:06:59.909> important<00:07:00.909> in<00:07:01.090> the<00:07:01.240> grand

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:01.389 
it's not really important in the grand

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:04.379 
it's not really important in the grand
scheme<00:07:01.659> of<00:07:01.960> things<00:07:02.169> and<00:07:02.349> it's<00:07:02.710> just<00:07:03.270> very<00:07:04.270> very

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:04.389 
scheme of things and it's just very very

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:06.719 
scheme of things and it's just very very
scary<00:07:05.020> I<00:07:05.110> don't<00:07:05.500> want<00:07:05.680> to<00:07:05.800> push<00:07:05.979> the<00:07:06.190> leg<00:07:06.400> past

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:06.729 
scary I don't want to push the leg past

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:09.119 
scary I don't want to push the leg past
this<00:07:07.229> because<00:07:08.229> I'm<00:07:08.470> afraid<00:07:08.590> something's

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:09.129 
this because I'm afraid something's

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:11.580 
this because I'm afraid something's
gonna<00:07:09.250> break<00:07:09.460> on<00:07:09.729> this<00:07:09.909> one<00:07:09.970> too<00:07:10.360> and<00:07:10.629> in<00:07:11.110> the

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590 
gonna break on this one too and in the

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.649 
gonna break on this one too and in the
event<00:07:11.860> I<00:07:12.009> only<00:07:12.190> get<00:07:12.460> a<00:07:12.490> replacement<00:07:12.819> piece<00:07:13.300> I

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:13.659 
event I only get a replacement piece I

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:16.680 
event I only get a replacement piece I
don't<00:07:13.840> want<00:07:14.139> to<00:07:14.229> risk<00:07:14.380> breaking<00:07:14.650> this<00:07:15.009> one<00:07:15.690> and

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:16.690 
don't want to risk breaking this one and

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.570 
don't want to risk breaking this one and
cuz<00:07:17.080> it<00:07:17.199> gets<00:07:17.289> jammed<00:07:17.650> in<00:07:17.889> there<00:07:18.099> the<00:07:18.220> same<00:07:18.400> way

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:18.580 
cuz it gets jammed in there the same way

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.330 
cuz it gets jammed in there the same way
that<00:07:18.759> this<00:07:18.970> one<00:07:19.180> did<00:07:19.360> so<00:07:19.860> that's<00:07:20.860> what<00:07:21.069> I<00:07:21.099> have

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:21.340 
that this one did so that's what I have

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.930 
that this one did so that's what I have
for<00:07:21.370> fixes<00:07:22.000> for<00:07:22.210> now<00:07:22.360> like<00:07:23.080> I<00:07:23.229> said<00:07:23.440> there<00:07:23.680> is

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:23.940 
for fixes for now like I said there is

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.730 
for fixes for now like I said there is
things<00:07:24.940> you<00:07:25.180> can<00:07:25.360> do<00:07:25.509> to<00:07:25.630> make<00:07:25.810> this<00:07:25.990> this

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:26.740 
things you can do to make this this

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.909 
things you can do to make this this
joint<00:07:27.340> mechanism<00:07:27.550> here<00:07:28.180> a<00:07:28.210> bit<00:07:28.539> more<00:07:28.780> loose

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 
joint mechanism here a bit more loose

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:31.890 
joint mechanism here a bit more loose
the<00:07:30.310> one<00:07:30.610> time<00:07:30.789> I<00:07:30.849> transformed<00:07:31.539> it<00:07:31.630> I<00:07:31.690> didn't

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:31.900 
the one time I transformed it I didn't
