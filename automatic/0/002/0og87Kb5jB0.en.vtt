vanishing point all right this is called

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.429 
vanishing point all right this is called
a<00:01:04.860> horizon<00:01:05.430> line<00:01:05.939> why<00:01:06.420> because<00:01:07.290> it's

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
a horizon line why because it's

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
for it huh horizontal the horizon line

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.140 
for it huh horizontal the horizon line
and<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:15.119> point<00:01:15.439> aka<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.640> most<00:01:17.640> important

start<00:02:10.399> look<00:02:10.519> like<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.700> train<00:02:10.909> track<00:02:11.120> already

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.329 
start look like a train track already

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:15.130 
start look like a train track already
isn't<00:02:11.599> it<00:02:11.719> that<00:02:12.560> was<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.709> motorcycle<00:02:13.959> all<00:02:14.959> right

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
isn't it that was a motorcycle all right

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.080 
isn't it that was a motorcycle all right
there's<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.590> lot<00:02:16.159> more<00:02:16.189> of<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.579> train<00:02:16.849> track

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
there's a lot more of a train track

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.289 
there's a lot more of a train track
there<00:02:17.560> oops<00:02:18.560> oh<00:02:18.829> the<00:02:19.519> train<00:02:19.730> strike<00:02:19.969> starting

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
there oops oh the train strike starting

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.670 
there oops oh the train strike starting
to<00:02:20.359> fall<00:02:20.540> apart<00:02:20.569> that's<00:02:21.049> hard<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.349> draw<00:02:21.530> these

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
to fall apart that's hard to draw these

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.709 
to fall apart that's hard to draw these
things<00:02:21.890> with<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:22.489> big<00:02:22.670> giant<00:02:22.849> fat<00:02:23.239> marker<00:02:23.689> you

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:23.719 
things with a big giant fat marker you

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.899 
things with a big giant fat marker you
know<00:02:24.010> all<00:02:25.010> right<00:02:25.159> when<00:02:25.280> is<00:02:25.489> it<00:02:25.579> is<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.730> train

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:25.909 
know all right when is it is a train

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.789 
know all right when is it is a train
track<00:02:26.120> now<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:26.569> can<00:02:26.870> see<00:02:27.079> if<00:02:27.170> can't<00:02:27.409> you<00:02:27.560> isn't

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
track now you can see if can't you isn't

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.649 
track now you can see if can't you isn't
it<00:02:27.859> beautiful<00:02:28.069> all<00:02:29.030> right<00:02:29.180> now<00:02:29.269> check<00:02:29.299> this

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
it beautiful all right now check this

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.899 
it beautiful all right now check this
out<00:02:29.920> over<00:02:30.920> here<00:02:31.250> I'm<00:02:32.030> gonna<00:02:32.269> draw<00:02:33.250> lat<00:02:34.250> now

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
out over here I'm gonna draw lat now

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.509 
out over here I'm gonna draw lat now
this<00:02:35.090> is<00:02:36.459> secondary<00:02:37.459> most<00:02:37.939> important<00:02:38.329> line

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
this is secondary most important line

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.250 
this is secondary most important line
actually<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:41.329> perspective<00:02:41.900> lines<00:02:42.049> are

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
actually the perspective lines are

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.780 
actually the perspective lines are
pretty<00:02:42.319> much<00:02:42.530> equal<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.129> point<00:02:43.400> somewhat

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
pretty much equal to the point somewhat

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.039 
pretty much equal to the point somewhat
because<00:02:44.599> they<00:02:44.750> all<00:02:44.900> converge<00:02:45.500> on<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.310> point

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
because they all converge on the point

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.250 
because they all converge on the point
all<00:02:48.049> right<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:48.349> here's<00:02:48.379> a<00:02:50.019> perspective<00:02:51.019> light

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
all right so here's a perspective light

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.770 
all right so here's a perspective light
I'm<00:02:51.470> gonna<00:02:51.620> do<00:02:51.829> there<00:02:52.069> here's<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:53.060> vertical

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
I'm gonna do there here's a vertical

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.530 
I'm gonna do there here's a vertical
line<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.379> look<00:02:55.099> I've<00:02:55.760> got<00:02:55.939> the<00:02:56.060> makings<00:02:56.209> of<00:02:56.450> a

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
line and look I've got the makings of a

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.059 
line and look I've got the makings of a
building<00:02:56.870> draw<00:02:57.019> a<00:02:57.049> couple<00:02:57.379> horizontal<00:02:57.889> lines

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
building draw a couple horizontal lines

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.319 
building draw a couple horizontal lines
here<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:59.919> and<00:03:00.919> then<00:03:01.159> another<00:03:01.430> vertical<00:03:01.819> line

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
here and and then another vertical line

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.080 
here and and then another vertical line
and<00:03:03.049> by<00:03:03.200> god<00:03:03.409> we<00:03:03.530> got<00:03:03.680> yourself<00:03:03.980> a<00:03:04.069> bills<00:03:04.280> now

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
and by god we got yourself a bills now

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.610 
and by god we got yourself a bills now
shade<00:03:05.419> it<00:03:05.599> in<00:03:05.689> there<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.109> you<00:03:06.169> can<00:03:06.290> tell<00:03:06.470> it's

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
shade it in there so you can tell it's

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.369 
shade it in there so you can tell it's
three-dimensional<00:03:07.400> that's<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.870> looks<00:03:09.109> even

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
three-dimensional that's that looks even

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.589 
three-dimensional that's that looks even
better<00:03:09.530> doesn't<00:03:09.859> it<00:03:09.980> looks<00:03:10.519> like<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:10.970> beautiful

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
better doesn't it looks like a beautiful

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.720 
better doesn't it looks like a beautiful
building<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.950> often<00:03:13.189> draw<00:03:13.340> a<00:03:13.370> couple<00:03:13.639> more

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
building and often draw a couple more

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
building and often draw a couple more
perspective<00:03:14.269> lines<00:03:14.449> here<00:03:14.900> look<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:15.739> can<00:03:15.889> draw<00:03:16.099> a

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
perspective lines here look I can draw a

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.619 
perspective lines here look I can draw a
window<00:03:17.750> on<00:03:18.109> this<00:03:18.379> thing<00:03:18.709> oh<00:03:18.979> man<00:03:19.729> sir<00:03:20.000> that's<00:03:20.419> a

window on this thing oh man sir that's a
fabulous<00:03:20.930> looking<00:03:21.440> building<00:03:21.859> isn't<00:03:22.010> it<00:03:22.159> I

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
fabulous looking building isn't it I

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.059 
fabulous looking building isn't it I
should<00:03:22.849> say<00:03:23.090> it<00:03:23.120> is<00:03:23.479> all<00:03:24.409> right<00:03:24.530> over<00:03:24.829> here<00:03:25.010> I'm

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409 
line here and a line here now once again

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:34.839 
line here and a line here now once again
you've<00:03:33.680> gotta<00:03:33.829> get<00:03:33.979> your<00:03:34.040> perspective<00:03:34.400> lines

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
you've gotta get your perspective lines

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.300 
you've gotta get your perspective lines
in<00:03:35.150> there<00:03:35.269> cuz<00:03:35.479> they<00:03:35.629> are<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.470> most<00:03:36.739> important

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
in there cuz they are the most important

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.670 
in there cuz they are the most important
well<00:03:38.060> next<00:03:38.269> to<00:03:38.419> the<00:03:38.479> point<00:03:38.720> actually<00:03:39.590> you

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
well next to the point actually you

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.640 
well next to the point actually you
can't<00:03:41.109> you<00:03:42.109> can't<00:03:42.409> disassociate<00:03:43.280> them<00:03:43.819> with

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
can't you can't disassociate them with

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.369 
can't you can't disassociate them with
the<00:03:45.650> point<00:03:45.919> because<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:47.090> know<00:03:47.209> they<00:03:47.599> are<00:03:47.989> as

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
the point because you know they are as

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.170 
the point because you know they are as
important<00:03:49.040> every<00:03:49.609> way<00:03:49.729> that<00:03:49.970> I'm<00:03:50.090> gonna

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
important every way that I'm gonna

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.719 
important every way that I'm gonna
define<00:03:50.629> look<00:03:51.530> here's<00:03:52.069> where<00:03:52.280> that<00:03:52.430> leg<00:03:52.609> would

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:52.729 
define look here's where that leg would

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:56.679 
define look here's where that leg would
come<00:03:52.939> down<00:03:53.090> well<00:03:55.150> no<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.389> would<00:03:56.510> come<00:03:56.659> down

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:56.689 
come down well no it would come down

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.890 
come down well no it would come down
that's<00:03:57.379> far<00:03:57.620> okay<00:03:57.949> all<00:03:58.790> right<00:03:59.060> I<00:03:59.090> remember<00:03:59.659> how
