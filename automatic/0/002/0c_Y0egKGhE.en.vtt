00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.600
 hi how about my name is carlos arispe 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.480
 and this is the channel of molcajete and 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.150
 you already know what this is about 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.779
 this time the theme of the month on the channel 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.000
 it's the first time or the last time in my 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.130
 case I got the subject of the first time 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.470
 for which I had planned to make a 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.449
 video about a project that is starting 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.780
 with some youtubers and in which I 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.970
 I'm participating however, there was no 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.500
 the opportunity to do something like 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.090
 that I had thought so in exchange for 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.170
 that's what I'm going to tell you about the first time 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.740
 to use a mac 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.120
 [Music] 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.460
 the first thing I should do is 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.260
 clarify that I'm using a mac 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.050
 solely and exclusively for reasons of 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.790
 I work as you already know because 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.130
 in the video of last month I mentioned it 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.040
 I am straight so I do not 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.800
 would be right to use a mac but 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.710
 good so things went 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.060
 the first thing that happens as heterosexual 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:13.000
 user of a machine is the need 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.030
 imperious to explain to everyone 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.190
 that if you are using a machine but not 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.040
 for pleasure but for the demands of your 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.980
 work and you face andres the fear 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.380
 what people are going to say about you 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.530
 and this is true the people start to 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.330
 mutter things about you as he hears ya 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.470
 you knew that the criterion began to use 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.240
 a computer brand does little 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.730
 and I thought he did know 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.060
 computers and look what ended and 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.730
 so macho that the wey looked and things 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.800
 like that 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.110
 almost at the same time you enter a stage 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.230
 of denial in which you say ok 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.240
 it's fine I'm going to use a brand but it's 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.070
 only for work and I'm just going 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.360
 to use temporarily so far in 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.060
 the one who has enough money to 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.730
 I can get out of this and buy some 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.710
 pc with windows even if it's an hp not 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.470
 matter what is the only thing I want 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.200
 is to go through this pothole as fast 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.150
 possible in this process also come in 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.760
 your old friends trying to support you 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.150
 and they even give you options tell you hey 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.550
 well I know well what you are going to do to use a 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.650
 machine is anything they say there 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.780
 people who get that and they do not come back 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.250
 look at a relative of a friend one day 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.360
 bought a brand and ended up a bad 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.579
 educational for public accountant and they say 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.600
 that now uses Palestinians in the neck and 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:37.610
 is dedicated to doing graphic design 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.100
 They even give you alternatives as 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.960
 example buy a tablet pc or a 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.690
 netbook although they are going to stop 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:49.130
 exist or even crazy options 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.290
 like for example using ubuntu summer already 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.960
 I could not choose the false door of the 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.930
 free software not the decision that was 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.000
 taken had to use a brand what 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.180
 first I thought when starting the system 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.650
 of the mac was oh god there is not a bar 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.180
 to show you that the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.769
 system where I have fallen 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.780
 after you pass the first shock 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.000
 emotional in which you do not know if you're 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.260
 starting the team or you suffered a 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.909
 sudden death and you're about to 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.430
 enter the sky because everything was put 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.840
 white and you hear an angelic sound 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.349
 After that, he reached the desk of 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.989
 the brand there is nothing weird everything is the same 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.299
 that on the pc there is a desk with a 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.139
 desktop background there are a few 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:33.959
 perfect icons now I just have to go 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:37.410
 at the beginning and open my documents but oh 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.480
 surprise there is no start button 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.160
 how are you supposed to open the 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.850
 browser window to see the 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.240
 folders 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.790
 if there is no easy start button just 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.080
 you have to open the finder and there 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.480
 find all the files of the 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.390
 system opens with that button where 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.760
 there are two guys kissing and from there 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.780
 you can see everything inside the 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.760
 ok system 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.560
 there you realize that the main 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.350
 difference between the mac and the pc is that 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.360
 in the mac everything is in this bar 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.420
 buttons below which is always 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.250
 active never disappears it keeps 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.050
 surely consuming resources from 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.510
 system and the only highlight of that 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.280
 bar is that it has a nice effect of 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.980
 unnecessary animation every time you put 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.600
 the cursor over it appears since 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.610
 you enter the finger you realize that 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.250
 indeed from there you can see everything 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.740
 that is in the system literally everything 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.470
 the whole system is accessible from the 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.130
 damn finder 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.480
 what happens to them there is confirmed that the 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.860
 The macs system was designed by 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.110
 people with obsessive disorder 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.510
 compulsive they needed to have all 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.190
 your things at hand in the most 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.110
 immediate because 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.129
 in the machine is all together and available 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.110
 at the same time 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.999
 the equivalent of this real life 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.009
 would be a person whose house did not have 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:55.409
 neither shelves nor shelves nor furniture with 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.239
 drawers and all things had them 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.349
 settle on the floor ready to 

00:04:57.239 --> 00:05:00.550
 use them at any time with 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:02.890
 just stretch your hand 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.710
 I think and the maqueros or if I were 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.540
 you would look for help 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.120
 but honestly I must say that asthma 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.320
 they are not difficult to really use 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.480
 it's just a matter of changing some 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.950
 customs some hobbies that you had with 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.290
 the pc 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.540
 which itself must reclaim the 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.640
 gentlemen of the mch who designed their 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.890
 operating system are two things the 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.990
 first that when I do some 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.540
 movement in the computer almost never 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.280
 no window appears asking me 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.490
 If I really want to do what I finish 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.380
 of doing 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.509
 for example if I want to change the 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.740
 name to a file I change it there is no 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:38.500
 a window that asks me if I really 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.599
 I want to apply that change and give me the 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.930
 opportunity to repent or to 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:45.400
 correct any errors that I have 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.630
 committed after machine is in a 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.390
 second chance which 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:53.040
 says or makes it look like the macs were 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.600
 developed for women 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.390
 and the second thing that I have to 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.040
 claim the signs of cupertino is that 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.320
 its interface is precisely how 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.560
 women may be pretty but we 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.810
 confuse easily and do not take it 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.610
 to bad lord apple designers not 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.610
 I have nothing personal against you 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.940
 I respect the gay community a lot but 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.940
 please 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.910
 do not put the option to access the 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.310
 file information immediately 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.410
 before the option to delete file 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.750
 because that's going to save us a lot 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.000
 annoyances to mac users and they're going 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.050
 to save many insults to members 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.569
 of his family 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.599
 finally if I end up using a mac 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:37.000
 but for all those that I feel is 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:38.530
 laughing inside at this moment that 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.250
 I ended up succumbing to the 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.419
 manzanita I will tell you that the election with 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.479
 which I stay after having 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:50.440
 used wool for the first time is that 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:53.820
 Mac computers are very good 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.820
 to run windows 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.320
