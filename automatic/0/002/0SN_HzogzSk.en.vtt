kids<00:03:10.470> drawer<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.840> kind<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.900> like<00:03:13.080> that<00:03:13.260> idea

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
kids drawer I kind of like that idea

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.030 
kids drawer I kind of like that idea
I<00:03:14.490> like<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.180> idea<00:03:15.300> and<00:03:15.600> this<00:03:15.750> used<00:03:16.020> to<00:03:16.110> be<00:03:16.320> out

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
I like that idea and this used to be out

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.640 
I like that idea and this used to be out
this<00:03:18.000> actually<00:03:18.570> sock<00:03:18.840> system<00:03:19.200> used<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:19.410> be<00:03:19.500> out

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
this actually sock system used to be out

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.960 
this actually sock system used to be out
in<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:19.890> garage<00:03:19.950> where<00:03:20.220> all<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.430> shoes<00:03:20.700> were

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
in the garage where all the shoes were

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.240 
in the garage where all the shoes were
so<00:03:21.330> it<00:03:22.050> makes<00:03:22.320> sense<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.709> have<00:03:22.800> your<00:03:22.980> socks

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
so it makes sense to have your socks

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.630 
so it makes sense to have your socks
right<00:03:23.520> where<00:03:23.700> your<00:03:23.880> shoes<00:03:24.120> are<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:25.310> so<00:03:26.310> you

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
right where your shoes are and so you

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.150 
right where your shoes are and so you
wouldn't<00:03:27.480> even<00:03:27.630> need<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.930> dedicated<00:03:28.440> software

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
wouldn't even need a dedicated software

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.300 
wouldn't even need a dedicated software
in<00:03:29.580> your<00:03:30.480> actual<00:03:30.810> dresser<00:03:31.290> so<00:03:32.070> there's<00:03:32.250> a

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
in your actual dresser so there's a

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.790 
in your actual dresser so there's a
thought<00:03:32.940> there's<00:03:33.390> an<00:03:33.540> idea<00:03:33.959> for<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.350> human<00:03:34.680> if

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
thought there's an idea for a human if

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.080 
thought there's an idea for a human if
you<00:03:35.480> like<00:03:36.480> that<00:03:36.720> idea<00:03:37.400> -<00:03:38.400> just<00:03:38.430> do<00:03:38.700> everybody

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090
