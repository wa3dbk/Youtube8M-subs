00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
like a rubber based silicone but the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.210 
like a rubber based silicone but the
back<00:01:17.119> this<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> actual<00:01:18.830> plastic<00:01:19.830> II

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.490 
back this is the actual plastic II
material<00:01:20.759> as<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.509> see<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> slight

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
material as you can see it is a slight

color<00:01:22.890> difference<00:01:23.009> between<00:01:23.840> this<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.080> this

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
color difference between this in this

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.020 
color difference between this in this
area<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.189> okay<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.490> can<00:01:26.610> get<00:01:26.790> used<00:01:26.909> to

area but it's okay I can get used to
that<00:01:28.220> large<00:01:29.220> opening<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.970> camera<00:01:30.619> let's

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
that large opening for the camera let's

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.300 
that large opening for the camera let's
go<00:01:31.770> ahead<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.100> install<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.630> really<00:01:33.630> easy<00:01:33.840> you

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
basically put your iPhone right there

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.710 
basically put your iPhone right there
and<00:01:38.659> at<00:01:39.659> an<00:01:39.840> angle<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.530> slides<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.729> then

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
and at an angle it just slides in then

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.950 
and at an angle it just slides in then
with<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> slight<00:01:43.170> touch

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.510 

you<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:46.920> wrap<00:01:47.159> around<00:01:47.190> the<00:01:47.610> edges<00:01:48.000> and

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
you just wrap around the edges and

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.570 
you just wrap around the edges and
that's<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.729> once<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.360> done<00:01:52.580> there's

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
that's it once you have it done there's

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.980 
that's it once you have it done there's
really<00:01:53.700> nothing<00:01:54.119> else<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.450> click<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:54.960> you

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
really nothing else that click so you

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.450 
really nothing else that click so you
pretty<00:01:55.320> much<00:01:55.409> know<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.800> have<00:01:56.010> it<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.250> right

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
pretty much know you have it in right

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.700 
pretty much know you have it in right
and<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:57.210> feels<00:01:57.360> really<00:01:57.630> solid<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.229> your<00:01:58.260> hands

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
and it feels really solid in your hands

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.070 
and it feels really solid in your hands
I<00:01:58.830> mean<00:01:59.180> it<00:02:00.180> feels<00:02:00.509> like<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:00.810> way<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.049> should

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
I mean it feels like the way it should

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.399 
I mean it feels like the way it should
feel<00:02:01.500> because<00:02:02.420> this<00:02:03.420> thickness<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.170> not

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
feel because this thickness is not

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.170 
feel because this thickness is not
really<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.740> thick<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.280> mean<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.580> did<00:02:05.820> compare

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
really that thick I mean I did compare

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.719 
really that thick I mean I did compare
this<00:02:06.300> to<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.509> XO<00:02:06.899> gear<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.320> XO<00:02:07.680> gear<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:07.979> 1500

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
this to the XO gear the XO gear is 1500

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.630 
this to the XO gear the XO gear is 1500
milliamps<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.840> one<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.080> 1200<00:02:10.770> not<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> big

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
milliamps this one is 1200 not a big

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.840 
milliamps this one is 1200 not a big
deal<00:02:11.880> not<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.360> big<00:02:12.569> difference<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:14.340> again<00:02:14.819> I

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
deal not a big difference and again I

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.809 
deal not a big difference and again I
love<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.390> feel<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.660> this<00:02:15.930> it's<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.670> mean<00:02:17.670> it

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
love the feel of this it's I mean it

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.759 
love the feel of this it's I mean it
looks<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.720> slides<00:02:18.989> in<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.170> out<00:02:19.320> of<00:02:19.470> your<00:02:19.530> jeans

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
looks it slides in and out of your jeans

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.500 
looks it slides in and out of your jeans
really<00:02:20.190> easily<00:02:20.430> because<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.940> didn't<00:02:21.300> want<00:02:21.450> to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
really easily because I didn't want to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.690 
really easily because I didn't want to
get<00:02:21.600> something<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.830> gonna<00:02:23.010> be<00:02:23.070> hard<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.550> do

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
get something it is gonna be hard to do

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.740 
get something it is gonna be hard to do
that<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.709> basically<00:02:25.709> what<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.340> do<00:02:26.489> is<00:02:26.750> it's

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
that so basically what you do is it's

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.759 
that so basically what you do is it's
got<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.959> little<00:02:28.140> on<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:29.250> corner<00:02:30.410> it's<00:02:31.410> got<00:02:31.590> the

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
got a little on the corner it's got the

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.180 
got a little on the corner it's got the
slot<00:02:32.010> for<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:33.330> put<00:02:33.630> in<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.980> mini<00:02:34.980> USB

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
slot for this so you put in the mini USB

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.580 
slot for this so you put in the mini USB
cable<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.030> then<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.080> pretty<00:02:37.320> much<00:02:37.440> just

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
cable and then you pretty much just

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.040 
cable and then you pretty much just
connect<00:02:38.280> your<00:02:38.370> USB<00:02:38.730> into<00:02:39.330> your<00:02:39.480> laptop

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
connect your USB into your laptop

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.009 
connect your USB into your laptop
whatever<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:41.330> first<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.420> was<00:02:42.540> wondering<00:02:42.660> like

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
whatever and first I was wondering like

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.870 
whatever and first I was wondering like
is<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:43.410> gonna<00:02:43.560> be<00:02:43.650> able<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.040> still<00:02:44.310> sync<00:02:44.730> with

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
is this gonna be able to still sync with

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.170 
is this gonna be able to still sync with
iTunes<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.600> does<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.709> can<00:02:46.980> um<00:02:47.180> it's

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
iTunes and it does so you can um it's

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.820 
iTunes and it does so you can um it's
pretty<00:02:48.390> cool<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:48.690> now<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:48.840> can<00:02:49.050> use<00:02:49.080> my<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.410> tuned

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
pretty cool so now I can use my I tuned

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.390 
pretty cool so now I can use my I tuned
my<00:02:50.459> Apple<00:02:50.930> USB<00:02:51.930> with<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.560> use<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.040> in<00:02:53.310> my

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
my Apple USB with it and use it in my

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.270 
my Apple USB with it and use it in my
car<00:02:53.640> for<00:02:53.820> example<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:55.019> hot<00:02:55.620> sinks<00:02:56.100> and

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
car for example so it hot sinks and

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.590 
car for example so it hot sinks and
charges<00:02:57.090> all<00:02:57.540> at<00:02:58.079> once<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:59.910> gives<00:03:00.299> you<00:03:00.450> up<00:03:00.480> to

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
charges all at once it gives you up to

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.949 
charges all at once it gives you up to
five<00:03:00.930> hours<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.590> additional<00:03:01.829> talk<00:03:02.310> time<00:03:02.610> and

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
five hours of additional talk time and

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.420 
five hours of additional talk time and
does<00:03:03.959> have<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.290> other<00:03:04.440> specifications<00:03:05.250> on

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
does have the other specifications on

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.340 
does have the other specifications on
their<00:03:05.579> website<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.360> basically<00:03:07.140> you're

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
their website so basically you're

are the battery indicators so you got a

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.880 
are the battery indicators so you got a
total<00:04:35.010> of<00:04:35.130> four<00:04:35.700> so<00:04:35.730> I'm<00:04:36.120> fully<00:04:36.390> charged<00:04:36.840> and<00:04:37.110> I

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
like that because it's hidden you can't

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.659 
like that because it's hidden you can't
even<00:04:39.330> see<00:04:39.570> the<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:40.800> circles<00:04:41.220> for<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.430> lights

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
even see the the circles for the lights

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.030 
even see the the circles for the lights
on<00:04:41.880> unless<00:04:42.150> you<00:04:42.180> actually<00:04:42.450> push<00:04:42.780> it<00:04:42.930> down<00:04:43.110> so

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
on unless you actually push it down so

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.810 
on unless you actually push it down so
that's<00:04:44.160> pretty<00:04:44.400> cool

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
that's pretty cool

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.490 
that's pretty cool
and<00:04:45.120> again<00:04:45.330> it<00:04:45.480> really<00:04:45.570> feels<00:04:46.110> great<00:04:46.380> in<00:04:46.470> your

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500

and again it really feels great in your
hands<00:04:46.919> good<00:04:47.669> case<00:04:48.050> 79<00:04:49.050> bucks

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.150 
I recommend that it's got a three year
warranty<00:04:51.150> so<00:04:51.840> you<00:04:52.620> can't<00:04:52.980> beat<00:04:53.130> that

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
warranty so you can't beat that

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.920 
warranty so you can't beat that
energizer<00:04:53.820> with<00:04:54.210> their<00:04:54.330> three<00:04:54.540> year<00:04:54.750> warranty

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
energizer with their three year warranty

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.200 
energizer with their three year warranty
is<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.440> best<00:04:55.650> and<00:04:55.950> I've<00:04:56.640> been<00:04:56.760> told<00:04:56.910> you<00:04:57.060> can

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
is the best and I've been told you can

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.140 
is the best and I've been told you can
charge<00:04:57.510> it<00:04:57.660> up<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:58.050> five<00:04:58.260> hundred<00:04:58.620> times<00:04:59.150> so

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
charge it up to five hundred times so

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.220 
charge it up to five hundred times so
