00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.070 

so<00:02:33.040> what<00:02:33.220> is<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.430> difference<00:02:33.640> between

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
so what is the difference between

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.710 
so what is the difference between
concave<00:02:35.080> 4k<00:02:36.060> LG<00:02:37.060> 4k<00:02:37.440> same<00:02:38.730> same<00:02:39.730> said<00:02:40.209> really

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
concave 4k LG 4k same same said really

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.680 
concave 4k LG 4k same same said really
because<00:02:41.380> we<00:02:41.560> use<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:41.950> pedal<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.610> LG<00:02:43.420> and

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
because we use the pedal the LG and

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.550 
because we use the pedal the LG and
Samsung<00:02:44.319> panel<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:45.670> use<00:02:45.850> L<00:02:46.030> tell<00:02:46.300> panel<00:02:47.230> is

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
Samsung panel you use L tell panel is

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.730 
Samsung panel you use L tell panel is
this<00:02:47.800> LG<00:02:48.250> Chem<00:02:48.430> yeah

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
this LG Chem yeah

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.540 
this LG Chem yeah
it's<00:02:50.740> not<00:02:50.950> it's<00:02:51.670> not<00:02:51.850> Chinese<00:02:53.370> but<00:02:54.370> there's

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
it's not it's not Chinese but there's

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.090 
it's not it's not Chinese but there's
also<00:02:54.730> Chinese<00:02:55.180> panel<00:02:55.510> maker<00:02:55.800> aerospace<00:02:56.800> you

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
also Chinese panel maker aerospace you

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.570 
also Chinese panel maker aerospace you
don't<00:02:57.220> know<00:02:57.340> will<00:02:57.490> use<00:02:57.640> IO<00:02:58.060> Gianna's<00:02:58.540> also<00:02:58.840> man

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
don't know will use IO Gianna's also man

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.860 
don't know will use IO Gianna's also man
so<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.700> quality<00:03:00.940> is<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.330> same

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
so the quality is the same

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.710 
so the quality is the same
the<00:03:02.770> panel<00:03:03.160> is<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.430> same<00:03:03.819> what<00:03:04.300> else<00:03:04.540> is
