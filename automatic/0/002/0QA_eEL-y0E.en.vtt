I don't know else they can expect when
you<00:01:38.770> punch<00:01:39.039> someone<00:01:39.190> 20<00:01:39.700> times<00:01:39.909> a<00:01:40.090> minute<00:01:40.240> I

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
you punch someone 20 times a minute I

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.969 
you punch someone 20 times a minute I
think<00:01:41.110> that's<00:01:41.259> probably<00:01:41.380> about<00:01:41.619> the<00:01:41.710> highest

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
think that's probably about the highest

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.340 
think that's probably about the highest
amount<00:01:42.369> of<00:01:42.429> strikes<00:01:42.700> anyone<00:01:43.119> in<00:01:43.450> MMA<00:01:43.960> lands

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
amount of strikes anyone in MMA lands

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.190 
amount of strikes anyone in MMA lands
especially<00:01:45.159> with<00:01:45.640> this<00:01:46.240> stuff<00:01:46.659> it<00:01:46.810> seems<00:01:47.020> like

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
especially with this stuff it seems like

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.260 
especially with this stuff it seems like
a<00:01:47.440> lot<00:01:47.679> of<00:01:47.710> people<00:01:47.890> keep<00:01:48.159> on<00:01:48.280> crap<00:01:48.550> understand

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
a lot of people keep on crap understand

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.180 
a lot of people keep on crap understand

I think it'd be a little more difficult

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.540 
I think it'd be a little more difficult
but<00:03:02.760> something<00:03:03.120> like<00:03:03.240> that

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.230

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
me and you know I think I'm doing things

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.390 
me and you know I think I'm doing things
in<00:03:52.480> mixed<00:03:52.690> martial<00:03:52.810> arts<00:03:53.140> that<00:03:53.410> no<00:03:53.890> wrestlers

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
in mixed martial arts that no wrestlers

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.910 
in mixed martial arts that no wrestlers
done<00:03:54.670> mixing<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.690> grappling<00:03:56.410> with<00:03:56.500> the

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
done mixing the grappling with the

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.510
