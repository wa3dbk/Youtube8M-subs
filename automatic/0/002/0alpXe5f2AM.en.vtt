00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.240
 I bring it and well, this one is blue and 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.599
 black I hope you like it I wanted 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.599
 see him 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.670
 The materials that we will need are 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.739
 some tongs to cut some 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.250
 small pliers a pair of scissors 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:42.730
 marker one carabiner two rings 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.810
 little things that are put at the end to put 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.930
 The glue rings epilating forceps 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:54.280
 a tape measure 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.120
 zeal office or for wool cloth rag and 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.039
 wire 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.150
 all this you can find in bazaars 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.310
 chinese 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:06.890
 and less than one euro 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.890
 Well, I take the wool of tights 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.450
 and I'm going to measure up or it's going to cut 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.340
 up to 68 centimeters because then that 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:21.170
 makes us to braid will shrink 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.170
 and we are going to cut three pieces 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.370
 I have one that has been cut and I'm going to 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.390
 take the same measure to cut the 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.390
 another and the other 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.280
 I hope there are not many criticisms in 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.720
 this video because on the previous day 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.720
 there was still a lot 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.320
 and well, here we are going to make a knot 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.320
 at the end then at the beginning 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.049
 the most pegadito possible more or less and 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.429
 we are pulling the bottom part is worth 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.039
 if we stretch from the top what 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.599
 it's going to happen that the thread will go up 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.920
 was going to be one shorter another one 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.160
 long then to throw the one down 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.959
 ok and good then now we take the is 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.120
 back to voice the office we paste it 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.440
 on a surface because we are going to braid 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.440
 and so that we do not go forward 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:34.130
 and nothing will we braid normal as 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.410
 as if we were making a braid 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.870
 of our hair as well and this time 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.930
 Well, we are not going to press 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.210
 we will not lose because if there would not be 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.480
 very fine or very small braid 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:52.460
 and then for my taste it would be better 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.650
 well and then by 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.770
 It is not braiding and braiding until you reach 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.770
 final 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.640
 now here at the end of the whole when 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.190
 we have finished making the braid 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.190
 let's make a knot 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.300
 and now we are going to go looking for it so that 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.760
 as a base plus volume 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.150
 seemed a little more to the same but 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.159
 we make our hair then there 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.450
 now we take the wire with what 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:53.560
 you want 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.810
 in the hood of the marker we are giving 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.190
 turns to do 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.920
 round wire 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.520
 I told Fado to take a bit 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.040
 cardboard and the shades there 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.870
 you leave it as rectangular I here what 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.870
 I'm going to do that 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.630
 I have chosen wire has been a 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.930
 and a half 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:51.040
 because of two was a fat one and one was 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.580
 very thin so it's one and a half 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:58.990
 and nothing like you see, I've already done it and 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:02.070
 now I take those curling tongs and 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.070
 we cut the wire 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.020
 now we take zeal fixos backwards by 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:15.169
 what you have and at the tip as you see 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.610
 how is a month of struggle or do we put it 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.610
 and we put out there him 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:28.030
 we take a piece of hair 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.930
 and we are taking out is getting ls and 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.180
 taking out the thread 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.150
 be very careful that you do not 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.480
 hitch 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:40.590
 the wire in the thread because if not 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.590
 It bothers the necklace 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.950
 and nothing now here you point 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.510
 we're going to put it up as a fan and 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.510
 You have to be very careful not 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.180
 if not then you would see a very loose thread 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.630
 Well now I take the scissors and 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.280
 let's cut for what's left over 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.280
 I've had a bit more 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:28.920
 Now we take a lighter, we burn the 

00:06:25.549 --> 00:06:30.780
 dangers that we have left those that leave 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.820
 and we are squeezing with the yolk of 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.820
 fingers with care not to burn 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:44.540
 now we take the glue and go to 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:47.180
 make glue for everything for all that 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.729
 we take the circle that I have 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.559
 taught at the beginning 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:53.409
 has a little hole to put the 

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:55.599
 washer 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:58.509
 and now with the hair clip it helped me 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:07:00.669
 to put the threads inside that thing 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:03.059
 because the threads are wider than the 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:03.059
 little hole 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.280
 and nothing if it would be the same 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.139
 do with the other side now we take the 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.600
 We put the ring through the little hole that 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:15.530
 I said 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:18.650
 and we close in the other one in the other site 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:20.950
 I'll show you a ring and an object like 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.950
 a closure 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.340
 well well being in a close 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:39.860
 and nothing now with the wire we're going to 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.870
 bend a little helping us from the 

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:45.530
 points up from the middle not 

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:48.620
 because if it would not open and nothing girls 

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:51.000
 Well that's how it would look like 

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:54.620
 finished 

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.620
 and nothing I hope you liked 

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:59.620
 the green I loved it is beautiful 

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.540
 they love 

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.310
 nothing can be blue is what I've done 

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.419
 what crooked no procedure and nothing 

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.320
 I think you liked it, we'll see you 

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:07.320
 next video chao
