00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
really boils down to the place that we

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.309 
really boils down to the place that we
have<00:02:50.700> in<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.819> locker<00:02:51.000> room<00:02:51.090> um<00:02:51.629> the<00:02:51.989> coaches

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
and this and that but um this this is a

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.399

have to keep it in irons it might be

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.220 
have to keep it in irons it might be
hard<00:04:00.030> but<00:04:00.180> it's<00:04:00.329> important<00:04:00.690> not<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:00.900> i<00:04:01.079> think

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
hard but it's important not to i think

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.410 
hard but it's important not to i think
uh

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
uh

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.030 
uh
you<00:04:03.050> know<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.290> only<00:04:03.380> thing<00:04:03.500> we<00:04:03.770> can<00:04:03.890> control

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
you know the only thing we can control

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.360 
you know the only thing we can control
is<00:04:04.840> Michigan<00:04:05.840> and<00:04:06.020> our<00:04:06.590> preparation<00:04:07.190> for<00:04:07.340> that

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
is Michigan and our preparation for that

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.309 
is Michigan and our preparation for that
and<00:04:08.060> I<00:04:08.120> think<00:04:08.270> once<00:04:08.420> you<00:04:08.540> start<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:09.200> look

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
and I think once you start to look

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.940 
and I think once you start to look
beyond<00:04:09.650> that<00:04:09.800> it's<00:04:09.950> just<00:04:10.069> a<00:04:10.220> trap<00:04:10.520> and<00:04:11.950> that

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
beyond that it's just a trap and that

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.740 
beyond that it's just a trap and that
leads<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.340> bad<00:04:13.520> things<00:04:13.580> I<00:04:13.970> think<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.209> focus<00:04:14.450> is

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
leads to bad things I think the focus is

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.840 
leads to bad things I think the focus is
what<00:04:15.080> needs<00:04:15.260> to<00:04:15.410> stay<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.709> same<00:04:15.890> you<00:04:16.730> know

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
what needs to stay the same you know

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.400 
what needs to stay the same you know
outside<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.419> locker<00:04:17.630> room<00:04:17.840> there's<00:04:18.049> there's

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
outside the locker room there's there's

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.900 
outside the locker room there's there's
gonna<00:04:18.530> be<00:04:18.709> a<00:04:18.739> lot<00:04:18.889> of<00:04:18.950> hype<00:04:19.459> a<00:04:19.639> lot<00:04:19.820> of

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
gonna be a lot of hype a lot of

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.759 
gonna be a lot of hype a lot of
