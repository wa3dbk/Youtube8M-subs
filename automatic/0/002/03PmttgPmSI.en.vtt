00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.249 
some new stuff today like our warm up in
that<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.880> thought<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:30.689> got<00:01:30.780> off<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.140> little

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
that and thought we got off to a little

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.810 
that and thought we got off to a little
bit<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.619> slow<00:01:31.860> start<00:01:32.250> because<00:01:32.490> these<00:01:32.610> guys

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
bit of a slow start because these guys

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.630 
bit of a slow start because these guys
have<00:01:33.060> practiced<00:01:33.509> their<00:01:33.659> tail<00:01:33.900> off<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.380> mean<00:01:34.560> for

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
have practiced their tail off I mean for

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.740 
have practiced their tail off I mean for
three<00:01:35.640> weeks<00:01:35.850> we'd<00:01:36.060> probably<00:01:36.240> practice<00:01:36.659> as

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
three weeks we'd probably practice as

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.980 
three weeks we'd probably practice as
good<00:01:36.930> as<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.110> ever<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.990> these

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
good as we ever have and and this these

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.749 
good as we ever have and and this these
games<00:01:40.259> are<00:01:40.530> coming<00:01:40.650> faster<00:01:41.250> than<00:01:41.400> they<00:01:41.670> ever

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
games are coming faster than they ever

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.429 
games are coming faster than they ever
have<00:01:42.060> yeah<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.540> think<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.899> lot<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.049> questions

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
have yeah I think a lot of questions

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.020 
have yeah I think a lot of questions
that<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:43.619> answered<00:01:43.920> as<00:01:44.040> far<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:45.210> know

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
that we answered as far as you know

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.140 
that we answered as far as you know
it<00:01:46.390> wasn't<00:01:46.659> replying<00:01:46.990> certain<00:01:47.320> positions<00:01:47.830> who

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
it wasn't replying certain positions who

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.789 
it wasn't replying certain positions who
who's<00:01:49.150> gonna<00:01:49.270> be<00:01:49.420> doing<00:01:49.630> what<00:01:49.810> so<00:01:49.840> it<00:01:50.380> is

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
who's gonna be doing what so it is

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.500 
who's gonna be doing what so it is
because<00:01:51.220> these<00:01:51.400> first<00:01:51.640> two<00:01:51.790> games<00:01:51.970> be<00:01:52.270> great

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
because these first two games be great

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.000 
because these first two games be great
for<00:01:52.720> us<00:01:52.750> to<00:01:52.930> you<00:01:52.990> know<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.140> kind<00:01:53.470> of<00:01:53.590> get<00:01:53.710> a<00:01:53.770> feel

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
for us to you know to kind of get a feel

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.010 
for us to you know to kind of get a feel
for<00:01:54.250> how<00:01:54.340> we're<00:01:54.520> gonna<00:01:54.610> you<00:01:55.360> know<00:01:55.479> we<00:01:55.600> know

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
for how we're gonna you know we know

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.090 
for how we're gonna you know we know
we're<00:01:56.140> gonna<00:01:56.290> play<00:01:56.440> hard<00:01:56.680> we<00:01:56.830> know<00:01:56.950> we're

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
we're gonna play hard we know we're

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.289 
we're gonna play hard we know we're
going<00:01:57.220> to<00:01:57.280> play<00:01:57.400> the<00:01:57.520> energy<00:01:57.850> we<00:01:58.090> know<00:01:58.180> we're

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
going to play the energy we know we're

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.969 
going to play the energy we know we're
going<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.509> run<00:01:58.659> but<00:01:59.530> just<00:01:59.560> those<00:01:59.920> little

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
going to run but just those little

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.440 
going to run but just those little
things<00:02:00.159> we<00:02:00.490> still<00:02:00.610> got<00:02:00.820> to<00:02:00.909> figure<00:02:01.030> out<00:02:01.270> you

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
things we still got to figure out you

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.550 
things we still got to figure out you
know<00:02:01.479> I<00:02:01.600> think<00:02:01.720> that<00:02:01.900> we<00:02:02.020> figured<00:02:02.350> out<00:02:02.440> in

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
know I think that we figured out in

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.350 
know I think that we figured out in
special<00:02:02.890> girls<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.490> key<00:02:03.640> energy<00:02:03.909> is<00:02:04.180> key

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
special girls the key energy is key

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.880 
special girls the key energy is key
tomorrow<00:02:04.659> for<00:02:04.899> tomorrow's<00:02:05.229> game<00:02:05.290> because

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
tomorrow for tomorrow's game because

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.200 
tomorrow for tomorrow's game because
you're<00:02:06.100> not<00:02:06.190> like<00:02:06.369> you<00:02:06.460> co<00:02:06.640> said<00:02:06.850> we<00:02:07.149> were

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
you're not like you co said we were

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.150 
you're not like you co said we were
practicing<00:02:07.570> hard<00:02:07.869> and<00:02:08.560> he<00:02:08.679> just<00:02:08.860> won't<00:02:09.009> got

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
practicing hard and he just won't got

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.080 
practicing hard and he just won't got
you<00:02:09.340> know<00:02:09.429> just<00:02:09.550> go<00:02:09.670> out<00:02:09.759> there<00:02:09.880> with<00:02:10.000> an

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
you know just go out there with an

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.670 
you know just go out there with an
energy<00:02:10.270> and<00:02:10.600> you<00:02:10.989> know<00:02:11.080> as<00:02:11.170> far<00:02:11.350> as<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.560> know

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
energy and you know as far as you know

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.650 
energy and you know as far as you know
for<00:02:11.830> myself<00:02:11.950> you<00:02:12.370> know<00:02:12.400> basically<00:02:13.300> don't<00:02:13.510> just

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
for myself you know basically don't just

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.910 
for myself you know basically don't just
stand<00:02:13.810> on<00:02:13.959> me<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.260> get<00:02:14.410> in<00:02:14.530> shape<00:02:14.709> no

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
us up by by energy level you know cuz

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.460 
us up by by energy level you know cuz
you<00:02:26.380> got<00:02:26.500> enough<00:02:26.680> good<00:02:26.890> players<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.600> so<00:02:28.600> I'm

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
gonna see if I could sell my energy

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.210 
gonna see if I could sell my energy
level<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:32.110> guys<00:02:32.350> are<00:02:32.380> coming<00:02:32.830> out<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:32.980> going

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
level so guys are coming out and going

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
it's gonna be on some energy level it

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.460 
it's gonna be on some energy level it
and<00:02:39.610> it's<00:02:39.940> hard<00:02:40.150> when<00:02:40.360> you<00:02:40.510> try<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.170> pace

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
and it's hard when you try to pace

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.080 
and it's hard when you try to pace
yourself<00:02:41.500> for<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.160> while<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.580> now<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.790> gotta

yourself for a while and now you gotta
turn<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:44.080> on<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.410> whole<00:02:44.560> time<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.190> I'm<00:02:45.220> anxious

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
turn it on the whole time so I'm anxious

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.400 
turn it on the whole time so I'm anxious
to<00:02:46.030> get<00:02:46.209> that<00:02:46.420> out<00:02:46.569> of<00:02:46.600> his<00:02:46.780> much

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
to get that out of his much

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.440 
to get that out of his much
Oh
