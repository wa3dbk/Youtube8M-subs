00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 since the dog is one or two 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.109
 blocks away or even from that 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.630
 they put their leash on him before leaving his 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.639
 enthusiasm grows because he knows that they take it 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.830
 to a place where they treat it like at home 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.020
 this is one of the comments that the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.240
 Laura Maldonado market and Fernando 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.310
 auto federico frequently listen to 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.039
 part of its farc clients dominate 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.260
 a nursery and hotel for dogs located 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.390
 in Colonia Cuauhtémoc for almost 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.279
 two years the house of the couple their car 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.109
 market is also home to several 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.600
 pets when their owners leave 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.270
 vacations or to work regardless of your 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.030
 size or race the main objective is 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.340
 the puppy will come have fun 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.440
 stay on vacation , not that 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.110
 do not stay locked we handle 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.690
 cages that enjoy that enjoy that 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.020
 socialize and then that he returns to his 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.420
 house not in park long island in effect not 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.160
 there are cages but games and areas 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.780
 specifically designed so that 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.300
 dogs spend their energies and live 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.039
 with other animals the idea came up later 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.840
 that the aura and fernando were 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.640
 mind that they had no other place in 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.979
 where they could feel the confidence 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.200
 to their three children as they call with 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.540
 fond of pets so its 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.330
 intention is to make the dog feel 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.909
 at ease after x is somehow 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.500
 the dynamics are taught everything that 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.030
 You have to do it not right now, we do not have 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.340
 the pool in the summer gets the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.960
 pool we teach them to swim then 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.880
 they do many activities here so that 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.890
 they forget they are not with the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.990
 owner and they do not even remember and when 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.700
 they come because they are tired no longer 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.619
 destroy in their homes because you do 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.479
 so much to the energy here and even for 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.460
 the nights the guests sleep in the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.170
 master bedroom of the house with the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.490
 tranquility that gives them to do it is 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.440
 an evaluation upon entering 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.229
 make sure your temperament is the 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.399
 suitable for business owners 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.320
 part of the needs that should be 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.690
 cover in a pet in addition to what 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.130
 physical is the psychological what it includes 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.869
 the coexistence with the animal so that 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.759
 have a balanced life and do not be 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.670
 abandoned with time by his family 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.770
