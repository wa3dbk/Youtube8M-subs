00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
do it in stages so half of it so Navy do

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.819 
do it in stages so half of it so Navy do
15<00:00:54.480> first<00:00:54.960> time<00:00:55.140> around<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.500> come<00:00:55.649> back<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
15 first time around and come back and

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.700 
15 first time around and come back and
then<00:00:56.039> do<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> 25<00:00:56.989> these<00:00:57.989> things<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.469> any<00:00:58.590> of

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
then do the 25 these things if any of

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.380 
then do the 25 these things if any of
these<00:00:58.800> got<00:00:59.010> chewed<00:00:59.250> up<00:00:59.430> as<00:00:59.699> some<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.000> mine<00:01:00.210> did

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
these got chewed up as some of mine did

buy new ones don't take a chance they

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.520 
buy new ones don't take a chance they
are<00:01:03.270> kind<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.480> an<00:01:03.570> expensive<00:01:03.960> nut<00:01:04.290> when<00:01:04.470> you

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
are kind of an expensive nut when you

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.810 
are kind of an expensive nut when you
think<00:01:04.680> about<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:04.949> think<00:01:05.040> they're<00:01:05.220> about<00:01:05.280> $3

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
think about it I think they're about $3

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.890 
think about it I think they're about $3
per<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.330> had<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.409> buy<00:01:07.530> five<00:01:07.799> new<00:01:08.040> ones<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.900> because

per I had to buy five new ones I because
they<00:01:10.170> were<00:01:10.260> starting<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.560> round<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.130> if<00:01:11.310> you

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
they were starting to round so if you

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.710

it<00:01:41.340> was<00:01:41.430> kind<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.670> tricky<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.210> don't<00:01:42.540> know<00:01:42.600> why

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
it was kind of tricky I don't know why

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.300 
it was kind of tricky I don't know why
I'm<00:01:42.990> video<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:43.740> there's<00:01:43.860> not<00:01:43.950> much<00:01:44.130> to

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
I'm video of it but there's not much to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.359 
I'm video of it but there's not much to
see<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.759> we<00:01:45.360> rolled<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.659> chain<00:01:45.869> up<00:01:46.189> slide<00:01:47.189> in

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
see so we rolled the chain up slide in

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.999 
see so we rolled the chain up slide in
the<00:01:47.520> exhaust<00:01:47.820> cam<00:01:48.090> first<00:01:48.439> get<00:01:49.439> us<00:01:49.560> at<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.979> I

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
the exhaust cam first get us at and I

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.710 
the exhaust cam first get us at and I
mean<00:01:50.159> slide<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.729> intake<00:01:50.939> cam<00:01:51.149> first<00:01:51.479> and

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
mean slide on the intake cam first and

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.429 
mean slide on the intake cam first and
do<00:01:51.869> your<00:01:51.960> best<00:01:52.079> try<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.470> get<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.649> aligned<00:01:54.439> you

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
do your best try and get it aligned you

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.350 
do your best try and get it aligned you
can<00:01:55.799> cheat<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.159> slightly<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.939> can<00:01:57.119> get

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
can cheat it slightly and you can get

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.420 
can cheat it slightly and you can get
the<00:01:57.570> exhaust<00:01:57.840> set<00:01:58.439> up<00:01:58.530> as<00:01:58.649> best<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.979> can<00:01:59.189> keep

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
the exhaust set up as best you can keep

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.069 
the exhaust set up as best you can keep
tension<00:01:59.670> on<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.939> chain<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.479> then<00:02:00.689> trying<00:02:00.960> to

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
tension on the chain and then trying to

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.539 
tension on the chain and then trying to
fiddle<00:02:01.200> with<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.439> while<00:02:02.130> trying<00:02:02.310> to

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
fiddle with that while trying to

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.010 
fiddle with that while trying to
maintain<00:02:02.700> your<00:02:03.210> alignment<00:02:03.659> down<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:03.960> the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
maintain your alignment down on the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.460 
maintain your alignment down on the
lower

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
lower

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.240 
lower
anymore<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:06.710> took<00:02:08.570> five<00:02:09.570> tries<00:02:09.899> five<00:02:10.890> attempts

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
anymore I took five tries five attempts

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.010 
anymore I took five tries five attempts
to<00:02:11.280> figure<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:11.700> out<00:02:11.850> make<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.540> work<00:02:12.690> for<00:02:12.870> me

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
to figure this out make it work for me

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.320 
to figure this out make it work for me
and<00:02:13.950> ultimately<00:02:14.190> though<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.700> got<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.240> then

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
and ultimately though I got it and then

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.670 
and ultimately though I got it and then
after<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:15.690> get<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.960> set<00:02:16.110> up<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.380> want<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.560> turn

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
after you get it set up you want to turn

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.490 
after you get it set up you want to turn
the<00:02:16.860> crank<00:02:16.980> over<00:02:17.400> several<00:02:18.180> times<00:02:18.380> make<00:02:19.380> sure

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
the crank over several times make sure

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.040 
the crank over several times make sure
nothing<00:02:19.770> hits<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.280> then<00:02:21.120> check<00:02:21.630> your<00:02:21.660> line<00:02:21.900> of

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
nothing hits and then check your line of

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.260 
nothing hits and then check your line of
March<00:02:22.200> again<00:02:22.320> make<00:02:22.560> sure<00:02:22.590> they're<00:02:22.800> still<00:02:22.950> true
