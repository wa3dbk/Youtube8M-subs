Urban<00:02:54.070> Meyer<00:02:54.100> Justin<00:02:54.610> his<00:02:54.760> self<00:02:55.090> he<00:02:55.270> has<00:02:55.420> a

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
Urban Meyer Justin his self he has a

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.810 
Urban Meyer Justin his self he has a
great<00:02:55.750> background<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.830> everywhere<00:02:57.640> he's

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
great background and everywhere he's

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.060 
great background and everywhere he's
been<00:02:57.850> he's<00:02:58.390> went<00:02:58.750> in<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.050> he<00:02:59.590> did<00:02:59.740> a<00:02:59.770> great<00:02:59.980> job

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
been he's went in and he did a great job

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.440 
been he's went in and he did a great job
at<00:03:00.400> Florida<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:00.790> think<00:03:01.000> he's<00:03:01.120> going<00:03:01.270> to<00:03:01.330> do<00:03:01.420> a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
at Florida I think he's going to do a

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.720 
at Florida I think he's going to do a
great<00:03:01.540> job<00:03:01.780> at<00:03:02.260> Ohio<00:03:02.500> State<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.370> then<00:03:03.520> went

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
great job at Ohio State and then went

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.160 
great job at Ohio State and then went
undefeated<00:03:04.000> last<00:03:04.390> year<00:03:04.690> probably<00:03:04.870> would<00:03:05.080> have

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
undefeated last year probably would have

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.990 
undefeated last year probably would have
been<00:03:05.260> number<00:03:05.980> one<00:03:06.160> ranked<00:03:06.430> team<00:03:06.490> in<00:03:06.730> the

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
been number one ranked team in the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.630 
been number one ranked team in the
nation<00:03:07.270> and<00:03:08.170> probably<00:03:08.860> went<00:03:09.160> to<00:03:09.220> national

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
nation and probably went to national

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.400 
nation and probably went to national
championship<00:03:10.240> and<00:03:10.390> their<00:03:10.540> preseason<00:03:11.110> number

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
championship and their preseason number

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:19.210 
championship and their preseason number
one<00:03:11.560> right<00:03:11.920> now

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.240 

I<00:03:19.340> think<00:03:20.240> ACC's<00:03:20.840> is<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.470> probably<00:03:21.830> biggest

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
I think ACC's is the probably biggest

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.190 
I think ACC's is the probably biggest
thing<00:03:22.430> that's<00:03:22.550> going<00:03:22.880> for<00:03:23.060> them<00:03:23.240> that's<00:03:24.080> a

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
thing that's going for them that's a

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.740 
thing that's going for them that's a
great<00:03:24.440> jump<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.160> a<00:03:25.190> different<00:03:25.250> um<00:03:25.790> I<00:03:26.180> would<00:03:26.630> say

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
great jump to a different um I would say

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.200 
great jump to a different um I would say
just<00:03:26.870> different<00:03:27.560> division<00:03:28.040> or<00:03:28.160> whatever<00:03:28.430> but

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
just different division or whatever but

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.880 
just different division or whatever but
um<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.780> coaching<00:03:30.170> staff<00:03:30.200> there<00:03:30.620> is<00:03:30.710> just

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
um the coaching staff there is just

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.280 
um the coaching staff there is just
amazing<00:03:31.160> coach<00:03:31.610> Charlie<00:03:32.000> Strong<00:03:32.360> and<00:03:32.780> coach

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
amazing coach Charlie Strong and coach

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.290 
amazing coach Charlie Strong and coach
Gordon<00:03:33.680> all<00:03:33.800> them<00:03:34.010> she's<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.430> real<00:03:34.970> juice<00:03:35.150> of

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.990 

I<00:03:43.900> think<00:03:44.530> there<00:03:44.650> will<00:03:44.740> be<00:03:44.800> going<00:03:45.400> back<00:03:45.580> to<00:03:45.610> semi

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.880 
I think there will be going back to semi

offensive side returning and that's just
a<00:04:06.850> big<00:04:07.140> thing<00:04:08.140> that<00:04:08.290> we<00:04:08.380> need<00:04:08.500> to<00:04:08.560> work<00:04:08.650> on<00:04:08.920> it

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
a big thing that we need to work on it

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.260 
a big thing that we need to work on it
just<00:04:09.190> all<00:04:09.310> offensive<00:04:09.730> side<00:04:10.030> of<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.209> ball

just all offensive side of the ball

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.180 
just all offensive side of the ball
right<00:04:10.630> now<00:04:10.840> because<00:04:11.110> our<00:04:11.230> defense<00:04:11.650> will<00:04:11.830> it

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
right now because our defense will it

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.370 
right now because our defense will it
will<00:04:12.370> work<00:04:12.550> out<00:04:12.790> but<00:04:13.120> i<00:04:13.150> often<00:04:13.420> sits<00:04:13.959> just<00:04:14.110> I

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
will work out but i often sits just I

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.590

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
think you'll all play out good but I

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.270 
think you'll all play out good but I
don't<00:04:17.290> know<00:04:17.410> I<00:04:17.440> guess<00:04:17.620> you<00:04:17.769> just<00:04:17.919> have<00:04:17.950> to<00:04:18.100> wait
