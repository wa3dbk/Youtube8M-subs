we<00:00:36.719> make<00:00:37.160> have<00:00:38.160> these<00:00:38.640> screws<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.600> come<00:00:39.989> all

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
we make have these screws that come all

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.830 
we make have these screws that come all
the<00:00:40.290> way<00:00:40.320> through<00:00:41.210> because<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.239> can't<00:00:42.570> find

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
the way through because I can't find

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.200 
the way through because I can't find
short<00:00:43.379> enough<00:00:43.710> screws<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> good

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
short enough screws that have a good

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.910 
short enough screws that have a good
bite<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.559> them<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.420> longer<00:00:49.079> screw<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.770> little

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
bite to them so a longer screw a little

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.939 
bite to them so a longer screw a little
bigger<00:00:50.280> screw<00:00:50.670> has<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.910> better<00:00:51.180> tooth<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.469> bite

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
bigger screw has a better tooth and bite

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.170 
bigger screw has a better tooth and bite
to<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:54.120> what<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> do<00:00:54.469> is<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:56.460> cut<00:00:56.699> those<00:00:56.910> off

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180

hard<00:03:02.080> for<00:03:02.260> me<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.959> already<00:03:04.959> have<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.260> cut<00:03:05.680> going

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
hard for me to already have a cut going

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:23.430 
hard for me to already have a cut going
all<00:03:07.239> right<00:03:07.390> I'll<00:03:07.570> just

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.259 

okay<00:03:24.440> this<00:03:24.860> one<00:03:25.190> is<00:03:27.220> supposedly<00:03:28.220> going<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:28.970> fit

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
okay this one is supposedly going to fit

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.650 
okay this one is supposedly going to fit
in<00:03:29.510> here

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
in here

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.930 
in here
at<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.989> bottom<00:03:33.230> of<00:03:33.530> this<00:03:33.739> box<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.810> this<00:03:35.810> was

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
at the bottom of this box and this was

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:44.199 
at the bottom of this box and this was
1/16<00:03:37.940> of<00:03:38.360> an<00:03:39.349> inch<00:03:39.650> material<00:03:41.440> plywood<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:43.790> if

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
1/16 of an inch material plywood and if

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.420 
1/16 of an inch material plywood and if
it<00:03:44.299> doesn't<00:03:44.629> fit<00:03:44.780> on<00:03:44.930> that<00:03:45.170> side<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.950> must<00:03:46.160> go

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
it doesn't fit on that side it must go

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.030 
it doesn't fit on that side it must go
on<00:03:46.610> this<00:03:46.790> time<00:03:47.090> but<00:03:47.810> I'll<00:03:47.959> do<00:03:48.230> is<00:03:48.290> I'll<00:03:48.650> glue

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
on this time but I'll do is I'll glue

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.150 
on this time but I'll do is I'll glue
that<00:03:49.340> up<00:03:50.890> and<00:03:51.890> put<00:03:52.730> it<00:03:52.819> in<00:03:52.940> there

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
that up and put it in there

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.009 
that up and put it in there
and<00:03:55.160> in<00:03:55.400> one<00:03:55.519> of<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:55.670> previous<00:03:55.880> videos<00:03:56.599> I

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
and in one of the previous videos I

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.160 
and in one of the previous videos I
don't<00:03:57.530> mind<00:03:57.829> leaving<00:03:58.280> these<00:03:58.790> burrs<00:03:59.209> like<00:03:59.810> this

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
don't mind leaving these burrs like this

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.860 
don't mind leaving these burrs like this
for<00:04:01.130> when<00:04:01.489> you're<00:04:01.700> going<00:04:01.849> to<00:04:02.209> glue<00:04:02.599> it<00:04:02.630> up

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
for when you're going to glue it up

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.740 
for when you're going to glue it up
inside<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:03.950> they'll<00:04:04.160> disappear<00:04:04.750> because

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
inside and they'll disappear because

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.670 
inside and they'll disappear because
that<00:04:05.959> helps<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.670> glue<00:04:07.670> bite<00:04:08.090> if<00:04:08.480> I<00:04:09.079> can<00:04:09.319> define

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
that helps the glue bite if I can define

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.330 
that helps the glue bite if I can define
a<00:04:09.709> new<00:04:09.920> word<00:04:10.310> like<00:04:10.879> glue<00:04:11.420> bite<00:04:12.069> so<00:04:13.069> I<00:04:13.099> don't

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
a new word like glue bite so I don't

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.849 
a new word like glue bite so I don't
mind<00:04:13.579> that<00:04:16.269> these<00:04:17.269> are<00:04:17.510> some<00:04:17.750> other<00:04:17.930> box<00:04:18.350> as<00:04:18.680> we

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
mind that these are some other box as we

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.490 
mind that these are some other box as we
made<00:04:19.810> skinning<00:04:20.810> two<00:04:21.709> layers<00:04:22.100> of<00:04:22.360> veneer

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
made skinning two layers of veneer

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.170 
made skinning two layers of veneer
around<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:25.130> ribs<00:04:25.850> of<00:04:26.270> coffee<00:04:27.200> stir<00:04:27.680> sticks

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
around the ribs of coffee stir sticks

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.460 
around the ribs of coffee stir sticks
this<00:04:29.180> one's<00:04:29.450> two<00:04:29.750> layers<00:04:30.080> of<00:04:30.970> veneer<00:04:32.470> seamed

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
this one's two layers of veneer seamed

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.510 
this one's two layers of veneer seamed
together<00:04:34.250> with<00:04:34.760> coffee<00:04:35.030> stir<00:04:35.510> sticks<00:04:35.900> and

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
together with coffee stir sticks and

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.850 
together with coffee stir sticks and
then<00:04:37.520> wrap<00:04:38.000> top<00:04:38.389> and<00:04:38.630> bottom<00:04:41.590> dropping<00:04:42.590> things

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
then wrap top and bottom dropping things

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.000

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
see I've got tongue depressors bent

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.310 
see I've got tongue depressors bent
around<00:04:53.960> a<00:04:54.650> two-by-four<00:04:55.900> that's<00:04:56.900> how<00:04:57.050> I<00:04:57.110> got

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
that shape so the tongue depressors I

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.089 
that shape so the tongue depressors I
pre<00:05:00.289> bent<00:05:00.530> them<00:05:00.800> around<00:05:01.669> the<00:05:01.970> 2x4<00:05:02.660> and<00:05:02.930> then<00:05:03.919> I

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:04.099 
pre bent them around the 2x4 and then I

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.480 
pre bent them around the 2x4 and then I
shape<00:05:04.460> the<00:05:04.490> this<00:05:05.330> is<00:05:05.479> called<00:05:05.750> wood<00:05:06.220> or<00:05:07.220> it's

on<00:05:10.669> one<00:05:10.910> side<00:05:11.240> and<00:05:11.830> veneer<00:05:12.830> on<00:05:13.010> the<00:05:13.130> other<00:05:13.280> and

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
on one side and veneer on the other and

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.379 
on one side and veneer on the other and
you<00:05:14.539> can<00:05:14.900> get<00:05:15.200> that<00:05:15.349> at<00:05:15.560> the<00:05:15.680> craft<00:05:16.010> store<00:05:16.389> but

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
you can get that at the craft store but

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.629 
you can get that at the craft store but
you<00:05:17.419> can<00:05:17.539> see<00:05:17.960> I've<00:05:18.169> already<00:05:18.380> cut<00:05:18.860> this<00:05:19.280> side

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
you can see I've already cut this side

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.310 
you can see I've already cut this side
with<00:05:20.479> this<00:05:20.720> tool<00:05:22.120> and<00:05:23.120> I'm<00:05:23.630> going<00:05:23.840> to<00:05:23.870> try<00:05:24.260> it

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
with this tool and I'm going to try it

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.950 
with this tool and I'm going to try it
again<00:05:25.450> if<00:05:26.450> I<00:05:26.690> can<00:05:26.960> do<00:05:27.200> this<00:05:27.500> with

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
again if I can do this with

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:37.560 
again if I can do this with
I<00:05:32.220> like<00:05:33.220> to<00:05:33.460> make<00:05:33.669> a<00:05:34.380> guide<00:05:35.910> so<00:05:36.910> I<00:05:36.940> just<00:05:37.270> help

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
I like to make a guide so I just help

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.180 
I like to make a guide so I just help
too

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:50.850 

straighten<00:05:40.940> it<00:05:40.970> out

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.820 

the<00:05:50.949> same

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
the same

00:05:52.830 --> 00:06:18.550 
the same
okay<00:05:53.520> maybe<00:05:53.879> now

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.450 

so<00:06:19.010> it's<00:06:19.190> cutting<00:06:19.640> two<00:06:19.880> layers<00:06:20.180> of<00:06:20.600> veneer

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
so it's cutting two layers of veneer

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:54.239 
so it's cutting two layers of veneer
and<00:06:22.550> trying<00:06:23.240> to<00:06:23.330> process

00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:54.249 

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:58.959 

so<00:06:55.249> I'll<00:06:56.179> straighten<00:06:56.569> that<00:06:56.839> line<00:06:57.169> up<00:06:57.969> by

00:06:58.959 --> 00:06:58.969 
so I'll straighten that line up by

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:02.919 
so I'll straighten that line up by
taking<00:06:59.389> some<00:06:59.869> of<00:06:59.899> the<00:07:00.229> sandpaper<00:07:01.479> paint<00:07:02.479> stir

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:02.929 
taking some of the sandpaper paint stir

00:07:02.929 --> 00:07:10.749 
taking some of the sandpaper paint stir
stick<00:07:03.459> sanding<00:07:05.139> stick<00:07:06.459> that<00:07:07.459> I<00:07:07.519> made<00:07:07.819> and<00:07:08.089> that
