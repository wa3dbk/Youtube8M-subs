for<00:00:26.279> summer<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.949> yeah<00:00:28.949> I've<00:00:29.609> tried<00:00:30.359> but<00:00:30.859> my<00:00:31.940> HP

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
for summer and yeah I've tried but my HP

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.500 
for summer and yeah I've tried but my HP
is<00:00:33.059> only<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.690> can<00:00:33.780> see<00:00:33.870> here<00:00:34.079> at<00:00:34.290> 16k<00:00:35.480> so<00:00:36.480> I

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
is only is you can see here at 16k so I

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.600 
is only is you can see here at 16k so I
pretty<00:00:36.870> much<00:00:36.960> get<00:00:37.200> one<00:00:37.649> shot<00:00:37.800> by<00:00:37.980> everything

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
pretty much get one shot by everything

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.750 
pretty much get one shot by everything
and<00:00:39.170> and<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:41.370> first<00:00:41.640> first<00:00:42.300> I've<00:00:42.719> gotten

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
and and the first first I've gotten

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.510 
and and the first first I've gotten
without<00:00:44.899> being<00:00:45.899> hit<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:47.129> beginning<00:00:47.280> of

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
without being hit is the beginning of

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.310 
without being hit is the beginning of
Phase<00:00:47.760> two<00:00:48.860> so<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.399> should<00:00:50.910> probably<00:00:50.940> do<00:00:51.449> like<00:00:52.050> a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
Phase two so I should probably do like a

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.290 
Phase two so I should probably do like a
billion<00:00:52.920> tries<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.699> wanted<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.000> actually

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
billion tries if I wanted to actually

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.520 
billion tries if I wanted to actually

really good if you can find one that

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.490 
really good if you can find one that
works<00:01:56.360> as<00:01:57.360> far<00:01:57.540> as<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.750> know<00:01:57.810> there's<00:01:58.110> still<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
works as far as I know there's still the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.580 
works as far as I know there's still the
bug<00:01:58.710> where<00:01:59.070> if<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.399> says<00:02:00.229> increased<00:02:01.229> attack

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
bug where if it says increased attack

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.499 
bug where if it says increased attack
speed<00:02:01.619> instead<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.670> tax<00:02:02.880> be<00:02:03.030> increased<00:02:03.360> it

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
speed instead of a tax be increased it

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.950 
speed instead of a tax be increased it
doesn't<00:02:03.810> work<00:02:04.020> when<00:02:04.740> it's<00:02:04.890> not<00:02:05.040> on<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.310> weapon

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
doesn't work when it's not on the weapon

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.859 
doesn't work when it's not on the weapon
and<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.140> sucks<00:02:08.330> so<00:02:09.330> if<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.539> didn't<00:02:09.780> know

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
and that sucks so if you didn't know

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.120 
and that sucks so if you didn't know
that<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.319> more<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.530> know

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
that the more you know

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.430 
that the more you know
and<00:02:12.250> here's<00:02:12.610> my<00:02:12.730> elephant<00:02:13.210> and<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.510> rest<00:02:14.350> of

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
and here's my elephant and the rest of

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.110 
and here's my elephant and the rest of
the<00:02:14.560> gear<00:02:14.740> is<00:02:14.860> not<00:02:15.010> really<00:02:15.280> that<00:02:15.400> important<00:02:15.970> I

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
the gear is not really that important I

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.090 
the gear is not really that important I
mean<00:02:16.270> it's<00:02:16.450> just<00:02:16.510> basically<00:02:17.320> intelligence

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
mean it's just basically intelligence

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.150 
mean it's just basically intelligence
and<00:02:18.610> crit<00:02:19.480> chance<00:02:19.510> plus<00:02:20.290> crit<00:02:20.530> damage<00:02:20.680> because

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
and crit chance plus crit damage because

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.490 
and crit chance plus crit damage because
that's<00:02:21.400> pretty<00:02:22.210> much<00:02:22.360> what<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:22.660> focus<00:02:23.140> on<00:02:23.290> right

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
that's pretty much what I focus on right

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.090 
that's pretty much what I focus on right
now<00:02:23.530> I've<00:02:23.860> gone<00:02:24.640> away<00:02:24.820> from<00:02:25.060> attacks<00:02:25.690> beat<00:02:26.100> to

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
now I've gone away from attacks beat to

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.690 
now I've gone away from attacks beat to
get<00:02:27.220> more<00:02:27.400> Christian<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.090> crit<00:02:28.240> damage<00:02:29.160> as<00:02:30.160> I

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
get more Christian and crit damage as I

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.900 
get more Christian and crit damage as I
find<00:02:31.210> it's<00:02:31.710> well<00:02:32.710> it<00:02:32.860> works<00:02:33.070> better<00:02:33.370> since

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
find it's well it works better since

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.240 
find it's well it works better since
attack<00:02:34.240> speed<00:02:34.420> only<00:02:34.540> increases<00:02:35.050> like<00:02:35.410> at<00:02:36.070> the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
attack speed only increases like at the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.210 
attack speed only increases like at the
rate<00:02:36.490> of<00:02:36.520> how<00:02:36.790> fast<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.540> attack<00:02:37.950> but<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.070> does

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
rate of how fast you attack but it does

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.490 
rate of how fast you attack but it does
increase<00:02:39.520> how<00:02:39.940> much<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.870> an<00:02:40.990> impact<00:02:41.140> like

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
increase how much of an impact like

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.280 
increase how much of an impact like
Phillip<00:02:42.070> like<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.370> ETF<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:43.020> you<00:02:44.020> can<00:02:44.140> see<00:02:44.260> how

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
Phillip like the ETF and you can see how

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.770 
Phillip like the ETF and you can see how
fast<00:02:44.830> i<00:02:45.070> can<00:02:45.100> actually<00:02:45.370> empty<00:02:45.970> my<00:02:46.270> I<00:02:46.300> can<00:02:46.630> power

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
fast i can actually empty my I can power

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.780 
fast i can actually empty my I can power
anyway<00:02:47.320> so<00:02:47.380> there's<00:02:47.830> not<00:02:47.980> really<00:02:48.250> any<00:02:48.490> point

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
anyway so there's not really any point

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.480 
anyway so there's not really any point
in<00:02:49.020> getting<00:02:50.020> all<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.350> attack<00:02:50.650> speed<00:02:50.890> I<00:02:51.160> mean

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
in getting all the attack speed I mean

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.400 
in getting all the attack speed I mean
thickness<00:02:51.790> like<00:02:52.510> what<00:02:52.720> one<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.380> half

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
thickness like what one and a half

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.240 
thickness like what one and a half
second<00:02:53.920> to<00:02:54.070> mt<00:02:54.370> at<00:02:54.460> all<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:56.200> yeah<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:57.040> here's

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
second to mt at all so yeah and here's

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.880 
second to mt at all so yeah and here's
my<00:02:57.400> stat<00:02:57.610> screen<00:02:57.880> you<00:02:58.000> can<00:02:58.120> see<00:02:58.360> I<00:02:58.630> have<00:02:59.470> thirty

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
my stat screen you can see I have thirty

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.370 
my stat screen you can see I have thirty
five<00:03:00.160> point<00:03:01.000> five<00:03:01.270> percent<00:03:02.200> crit<00:03:02.740> chance<00:03:04.380> so

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
five point five percent crit chance so

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.580 
five point five percent crit chance so
if<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:05.860> got<00:03:06.330> arcane<00:03:07.330> power<00:03:07.360> on<00:03:07.780> crit<00:03:08.140> I<00:03:08.320> would

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
if I got arcane power on crit I would

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.790 
if I got arcane power on crit I would
basically<00:03:09.010> almost<00:03:09.670> be<00:03:09.970> able<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.330> keep<00:03:10.600> up<00:03:10.810> my

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
basically almost be able to keep up my

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.360 
basically almost be able to keep up my
arcane<00:03:12.190> power<00:03:12.220> with<00:03:12.880> just<00:03:13.510> Hydra<00:03:14.110> and<00:03:14.370> arcane

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
arcane power with just Hydra and arcane

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.750 
arcane power with just Hydra and arcane
orb<00:03:15.930> which<00:03:16.930> would<00:03:17.140> be<00:03:17.380> pretty<00:03:17.770> neat<00:03:17.830> but<00:03:18.250> as

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
orb which would be pretty neat but as

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.790 
orb which would be pretty neat but as
far<00:03:18.940> as<00:03:19.000> i<00:03:19.180> know<00:03:19.240> right<00:03:19.360> now<00:03:19.750> on<00:03:19.960> auction<00:03:20.620> i<00:03:20.680> was

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
far as i know right now on auction i was

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.510 
far as i know right now on auction i was
just<00:03:21.010> not<00:03:21.280> any<00:03:21.760> cheap<00:03:22.150> ones<00:03:22.420> available<00:03:23.520> which

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
just not any cheap ones available which

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.430 
just not any cheap ones available which
are<00:03:24.700> as<00:03:24.970> good<00:03:25.240> as<00:03:26.190> good<00:03:27.190> as<00:03:27.280> my<00:03:27.430> helmet<00:03:27.850> over<00:03:28.150> my

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
are as good as good as my helmet over my

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.480 
are as good as good as my helmet over my
my<00:03:29.440> orphaned<00:03:29.950> and<00:03:30.250> i'm<00:03:30.580> not<00:03:30.760> super<00:03:31.330> rich<00:03:31.540> so

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
my orphaned and i'm not super rich so

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.020 
my orphaned and i'm not super rich so
yeah<00:03:33.840> anyways<00:03:34.840> let's<00:03:35.200> get<00:03:35.350> started<00:03:35.410> um<00:03:36.030> the

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
yeah anyways let's get started um the

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.180 
yeah anyways let's get started um the
first<00:03:37.300> thing<00:03:37.480> i<00:03:37.750> do<00:03:37.900> is<00:03:38.110> i<00:03:38.470> get<00:03:38.650> five<00:03:38.860> stacks

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
first thing i do is i get five stacks

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.690 
first thing i do is i get five stacks
and<00:03:39.580> I<00:03:40.390> do<00:03:41.350> that<00:03:41.800> by<00:03:41.830> going<00:03:42.100> to<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.490> cemetery

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
and I do that by going to the cemetery

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.510 
and I do that by going to the cemetery
of<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.060> sake<00:03:43.510> in<00:03:43.720> here<00:03:44.130> where<00:03:45.130> it's<00:03:45.280> pretty

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
of the sake in here where it's pretty

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.630 
of the sake in here where it's pretty
simple<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:46.000> find<00:03:46.180> champion<00:03:46.480> packs<00:03:47.430> um<00:03:50.640> because

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
simple to find champion packs um because

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.920 
simple to find champion packs um because
there's<00:03:52.270> pretty<00:03:52.720> much<00:03:52.780> always<00:03:53.050> one<00:03:53.440> in<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:55.780> all

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
there's pretty much always one in in all

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.900 
there's pretty much always one in in all
of<00:03:56.110> these<00:03:56.260> scripts<00:03:56.590> if<00:03:56.950> not<00:03:57.310> more<00:03:57.580> so<00:03:59.820> yeah<00:04:00.820> I'm

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
of these scripts if not more so yeah I'm

of these scripts if not more so yeah I'm
just<00:04:01.090> going<00:04:01.209> to<00:04:01.240> go<00:04:01.300> ahead<00:04:01.480> and<00:04:01.720> do<00:04:01.810> that<00:04:02.490> there

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
just going to go ahead and do that there

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.710 
just going to go ahead and do that there
we<00:04:03.610> go<00:04:03.730> five<00:04:04.209> stacks<00:04:04.570> and<00:04:05.190> before<00:04:06.190> we<00:04:06.220> go<00:04:06.310> into

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
we go five stacks and before we go into

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.270 
we go five stacks and before we go into
unicon<00:04:07.720> level<00:04:07.990> i'm<00:04:08.350> going<00:04:08.709> to<00:04:08.770> show<00:04:08.890> my<00:04:09.040> bill

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
unicon level i'm going to show my bill

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.510 
unicon level i'm going to show my bill
first<00:04:10.080> so<00:04:11.080> i<00:04:11.380> have<00:04:11.560> matching<00:04:12.010> missile<00:04:12.340> with

orb for all the AoE and burst and I ruin

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.830 
orb for all the AoE and burst and I ruin
it<00:04:23.080> with<00:04:23.229> obliteration<00:04:23.919> just<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.760> do<00:04:25.450> even

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
it with obliteration just to do even

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.090 
it with obliteration just to do even
more<00:04:25.930> damage<00:04:26.110> and<00:04:27.060> Hayek<00:04:28.060> Ritz<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.980> then<00:04:29.980> you

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
more damage and Hayek Ritz and then you

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.830 
more damage and Hayek Ritz and then you
have<00:04:30.990> arcane<00:04:31.990> Hydra<00:04:32.470> which<00:04:33.250> I<00:04:33.730> use<00:04:34.449> because<00:04:34.630> it

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
have arcane Hydra which I use because it

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.500 
have arcane Hydra which I use because it
can<00:04:35.020> crit<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:35.470> it<00:04:35.860> with<00:04:36.580> temporal<00:04:36.970> flux<00:04:37.210> it

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
can crit and it with temporal flux it

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
can crit and it with temporal flux it
slows<00:04:37.840> and<00:04:39.000> then<00:04:40.000> teleport<00:04:40.990> with<00:04:41.350> the

slows and then teleport with the

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.510 
slows and then teleport with the
fracture<00:04:42.130> room<00:04:42.550> so<00:04:43.090> that<00:04:43.410> you<00:04:44.410> have<00:04:44.590> two<00:04:44.860> tanks

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
fracture room so that you have two tanks

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.370 
fracture room so that you have two tanks
like<00:04:46.000> you<00:04:46.389> can<00:04:46.510> take<00:04:46.660> two<00:04:46.840> more<00:04:46.990> hits<00:04:47.169> because

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
like you can take two more hits because

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.460 
like you can take two more hits because
they<00:04:47.620> take<00:04:47.860> two<00:04:48.010> hits<00:04:48.220> for<00:04:48.400> you<00:04:48.930> and<00:04:49.930> then<00:04:50.350> I

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
they take two hits for you and then I

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.700 
they take two hits for you and then I
use<00:04:50.650> blizzard<00:04:51.870> only<00:04:52.870> for<00:04:53.080> the<00:04:53.169> slow<00:04:53.470> the

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
use blizzard only for the slow the

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.180 
use blizzard only for the slow the
damage<00:04:54.010> is<00:04:54.160> just<00:04:54.639> really<00:04:55.270> really<00:04:55.449> low<00:04:55.750> um

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
damage is just really really low um

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.550 
damage is just really really low um
that's<00:04:57.190> why<00:04:57.460> I<00:04:57.490> ruin<00:04:57.940> it<00:04:58.090> with<00:04:58.270> snow<00:04:58.990> bound<00:04:59.169> so

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
that's why I ruin it with snow bound so

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.409 
that's why I ruin it with snow bound so
that<00:04:59.710> costs<00:05:00.310> less<00:05:00.720> arcane<00:05:01.720> power<00:05:02.160> and<00:05:03.419> finally

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
that costs less arcane power and finally

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.390 
that costs less arcane power and finally
I<00:05:04.450> have<00:05:04.720> magic<00:05:05.229> weapon<00:05:05.530> and<00:05:05.770> that<00:05:06.220> one<00:05:06.370> is

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
I have magic weapon and that one is

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:13.310 
I have magic weapon and that one is
obvious<00:05:06.850> it<00:05:07.150> grants<00:05:08.220> what<00:05:09.300> um<00:05:11.490> 16k<00:05:12.490> damage<00:05:12.910> so

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
obvious it grants what um 16k damage so

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.050 
obvious it grants what um 16k damage so
that's<00:05:14.320> a<00:05:14.500> lot<00:05:14.680> and<00:05:14.889> it<00:05:15.190> also<00:05:15.370> gives<00:05:15.520> me<00:05:16.030> a

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
that's a lot and it also gives me a

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.670 
that's a lot and it also gives me a
knock<00:05:16.510> back<00:05:16.750> on<00:05:17.500> all<00:05:17.680> my<00:05:17.710> spells<00:05:19.500> armor<00:05:20.500> than

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
knock back on all my spells armor than

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.820 
knock back on all my spells armor than
prodigy<00:05:21.280> obviously<00:05:21.910> to<00:05:22.090> refill<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:23.169> arcane

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
prodigy obviously to refill the arcane

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.510 
prodigy obviously to refill the arcane
power<00:05:23.880> faster<00:05:24.880> and<00:05:25.199> glass<00:05:26.199> cannon<00:05:26.560> just<00:05:27.250> to<00:05:27.400> do

power faster and glass cannon just to do

power faster and glass cannon just to do
more<00:05:27.729> damage<00:05:27.940> and<00:05:28.270> I<00:05:28.360> can't<00:05:28.600> take<00:05:28.780> any<00:05:28.930> hit

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
more damage and I can't take any hit

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.850 
more damage and I can't take any hit
anyway<00:05:29.500> so<00:05:30.270> it<00:05:31.270> doesn't<00:05:31.360> matter<00:05:31.690> that<00:05:32.289> Louis

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
anyway so it doesn't matter that Louis

anyway so it doesn't matter that Louis
the<00:05:33.100> arm<00:05:33.550> and<00:05:33.760> resistance<00:05:34.440> so<00:05:35.440> let's<00:05:35.740> just

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
the arm and resistance so let's just

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.600 
the arm and resistance so let's just
dive<00:05:36.490> into<00:05:36.700> it<00:05:36.940> and<00:05:38.010> sometimes<00:05:39.010> you're<00:05:39.460> in<00:05:39.550> the

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
dive into it and sometimes you're in the

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.440 
dive into it and sometimes you're in the
beginning<00:05:39.910> you<00:05:39.940> have<00:05:40.030> a<00:05:40.180> lot<00:05:40.419> of<00:05:40.450> units

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
camping the portal wanting to kill you

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.279 
camping the portal wanting to kill you
but<00:05:50.530> you<00:05:50.919> just<00:05:51.099> have<00:05:51.280> to<00:05:51.460> kind<00:05:51.880> of<00:05:52.000> you<00:05:52.900> know<00:05:52.960> go

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
but you just have to kind of you know go

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.469 
but you just have to kind of you know go
down<00:05:53.470> die<00:05:53.770> and<00:05:54.099> respawn<00:05:54.460> until<00:05:54.820> you<00:05:54.970> clear
