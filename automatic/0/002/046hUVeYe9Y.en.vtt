00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.840 
exactly what the what it's going to look
like<00:01:36.000> once<00:01:36.270> it's<00:01:36.479> clear<00:01:36.810> coated<00:01:37.520> so<00:01:38.520> here<00:01:38.670> hang

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
like once it's clear coated so here hang

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.510 
like once it's clear coated so here hang
on<00:01:38.970> one<00:01:39.119> second<00:01:39.450> I'll<00:01:39.509> throw<00:01:39.689> some<00:01:40.340> throw<00:01:41.340> some

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
on one second I'll throw some throw some

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:55.550 
on one second I'll throw some throw some
water<00:01:41.640> over<00:01:41.970> that

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.020 

so<00:01:56.560> as<00:01:56.710> soon<00:01:56.860> as<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.070> water<00:01:57.250> hits<00:01:57.490> you<00:01:57.700> can<00:01:57.850> see

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
so as soon as the water hits you can see

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.070 
so as soon as the water hits you can see
how<00:01:58.150> quick<00:01:58.450> that<00:01:58.630> shine<00:01:58.930> pops<00:02:03.720> we<00:02:04.720> get<00:02:04.990> off

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
how quick that shine pops we get off

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.400 
how quick that shine pops we get off
that<00:02:05.290> glare<00:02:06.540> but<00:02:07.540> you<00:02:07.660> can<00:02:07.810> already<00:02:07.930> see<00:02:08.259> with

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
that glare but you can already see with

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.260 
that glare but you can already see with
water<00:02:08.679> on<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:09.009> it's<00:02:09.160> twice<00:02:09.429> as<00:02:09.670> shiny<00:02:09.940> as<00:02:10.030> the

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
water on it it's twice as shiny as the

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.400 
water on it it's twice as shiny as the
top<00:02:10.479> up<00:02:10.690> here<00:02:12.060> get<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.090> better<00:02:13.300> shot<00:02:13.420> this<00:02:13.990> way

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.070 

you<00:02:17.410> can<00:02:17.590> see<00:02:17.770> if<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.010> follow<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.430> cooler<00:02:18.670> up

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
you can see if you follow the cooler up

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.400 
you can see if you follow the cooler up
you<00:02:20.080> see<00:02:20.260> how<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.440> walleye<00:02:20.800> door<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:22.260> guess<00:02:23.260> they

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
you see how a walleye door I guess they

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.040 
you see how a walleye door I guess they
call<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.650> orange<00:02:23.950> peels<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:25.390> top<00:02:25.600> part<00:02:25.900> is

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
call it orange peels the top part is

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.710 
call it orange peels the top part is
compared<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.680> bottom<00:02:26.980> here<00:02:27.540> it's<00:02:28.540> almost

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
compared to the bottom here it's almost

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.110 
compared to the bottom here it's almost
like<00:02:28.930> glass<00:02:29.230> at<00:02:29.560> this<00:02:29.739> point<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.280> that's<00:02:30.910> what

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
like glass at this point so that's what

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.750 
like glass at this point so that's what
it's<00:02:31.209> going<00:02:31.300> to<00:02:31.420> look<00:02:31.510> like<00:02:31.570> once<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.760> once

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
it's going to look like once the once

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.979 
it's going to look like once the once
the<00:02:33.910> clear<00:02:34.150> coats<00:02:34.360> over<00:02:34.480> it<00:02:34.660> I<00:02:34.690> got<00:02:34.840> some

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
the clear coats over it I got some

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.600 
the clear coats over it I got some
airbrushing<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.620> do<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:35.860> stuff<00:02:36.040> before<00:02:36.430> that

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
airbrushing to do and stuff before that

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.979 
airbrushing to do and stuff before that
but<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:36.880> looks<00:02:36.910> like<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.300> bed's<00:02:37.480> almost<00:02:37.780> done

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
but it looks like the bed's almost done

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.050 
but it looks like the bed's almost done
here<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:39.130> we're<00:02:39.220> going<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.370> go<00:02:39.520> back<00:02:39.700> one<00:02:40.030> more

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
once-over with mm and then that'll be

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.630

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.300 
officiai or the orange peel on that is
really<00:03:24.010> bad<00:03:25.170> in<00:03:26.170> most<00:03:26.440> areas<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:27.070> we're<00:03:27.220> gonna

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
really bad in most areas so we're gonna

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.500 
really bad in most areas so we're gonna
have<00:03:27.459> to<00:03:27.519> go<00:03:27.610> back<00:03:27.640> and<00:03:27.910> do<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.030> again<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.239> top

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
have to go back and do it again the top

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.060 
have to go back and do it again the top
came<00:03:28.720> out<00:03:28.870> pretty<00:03:29.049> clean<00:03:29.440> without<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.920> wet

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
came out pretty clean without the wet

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.910 
came out pretty clean without the wet
sand<00:03:30.690> so<00:03:31.690> there's<00:03:31.930> just<00:03:31.989> a<00:03:32.170> couple<00:03:32.320> areas<00:03:32.650> on

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
sand so there's just a couple areas on

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.080 
sand so there's just a couple areas on

have to go back and do like right there

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.619 
have to go back and do like right there
latter<00:03:36.280> would<00:03:36.549> be<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:36.909> can<00:03:37.090> kind<00:03:37.299> of<00:03:37.330> see<00:03:37.510> it

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
latter would be you can kind of see it

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:46.020 
latter would be you can kind of see it
wave<00:03:40.530> right<00:03:41.530> there<00:03:41.560> on<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.040> split<00:03:44.849> and<00:03:45.849> then

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
wave right there on the split and then

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.449 
wave right there on the split and then
this<00:03:46.209> is<00:03:46.390> already<00:03:46.860> what's<00:03:47.860> and<00:03:48.129> it<00:03:48.280> that's

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
this is already what's and it that's

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.399 
this is already what's and it that's
already<00:03:48.730> got<00:03:48.849> it<00:03:49.000> actually<00:03:49.780> needs<00:03:50.140> another

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 
already got it actually needs another

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.580 
already got it actually needs another
another<00:03:51.010> coat<00:03:51.690> I'll<00:03:52.690> probably<00:03:52.930> put<00:03:53.170> two<00:03:53.349> more

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
another coat I'll probably put two more

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.170 
another coat I'll probably put two more
on<00:03:53.709> it<00:03:53.860> just<00:03:54.040> because<00:03:54.220> I<00:03:54.310> sanded<00:03:54.909> through<00:03:55.030> to

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
on it just because I sanded through to

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.199 
on it just because I sanded through to
the<00:03:55.269> primer<00:03:55.510> in<00:03:55.720> some<00:03:55.930> spots<00:03:56.760> so<00:03:57.760> I'll<00:03:57.849> put<00:03:58.060> two

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
the primer in some spots so I'll put two

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.430 
the primer in some spots so I'll put two
more<00:03:58.360> coats<00:03:58.599> on<00:03:58.750> that<00:03:58.870> just<00:03:59.079> to<00:03:59.140> make<00:03:59.230> sure<00:03:59.290> I

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
more coats on that just to make sure I

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.930 
more coats on that just to make sure I
don't<00:03:59.620> stand<00:03:59.920> through<00:04:00.069> the<00:04:00.099> primer<00:04:00.430> again<00:04:02.940> and

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
don't stand through the primer again and

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.369 
don't stand through the primer again and
then<00:04:04.150> this<00:04:04.329> is<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.659> this<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:04.930> what<00:04:05.019> the<00:04:05.200> bed

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
then this is the this is what the bed

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:06.869 
then this is the this is what the bed
looked<00:04:05.620> like<00:04:05.739> on<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.010> other<00:04:06.040> side<00:04:06.220> before<00:04:06.760> you

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
looked like on the other side before you

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.690 
looked like on the other side before you
can<00:04:07.030> barely<00:04:07.329> see<00:04:07.510> in<00:04:07.659> it<00:04:07.780> as<00:04:07.959> you<00:04:08.440> can<00:04:08.530> tell<00:04:08.829> I'm

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700
