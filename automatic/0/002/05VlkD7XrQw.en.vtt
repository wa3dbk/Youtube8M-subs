 folded to save space and so 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.149
 stow it easily on 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.040
 smallest space finds itself in the backpack 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.439

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.070
 Companion comfortably place or deposit 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.350
 you the grill 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.909
 but just in their car is a lot 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.780
 heard and certainly the one or 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.220
 others seen 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.630

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.650
 what that means or how easy it is 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.240
 in fact, that grudge goes away 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.130
 to fold apart , I suppose 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.530
 simply both handles aim at it briefly 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.390
 must ensure that he has a stable 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.970

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.950
 still the specially refined rust above 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.840
 on it and let 's go please

 do not forget the charcoal grill 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.350
 it probably will not work without blood 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.759
 with the grilling so easy 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.439
 when they fold back together 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.240

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.070
