00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.810
 Hmm 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.830
 Talk to the beauty show first show 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.419
 here today with another video in this video 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.789
 Good today, we're here for one more. 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:24.470
 episode of our wise land series 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.390
 personal in the last episode 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.369
 as I told you guys 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.220
 would probably do a house here in this 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.780
 place baroto so let's do it in 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.250
 personal truth and was also 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.070
 some ideas here since you 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.809
 they had enough challenges including 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.420
 some there I found very epic too 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.280
 epics even then just look at one of you 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.320
 sent a tip to build a house 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.869
 on top of that tree behind me 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.760
 one giant sponge tree exactly I 

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:51.860
 I'm thinking maybe I'll make a house 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.750
 there is the house that I will create here will 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.280
 to be just a kind of temporary house 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.260
 because it will not be anything big 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.360
 only the normal home even simple for 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.350
 we get a good picture here and power 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.600
 at least take shelter 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.580
 I was to be here planting ago 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.860
 people and ended up joining our 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.510
 in the caves that are behind there and 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.450
 finish here so I needed one 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.729
 little more than leaving the locks here and 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.290
 come on and 2 shall start building 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.240
 here then I do not know if I will do 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.610
 second these things like this 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.800
 Pay off, but I'll probably go 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.320
 yes then for him to do more here we go 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:28.970
 build because to build life right 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.430
 let's go there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.810
 odd number of was true odd number 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.760
 it will not help very much, I think I will 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.560
 to do it that way I'm going to take this 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.330
 but part here though is not bad 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.830
 because it would be fairer, man. 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.560
 now I'll do it anyway, I 'll do it 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.950
 even number that is more bonetti 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.350
 more beautiful like there and still good that ta 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.210
 by day or not he will stay at night and 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.100
 although it was I think we'll go 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.890
 need to run after sheep goat 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.080
 sheep is going to help a lot now in this 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.920
 Momentum, Brazil needs to sleep. 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.870
 expensive 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.780
 I do not know where she has sheep, does not she? 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.460
 idea really that has a beach sea 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.200
 hotel garbage people can we do 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.110
 lots of things here on the beach 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.900
 I see him I see sheep had 91 3 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.060
 government has the line that also looks at 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.170
 Poor chicken is going to go to me. 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.049
 list of the dead 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.790
 beauty looks only that there is only one face to 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.439
 old one did not know whether to give to 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.569
 help a lot there is a lot of squid 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.950
 even squid has here but I'm not ashamed 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.230
 on my face if I had faith or at least 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.790
 I did our treasury is giving to 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.920
 people get enough lan 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.409
 so come on, look at this forest 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.659
 Port could have a sheep here, man. 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.799
 our most expensive help 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.200
 come on let's take a look at this 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.889
 biome that is very strange to him that 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.599
 old 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:43.489
 come on in front I ran not 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.409
 It occurred to you guys, they performed 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.029
 here in the last episode I was on psiu 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.709
 Dude, I 'm very hesitant. 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:50.629
 but it actually even got a little fair 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.730
 It's because I type piero first episode 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.319
 at least we were being intimidated 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.959
 a bit with the map and maybe at least 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:00.159
 gave to do things without is this sound 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.480
 bag of monsters is you me 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:04.790
 understand it looks only then the very part 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.139
 time to predict I'll have to eat 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.480
 so I needed to at least sort it out 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:10.159
 That furnace people but by the way 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:16.159
 here we will not have how to do 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:18.529
 now ours because late afternoon day of 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.279
 day and it will not help anything nothing nothing nothing nothing 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:22.159
 same 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:23.900
 Look, let's just go to our house, then 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.309
 talita our house had lit is 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.889

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.790

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.290

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:41.090
 food there with that lady the cows 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.419
 and at least we 'll have as if 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.159
 recharge the beauty is I weighed pine 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.359
 close this to close this here 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.769
 For him it was one of them. 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:52.340

 wait , it's daylight so we can give 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:00.739
 more exploited, otherwise it will not 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:02.700
 It's okay , girl, to lower it a bit. 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.650
 Sound because you know what it's like, man. 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.870
 from bush breaking down a while ago 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.090
 more noise but let's go to that 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.700
 even so she and we are going to spend another 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.590

 it was a fast rumor we're going to be 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.330
 very monstro because here is everything 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.650
 aligned then I'll have to 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.169
 a little bit of just any 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.550
 way or leaving them because problem 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.610
 if monster came, we can 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.830
 see them see light exactly one 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.800
 make just one more row in enough 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:42.840
 Wood here for that, so lap dex to 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.820
 do not die in the wide xbox I want 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.750
 here we are going to make the connection here 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.310
 from the door to do the thing door to door 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.590
 here I will let two glasses just pay 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.139
 We'll take off shankar later. 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.050

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.930
 down comes good girl up ahead 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.460
 also to avoid constraints 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.740
 Look who's the one who does not leave the line. 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.260
 house where spider was born spider was born 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.880
 it 's not good at all but any 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.250
 maybe if we can not 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.970
 all the lans in this episode wait in 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.030

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.200
 Come on, let's go, guys, without fear. 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.060
 of the spider without fear 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.010
 Let's go, I'll see, I can 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.880
 do a little better and have guilt there 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.080
 guys 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.750
 Let's go guys fast, then I can. 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.320
 do a better thing because if not I 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.539
 I'll end up dying here to believe it 's nothing. 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.479
 good, it's nothing good, come on, come on. 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:35.850

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.530
 bodices do not want do not want do not want me 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.360
 see that she does not want to see me is nothing 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.610
 nice to also do the house that same 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.889
 very simple just to improvise to make a 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.050
 text of a good dem dem ceiling is 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.919
 It's very strange for him to take 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.200
 that over there 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:52.710
 Let's just do the details. 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.419
 Let's go if you jump here, ipioca did not give 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.520
 very sure did not work very well 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.960
 Look at the aac, there's no such thing as the monsters. 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.970
 come in later, we can make a 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.280
 Glass with us arranges that too is 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.620
 Why can not I do one thing all the time? 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.610
 instant cni 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.099
 lapidam I'll have to put your cut 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.689
 after that then this will help a lot 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.189
 episode will be more but managed in 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:13.080
 home at least one day I went after 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:15.300
 of the lan we needed now 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.990
 You only need two more and I want to see 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:22.050
 already two lan now we go there got stuck 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.419
 of food also that of the puma and reebok 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.879
 do the following we will plant fast is just 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:30.059
 I know that here and they want to take 

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:32.460
 careful because in what he plus a bi 

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:34.589
 Our lady is very fast fast fast to 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.719
 people, let's make this plantation here 

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:37.740
 Let's dedicate it to the power of home. 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:39.659
 fast 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.300
 I think I just think I'm going to miss it. 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:44.969
 more wood just looks down here this 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:48.479
 It's not good, it's not really good. 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:50.759
 dude it's we can end then 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:54.060
 then the house left the car was a 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:56.639
 very jec thing if it binds is not stone 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.830
 had a stone in stone is not an ax 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:00.719
 This was very strange. 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.210
 strange but I'm going to leave this episode 

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:04.349
 here was really only to build 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.649
 this house that went into the next episode 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:10.020
 people are looking for some kind of 

00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:12.899
 food 67 look only left two more 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.399
 torches here and leave here also because 

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:18.509
 not're uncool and we tidies 

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:20.520
 also in the southern most of the chests 

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:22.860
 This episode is 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.180
 it was more to build our little house 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.159
 marotta that we 'll explore later 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.379
 Because there's too much to find 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:30.029
 I knew I had a beach here and 

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:31.919
 there near a beach so people 

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:33.990
 What are you enjoying it for?
