that I used to organize myself on my

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.930 
that I used to organize myself on my
phone<00:03:36.900> is<00:03:37.170> who<00:03:37.260> knows<00:03:37.500> now<00:03:38.280> know<00:03:38.550> this<00:03:38.670> is<00:03:38.820> a

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
phone is who knows now know this is a

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.250 
phone is who knows now know this is a
really<00:03:39.060> obvious<00:03:39.330> one<00:03:39.540> everyone<00:03:39.930> knows<00:03:40.110> about

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
really obvious one everyone knows about

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.720 
really obvious one everyone knows about
people<00:03:40.830> don't<00:03:40.920> really<00:03:41.160> use<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.550> often

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.880 
and I think it's a really good thing to
use<00:03:44.610> when<00:03:44.640> you<00:03:47.180> when<00:03:48.180> you're<00:03:48.330> making<00:03:48.390> notes
