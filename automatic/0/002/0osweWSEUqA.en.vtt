00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.010 
special effects I mean the fact is I
could<00:02:14.560> only<00:02:14.680> do<00:02:14.920> one<00:02:15.130> page<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:16.750> know<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:16.900> took

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
could only do one page you know it took

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.890 
could only do one page you know it took
three<00:02:17.350> hours<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.680> set<00:02:18.040> up<00:02:18.160> each<00:02:18.970> time<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:19.600> you

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
three hours to set up each time so you

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.480 
three hours to set up each time so you
know<00:02:20.020> I'd<00:02:20.200> go<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.500> them<00:02:20.650> afterwards<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.310> say

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
know I'd go to them afterwards and I say

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.670 
know I'd go to them afterwards and I say
yeah<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.209> think<00:02:22.780> we<00:02:22.870> got<00:02:23.020> something<00:02:23.260> good<00:02:23.470> there

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
yeah I think we got something good there

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.800 
yeah I think we got something good there
but<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:24.459> know<00:02:24.580> could<00:02:24.820> we<00:02:24.850> try<00:02:25.270> in<00:02:25.330> a<00:02:25.450> different

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
but you know could we try in a different

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.530 
but you know could we try in a different
way

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540
