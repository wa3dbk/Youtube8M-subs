00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:07.710
 and so today I would like 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.629
 to make a little message not only in 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.160
 link with total strategy but especially 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.749
 in connection with steel sun as 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.579
 many already know it during the summer 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:16.500
 2013 ie a little before the release 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:18.480
 from Rome 2 I asked a question to the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.980
 community while I proposed if the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.080
 people were interested in what I 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.390
 do a series on dark s3g by the fact 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.550
 even proposed the community to choose 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.650
 for me with a favorite nation that I 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.930
 do this last if not that japan 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.150
 won hands down and eventually he 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.460
 was the relatively disastrous exit 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.230
 from Rome for two months for me because of 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.030
 because I really need to 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.250
 after that it's sure that afterwards he has 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.810
 I had to m aside total strategy 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.489
 and all this is all the more so as the 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.710
 people with their meager yield syria 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.170
 on darkest hour series that was going to be 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.820
 inevitably extremely strategic 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.620
 and that I knew they were going to be 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.850
 followed by fewer people and that's 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.950
 greatly due to the fact that this series 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.960
 was going to be inevitably extremely 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.000
 complex so it's so yes on one side it 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.920
 took me a little bit total strategy 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.719
 aside from time to time however I 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.880
 strives to make a few episodes by 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.470
 here or there I make it very soon 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.909
 and besides, it's going to be an episode 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.470
 to actually rank people will love it 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.210
 I am sure but it does not prevent 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.890
 meanwhile I noticed that the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.840
 sun and steel series throws up a bit 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.060
 least I know that initially coming out 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.860
 the nex that may not have been the choice the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.540
 more strategic since nex 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.190
 revealed extremely complex but 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.330
 multitude of people said to themselves I am 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.159
 doubted that people had precisely 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.960
 to tell oneself is that the rest of the series to 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.040
 it's pretty much like it's fixed 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.110
 so today he just made a 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.939
 little video to invite you yes to 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.229
 you embark on this adventure this 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.450
 week we are now going to 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.150
 the episode 12 of the series is finally here 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.500
 after eleven episodes if we exclude appendices 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.210
 with the year that it would be 12 episodes 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.310
 and so it's after eleven episodes 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.110
 normal episode through which we have 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.240
 been able to plan the war with 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.530
 trouble minutia we finally arrive this 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.700
 week at war and it's for this 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.080
 reason I'm doing this video I 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.049
 would like to invite you since I 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.970
 really an almost 100% auditory feedback 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.619
 but however that a sweater viewing 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.119
 so I know that the series is 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.920
 complex but still format 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.229
 consider this last as an out 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.090
 series of strategies total reality that's 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.039
 exactly the same principle as the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.020
 series came together universalism or 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.920
 still the one on civilization 5 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.150
 indeed the only 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.920
 ference and that this last of his 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.209
 post to total tj and that there is no one 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.590
 hole at the beginning of each episode 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.239
 in any case I just wanted you 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.190
 scare the war finally begins 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.140
 this week it's not too late 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.420
 to immerse myself in the adventure with me 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.130
 and with everything following the series otherwise 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.480
 for others I tell you that there 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.950
 still has a strategy episode 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.540
 total coming very soon 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.280
 while waiting anyway I give you the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.569
 link to the first episode and to 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.910
 inside of it if you are 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.470
 interested the link to the nex so for 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.730
 those who have not yet followed the series 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.989
 immerse yourself inside this 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.670
 last without further ado 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.560
 that's a piece of advice that I give you if 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.810
 you are passionate about great strategy 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.250
 but this says all that remains to me to say 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.250
 it's done
