the 4.2 liters in the kind of lines and
the<00:00:25.939> f-150s<00:00:26.939> what<00:00:27.930> happens<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.970> your

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
the f-150s what happens is that your

the f-150s what happens is that your
symptoms<00:00:30.450> include<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.829> runs<00:00:32.070> final<00:00:32.460> idle<00:00:32.790> no

symptoms include it runs final idle no

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.810 
symptoms include it runs final idle no
problems<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:34.380> pie<00:00:34.560> up<00:00:34.680> no<00:00:34.890> codes<00:00:35.340> made<00:00:35.790> a

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
problems you pie up no codes made a

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.860 
problems you pie up no codes made a
misfire<00:00:36.360> code<00:00:36.920> for<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> particular<00:00:38.070> cylinder

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
misfire code for a particular cylinder

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.020 
misfire code for a particular cylinder
but<00:00:39.870> what<00:00:40.470> you'll<00:00:40.680> have<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.310> it<00:00:41.760> will<00:00:41.880> run

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
but what you'll have is it will run

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.210 
but what you'll have is it will run
final<00:00:42.329> idle<00:00:42.810> you'd<00:00:43.110> be<00:00:43.290> driving<00:00:43.500> along<00:00:43.920> and

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
final idle you'd be driving along and

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.660 
final idle you'd be driving along and
then<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.770> you'll<00:00:46.770> start<00:00:46.980> getting<00:00:47.220> a<00:00:47.250> misfire

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
then the you'll start getting a misfire

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.090 
then the you'll start getting a misfire
out<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.660> nowhere<00:00:48.810> on<00:00:49.110> one<00:00:49.560> particular

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
out of nowhere on one particular

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.630 
out of nowhere on one particular
cylinder<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:52.710> reason<00:00:53.070> for<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.370> is

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
cylinder and the reason for it is

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.760 
cylinder and the reason for it is
because<00:00:53.850> these<00:00:54.330> little<00:00:54.540> ports<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.650> is

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
because these little ports this is

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.610 
because these little ports this is
unique<00:00:56.100> designed<00:00:56.580> to<00:00:56.760> 3/8<00:00:57.240> and<00:00:57.390> for<00:00:57.630> 2<00:00:57.900> these

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
unique designed to 3/8 and for 2 these

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.160 
unique designed to 3/8 and for 2 these
are<00:00:58.680> EGR<00:00:59.370> ports<00:00:59.790> like<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.000> port<00:01:00.330> injection<00:01:00.570> for

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
are EGR ports like a port injection for

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.719 
are EGR ports like a port injection for
the<00:01:01.200> EGR<00:01:01.770> system<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.990> what<00:01:03.990> happens<00:01:04.379> is

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
the EGR system and what happens is

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.730 
the EGR system and what happens is
usually<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:06.689> know<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.960> other<00:01:07.080> five<00:01:07.350> get

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
usually you know the other five get

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.429 
usually you know the other five get
plugged<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.970> they're<00:01:09.119> not<00:01:09.210> injected<00:01:09.750> no<00:01:09.900> EGR

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
plugged so they're not injected no EGR

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.410 
plugged so they're not injected no EGR
into<00:01:10.650> these<00:01:10.799> other<00:01:10.950> ones<00:01:11.189> well<00:01:11.970> everything<00:01:12.329> is

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
into these other ones well everything is

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.649 
into these other ones well everything is
coming<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:12.900> from<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.200> EGR<00:01:13.619> valve<00:01:14.280> all<00:01:15.119> that

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
coming in from the EGR valve all that

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.710 
coming in from the EGR valve all that
flow<00:01:15.990> from<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.320> big<00:01:16.620> pipe<00:01:17.420> comes<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
flow from that big pipe comes in the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.670 
flow from that big pipe comes in the
intake<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:20.060> comes<00:01:21.060> out<00:01:21.270> one<00:01:21.960> cylinder<00:01:22.500> and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
intake and comes out one cylinder and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.500 
intake and comes out one cylinder and
what<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> EGR<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:24.120> is<00:01:24.480> to<00:01:25.470> decrease<00:01:26.510> exhaust

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
what the EGR is is to decrease exhaust

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.170 
what the EGR is is to decrease exhaust
gas<00:01:27.750> temps<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.800> we<00:01:28.890> know<00:01:29.010> don't<00:01:29.340> get<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.850> high

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
gas temps so we know don't get that high

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.800 
gas temps so we know don't get that high
temp<00:01:30.540> above<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.050> think<00:01:31.200> that's<00:01:31.320> 2500<00:01:32.810> degrees

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
temp above I think that's 2500 degrees

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.660 
temp above I think that's 2500 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.500> then<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.220> start<00:01:35.460> creating

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
Fahrenheit and then you start creating

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.390 
Fahrenheit and then you start creating
NOx<00:01:36.090> which<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.810> another<00:01:37.050> greenhouse<00:01:37.860> gas<00:01:38.220> law

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
NOx which is another greenhouse gas law

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.210 
NOx which is another greenhouse gas law
a<00:01:38.430> lot<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.990> that's<00:01:40.170> why<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.350> system<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.799> there

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
a lot so that's why the system is there

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.140 
a lot so that's why the system is there
so<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.640> an<00:01:41.760> inert<00:01:42.299> gas<00:01:43.490> and<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.850> going<00:01:45.060> to

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
so it's an inert gas and it's going to

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.740 
so it's an inert gas and it's going to
it<00:01:45.720> will<00:01:45.930> lean<00:01:46.170> out<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.320> mixture<00:01:47.659> to<00:01:48.659> an

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
it will lean out the mixture to an

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.770 
it will lean out the mixture to an
extent<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.620> accounted<00:01:50.190> for<00:01:50.510> when

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
extent and it's accounted for when

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.920 
extent and it's accounted for when
these<00:01:53.380> it's<00:01:53.950> getting<00:01:54.310> it<00:01:54.400> all<00:01:54.520> evenly<00:01:54.909> the<00:01:55.510> PCM

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
these it's getting it all evenly the PCM

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.460 
these it's getting it all evenly the PCM
you<00:01:56.200> know<00:01:56.320> it<00:01:57.420> calibrates<00:01:58.420> for<00:01:58.630> that<00:01:58.810> and<00:01:59.080> it

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
you know it calibrates for that and it

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.100 
you know it calibrates for that and it
compensates<00:02:00.509> but<00:02:01.509> if<00:02:01.600> you're<00:02:01.720> getting<00:02:01.960> all

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
compensates but if you're getting all

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.700 
compensates but if you're getting all
the<00:02:02.259> EGR<00:02:02.619> in<00:02:03.040> one<00:02:03.460> port<00:02:04.259> they<00:02:05.259> will<00:02:05.440> not

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
the EGR in one port they will not

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.350 
the EGR in one port they will not
compensate<00:02:06.400> for<00:02:06.549> that<00:02:06.729> because<00:02:06.880> you're<00:02:07.119> just

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
compensate for that because you're just

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.229 
compensate for that because you're just
putting<00:02:07.869> tons<00:02:08.619> of<00:02:09.009> inert<00:02:09.310> gas<00:02:09.340> into<00:02:10.119> that

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
putting tons of inert gas into that

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.960 
putting tons of inert gas into that
cylinder<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:12.810> you'll<00:02:13.810> have<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.110> misfire

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
cylinder and you'll have the misfire

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.309 
cylinder and you'll have the misfire
okay<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.030> what<00:02:16.239> you<00:02:16.330> can<00:02:16.569> do<00:02:16.750> without<00:02:16.810> pulling

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
okay so what you can do without pulling

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.350 
okay so what you can do without pulling
the<00:02:17.410> upper<00:02:17.680> intake<00:02:17.800> like<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.430> have<00:02:18.700> here

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
the upper intake like I have here

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.690 
the upper intake like I have here
because<00:02:19.989> I'm<00:02:20.140> doing<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.590> upper<00:02:21.010> intake<00:02:21.340> seals

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
because I'm doing a upper intake seals

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.780 
because I'm doing a upper intake seals
it's<00:02:21.940> unrelated<00:02:22.600> repair<00:02:22.959> is<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:24.190> can<00:02:24.400> cut<00:02:24.640> if

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
it's unrelated repair is you can cut if

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.600 
it's unrelated repair is you can cut if
you<00:02:24.940> have<00:02:25.090> this<00:02:25.180> issue<00:02:25.450> where<00:02:25.989> it's<00:02:26.680> getting

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
you have this issue where it's getting

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.229 
you have this issue where it's getting
misfires<00:02:28.209> once<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.780> EGR<00:02:29.140> kicks<00:02:29.620> in<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.310> any

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
checks out what you can do is come over

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.259 
checks out what you can do is come over

here engine off engine on doesn't matter

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.720 
here engine off engine on doesn't matter
pull<00:02:40.900> your<00:02:41.019> vacuum<00:02:41.410> line<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.890> your<00:02:41.980> EGR<00:02:42.459> valve

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
pull your vacuum line to your EGR valve

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.240 
pull your vacuum line to your EGR valve
just<00:02:42.970> leave<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.330> side<00:02:43.800> just<00:02:44.800> like<00:02:45.010> that

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
just leave to the side just like that

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.610 
just leave to the side just like that
then<00:02:46.239> go<00:02:46.420> for<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.660> drive<00:02:46.959> under<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.290> same

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
then go for a drive under the same

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.970 
then go for a drive under the same
conditions<00:02:48.310> that<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.730> was<00:02:48.850> happening<00:02:49.120> before

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
conditions that I was happening before

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.699 
conditions that I was happening before
and<00:02:50.980> test<00:02:51.910> it<00:02:52.150> in<00:02:52.300> all<00:02:52.840> sudden<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:53.380> won't<00:02:53.620> have

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
and test it in all sudden you won't have

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.890 
and test it in all sudden you won't have
misfires<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:55.260> what<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.380> is<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.570> all<00:02:58.570> that

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
misfires and what it is is the all that

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.690 
misfires and what it is is the all that
gas<00:02:59.140> being<00:02:59.410> dumped<00:02:59.769> into<00:02:59.890> that<00:03:00.070> cylinder<00:03:00.430> and

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
gas being dumped into that cylinder and

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.600 
gas being dumped into that cylinder and
since<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:01.750> cut<00:03:02.049> off<00:03:02.230> all<00:03:02.620> those<00:03:02.799> gas<00:03:03.100> is<00:03:03.340> ever

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
since you cut off all those gas is ever

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.319 
since you cut off all those gas is ever

the<00:03:07.329> misfire<00:03:07.750> is<00:03:07.870> gone<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:09.700> if<00:03:09.850> you<00:03:09.970> are<00:03:10.150> having

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
the misfire is gone so if you are having

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.380 
the misfire is gone so if you are having
that<00:03:10.600> problem<00:03:11.079> with<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.290> EGR<00:03:11.739> and<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:13.090> figure

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
that problem with the EGR and you figure

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.920 
that problem with the EGR and you figure
it<00:03:13.480> out<00:03:13.600> as<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.989> EGR<00:03:14.640> what<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:15.760> can<00:03:15.880> do<00:03:16.090> is<00:03:16.299> use

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
it out as the EGR what you can do is use

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.890 
it out as the EGR what you can do is use
a<00:03:17.040> thick<00:03:18.040> coat<00:03:18.340> hanger<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:18.850> get<00:03:19.450> down<00:03:19.660> in<00:03:19.870> here

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
a thick coat hanger and get down in here

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.949 
a thick coat hanger and get down in here
and<00:03:20.440> clean<00:03:20.890> them<00:03:21.040> out<00:03:21.510> something<00:03:22.510> angle<00:03:22.780> like

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
and clean them out something angle like

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.569 
and clean them out something angle like
this<00:03:22.989> then<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:23.650> can<00:03:23.769> get<00:03:23.859> to<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.070> back<00:03:24.280> ones

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
this then you can get to the back ones

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.400 
this then you can get to the back ones
too<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:26.310> start<00:03:27.310> cleaning<00:03:27.519> those<00:03:27.760> ones<00:03:28.030> out

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
too and start cleaning those ones out

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.140 
too and start cleaning those ones out
without<00:03:29.410> Pullen's<00:03:30.010> whole<00:03:30.220> upper<00:03:30.579> intake<00:03:30.910> off

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
without Pullen's whole upper intake off

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.030 
without Pullen's whole upper intake off
all<00:03:31.750> I<00:03:31.870> got<00:03:32.049> to<00:03:32.200> do<00:03:32.290> is<00:03:32.410> pull<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.739> upper

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
all I got to do is pull the upper

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.880 
all I got to do is pull the upper
clamshell<00:03:33.609> off<00:03:33.850> and<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:35.109> can<00:03:35.260> get<00:03:35.440> that<00:03:35.560> taken

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
clamshell off and you can get that taken

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.130 
clamshell off and you can get that taken
care<00:03:35.920> of
