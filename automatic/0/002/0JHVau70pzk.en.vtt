00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
going on we we looked at a lot of books

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.979 
going on we we looked at a lot of books
before<00:00:43.950> he<00:00:44.010> was<00:00:44.129> born<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.640> basically<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.600> speak

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
before he was born and basically I speak

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.479 
before he was born and basically I speak
to<00:00:46.079> him<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.260> English<00:00:46.559> his<00:00:46.860> mother<00:00:47.100> speaks<00:00:47.399> to

him<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.670> Thai<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.870> he<00:00:48.989> can<00:00:49.140> easily

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
him in Thai and so he can easily

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.209 
him in Thai and so he can easily
differentiate<00:00:49.800> them<00:00:50.250> who<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.449> which<00:00:51.629> language
