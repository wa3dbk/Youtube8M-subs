00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 our bikes and kids if I'm alive 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.580
 or dead or anything like that but 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.280
 Well, first of all, ask your forgiveness 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.260
 because time since it did not go up any 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.190
 video not just I'm not going to 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.980
 trick you into saying that I have not had 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.910
 time nor in these strange things 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.080
 just tell you that I did not want to 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.430
 a lot of fact this video wanted it 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.439
 have gone up last week but good 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.119
 I did not upload it for a series of 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.369
 circumstances that sincerely 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.050
 I liked it and well simply because 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.910
 we have reached 12 thousand if you in 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.500
 this moment we have 12 thousand 300 and I think 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.320
 let me take a little bit this more 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.120
 seriously since I think that both of you 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.890
 as I myself deserve it is also 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.180
 upload more more determined videos no video 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.340
 daily because I know that I will not meet 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.020
 being sincere but yes he asked more than 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.670
 followed that I think I think they do 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.200
 so too, nothing at first 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.079
 place that second place tell you that the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.610
 loss that you see in the background is a domain 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.370
 in rope that was with amp and we started 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.870
 to burst you took out vais to see that it's a 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.160
 piece of first round in fact and since 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.930
 you will see at the end what happens that good 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.370
 Usually that happens when it bursts so much 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.469
 but good to the case 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.940
 that the game that is is great as well 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.980
 I hope you enjoy it and we go with 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.769
 the first question they tell us 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.119
 wilfredo wilfredo perdomo tells us 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.440

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.240

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.850
 also for you from valencia hobbies or 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.619
 it gets pretty far but good maybe 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.670
 you have haters so in all the videos to 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.380
 not that you go to my first 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.840
 videos that I think that up there I have a 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.640
 dislike imagine in all the videos 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.369
 pilla dislike I feel the videos there 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.440
 people who do not like n hater itself what 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.500
 what is that typical oil that is there if 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.450
 goes with you to death some there are some 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.850
 found but do not believe me believe me 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.020
 thanks a long time ago months ago 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.929
 I found a comment from an uncle 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.420
 it said they tell me karate from among a cancer 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.340
 and I do not know or I started to see that and 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.020
 As a mother, my uncles, this kid is 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.539
 goes completely and that's what to me 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.090
 those kind of comments to see to 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.289
 someone who spends his energy in wishing you 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.580
 the worst thing makes me quite funny 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.789
 Sincerely, he will cheat us where 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.979
 is honestly the haters I do not think that 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.509
 neither in the first place nor that less deserves 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.590
 because I think they did not put me here with 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.420
 nobody ever made a controversial video 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.650
 getting in with anyone or anything for the 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.350
 style and second if I have some 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.700
 do you want me to say I do not I will 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.770
 be here crying you know or know something 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.080
 that really does not matter to me then 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.820
 come on with the next question tell us 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.230
 why they say is true luis tells us 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.170
 what do they say if you have to paste a 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.120
 campion address or eric valette 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.460
 because you say well here in Galicia 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.920
 where I live the word then the word 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.660
 d with the name Vicente is super common or 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.710
 it is in fact my father Vicente and my 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.110
 grandfather called vicente that is 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:34.150
 super common but the case says after 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.940
 comes vicente vicens 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.160
 there a short one is a little vicente mind 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.070
 it's a s but good comes to me from that 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.630
 vicente better said and then the 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.190
 following if I had to see a 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.200
 colleja someone asks is is it 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.670
 I would hit that serious or eric is worth this 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.280
 Question 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.010
 I think there are moments that we are in 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.930
 skype and it's just like the osc les and the 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.580
 bastard takes the phone and when the 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.350
 game turns the volume up and hits it 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.240
 to the micro- valentes this time we are in 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.709
 call and we are deaf or 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.240
 It thinks you will head explode 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.220
 from the top that puts it that is one thing 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.320
 super beast and there you deserve an alley 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.190
 quite handsome but that's how it goes 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.990
 followed I think he 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.850
 he deserves more more collejas the bastard 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.770
 It has a neck that also goes with it 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.940
 to give him a son once in a while but 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.320
 good after this video sure that 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.850
 comes to say the gringa we're going to 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.620
 to carry seven punches I do not know what 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.420
 always the same bastard but good 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.280
 it's always messing up and such that 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.720
 we got some laughs but I think that 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.700
 more than often I think I would give it to 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.460
 eric but always always with love to 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.380
 see and do not scratch you so good we go 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.890
 the next how did you meet gref 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.600
 this question from a video that I made that 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.030
 you left me is a lot of questions the 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.820
 90% were like I met Gref that is 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.290
 super bestial then good to answer 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.580
 because I think I want to leave her now 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.450
 ditch go because it seems that the 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.210
 ask what else interested you 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.740
 always from life then like 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.720
 I met Andrew after they played 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.650
 something host achievements that a year ago and 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.120
 medium 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.970
 it's going to be two years but good one year and 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.190
 better means of games than a friend of his 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.140
 that was mine and nothing played 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.670
 quite with something you end up with that in 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.740
 that time the water had very little 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.180
 small then I remember having to do 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.980
 mine added skate for sometime that 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.140
 I agreed with him and such while he had 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.360
 been playing xbox to agree is 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.290
 always because I do not know since that no 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.259
 I know why I always remember 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.289
 as a state that plays xbox that tells me 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:22.669
 we played cups I had the xbox one and 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.229
 at that time I did not have any friends 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.210
 mine has not bought me just because I 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.820
 I wanted to climb everything to the top and I do not know 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.740
 liked the theme of the xbox and such 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.210
 then I said nothing, look, it's uncle 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.620
 I have the team continue to establish with 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.030
 the games because you know me and we play 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.310
 in three he starts to play heap with 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.509
 mine was played every day almost always 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.240
 when I go out I played with the bread 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:43.340
 we are always there playing and growing 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.660
 friend and says if he was friend of grows 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.669
 so what happens that you are like I played 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.680
 also something because from time to time what 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:52.400
 they got call then basically 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.560
 we started talking and such and it was like a 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.270
 chain, not at the end you're getting things 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.130
 at the end you are with the call such and 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.570
 you wear well, as with the 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.860
 matter these people well the same to 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.449
 end of call in call then to 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.280
 you end up making a colleague of them 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.539
 he was simply knows him so why 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.250
 a friend of his in common who was going 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:10.009
 getting into the call and finally we 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.270
 we made friends in plan without as much as you 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.590
 You realize that you end when all the 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.970
 days with him talking all day with him 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.289
 and just that, so I do not expect anything 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.479
 that you have liked kids that you can 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.070
 the video but do not ask me questions 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.500
 and how I knew to love or anything 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.790
 because that's massive already so nothing 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.790
 I can write more and there are current
