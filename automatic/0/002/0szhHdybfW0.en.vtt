touches me I put the book aside for a

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.020 
touches me I put the book aside for a
few<00:05:08.550> moments<00:05:09.060> or<00:05:09.210> longer<00:05:09.690> I<00:05:10.640> go<00:05:11.640> from<00:05:11.880> the

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
few moments or longer I go from the

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.330 
few moments or longer I go from the
reading<00:05:12.510> to<00:05:12.900> a<00:05:12.930> little<00:05:13.200> reflection<00:05:13.530> on<00:05:14.070> the

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
reading to a little reflection on the

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.070 
reading to a little reflection on the
importance<00:05:14.880> of<00:05:15.150> what<00:05:15.390> has<00:05:15.600> touched<00:05:15.900> me<00:05:16.370> and<00:05:18.080> so

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
importance of what has touched me and so

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.700 
importance of what has touched me and so
there<00:05:19.380> is<00:05:19.530> the<00:05:19.980> reader<00:05:20.220> the<00:05:21.000> read<00:05:21.240> and<00:05:21.710> then

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
there is the reader the read and then

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.560 
there is the reader the read and then
immediately<00:05:23.130> afterwards<00:05:23.760> there<00:05:24.240> is<00:05:24.270> some

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
immediately afterwards there is some

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.640 
immediately afterwards there is some
reflection<00:05:25.250> what's<00:05:26.250> important<00:05:26.850> about<00:05:26.970> this

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
reflection what's important about this

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.340 
reflection what's important about this
what<00:05:28.650> is<00:05:28.830> the<00:05:28.950> understanding<00:05:29.220> about<00:05:29.940> this

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
what is the understanding about this

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.690 
what is the understanding about this
what<00:05:31.350> is<00:05:31.530> it<00:05:31.560> telling<00:05:32.250> me<00:05:32.580> so<00:05:33.000> to<00:05:33.060> speak<00:05:33.480> and

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
what is it telling me so to speak and

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.330 
what is it telling me so to speak and
from<00:05:35.700> that<00:05:36.060> I<00:05:36.360> might<00:05:36.960> chew<00:05:37.530> over<00:05:37.830> that

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
from that I might chew over that

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.020 
from that I might chew over that
particular<00:05:38.790> theme<00:05:39.330> and<00:05:40.220> it<00:05:41.220> stays<00:05:41.520> with<00:05:41.550> me

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
particular theme and it stays with me

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.390 
particular theme and it stays with me
for<00:05:42.570> a<00:05:43.160> of<00:05:44.160> time<00:05:44.430> and<00:05:45.200> in<00:05:46.200> that<00:05:46.680> respect

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
for a of time and in that respect

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.440 
for a of time and in that respect
what<00:05:47.880> is<00:05:48.470> particular<00:05:49.470> about<00:05:49.560> truth<00:05:50.450> that

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
what is particular about truth that

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.950 
what is particular about truth that
which<00:05:51.660> wakes<00:05:51.960> us<00:05:52.169> up<00:05:52.320> it<00:05:52.890> can<00:05:53.220> be<00:05:53.400> found<00:05:53.730> in<00:05:54.060> the

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
which wakes us up it can be found in the

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
which wakes us up it can be found in the
lines<00:05:55.200> of<00:05:55.530> a<00:05:55.620> single<00:05:56.070> poem<00:05:57.350> the<00:05:58.350> great<00:05:58.620> one

line of Shakespeare to be or not to be

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.020 
line of Shakespeare to be or not to be
that<00:06:03.450> is<00:06:03.810> a<00:06:04.020> question<00:06:04.350> you<00:06:05.340> and<00:06:05.520> I<00:06:05.610> we<00:06:05.850> could

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
that is a question you and I we could

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.290 
that is a question you and I we could
reflect<00:06:06.360> on<00:06:06.720> that<00:06:07.070> meditate<00:06:08.070> on<00:06:08.100> that<00:06:08.340> for

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
reflect on that meditate on that for

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.950 
reflect on that meditate on that for
years<00:06:09.660> and<00:06:10.080> get<00:06:10.560> much<00:06:10.770> out<00:06:11.040> of<00:06:11.190> it

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
years and get much out of it

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.710 
years and get much out of it
so<00:06:12.960> truth<00:06:13.260> is<00:06:13.470> found<00:06:13.740> in<00:06:13.980> fiction<00:06:14.460> it's<00:06:15.450> found
