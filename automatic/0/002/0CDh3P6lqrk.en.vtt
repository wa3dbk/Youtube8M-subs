00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.990 
I am super stoked about this because it
is<00:00:14.429> just<00:00:14.670> non-stop<00:00:14.910> action<00:00:15.780> 24<00:00:16.560> 7<00:00:16.789> inch<00:00:17.789> of

is just non-stop action 24 7 inch of

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.340 
is just non-stop action 24 7 inch of
thickness<00:00:18.150> now<00:00:18.690> one<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.050> things<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.320> I

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
thickness now one of the things that I

thickness now one of the things that I
like<00:00:19.529> about<00:00:19.590> obliteration<00:00:20.369> right<00:00:20.730> off<00:00:20.910> the

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
like about obliteration right off the

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.429 
like about obliteration right off the
right<00:00:21.270> out<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.539> gates<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.199> fact

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
right out of the gates is to the fact

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.429 
right out of the gates is to the fact
that<00:00:22.609> the<00:00:23.609> action<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.180> always<00:00:24.330> around<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
that the action is always around the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.950 
that the action is always around the
bomb<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.800> there's<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.279> central<00:00:26.760> focus<00:00:26.960> around

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
bomb and there's a central focus around

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.800 
bomb and there's a central focus around
the<00:00:28.260> bomb<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> entire<00:00:28.800> time<00:00:29.070> also<00:00:29.480> just<00:00:30.480> how

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
the bomb the entire time also just how

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.690 
the bomb the entire time also just how
what's<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.710> metagame<00:00:31.980> that's<00:00:32.340> involved

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
what's the metagame that's involved

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.920 
what's the metagame that's involved
there<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.000> had<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> chance<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.660> be<00:00:33.750> able<00:00:33.870> to

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
there I had the chance to be able to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.479 
there I had the chance to be able to
play<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.230> game<00:00:34.410> now<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.950> game<00:00:35.130> mode<00:00:35.280> now

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
play this game now this game mode now

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.720 
play this game now this game mode now
for<00:00:35.700> two<00:00:35.910> hours<00:00:36.079> so<00:00:37.079> just<00:00:37.380> gone<00:00:38.250> all<00:00:38.430> out<00:00:38.460> it

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
for two hours so just gone all out it

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.130 
for two hours so just gone all out it
just<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.969> see<00:00:39.120> exactly<00:00:39.149> all<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> different

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
just to see exactly all the different

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.650 
just to see exactly all the different
things<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.469> can<00:00:40.680> do<00:00:40.829> with<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.600> there's<00:00:42.600> a

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
things that you can do with it there's a

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.630 
things that you can do with it there's a
variety<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.350> maybe<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:43.739> still<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
variety of it maybe it's still the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.400 
variety of it maybe it's still the
difference<00:00:44.969> between<00:00:45.090> offense<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.930> defense

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
difference between offense and defense

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.010 
difference between offense and defense
yep<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> idea<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.570> ahead<00:00:48.750> and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
yep you have the idea of going ahead and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.869 
yep you have the idea of going ahead and
defending<00:00:49.469> those<00:00:49.620> different<00:00:50.100> income<00:00:50.399> points

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
defending those different income points

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.150 
defending those different income points
I<00:00:51.480> think<00:00:52.110> one<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.440> things<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.770> started

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
I think one of the things that I started

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.889 
I think one of the things that I started
to<00:00:53.280> notice<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.699> how<00:00:53.879> fast<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.510> whenever<00:00:54.780> you

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
to notice is how fast so whenever you

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.360 
to notice is how fast so whenever you
pick<00:00:55.079> up<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> bomb<00:00:55.530> no<00:00:55.829> matter<00:00:55.980> where<00:00:56.219> you're

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
pick up the bomb no matter where you're

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.220 
pick up the bomb no matter where you're
at<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.699> bomb<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.059> always<00:00:57.390> indicated<00:00:57.930> on<00:00:58.109> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
at the bomb is always indicated on the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.990 
at the bomb is always indicated on the
map<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:59.070> go<00:00:59.190> ahead<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.430> hop<00:00:59.670> into<00:00:59.879> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
map we can go ahead and hop into the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.750 
map we can go ahead and hop into the
game<00:01:00.210> right<00:01:00.359> now<00:01:00.420> as<00:01:01.410> we're<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.430> getting

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
game right now as we're just getting

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.340 
game right now as we're just getting
just<00:01:02.910> kind<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.090> generally<00:01:03.329> discussing<00:01:04.019> what's

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
just kind of generally discussing what's

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.740 
just kind of generally discussing what's
happened<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.489> far<00:01:05.519> especially<00:01:06.000> with<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.600> new

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
happened so far especially with this new

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.870 
happened so far especially with this new
game<00:01:06.990> mode<00:01:07.229> here<00:01:07.400> being<00:01:08.400> known<00:01:08.850> as

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
game mode here being known as

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.210 
game mode here being known as
obliteration<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.920> things<00:01:10.979> that

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
obliteration so one of the things that

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.130 
obliteration so one of the things that
will<00:01:11.430> happen<00:01:11.610> over<00:01:12.180> time<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.020> can

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
will happen over time that you can

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.359 
will happen over time that you can
realize<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.590> but<00:01:13.680> as<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.890> saw<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.280> screen

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
realize it but as you saw on the screen

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.270 
realize it but as you saw on the screen
is<00:01:14.760> right<00:01:15.720> now<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.900> bomb<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.350> not<00:01:16.530> located<00:01:16.799> on

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
is right now the bomb is not located on

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.660 
is right now the bomb is not located on
the<00:01:17.430> map<00:01:17.780> just<00:01:18.780> recently<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.650> bomb<00:01:20.250> was<00:01:20.460> planted

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the map just recently a bomb was planted

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.300 
the map just recently a bomb was planted
and<00:01:21.119> blew<00:01:21.689> up<00:01:21.780> one<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.110> these<00:01:22.200> mcom<00:01:22.680> points<00:01:23.159> and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
and blew up one of these mcom points and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.450 
and blew up one of these mcom points and
then<00:01:23.909> from<00:01:24.180> there<00:01:24.590> there's<00:01:25.590> time<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.189> passes

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
then from there there's time that passes

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.819 
then from there there's time that passes
allowing<00:01:27.240> teams<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.930> kind<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.229> maneuver

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
allowing teams to kind of maneuver

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.429 
allowing teams to kind of maneuver
around<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.340> map<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.790> then<00:01:30.299> from<00:01:30.509> there<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
around the map and then from there the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.969 
around the map and then from there the
bomb<00:01:31.650> will<00:01:31.829> be<00:01:31.979> re<00:01:32.430> randomized<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.860> put<00:01:34.860> back

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
bomb will be re randomized and put back

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.710 
bomb will be re randomized and put back
up<00:01:35.189> onto<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.520> map<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.090> main<00:01:36.210> point<00:01:36.509> to

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
up onto the map but the main point to

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.780 
up onto the map but the main point to

Chinese only have one left so we can
kind<00:03:32.060> of<00:03:32.209> scan<00:03:32.959> around<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.350> map<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:33.770> see

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
kind of scan around the map and see

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.640 
kind of scan around the map and see
exactly<00:03:34.040> where<00:03:34.790> these<00:03:35.540> points<00:03:36.050> are<00:03:36.170> so<00:03:36.470> this

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
exactly where these points are so this

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.020 
exactly where these points are so this

postings are focused that's our focus
and<00:05:28.200> there's<00:05:28.380> been<00:05:28.560> a<00:05:28.590> lot<00:05:28.740> of<00:05:29.100> people<00:05:29.640> they're

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820

asking<00:05:30.600> us<00:05:30.690> a<00:05:30.810> bunch<00:05:30.960> of<00:05:31.020> questions<00:05:31.380> so<00:05:31.590> Corey

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
asking us a bunch of questions so Corey

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.920 
asking us a bunch of questions so Corey
actually<00:05:32.430> took<00:05:32.940> down<00:05:33.120> a<00:05:33.150> couple<00:05:33.480> of<00:05:33.660> them<00:05:33.750> and

actually took down a couple of them and

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.660 
actually took down a couple of them and
I<00:05:34.530> think<00:05:34.650> there's<00:05:34.980> one<00:05:35.040> that<00:05:35.250> we<00:05:35.400> really

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
I think there's one that we really

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:36.950 
I think there's one that we really
should<00:05:35.820> talk<00:05:36.030> about<00:05:36.180> right<00:05:36.510> away<00:05:36.750> and<00:05:36.870> that's

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
should talk about right away and that's

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.560 
should talk about right away and that's
the<00:05:37.140> squad's<00:05:37.440> Corey<00:05:37.920> if<00:05:38.430> you<00:05:38.820> can<00:05:39.180> clear<00:05:39.420> that

the numbers however you want it it ends
up<00:05:57.150> being<00:05:57.390> worse<00:05:57.660> if<00:05:57.990> you<00:05:58.140> have<00:05:58.290> six<00:05:59.100> squads<00:05:59.490> of

up being worse if you have six squads of
five<00:06:00.000> well<00:06:00.510> then<00:06:00.660> there's<00:06:00.810> going<00:06:00.960> to<00:06:01.020> be<00:06:01.050> two

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
five well then there's going to be two

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.200 
five well then there's going to be two
remaining<00:06:01.740> well<00:06:02.010> just<00:06:02.580> think<00:06:02.730> of<00:06:02.790> it<00:06:02.880> at<00:06:03.000> more

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
remaining well just think of it at more

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.850 
remaining well just think of it at more
or<00:06:03.240> less<00:06:03.390> that's<00:06:04.110> that's<00:06:04.440> the<00:06:04.530> way<00:06:04.620> it<00:06:04.710> works

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
or less that's that's the way it works

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.530 
or less that's that's the way it works
mathematically<00:06:05.610> but<00:06:05.760> think<00:06:05.970> about<00:06:06.060> it<00:06:06.360> just

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
mathematically but think about it just

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.680 
mathematically but think about it just
as<00:06:07.080> freedom<00:06:07.470> having<00:06:08.100> the<00:06:08.190> ability<00:06:08.490> to<00:06:09.210> have<00:06:09.390> as

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
as freedom having the ability to have as

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.300 
as freedom having the ability to have as
many<00:06:10.020> squads<00:06:10.440> as<00:06:10.620> you<00:06:10.710> want<00:06:10.890> there's<00:06:11.130> no

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
many squads as you want there's no

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.460 
many squads as you want there's no
limitation<00:06:11.790> on<00:06:12.060> the<00:06:12.120> number<00:06:12.210> of<00:06:12.450> squads<00:06:12.870> it's

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
limitation on the number of squads it's

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.200 
limitation on the number of squads it's
just<00:06:13.770> a<00:06:13.860> limitation<00:06:14.430> on<00:06:14.520> how<00:06:14.580> many<00:06:14.910> players

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
just a limitation on how many players

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.180 
just a limitation on how many players
you<00:06:15.330> can<00:06:15.570> have<00:06:15.750> per<00:06:16.050> squad<00:06:16.470> so<00:06:16.950> with<00:06:17.100> that

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
you can have per squad so with that

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.470 
you can have per squad so with that
being<00:06:17.400> said<00:06:17.520> if<00:06:17.760> you<00:06:17.850> want<00:06:18.030> to<00:06:18.120> evenly

distribute across all the squad's you

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.730 
distribute across all the squad's you
can<00:06:20.550> basically<00:06:20.700> have<00:06:20.880> four<00:06:21.870> squads<00:06:22.200> of<00:06:22.440> five

just reviving their entire team yeah
revived<00:07:10.630> train<00:07:11.020> and<00:07:11.260> then<00:07:11.740> what<00:07:12.040> we're<00:07:12.190> seeing

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 
revived train and then what we're seeing

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.890 
revived train and then what we're seeing
here<00:07:12.520> though<00:07:12.850> is<00:07:13.060> that<00:07:13.090> there<00:07:13.360> is<00:07:13.480> a<00:07:13.690> an

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:13.900 
here though is that there is a an

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.780 
here though is that there is a an
animation<00:07:14.440> process<00:07:14.830> that<00:07:15.250> you<00:07:15.370> have<00:07:15.520> to<00:07:15.670> go

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:15.790 
animation process that you have to go

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.610 
animation process that you have to go
through<00:07:16.060> so<00:07:16.240> it's<00:07:16.360> you<00:07:16.600> have<00:07:16.720> to<00:07:16.840> heat<00:07:17.320> up<00:07:17.350> your

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:17.620 
through so it's you have to heat up your

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.620 
through so it's you have to heat up your
if<00:07:18.070> to<00:07:18.250> get<00:07:18.430> your<00:07:18.580> charge<00:07:18.850> going<00:07:19.240> and<00:07:19.390> then<00:07:19.510> you

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:19.630 
if to get your charge going and then you

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.720 
if to get your charge going and then you
have<00:07:19.720> to<00:07:19.870> get<00:07:20.410> blind<00:07:20.650> your<00:07:20.800> teammate<00:07:21.190> do<00:07:21.550> the

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:21.730 
have to get blind your teammate do the

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.340 
have to get blind your teammate do the
charge<00:07:22.000> against<00:07:22.390> oh<00:07:22.570> it's<00:07:22.690> that<00:07:22.900> amount<00:07:23.200> of

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:23.350 
charge against oh it's that amount of

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.260 
charge against oh it's that amount of
time<00:07:23.560> to<00:07:24.190> get<00:07:24.310> each<00:07:24.460> one<00:07:24.490> of<00:07:24.700> those<00:07:24.820> charges

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:25.270 
time to get each one of those charges

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.000 
time to get each one of those charges
and<00:07:25.660> that's<00:07:25.780> where<00:07:25.960> again<00:07:26.470> I<00:07:26.500> think<00:07:26.800> that's

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.010 
and that's where again I think that's

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.980 
and that's where again I think that's
where<00:07:27.100> kind<00:07:27.340> of<00:07:27.430> spreads<00:07:28.300> out<00:07:28.510> the<00:07:28.660> revived

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:28.990 
where kind of spreads out the revived

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.860
