00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
to cover up or lap over the raw edge of

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.850 
to cover up or lap over the raw edge of
this<00:02:11.940> fabric<00:02:12.450> that's<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.260> first<00:02:13.530> thing<00:02:13.709> we're

to do after that's done is this is going

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.140 
to do after that's done is this is going
to<00:02:18.900> be<00:02:19.050> completely<00:02:19.620> ironed<00:02:19.950> down<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:20.910> all

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
to be completely ironed down so that all

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.479 
to be completely ironed down so that all
of<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.450> raw<00:02:21.630> edges<00:02:21.930> are<00:02:22.230> encased<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.310> the

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
of the raw edges are encased this is the

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.390 
of the raw edges are encased this is the
right<00:02:23.700> side<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.239> fabric<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:25.100> this<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.280> the

wrong side of the fabric so now I'm

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.890 
wrong side of the fabric so now I'm
going<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.570> go<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.930> iron<00:02:32.030> okay<00:02:33.030> once<00:02:33.630> you

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
going to come to the iron and we're

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.259

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
extends is because we're going to be

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.509 
extends is because we're going to be
covering<00:02:51.000> up<00:02:51.329> this<00:02:51.510> raw<00:02:51.780> edge<00:02:52.049> right<00:02:52.380> here<00:02:52.650> so

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
covering up this raw edge right here so

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.509 
covering up this raw edge right here so
we're<00:02:53.790> going<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.680> take<00:02:55.680> this<00:02:55.920> edge<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.430> the

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
we're going to take this edge of the

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.030 
we're going to take this edge of the
fabric<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.180> cover<00:02:57.450> up<00:02:57.690> this<00:02:58.019> raw<00:02:58.320> edge<00:02:58.680> and

this way all of the raw edges are going

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.410 
this way all of the raw edges are going
to<00:03:30.840> be<00:03:30.900> encased<00:03:31.470> this<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.459> what<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.909> inside<00:03:33.390> of

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
away from this folded edge I'm going to

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.420 
away from this folded edge I'm going to
back<00:04:13.859> stitch<00:04:16.699> and<00:04:17.900> I'm<00:04:18.900> going<00:04:19.109> to<00:04:19.139> continue

and I'm gonna back stitch at the edge

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.910 
and I'm gonna back stitch at the edge
and<00:04:36.790> this<00:04:37.790> is<00:04:37.970> what<00:04:38.240> my<00:04:39.140> finished<00:04:39.530> seam<00:04:39.710> looks

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
and this is what my finished seam looks

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.620 
and this is what my finished seam looks
like<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.660> this<00:04:41.660> is<00:04:41.810> a<00:04:41.840> flat<00:04:42.110> felled<00:04:42.350> seam
