00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 i 

00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.130
 [Music] 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.439
 the land of the return in alfacar in 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.090
 granada there is jesus that we 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.820
 will explain why we are there to 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.830
 this hour of the afternoon jesus who was going to 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.230
 say that mass will become 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.030
 one of the most important breads and 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.770
 main plans of all Andalusia that 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.200
 it's the bread of alfacar and the bread of vietnam 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.210
 we are in the bakers cooperative 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.780
 of these two regions of these two 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.850
 municipalities because josé ruiz is one of 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.369
 the bus stops master baker besides 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.430
 because we are here we are here because 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.800
 we are doing the pieces the dams 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.080
 the plans to alpha well threads loaves 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.030
 and bars we are preparing a bread but 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.980
 is that in these two days 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.500
 they are also almost all 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.290
 bakers of these two locations are 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.870
 gathered because they want to get the 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.400
 Alfacar and Víznar bread is equally 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.800
 good anywhere that is 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.090
 buy 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.040
 in the idea is that we have the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.180
 bread stalls such faccaro are 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.890
 alfacar and víznar 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.630
 the same bread you want that you meet 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.060
 the ladies that means you have to 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.860
 to be a very homogenous bread the bread that gives 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.110
 the same where you buy 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.950
 just as good is a quality mark 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.950
 a seal of quality 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.520
 vindicating because they are here the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.830
 best alfacar and víznar bakers 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.940
 truth and that here we are all 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.310
 those who belong to the guild of 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.229
 alfacar and víznar bakers and we are 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.490
 elaborating this exquisite bread that I 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.170
 our days has earned our points 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.390
 of selling good alfacar bread more than 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.250
 professionals are artists like you say 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.680
 modest I 'm going to approach some of 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.270
 them because I want to see what they are 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.770
 doing as quickly as they are 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.830
 doing to see to see what the trick is 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.460
 the trick is to pamper the dough to finish 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.619
 the dough knows how to give their time escaping from 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.970
 this to do so rap so quickly 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:53.180
 something so apparently simple 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.180
 very sure not 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.780
 to any of you who do not have 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.340
 usually the possibility of having 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.070
 treated the mass of the host of the 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.380
 formed then that would be the bars the 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.380
 normal bars with the shape in the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.870
 characteristic of alfacar bread 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.890
 in the center a little wider and its two 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:21.090
 tits in the end that seems like it's 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.680
 of a finite bread but then this volume 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.700
 its fermentation a natural fermentation 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.740
 a prolonged fermentation so that 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.930
 win in flavors so that we win in 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.930
 conservation so that we gain in volume 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.750
 this would be a loop thread 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.000
 let's see here and now here 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.640
 we see here the differences of loaves that 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.380
 we're going to teach after completion 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.910
 for example what is the most complicated of 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.710
 make the rock that has here a part 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.140
 more finite and someone may think that he has 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.990
 come out more the way we call the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.680
 mother-in-law we had for the mother-in-law so that 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.680
 do not protest 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:11.010
 because man has always eaten 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:13.520
 large part and the gravels and said that 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.520
 you have 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.099
 nothing that we are ready that the word 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.560
 it's okay 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.480
 regardless of its gas this for example is 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.390
 more more finite the government not because 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.670
 is fourth is in the middle of the 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.920
 bar everything just as good what is the 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.470
 Bread secret alfacar first 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.860
 the hands of the bakers and the second 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.860
 Water 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:44.040
 the love that we put to him now 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.750
 do things in any way this 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.989
 I'm going to stay here because I want what 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.910
 finish and then I'll show you what's not 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.510
 I know if I'm going to teach it to you rather what 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.630
 I'm going to try 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.170
 Well, I'll leave it there then he taught you how 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:04.890
 is the alfacar bread today modest as 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:07.230
 how am I suffering today here but you 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:12.140
 are you going to get there that way 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:15.540
 Amazing smell of freshly baked bread arrives here 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:19.049
 we are in alfacar in alfacar in 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:23.099
 one of the best stone ovens 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:25.770
 tell me something Miguel how it is known that a 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:28.860
 what temperature does it say you say between 100 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.169
 105 degrees of temperature as is which 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.199
 it is the first symptom that one says this 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.689
 it is a good bread to leave when leaving its scent 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.710
 its texture 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:42.090
 is when the group 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.830
 share has done this is charity 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.300
 by that sounds to see how it sounds 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.300
 I love to give you a little 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:58.420
 come eat what we will do incredible is that the 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.420
 sound is 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:12.459
 and here in andalucía direct I had the 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:16.659
 lucky to see that bread that I want besides 

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:20.559
 that you are the one who keeps telling me 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:22.659
 see see we have color aroma softness 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:24.849
 before I said good first thing the 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:27.459
 temperature and how it looks but 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.959
 as it is known that it is a good bread for the 

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:31.509
 cream color of the friend that the 

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:35.619
 soft acid kneading we have not punished 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:37.990
 the paste the volume the texture the skin 

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:40.029
 bark all that does is the sum 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.339
 definitive of a quality plan is a 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:43.209
 alfacar bread but good I can not no 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:46.779
 I can hold more 

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:48.350
 this cuts me a little bit what you have to 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:50.729
 prove it 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:54.669
 [Music] 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:57.380
 for the classmates let's try it uff 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:59.060
 see if it gets undone 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.190
 the magnificent skill you have and is 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.630
 one of the characteristics of the fund 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.240
 you mari 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.189
