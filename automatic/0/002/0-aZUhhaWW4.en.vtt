00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.560
 carretillo this as they are justice 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.420
 or Celtic and well he welcomes you to 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.920
 a very very fast way is a very review 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.810
 fast really is not very very 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.400
 complicated because of that is that good 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.140
 it is just so to warn them not 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.630
 from this way he mentioned that it is the one of may 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.339
 indicators but already that as well as the 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.779
 version that is in pc that we find 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:23.150
 they are going to see what I mean they are not already 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.650
 more prettier more detailed all a 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.599
 little bit more interface and paste 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.210
 So now you know English 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.829
 subtraction here below is a simple js to the 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.899
 final I tell you where to download it because 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.980
 It is good we will see once 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.930
 check there is the download link 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.630
 down here ok and I'm also using the 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.180
 version of the block launcher pro 1.7 point 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.800
 8 that since we already switched to point 8 and 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.990
 down here is the limit that I do not raise the 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.290
 video because I do not want to be one of the 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.000
 first to upload it because then this one 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.740
 I would not get a little more 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.870
 visits and perhaps measure you're not crazy 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.250
 way or not, because what happens is 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.230
 that if I have many visits it's going to be 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.910
 obviously more is more viral more 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.680
 known and maybe they strike me 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.300
 can assume the suitors of all 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.920
 modes I already had them my page 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.720
 facebook you are interested in having it clone 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.970
 chip what you apply and months you from minecraft 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.030
 as for pirate minecraft before 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.890
 than any other place 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.150
 the burrow that's down here I'm 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.670
 posting things with this 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.140
 constantly not every one that comes out when 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.820
 come out he's already going to have him there in 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.590
 a publication or in a photo that is what 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.570
 that I'm doing block 8 and it produces 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.190
 his wine to a photo in an album there are 15 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.869
 blog with cyprus my facebook page 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.060
 it really is very complicated to find it 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.070
 de cali form link that I leave you 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.479
 low is the photo that nothing else is thing 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.759
 that in the description of that photo 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.350
 Well, you can see the link and simple canons 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.899
 and even very easy view I think that no 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.060
 there is lose do not lie good the 1.7 point 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.289
 8 which is also here below and the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.280
 texture if you are interested is the 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.530
 farc if it is also here in the 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.179
 description between only carnal I tell you 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.619
 that is a little weird this because good 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.970
 there are two download links of any 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.399
 I'm already putting it and with two 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.110
 red boxes there is one that says hai or 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.880
 is that it is the chingones and they 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.149
 Lowe says it's slow a little bit 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.240
 more more than half baked half-canvas 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.369
 egg that more than well that does not run so 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.679
 cool but it depends a lot on 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.690
 device to me with it works well 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.340
 works wolf that the one that I have 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.230
 installed more inactivated as you can see 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.150
 I have two activated that is the hai that is 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.380
 the running because more investments by 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.810
 a little more 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.360
 in more agile devices and lalo I 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.720
 I have low because with height I was seen 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.630
 I do not know how he grew me very big he and 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.460
 what should it look like 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.200
 the picture or they were to see what then 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.080
 good for children is those who have a 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.970
 historical ni to b1 or something like me 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.260
 I recommend the loua that love carla very 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.840
 very well as you can see here is the 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.550
 interface this this looked giant today 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.110
 with the street it did not even look good 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.720
 so then I recommend the 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.700
 will depend a lot on your version with 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.650
 Juarense to activate one of the 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.240
 options restart the ruble ntx the broker 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.950
 because if you are not going to give them a little 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.330
 problems then well there is there 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.830
 are the channel names as they can 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.290
 see is updated and they also appear 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.360
 wolves the villagers look like the 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.010
 mushroom cows and everything else not then 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.300
 well it's not very complicated to use them 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.130
 I say simply was to make him the 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.780
 gravel to let him know that already 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.580
 it came out and then nothing if you liked the video 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.500

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.210
 subscribe and come share the channel 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.620

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.450
 you want to go hand in hand a lot with 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.010
 that and we are any doubt that you have 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.810
