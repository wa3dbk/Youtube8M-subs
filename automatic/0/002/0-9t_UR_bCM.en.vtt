those for the higher level gameplay in
our<00:02:10.070> game<00:02:10.540> now<00:02:11.540> remember<00:02:12.170> that<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.680> vehicles

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
our game now remember that the vehicles

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.400 
our game now remember that the vehicles
will<00:02:13.459> change<00:02:13.850> probably<00:02:14.510> as<00:02:14.660> we<00:02:14.870> get<00:02:15.020> to<00:02:15.170> launch

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
will change probably as we get to launch

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.170 
will change probably as we get to launch
so<00:02:16.040> what<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.340> see<00:02:16.520> here<00:02:16.550> are<00:02:16.970> just

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
so what you see here are just

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.610 
so what you see here are just
preliminary<00:02:17.390> versions<00:02:18.170> of<00:02:18.230> what<00:02:18.380> we're<00:02:18.530> going

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
preliminary versions of what we're going

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.620 
preliminary versions of what we're going
to<00:02:18.739> have<00:02:18.770> but<00:02:19.580> when<00:02:19.820> you<00:02:19.970> get<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.420> game

to have but when you get to the game

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.150 
to have but when you get to the game
when<00:02:20.840> we<00:02:20.870> launched<00:02:21.200> low<00:02:21.500> probably<00:02:21.890> even

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
when we launched low probably even

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.310 
when we launched low probably even
better<00:02:22.550> looking<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.330> cooler<00:02:23.870> than<00:02:24.080> what<00:02:24.230> you
