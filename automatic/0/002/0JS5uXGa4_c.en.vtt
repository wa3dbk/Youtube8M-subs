that<00:01:59.040> water<00:01:59.369> goes<00:02:00.030> into<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.630> toilet<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.200> flush

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
that water goes into the toilet to flush

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.740 
that water goes into the toilet to flush
the<00:02:01.560> toilet<00:02:01.920> because<00:02:02.100> we<00:02:02.939> think<00:02:03.180> it's<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.450> crime

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
the toilet because we think it's a crime

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.410 
the toilet because we think it's a crime
to<00:02:03.810> use<00:02:04.170> drinking<00:02:04.829> quality<00:02:05.250> water<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.790> flush

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
to use drinking quality water to flush

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.389 
to use drinking quality water to flush
the<00:02:06.600> toilet<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.140> another<00:02:07.799> part<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.369> goes

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the toilet and another part of it goes

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.969 
the toilet and another part of it goes
to<00:02:08.759> water<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.179> garden<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.569> also<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
to water the garden and also to the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.690 
to water the garden and also to the
water

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
water

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.449 
water
we<00:02:12.569> had<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.810> problem<00:02:13.200> with<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.740> water<00:02:13.950> filter

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
we had a problem with the water filter

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.100 
we had a problem with the water filter
though<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.910> here's<00:02:15.750> what<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.140> was<00:02:16.640> when<00:02:17.640> we

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
though and here's what it was when we

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.800 
though and here's what it was when we
were<00:02:19.110> using<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.310> grey<00:02:20.459> water<00:02:20.760> anybody<00:02:21.690> who

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
were using the grey water anybody who

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.240 
were using the grey water anybody who
had<00:02:22.020> experience<00:02:22.500> with<00:02:22.590> grey<00:02:22.770> water<00:02:23.010> knows

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
had experience with grey water knows

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.180 
had experience with grey water knows
that<00:02:23.520> gray<00:02:23.670> water<00:02:23.970> smells<00:02:24.870> bad<00:02:25.140> it's<00:02:25.709> got<00:02:25.980> that

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
that gray water smells bad it's got that

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.300 
that gray water smells bad it's got that
sort<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.270> fermented<00:02:27.930> soap<00:02:28.319> smell<00:02:28.770> along<00:02:29.130> with

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
sort of fermented soap smell along with

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.850 
sort of fermented soap smell along with
the<00:02:29.430> sort<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.670> rotten<00:02:30.090> perfumey<00:02:30.750> smell<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.319> it

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
the sort of rotten perfumey smell and it

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.890 
the sort of rotten perfumey smell and it
really<00:02:32.130> does<00:02:32.310> smell<00:02:32.489> bad<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:33.090> it's<00:02:33.660> filled

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
really does smell bad and it's filled

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.260 
really does smell bad and it's filled
with<00:02:34.110> bacteria<00:02:34.319> so<00:02:35.040> we<00:02:35.670> were<00:02:35.819> running<00:02:36.000> it

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
with bacteria so we were running it

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.559 
with bacteria so we were running it
through<00:02:36.569> this<00:02:37.430> filter<00:02:38.430> here<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.420> water

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
through this filter here but the water

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.150 
through this filter here but the water
that<00:02:39.810> we<00:02:40.019> were<00:02:40.140> getting<00:02:40.290> out<00:02:40.560> even<00:02:40.950> though<00:02:41.010> it

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
that we were getting out even though it

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.830 
that we were getting out even though it
looked<00:02:41.519> clean<00:02:42.230> still<00:02:43.230> had<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.800> soapy

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
looked clean still had that soapy

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.449 
looked clean still had that soapy
fermented<00:02:45.840> smell<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.530> sort<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:46.769> sour<00:02:47.069> acrid

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
fermented smell that sort of sour acrid

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.220 
fermented smell that sort of sour acrid
smell<00:02:47.940> like<00:02:48.390> when<00:02:48.569> you<00:02:48.660> leave<00:02:48.810> your<00:02:48.959> clothes

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
smell like when you leave your clothes

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.330 
smell like when you leave your clothes
in<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.760> washing<00:02:50.760> machine<00:02:51.000> too<00:02:51.480> long<00:02:51.720> so<00:02:52.440> we

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
in the washing machine too long so we

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.729 
in the washing machine too long so we
figured<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.819> was<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.970> failure<00:02:54.330> but<00:02:55.110> now<00:02:55.350> we've

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
figured it was a failure but now we've

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.430 
figured it was a failure but now we've
learned<00:02:56.010> something<00:02:56.400> more<00:02:57.209> interesting<00:02:57.780> if<00:02:58.140> we

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
learned something more interesting if we

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.220 
learned something more interesting if we
take<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.830> same<00:02:58.890> water<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.790> put<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:00.959> our

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
take that same water and put it in our

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.670 
take that same water and put it in our
biogas<00:03:02.220> digester<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.120> let<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.260> anaerobic

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
biogas digester and let the anaerobic

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.539 
biogas digester and let the anaerobic
bacteria<00:03:05.489> have<00:03:05.760> at<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.180> they<00:03:06.959> create<00:03:10.549> they

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
bacteria have at it they create they

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:17.390 
bacteria have at it they create they
create<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:14.030> water<00:03:15.030> as<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.019> can<00:03:16.049> see<00:03:16.440> here<00:03:16.829> that

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
create a water as you can see here that

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.500 
create a water as you can see here that
is<00:03:17.549> a<00:03:17.579> rich<00:03:17.850> fertilizer<00:03:18.359> and<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:18.870> smells<00:03:19.380> like

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
is a rich fertilizer and it smells like

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.180 
is a rich fertilizer and it smells like
like<00:03:21.510> Jason<00:03:21.989> it<00:03:22.079> smells<00:03:22.410> like<00:03:22.620> horse<00:03:22.920> dung

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
like Jason it smells like horse dung

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.340 
like Jason it smells like horse dung
like<00:03:23.880> horse<00:03:24.120> manure<00:03:24.480> because<00:03:24.720> that's<00:03:24.930> where

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
like horse manure because that's where

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.599 
like horse manure because that's where
the<00:03:25.440> bacteria<00:03:25.890> come<00:03:26.130> from

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
the bacteria come from

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.759 
the bacteria come from
it<00:03:26.970> started<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.540> system<00:03:27.959> now<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.410> must<00:03:28.590> say

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
it started the system now you must say

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.319 
it started the system now you must say
this<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:29.130> certainly<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.489> dirtiest<00:03:29.970> looking

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
this is certainly the dirtiest looking

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.050 
this is certainly the dirtiest looking
water<00:03:30.570> that<00:03:31.200> you've<00:03:31.350> ever<00:03:31.590> seen<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.310> you

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
water that you've ever seen and you

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.550 
water that you've ever seen and you
would<00:03:33.209> be<00:03:33.359> right<00:03:33.510> it's<00:03:33.810> pretty<00:03:34.049> dirty<00:03:34.350> it

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
would be right it's pretty dirty it

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.009 
would be right it's pretty dirty it
certainly<00:03:34.890> wouldn't<00:03:35.220> want<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.720> fall<00:03:36.720> into

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
certainly wouldn't want to fall into

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.650 
certainly wouldn't want to fall into
that<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.560> really<00:03:38.310> does<00:03:38.579> reek<00:03:38.850> but<00:03:39.120> if<00:03:39.239> we<00:03:39.390> take

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
that it really does reek but if we take

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.690 
that it really does reek but if we take
this<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:41.150> put<00:03:42.150> this<00:03:42.650> smelly<00:03:43.650> dirty<00:03:44.400> brown

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
this and put this smelly dirty brown

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.580 
this and put this smelly dirty brown
water<00:03:45.440> into<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.530> smudge<00:03:46.799> deck<00:03:47.100> system<00:03:50.030> and

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
water into the smudge deck system and

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.130 
water into the smudge deck system and
run<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.829> out<00:03:54.019> ironically<00:03:55.019> what<00:03:55.350> we<00:03:55.500> get<00:03:57.140> is

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
run it out ironically what we get is

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.229 
run it out ironically what we get is
clean<00:03:58.530> water<00:03:58.769> it<00:03:59.519> has<00:03:59.700> no<00:04:00.660> smell<00:04:01.730> so<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.850> irony

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
clean water it has no smell so the irony

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.910 
clean water it has no smell so the irony
of<00:04:03.359> taking<00:04:03.840> what<00:04:03.989> looked<00:04:04.319> like<00:04:04.440> clean<00:04:04.890> water

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
of taking what looked like clean water

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.979 
of taking what looked like clean water
but<00:04:05.370> had<00:04:05.519> that<00:04:05.700> soapy<00:04:06.180> smell<00:04:06.480> from<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.720> gray

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
but had that soapy smell from the gray

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.009 
but had that soapy smell from the gray
water<00:04:07.290> and<00:04:07.620> running<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:08.639> through<00:04:08.850> the<00:04:09.389> biogas

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
water and running it through the biogas

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.770 
water and running it through the biogas
digester<00:04:10.859> and<00:04:10.980> then<00:04:11.609> letting<00:04:12.150> it<00:04:12.359> turn<00:04:12.600> into

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
digester and then letting it turn into

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.240 
digester and then letting it turn into
this<00:04:13.549> microbe<00:04:14.579> rich<00:04:14.970> very<00:04:15.930> Brown<00:04:16.350> very<00:04:16.889> dirty

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
this microbe rich very Brown very dirty

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.620 
this microbe rich very Brown very dirty
water<00:04:17.519> and<00:04:17.669> running<00:04:18.030> that<00:04:18.269> through<00:04:18.539> the

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
water and running that through the

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.060 
water and running that through the
schmutz<00:04:18.930> tech<00:04:19.200> system<00:04:19.760> actually<00:04:20.760> gives<00:04:21.000> us

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
schmutz tech system actually gives us

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.550 
schmutz tech system actually gives us
a<00:04:22.960> superior<00:04:23.960> quality<00:04:24.530> water<00:04:24.730> with<00:04:25.730> no<00:04:26.000> smell

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
a superior quality water with no smell

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.170 
a superior quality water with no smell
so<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.590> interesting<00:04:27.920> thing<00:04:28.160> is<00:04:28.580> that<00:04:28.610> if<00:04:28.970> you

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
so the interesting thing is that if you

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.570 
so the interesting thing is that if you
use<00:04:29.320> anaerobic<00:04:30.320> bacterias<00:04:31.070> your<00:04:31.250> friend

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
use anaerobic bacterias your friend

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.400 
use anaerobic bacterias your friend
apparently<00:04:32.210> what<00:04:32.540> it's<00:04:32.660> doing<00:04:32.990> is<00:04:33.110> breaking

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
apparently what it's doing is breaking

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.530 
apparently what it's doing is breaking
down<00:04:33.680> some<00:04:34.400> of<00:04:34.490> these<00:04:34.580> other<00:04:34.790> compounds<00:04:35.480> that

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
down some of these other compounds that

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.540 
down some of these other compounds that
are<00:04:35.600> in<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.900> gray<00:04:36.080> water<00:04:36.380> further<00:04:37.280> breaking

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
are in the gray water further breaking

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.070 
are in the gray water further breaking
down<00:04:37.880> and<00:04:38.060> then<00:04:38.150> what<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.330> schmutz<00:04:38.630> deck

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
down and then what the schmutz deck

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.710 
down and then what the schmutz deck
system<00:04:39.440> does<00:04:39.860> you<00:04:40.700> can<00:04:40.880> see<00:04:40.910> it's<00:04:41.180> clear<00:04:41.480> water

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
system does you can see it's clear water

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.870 
system does you can see it's clear water
coming<00:04:42.170> out<00:04:42.290> but<00:04:42.890> the<00:04:43.040> schmutz<00:04:43.340> deck<00:04:43.640> system

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
coming out but the schmutz deck system

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.420 
coming out but the schmutz deck system
does<00:04:44.300> is<00:04:44.630> it<00:04:44.810> actually<00:04:44.990> traps<00:04:45.680> all<00:04:45.950> that<00:04:46.190> and

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
does is it actually traps all that and

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.090 
does is it actually traps all that and
then<00:04:46.550> eats<00:04:46.850> all<00:04:47.360> of<00:04:47.690> those<00:04:47.810> bad<00:04:48.140> bacteria<00:04:48.440> and

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
then eats all of those bad bacteria and

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.820 
then eats all of those bad bacteria and
even<00:04:49.610> eliminates<00:04:50.330> that<00:04:50.420> smell<00:04:50.960> so<00:04:51.500> it's<00:04:51.620> quite

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
even eliminates that smell so it's quite

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.440 
even eliminates that smell so it's quite
a<00:04:51.890> finding<00:04:52.430> for<00:04:52.610> us<00:04:52.700> let's<00:04:52.910> just<00:04:52.940> take<00:04:53.150> a<00:04:53.180> look

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
a finding for us let's just take a look

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.900 
a finding for us let's just take a look
for<00:04:53.600> a<00:04:53.690> second<00:04:54.080> and<00:04:54.230> looks<00:04:54.470> inside<00:04:54.920> the<00:04:55.640> switch

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
for a second and looks inside the switch

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.700 
for a second and looks inside the switch
deck<00:04:56.210> system<00:04:59.080> here<00:05:00.080> we<00:05:00.170> just<00:05:00.260> have<00:05:00.440> a<00:05:00.470> little

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
deck system here we just have a little

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.260 
deck system here we just have a little
screen<00:05:01.100> to<00:05:01.250> show<00:05:01.400> you<00:05:01.490> just<00:05:01.640> how<00:05:01.730> dirty<00:05:02.060> the

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
screen to show you just how dirty the

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.850 
screen to show you just how dirty the
water<00:05:02.420> going<00:05:02.900> in<00:05:03.050> really<00:05:03.440> is<00:05:05.320> and<00:05:06.320> in<00:05:06.470> here

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
water going in really is and in here

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.130 
water going in really is and in here
there<00:05:07.730> it<00:05:07.910> is<00:05:08.030> this<00:05:08.240> is<00:05:08.300> the<00:05:08.420> filthy<00:05:08.900> water

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
there it is this is the filthy water

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.200 
there it is this is the filthy water
that<00:05:09.860> is<00:05:10.040> being<00:05:10.310> fertilized<00:05:10.730> there's<00:05:11.000> some

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
that is being fertilized there's some

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.300 
that is being fertilized there's some
tiles<00:05:11.660> here<00:05:11.960> just<00:05:12.170> to<00:05:12.290> keep<00:05:12.470> the<00:05:12.800> water<00:05:13.070> that's

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
tiles here just to keep the water that's

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.700 
tiles here just to keep the water that's
going<00:05:13.400> in<00:05:13.790> from<00:05:13.970> disturbing<00:05:14.600> the<00:05:15.020> bacteria

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
going in from disturbing the bacteria

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.910

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
live at the top of this and the rest is

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.110 
live at the top of this and the rest is
just<00:05:20.480> sand<00:05:20.920> 75<00:05:21.920> centimeters<00:05:22.520> of<00:05:22.640> sand<00:05:22.880> that's

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
just sand 75 centimeters of sand that's

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.820 
just sand 75 centimeters of sand that's
all<00:05:23.300> it<00:05:23.450> is<00:05:23.480> and<00:05:23.750> then<00:05:24.080> there's<00:05:24.230> some<00:05:24.380> gravel

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
all it is and then there's some gravel

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.860 
all it is and then there's some gravel
down<00:05:24.980> here<00:05:25.310> and<00:05:25.430> some<00:05:25.580> larger<00:05:25.970> stones<00:05:26.270> and<00:05:26.510> a

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
down here and some larger stones and a

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.380 
down here and some larger stones and a
tube<00:05:27.110> that's<00:05:27.440> all<00:05:27.680> it<00:05:27.800> is<00:05:27.860> sand<00:05:28.400> and<00:05:28.610> a<00:05:29.000> -<00:05:29.210> but

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
tube that's all it is sand and a - but

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.230 
tube that's all it is sand and a - but
look<00:05:29.570> at<00:05:29.720> what<00:05:29.870> you<00:05:29.900> get<00:05:30.170> out<00:05:31.030> you<00:05:32.030> get<00:05:32.210> out

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
look at what you get out you get out

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:39.220 
look at what you get out you get out
clean<00:05:32.780> water<00:05:35.890> with<00:05:36.890> no<00:05:37.160> smell<00:05:37.900> now<00:05:38.900> we

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
clean water with no smell now we

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.440 
clean water with no smell now we
wouldn't<00:05:39.470> recommend<00:05:39.770> drinking<00:05:40.460> this<00:05:40.610> we're

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
wouldn't recommend drinking this we're

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.180 
wouldn't recommend drinking this we're
not<00:05:41.600> going<00:05:41.810> to<00:05:41.870> recommend<00:05:42.200> bathing<00:05:42.920> in<00:05:43.040> this

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
not going to recommend bathing in this

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.490 
not going to recommend bathing in this
but<00:05:43.970> certainly<00:05:44.450> it<00:05:44.570> could<00:05:44.690> be<00:05:44.810> used<00:05:45.020> to<00:05:45.170> clean

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
but certainly it could be used to clean

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.860 
but certainly it could be used to clean
floors<00:05:45.920> and<00:05:46.250> when<00:05:46.910> we<00:05:47.030> do<00:05:47.210> a<00:05:47.240> bacterial

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
floors and when we do a bacterial

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.330 
floors and when we do a bacterial
analysis<00:05:48.410> we<00:05:48.530> just<00:05:48.680> wanted<00:05:48.890> the<00:05:48.950> equipment

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
analysis we just wanted the equipment

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.070 
analysis we just wanted the equipment
you<00:05:49.400> have<00:05:49.490> to<00:05:49.580> do<00:05:49.700> it<00:05:49.850> then<00:05:50.330> we'll<00:05:50.510> see<00:05:50.720> what

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
you have to do it then we'll see what

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.050 
you have to do it then we'll see what
other<00:05:51.200> uses<00:05:51.650> this<00:05:51.830> water<00:05:52.100> can<00:05:52.400> be<00:05:52.520> taken<00:05:52.550> for

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
other uses this water can be taken for

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.930 
other uses this water can be taken for
but<00:05:53.600> this<00:05:53.750> just<00:05:54.050> shows<00:05:54.230> the<00:05:54.590> system<00:05:55.370> preferred

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
but this just shows the system preferred

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.090 
but this just shows the system preferred
now<00:05:56.180> is<00:05:56.510> grey<00:05:57.170> water<00:05:57.470> -<00:05:58.190> biogas<00:05:58.820> digester

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
now is grey water - biogas digester

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.010 
now is grey water - biogas digester
biogas<00:06:01.100> digester<00:06:01.760> effluent<00:06:02.390> which<00:06:02.750> can<00:06:02.960> be

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
biogas digester effluent which can be

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.550 
biogas digester effluent which can be
used<00:06:03.170> as<00:06:03.290> a<00:06:03.320> fertilizer<00:06:03.620> and<00:06:04.280> then<00:06:05.030> into<00:06:05.930> the

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
used as a fertilizer and then into the

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.980 
used as a fertilizer and then into the
smokestack<00:06:07.190> system<00:06:07.640> slow<00:06:07.970> sand<00:06:08.270> filter<00:06:08.780> and

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
smokestack system slow sand filter and

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.470 
smokestack system slow sand filter and
out<00:06:09.500> comes<00:06:09.890> pretty<00:06:10.580> clean<00:06:10.880> water

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:11.480 
out comes pretty clean water

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.260 
out comes pretty clean water
