00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:06.580 
another quick tip on L sets we have

another quick tip on L sets we have
Ellis<00:00:06.910> it's<00:00:08.370> set<00:00:09.370> up<00:00:09.400> in<00:00:09.580> our<00:00:09.670> workout<00:00:10.030> today

Ellis it's set up in our workout today
at<00:00:10.480> dock<00:00:10.690> town<00:00:11.129> you<00:00:12.129> see<00:00:12.309> a<00:00:12.339> lot<00:00:12.610> of<00:00:13.169> just<00:00:14.169> else

it folds we're again working on cleaning
up<00:00:17.830> our<00:00:18.070> warm-up<00:00:18.550> at<00:00:19.000> first<00:00:20.520> cultivating

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
up our warm-up at first cultivating

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.910 
up our warm-up at first cultivating
better<00:00:21.700> position<00:00:22.270> so<00:00:23.230> what<00:00:23.470> I<00:00:23.500> want<00:00:23.710> to<00:00:23.770> talk

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
better position so what I want to talk

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.060 
better position so what I want to talk
about<00:00:24.070> is<00:00:24.310> is<00:00:24.550> sort<00:00:24.850> of<00:00:24.940> just<00:00:25.150> the<00:00:25.240> sort<00:00:25.630> of

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
about is is sort of just the sort of

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.060 
about is is sort of just the sort of
hierarchy<00:00:27.070> of<00:00:27.190> scaling<00:00:27.760> this<00:00:27.880> movement

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
hierarchy of scaling this movement

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.140 
hierarchy of scaling this movement
you've<00:00:30.070> already<00:00:30.220> established<00:00:30.400> that<00:00:30.850> we<00:00:31.000> like

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
you've already established that we like

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.240 
you've already established that we like
to<00:00:31.270> work<00:00:31.450> out<00:00:31.900> of<00:00:32.140> our<00:00:32.259> shoulder<00:00:32.739> girdles<00:00:33.100> so

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
to work out of our shoulder girdles so

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.419 
to work out of our shoulder girdles so
that<00:00:33.430> sort<00:00:33.760> of<00:00:33.820> depends<00:00:34.480> upon<00:00:34.570> what<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:36.160> size

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:36.429 
that sort of depends upon what what size

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:38.520 
that sort of depends upon what what size
you<00:00:36.730> are<00:00:36.760> with<00:00:37.149> your<00:00:37.300> shoulders<00:00:37.749> okay<00:00:37.929> so<00:00:38.469> I'm

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
going to measure it with my cubit

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.099 
going to measure it with my cubit
they're<00:00:39.940> gonna<00:00:40.329> make<00:00:40.510> sure<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:40.719> hands<00:00:40.929> are

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:41.109 
they're gonna make sure the hands are

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:42.529 
they're gonna make sure the hands are
right<00:00:41.230> in<00:00:41.409> the<00:00:41.469> center<00:00:41.499> of<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:41.980> parallettes

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
right in the center of the parallettes

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.840 
right in the center of the parallettes
okay<00:00:43.539> and<00:00:44.170> and<00:00:44.679> our<00:00:44.769> ultimate<00:00:44.890> goal<00:00:45.339> here<00:00:45.579> is<00:00:45.820> a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
okay and and our ultimate goal here is a

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.430 
okay and and our ultimate goal here is a
nice<00:00:46.469> level<00:00:47.469> Nelson<00:00:48.309> with<00:00:48.579> straight<00:00:48.850> legs

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
nice level Nelson with straight legs

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.270 
nice level Nelson with straight legs
this<00:00:50.440> is<00:00:50.499> work<00:00:52.109> totally<00:00:53.109> okay<00:00:53.679> so<00:00:53.739> how<00:00:54.039> do<00:00:54.100> we

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
this is work totally okay so how do we

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.700 
this is work totally okay so how do we
scale<00:00:54.489> this<00:00:54.699> bad<00:00:54.879> boy<00:00:55.059> typically<00:00:55.899> we<00:00:56.050> see<00:00:56.260> a

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
scale this bad boy typically we see a

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.549 
scale this bad boy typically we see a
nice<00:00:57.550> support<00:00:58.329> position<00:00:58.870> where<00:00:59.019> we<00:00:59.140> just<00:00:59.319> tuck

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
nice support position where we just tuck

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.649 
nice support position where we just tuck
up<00:00:59.739> and<00:00:59.920> hold<00:01:00.100> but<00:01:00.760> what<00:01:00.879> we<00:01:01.030> want<00:01:01.210> to<00:01:01.300> do<00:01:01.449> is

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
up and hold but what we want to do is

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:03.450 
up and hold but what we want to do is
make<00:01:01.870> sure<00:01:01.899> those<00:01:02.199> lats<00:01:02.440> are<00:01:02.649> on<00:01:02.769> so<00:01:03.309> we're

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
make sure those lats are on so we're

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.360 
make sure those lats are on so we're
pressing<00:01:03.789> down<00:01:04.379> off<00:01:05.379> into<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:05.979> parallettes

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
pressing down off into the parallettes

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.490 
pressing down off into the parallettes
and<00:01:06.790> then<00:01:07.360> we're<00:01:07.540> actually<00:01:07.719> we<00:01:08.259> can<00:01:08.380> actually

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
and then we're actually we can actually

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.999 
and then we're actually we can actually
even<00:01:08.860> ramp<00:01:09.399> it<00:01:09.549> up<00:01:09.610> by<00:01:09.790> squeezing<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:11.140> turning

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
even ramp it up by squeezing and turning

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:13.249 
even ramp it up by squeezing and turning
a<00:01:12.100> little<00:01:12.310> bit<00:01:12.399> on<00:01:12.520> the<00:01:12.640> parallettes

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
a little bit on the parallettes

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.969 
a little bit on the parallettes
activating<00:01:14.259> those<00:01:14.350> lads<00:01:14.590> and<00:01:14.770> almost

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
activating those lads and almost

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.289 
activating those lads and almost
pressing<00:01:15.850> those<00:01:16.000> those<00:01:16.390> eyelets<00:01:16.810> forward

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
pressing those those eyelets forward

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.670 
pressing those those eyelets forward
then<00:01:19.299> what<00:01:19.600> you're<00:01:19.750> going<00:01:19.899> to<00:01:19.930> do<00:01:20.110> is<00:01:20.469> push

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
then what you're going to do is push

then what you're going to do is push
your<00:01:20.799> hips<00:01:20.979> through<00:01:21.189> and<00:01:21.610> then<00:01:21.969> extend<00:01:22.299> your

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
your hips through and then extend your

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.440 
your hips through and then extend your
hips<00:01:22.600> up<00:01:22.810> your<00:01:23.530> feet<00:01:23.740> out<00:01:23.770> now<00:01:24.490> our<00:01:24.969> scaling

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
hips up your feet out now our scaling

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.029 
hips up your feet out now our scaling
options<00:01:25.810> aren't<00:01:26.049> as<00:01:26.110> such<00:01:26.320> we<00:01:26.560> started<00:01:26.890> with<00:01:27.009> a

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
options aren't as such we started with a

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.779 
options aren't as such we started with a
tuck<00:01:27.310> okay<00:01:28.060> we<00:01:28.180> got<00:01:28.360> that<00:01:28.600> but<00:01:29.409> we've<00:01:30.369> also

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
tuck okay we got that but we've also

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.670 
tuck okay we got that but we've also
seen<00:01:31.090> this<00:01:31.299> very<00:01:31.509> often<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:32.140> straighten<00:01:32.590> the
