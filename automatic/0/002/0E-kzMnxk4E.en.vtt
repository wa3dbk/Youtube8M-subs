Judaism teaches us that everything we

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.700 
Judaism teaches us that everything we

to<00:01:49.950> be<00:01:50.100> holy<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.520> some<00:01:50.970> way<00:01:51.180> or<00:01:51.689> at<00:01:51.899> least<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.350> be

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
to be holy in some way or at least to be

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.370 
to be holy in some way or at least to be
avoiding<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.820> use<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.060> profanity<00:01:54.540> because

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
avoiding the use of profanity because

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.319 
avoiding the use of profanity because
those<00:01:55.649> words<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.159> impact<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.909> those<00:01:57.060> words

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
those words have impact and those words

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.990 
those words have impact and those words
have<00:01:57.719> meaning<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.920> say<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.219> if<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.670> can't

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
have meaning and I say that if you can't

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.830 
have meaning and I say that if you can't
be<00:02:00.240> funny<00:02:00.570> unless<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.740> are<00:02:02.070> cursing<00:02:03.000> then

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
be funny unless you are cursing then

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.010 
be funny unless you are cursing then
guess<00:02:04.140> what<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.770> are<00:02:05.070> just<00:02:05.490> not<00:02:05.820> funny<00:02:06.390> at<00:02:06.689> all

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
guess what you are just not funny at all

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.650 
guess what you are just not funny at all
so<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.740> think<00:02:07.890> Cosby<00:02:08.580> was<00:02:08.759> right<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.209> i<00:02:09.629> think

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
so I think Cosby was right and i think
