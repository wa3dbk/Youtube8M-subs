00:00:07.986 --> 00:00:09.136
 good Morning. 

00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:12.756
 Yesterday, we received another painful news. 

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.626
 About the series of economic crises our country is currently facing 

00:00:15.626 --> 00:00:21.166
 In November alone, 533,000 people were unemployed. 

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.196
 The past November is the past 60 years. 

00:00:24.196 --> 00:00:26.526
 The month with the highest unemployment rate. 

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:29.096
 So we are in this crisis 

00:00:29.146 --> 00:00:31.276
 The number of unemployed has reached nearly 2 million. 

00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:33.986
 But this is not just a number. 

00:00:34.696 --> 00:00:36.576
 Every number represents 

00:00:36.576 --> 00:00:37.386
 a family 

00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:40.346
 This represents the festival 

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.716
 The uneasiness you feel 

00:00:42.716 --> 00:00:43.526
 With frustration 

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:46.256
 Can you provide your child with college in the future? 

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:48.406
 Can you afford your own medical expenses in the future? 

00:00:49.086 --> 00:00:50.566
 Can you have dignity? 

00:00:50.626 --> 00:00:52.066
 And safe retirement? 

00:00:53.016 --> 00:00:55.266
 Your job, or your husband's job 

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.126
 Or your daughter's work 

00:00:56.126 --> 00:00:58.866
 Or will your sonâ€™s work be laid off? 

00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:01.386
 Many problems 

00:01:01.386 --> 00:01:02.926
 Many Americans sleep at night. 

00:01:04.246 --> 00:01:06.006
 But this is not the first time people have proposed 

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:06.536
 these questions 

00:01:07.376 --> 00:01:09.196
 We have also faced difficulties 

00:01:09.496 --> 00:01:11.976
 At that time our economic situation 

00:01:11.976 --> 00:01:13.386
 It is gradually falling. 

00:01:14.086 --> 00:01:14.946
 Whenever this moment, 

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.906
 We all stand up to meet the challenge, 

00:01:17.396 --> 00:01:20.686
 We are united as one because of our common goals. 

00:01:21.306 --> 00:01:23.036
 I know that Americans must be able to do it again. 

00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:23.966
 Stand up to meet this challenge 

00:01:24.406 --> 00:01:27.816
 But we need to take action - take action now. 

00:01:27.936 --> 00:01:30.466
 This is why I asked my economic team. 

00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.446
 Formulating an economic recovery plan 

00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:34.536
 This plan will help Wall Street and Central Street 

00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:37.726
 Retain or create 

00:01:37.726 --> 00:01:38.976
 At least 2.5 million jobs 

00:01:39.316 --> 00:01:41.036
 Rebuilding our infrastructure, 

00:01:41.326 --> 00:01:44.046
 Improve teaching conditions and reduce our oil 

00:01:44.046 --> 00:01:46.516
 Rely on, and save billions of dollars in expenses. 

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:49.286
 We will not adopt the old Washington model. 

00:01:49.956 --> 00:01:51.576
 We don't just solve the problem with money. 

00:01:52.256 --> 00:01:54.636
 We will measure our progress through reforms. 

00:01:54.956 --> 00:01:56.166
 And our staged results -- 

00:01:56.696 --> 00:01:59.486
 Metrics include we create jobs, we save energy, 

00:01:59.946 --> 00:02:01.966
 And whether the United States has become 

00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:02.476
 even more competitive 

00:02:03.596 --> 00:02:06.446
 Today, I will announce some important parts of my plan. 

00:02:07.416 --> 00:02:09.886
 First, we will do our best 

00:02:10.086 --> 00:02:12.866
 To make public buildings more energy efficient. 

00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:16.086
 Our government is currently paying the most expensive in the world. 

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:16.766
 Energy costs. 

00:02:17.576 --> 00:02:18.526
 We have to change this situation. 

00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:20.596
 We want to transform our federal buildings 

00:02:20.626 --> 00:02:22.806
 Update old heating system 

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:25.296
 And install energy-saving light bulbs. 

00:02:25.806 --> 00:02:28.076
 This is not just an annual savings for US taxpayers. 

00:02:28.076 --> 00:02:29.456
 Billions of dollars. 

00:02:29.776 --> 00:02:31.506
 Will also create new jobs. 

00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:35.076
 Second, we will create millions of jobs. 

00:02:35.326 --> 00:02:38.356
 This opportunity is what we will be doing 

00:02:38.356 --> 00:02:41.206
 Since the creation of the national highway in China in 1950 

00:02:41.206 --> 00:02:43.986
 Largest single investment transformation infrastructure 

00:02:44.616 --> 00:02:47.566
 We will use a more savvy new way 

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:50.696
 To invest in your taxes, we will also set up a simple rule - 

00:02:51.366 --> 00:02:52.476
 Use it or lose it. 

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:55.926
 If any state does not use the money in 

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:57.436
 Road repair or bridge repair, 

00:02:57.776 --> 00:02:58.726
 They will not get the money. 

00:03:00.126 --> 00:03:03.416
 Third, my economic recovery plan will be 

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:05.396
 Update and upgrade as much as possible 

00:03:05.396 --> 00:03:07.376
 School building 

00:03:07.426 --> 00:03:08.626
 These have never appeared in this country. 

00:03:09.376 --> 00:03:11.036
 We will repair the damaged school, 

00:03:11.376 --> 00:03:13.976
 Make them more energy efficient, providing education for the school 

00:03:13.976 --> 00:03:14.916
 More computers 

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:17.386
 Because we want our children to be there. 

00:03:17.456 --> 00:03:20.826
 Winning the economic competition in the 21st century, we have to provide them with 

00:03:21.116 --> 00:03:22.666
 School of the 21st century. 

00:03:23.676 --> 00:03:25.966
 As we update our schools and highways, 

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:29.056
 We will also update our information highway. 

00:03:29.616 --> 00:03:30.766
 United States 

00:03:31.046 --> 00:03:33.386
 Ranked 15th in the world in broadband usage 

00:03:33.386 --> 00:03:34.786
 This is unacceptable. 

00:03:35.516 --> 00:03:37.796
 Here, in the process of updating the Internet, 

00:03:38.276 --> 00:03:41.126
 All children should be able to use the internet 

00:03:41.576 --> 00:03:43.576
 When I become president, children will have this opportunity - 

00:03:43.576 --> 00:03:45.836
 Because this will make the United States stronger in the world 

00:03:45.836 --> 00:03:47.306
 Competitiveness. 

00:03:48.446 --> 00:03:50.146
 In addition to making the library online 

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:52.696
 And the school uses the internet, we must guarantee 

00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:54.946
 Our hospital can pass the internet 

00:03:54.996 --> 00:03:55.626
 Connected to each other. 

00:03:56.306 --> 00:03:58.306
 My economic recovery plan 

00:03:58.306 --> 00:04:00.866
 Will modernize our healthcare system 

00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:02.996
 This will not only save employment opportunities, 

00:04:03.196 --> 00:04:04.276
 Will also save lives 

00:04:04.746 --> 00:04:06.936
 We will guarantee the United States 

00:04:06.936 --> 00:04:09.586
 Every doctor's office and hospital will use the most advanced 

00:04:09.586 --> 00:04:12.076
 Technology and electronic medical equipment 

00:04:12.076 --> 00:04:13.396
 This way we can reduce the cumbersome procedures, 

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:16.766
 Prevent medical accidents and save every year 

00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:18.116
 Billions of dollars 

00:04:19.266 --> 00:04:20.676
 This is just me 

00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:22.106
 In the next few weeks 

00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:24.196
 Part of the implementation of the economic recovery plan. 

00:04:24.736 --> 00:04:26.726
 When the Congress resumed in January, 

00:04:27.086 --> 00:04:28.816
 I hope to work with them. 

00:04:29.156 --> 00:04:31.076
 Pass this plan as soon as possible 

00:04:31.836 --> 00:04:34.036
 At this time we must act urgently 

00:04:34.036 --> 00:04:36.486
 Retain or create 

00:04:36.486 --> 00:04:37.796
 2.5 million jobs 

00:04:38.126 --> 00:04:40.186
 Such nearly 2 million unemployed families 

00:04:40.186 --> 00:04:42.516
 Will know that they still have a future. 

00:04:42.516 --> 00:04:44.796
 This is also me, as the president of the United States. 

00:04:45.206 --> 00:04:46.556
 Things to do. 

00:04:47.026 --> 00:04:49.166
 thank you all.
