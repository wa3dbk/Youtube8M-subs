00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.970
 well for the truth I'm doing a 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.470
 little effort to make this video 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.240
 because I have my head over there still 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.099
 Yesterday we were brewing for here and 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.290
 there and well I still have one 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.750
 little hangover but the truth was 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.030
 enough desire to comment this video 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.010
 because they have a good story 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.140

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.850

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.929
 there's going to see if there's something 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.789
 different because new people and such and 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:50.440
 effectively what was full was of 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.359
 looks and we call them simply 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.730
 because they have just started does not have the 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.530
 level and have no experience and how 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.839
 You have seen my team at the beginning 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.289

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.180
 total newbies and me and good everything started 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.880
 in the waiting room the trolley or was 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.009
 total what they wanted to do 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.170
 we are going to give you a beating I do not know what 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.090
 novice gang I do not know good yo ay 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.340
 I kept quiet listening to what they said 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.530
 I messed with nobody or anything but in 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.039
 one of this for one of my team and 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.070
 jump nothing happens we have a panzer and 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.689
 what the fuck i thinking fuck will be 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.549
 Fucking my uncle, I tell him he got me 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.009

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.899

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.119

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.340
 well try to do your best 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.990
 and thank goodness that I change the gusts 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.179
 because until then I had been 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.220
 playing with specialist but I put myself 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.619
 my favorite streaks that are the 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.869
 predictor pay low and osa helicopter 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.490
 hiper gave it to see if I can get out 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.860
 the and such but good we started here as 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.830
 We see 1,200 2,300 were giving us 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.099
 and the beating and the trolley, that is, and continue 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.409
 there where are instances I do not know what 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:01.569
 moved everywhere and also for more 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.090
 cojones as you will see the most cantamaÃ±anas 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:06.159
 of all went with the whores vouchers of 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.720
 shit that looks at me I charge it ends up what 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.920
 good how good how good it throws me and 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.810
 to the ground that stabbing them from 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.850
 current of the balls well then 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.140
 here is going to start the whole show 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.460
 Well, here he starts to take out the 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.960
 gusts here I already have my helicopter and already 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.210
 I have the helicopter now there's 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.550
 get as the town is because 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.140
 the town will devastate them good as 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.180
 you see also here we already got 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.310
 put a little bit ahead of the truth and 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.980
 there they keep shutting the mouth they were not 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.870
 so good gallinitas I would be my thing 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.750
 would be killing my helicopter the 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.880
 really start doing a massacre it 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.310
 behaves very well on the typical day that you 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.830
 helicopter finally kills so more 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.390
 happy you could not tournament the truth but 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.210
 well here my goal was still 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.740
 get my hair out but of course I saw the 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.390
 points on the minimap and I say but where 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.310
 What are you doing with my pussy ? 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.260
 helicopter that was devastating them to 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.330
 all but good here as you see already 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.070
 I get it out and I say you are going to find out 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.050
 Now that I have good cinema hair so 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.850
 but also we turn around the 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.530
 bookmark again I say good I have my 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.870
 quiet town that we can with 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.370
 them good the truth I here no longer 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.720
 I knew a little well what to do 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.240
 We are losing but good, I just 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.400
 get my hair out I do not know how do I stay anymore 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.560
 tranquilito waiting for the pec to do it 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.660
 his work but good the truth that not 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.490
 I can not do it 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.500
 I do not know how to be calm so 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.600
 I say look what the hell are we going to try another 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.180
 Once gusts us out and we will 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.730
 losing and good to see if I get another 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.000
 once I got the predator out of the helicopter and 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.890
 so good we finished it off because good 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.630
 as you will understand they had turned to 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.760
 put ahead on the scoreboard and good 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.900
 the chulitos were already calling us from 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.970
 all over again and that maybe serves to 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.350
 motivate you more itches you more and you say that 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.690
 cojones come on let's go let's go let's go 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.120
 that we can good as you could see 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.860
 my hair has just come into action and I say 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.140
 well let's walk around this area and that 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.580
 the hair is doing my job and I do 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.470
 new and brushing one down the road 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.910
 so perfect and I go back to get the 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.650
 rats effectively here I find myself 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.510
 two to one who wanted to throw me the try what 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.970
 is going to shoot you have it clear boy 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.220
 and good as you have seen I already have the 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.560
 predictor this is about to kill me 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.030
 but I can kill him and well nothing 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.410
 and I have the predictor and say we come 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.790
 to take credit now you see if we kill 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.620
 to one that we need for the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.530
 helicopter again come let's throw it 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.600
 there I have several here kill them and good 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.850
 I already have my helicopter just in case 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.530
 and well, as you can see already 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.570
 we had returned to put in 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.920
 head us and then here and so 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.480
 that I thought I say good it's time to 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.400
 control a bit the game does not do 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.720
 the crazy man do not do the fool to see if now 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.120
 Eventually we will turn to the 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.740
 game and I said well let's try 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.500
 here to control but fuck what I do in 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.140
 the one of the duals of the cojones because 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.690
 they did not kill themselves many times here I think 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.640
 that all was the fag this but 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.320
 good as I tell you look at my hair was 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.240
 there from obama you have to control little 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.630
 little by little because you can see that 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:00.680
 was very close six thousand 907 thousand 600 or 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:03.140
 be six thousand 707 thousand one hundred winning but 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.120
 that I hear gentlemen have taken a hair 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.880
 the enemies today please 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.290
 I was really I was leaving the 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.610
 heart seemed like I was playing a 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.070
 master skillful and I was just 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.050
 playing the pride of the subnormal 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.909
 opposites 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.009
 but good as I say you had been taken 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:20.590
 hair but it was going to be a bit late 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.210
 kids because here my partner from 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.940
 team gets a double bottom finish 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.520
 great that takes us straight to the 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.770
 good victory with kids this is a 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.509
 departure from which you really feel 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.729
 proud of having won it and that 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:37.440
 You really enjoyed it, I hope you have 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.440
 liked and see you in a next chao
