improvement<00:01:09.119> your<00:01:09.240> perhaps<00:01:09.539> looking<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:10.140> a

00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:10.429 
improvement your perhaps looking for a

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:12.590 
improvement your perhaps looking for a
qualifying<00:01:11.429> piece<00:01:11.759> I<00:01:11.789> suppose<00:01:12.330> with

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
qualifying piece I suppose with

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.300 
qualifying piece I suppose with
something<00:01:12.929> you're<00:01:13.380> trying<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.740> develop<00:01:13.950> over

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
something you're trying to develop over

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.830 
something you're trying to develop over
the<00:01:14.340> course<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:14.819> year<00:01:15.060> has<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.630> been<00:01:15.690> a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the course of the year has that been a

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.870 
the course of the year has that been a
priority<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.590> sense<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.550> how<00:01:17.700> things

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
priority to you sense and how things

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.139 
priority to you sense and how things
have<00:01:18.060> developed<00:01:18.149> um<00:01:19.429> yeah<00:01:20.429> maybe<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:20.880> try<00:01:21.030> to

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
have developed um yeah maybe we try to

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.809 
have developed um yeah maybe we try to
improve<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.720> all<00:01:21.899> the<00:01:22.050> areas<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.619> I'm<00:01:23.399> for

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:23.819 
improve on all the areas and I'm for

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:25.639 
improve on all the areas and I'm for
sure<00:01:23.909> if<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.179> can<00:01:24.390> qualify<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.840> more<00:01:25.470> higher

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
sure if you can qualify the more higher

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.320 
sure if you can qualify the more higher
up<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.069> will<00:01:26.250> give<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.610> much<00:01:26.789> better<00:01:27.090> chance

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
up it will give you a much better chance

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.649 
up it will give you a much better chance
to<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:28.200> win<00:01:28.380> win<00:01:29.039> more<00:01:29.250> races<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.940> I<00:01:30.119> makes<00:01:30.479> you

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
to to win win more races and I makes you

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.080 
to to win win more races and I makes you
a<00:01:30.720> lot<00:01:30.929> much<00:01:31.140> easier<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:31.979> rest<00:01:32.250> edge<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:32.700> I

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
a lot much easier in the rest edge but I

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.809 
a lot much easier in the rest edge but I
mean<00:01:33.690> it's<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.929> whole<00:01:34.170> package<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.819> they've

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
mean it's the whole package that they've

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:37.399 
mean it's the whole package that they've
been<00:01:35.850> trying<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.360> make<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.899> faster<00:01:37.319> and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
been trying to make it faster and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.410 
been trying to make it faster and
hopefully<00:01:38.130> hopefully<00:01:38.520> wants<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.149> do<00:01:39.240> that

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
hopefully hopefully wants to do that

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.510 
hopefully hopefully wants to do that
what<00:01:40.110> about<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.440> remind<00:01:40.830> a<00:01:40.920> lot<00:01:41.039> to<00:01:41.190> reflect

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
what about you remind a lot to reflect

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.819 
what about you remind a lot to reflect
on<00:01:41.670> from<00:01:41.970> last<00:01:42.000> season<00:01:42.600> very<00:01:43.049> solid<00:01:43.289> end<00:01:43.619> to

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
on from last season very solid end to

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.100 
on from last season very solid end to
this<00:01:43.950> season<00:01:44.340> from<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.899> can<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:45.960> maintain

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
this season from you can you maintain

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.289 
this season from you can you maintain
the<00:01:46.500> highs<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.369> avoid<00:01:47.789> so<00:01:48.030> that

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
the highs you have and avoid so that

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.550 
the highs you have and avoid so that
some<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.630> laws<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.960> have<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.320> could<00:01:49.439> put

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
some of the laws you have if I could put

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.130 
some of the laws you have if I could put
it<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.680> way<00:01:49.799> well<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.670> will<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.090> any<00:01:51.479> other<00:01:51.689> so

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
it that way well I will of any other so

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.840 
it that way well I will of any other so
I<00:01:52.170> think<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.680> clear<00:01:52.920> for<00:01:53.100> everybody<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.490> we

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
I think it's clear for everybody that we

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.760 
I think it's clear for everybody that we
had<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.030> good<00:01:54.210> qualifying<00:01:54.600> speeding<00:01:55.020> too<00:01:55.590> much

judge but I wonder if we could just come
and<00:02:40.769> I<00:02:40.890> will<00:02:40.920> look<00:02:41.130> at<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.370> front<00:02:41.579> of<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.819> car

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
and I will look at the front of the car

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.610 
and I will look at the front of the car
because<00:02:42.269> viewers<00:02:42.810> will<00:02:42.930> be<00:02:42.959> interested<00:02:43.590> to

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329

potentially the red bulls a little bit

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.380 
potentially the red bulls a little bit
closer<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.550> you<00:03:35.760> what<00:03:35.880> what<00:03:36.150> kind<00:03:36.360> of

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.260 
difference might not make it same for
everybody<00:03:39.390> so<00:03:39.950> I<00:03:40.950> don't<00:03:41.610> really<00:03:41.790> think<00:03:41.910> it's

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
everybody so I don't really think it's

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.990 
everybody so I don't really think it's
going<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.480> change<00:03:42.540> self<00:03:42.990> a<00:03:43.140> lot<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:44.700> running

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
going to change self a lot the running

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.120 
going to change self a lot the running
order<00:03:45.180> but<00:03:45.900> I<00:03:46.170> think<00:03:46.380> it's<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.710> smart<00:03:46.770> thing

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
order but I think it's a smart thing

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.570 
order but I think it's a smart thing
because<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:48.180> then<00:03:48.660> as<00:03:49.290> long<00:03:49.320> as<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:50.370> rules

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
because and then as long as the rules

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.820 
because and then as long as the rules
are<00:03:50.760> simple<00:03:51.210> it's<00:03:51.960> not<00:03:52.080> gonna<00:03:52.230> changed<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.710> lot

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
are simple it's not gonna changed a lot

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.380 
are simple it's not gonna changed a lot
done<00:03:53.010> it's<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.250> same<00:03:53.460> like<00:03:53.700> in<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.910> race<00:03:54.120> now

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
done it's the same like in the race now

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.130 
done it's the same like in the race now
so<00:03:54.800> it's<00:03:55.800> I<00:03:56.220> think<00:03:56.340> it's<00:03:56.610> fine<00:03:56.880> what<00:03:57.780> about<00:03:57.870> you

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
so it's I think it's fine what about you

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.140 
so it's I think it's fine what about you
as<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.320> driver<00:03:58.680> coming<00:03:59.160> into<00:03:59.459> this<00:03:59.580> season<00:03:59.850> now

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
as a driver coming into this season now

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.790 
as a driver coming into this season now
as<00:04:00.330> opposed<00:04:00.630> to<00:04:00.780> last<00:04:00.930> season<00:04:01.320> we've<00:04:01.440> had<00:04:01.650> that

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
as opposed to last season we've had that

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.699 
as opposed to last season we've had that
the<00:04:02.010> years<00:04:02.550> off<00:04:02.820> here<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.900> come<00:04:04.080> from<00:04:04.530> having

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
the years off here you come from having

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.620 
the years off here you come from having
been<00:04:04.920> third<00:04:05.220> in<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.459> championship<00:04:05.490> is<00:04:06.420> that<00:04:06.600> a

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
been third in the championship is that a

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.430 
been third in the championship is that a
big<00:04:06.810> advantage<00:04:07.110> for<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:07.590> um<00:04:08.690> we<00:04:09.690> all<00:04:09.930> start

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
big advantage for you um we all start

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.690 
big advantage for you um we all start
from<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.830> same<00:04:11.040> same<00:04:11.730> zero<00:04:12.360> point<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:13.700> it

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
from the same same zero point and it

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.310 
from the same same zero point and it
should<00:04:14.940> be<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.180> bit<00:04:15.360> more<00:04:15.540> easy<00:04:15.780> because<00:04:16.140> I<00:04:16.260> know

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
should be a bit more easy because I know

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.800 
should be a bit more easy because I know
the<00:04:16.590> people<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:17.100> people<00:04:17.250> knows<00:04:17.609> me<00:04:17.910> now<00:04:18.120> and<00:04:18.330> I

the people the people knows me now and I

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.550 
the people the people knows me now and I
mr.<00:04:19.739> it<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.880> more<00:04:21.270> easy<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:21.720> go<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.230> first

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
mr. it is more easy to go to the first

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.060 
mr. it is more easy to go to the first
race<00:04:22.830> for<00:04:23.070> sure<00:04:23.220> so<00:04:24.350> but<00:04:25.350> it<00:04:25.650> doesn't<00:04:25.980> mean

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
race for sure so but it doesn't mean

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.500 
race for sure so but it doesn't mean
that<00:04:26.130> it's<00:04:26.370> gonna<00:04:26.490> give<00:04:26.730> us<00:04:26.820> a<00:04:26.880> better<00:04:27.060> result

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
that it's gonna give us a better result

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.140 
that it's gonna give us a better result
hopefully<00:04:28.050> will<00:04:28.290> and<00:04:28.610> that's<00:04:29.610> that's<00:04:29.940> what

hopefully will and that's that's what
we're<00:04:30.330> aiming<00:04:30.419> for<00:04:30.630> what<00:04:31.560> about<00:04:31.680> Lewis<00:04:32.190> our

make McLaren a little bit less

is<00:04:45.930> and<00:04:46.230> we<00:04:47.070> will<00:04:47.250> have<00:04:47.430> to<00:04:47.580> wait<00:04:47.730> and<00:04:47.910> see<00:04:48.000> in<00:04:48.180> a

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
is and we will have to wait and see in a

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.600 
is and we will have to wait and see in a
testing<00:04:48.690> and<00:04:48.930> then<00:04:49.080> go<00:04:49.560> from<00:04:49.710> there<00:04:49.800> but<00:04:50.160> I

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
testing and then go from there but I

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.280 
testing and then go from there but I
think<00:04:51.090> it<00:04:51.210> will<00:04:51.419> be<00:04:51.570> interesting<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:52.020> see<00:04:52.260> what
