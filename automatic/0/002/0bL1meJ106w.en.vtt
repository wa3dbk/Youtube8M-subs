of right above us right where the slab
was<00:00:28.360> really<00:00:28.630> thick<00:00:28.930> it<00:00:29.770> didn't<00:00:30.099> impact<00:00:30.189> the

was really thick it didn't impact the

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.540 
was really thick it didn't impact the

the surface he skied down didn't trigger

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.849 
the surface he skied down didn't trigger
the<00:00:37.059> slide<00:00:37.360> and<00:00:37.660> then<00:00:37.719> cut<00:00:38.230> into<00:00:38.350> the<00:00:38.530> trees

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:38.859 
the slide and then cut into the trees

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:44.369 
the slide and then cut into the trees
here<00:00:39.399> skier<00:00:40.149> right<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:42.280> then<00:00:42.460> skier<00:00:42.760> to<00:00:43.379> drop

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
here skier right and then skier to drop

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.349 
here skier right and then skier to drop
it<00:00:44.679> more<00:00:45.039> on<00:00:45.309> the<00:00:45.399> right<00:00:45.640> side<00:00:45.940> of<00:00:46.059> the<00:00:46.120> path

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
it more on the right side of the path

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.060 
it more on the right side of the path
where<00:00:46.600> the<00:00:46.719> snowpack<00:00:47.170> was<00:00:47.350> a<00:00:47.379> lot<00:00:47.620> thinner

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
where the snowpack was a lot thinner

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.139 
where the snowpack was a lot thinner
it's<00:00:48.969> his<00:00:49.210> rocks<00:00:49.629> up<00:00:49.929> there<00:00:49.960> it's<00:00:50.379> more<00:00:50.589> scour

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
it's his rocks up there it's more scour

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.360 
it's his rocks up there it's more scour
and<00:00:52.149> he<00:00:52.420> came<00:00:52.749> down<00:00:52.780> and<00:00:53.409> he<00:00:53.769> impacted<00:00:54.280> the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
and he came down and he impacted the

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.759 
and he came down and he impacted the
weak<00:00:54.579> layer<00:00:54.820> looks<00:00:55.690> like<00:00:55.929> right<00:00:56.170> over<00:00:56.199> here<00:00:56.739> by

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
weak layer looks like right over here by

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:02.130 
weak layer looks like right over here by
these<00:00:57.010> rocks<00:01:00.269> when<00:01:01.269> the<00:01:01.359> snowpack<00:01:01.809> is<00:01:01.960> just

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
these rocks when the snowpack is just

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.070 
these rocks when the snowpack is just
like<00:01:02.260> a<00:01:02.289> foot<00:01:02.710> deep<00:01:03.150> so<00:01:04.150> he<00:01:04.300> impacted<00:01:04.900> that

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
like a foot deep so he impacted that

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.219 
like a foot deep so he impacted that
weak<00:01:05.290> layer<00:01:05.530> over<00:01:05.860> here<00:01:06.690> propagated<00:01:07.690> into

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
weak layer over here propagated into

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.740 
weak layer over here propagated into
this<00:01:08.350> deeper<00:01:08.770> part<00:01:09.010> of<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.159> snowpack

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
this deeper part of the snowpack

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.080 
this deeper part of the snowpack
creating<00:01:10.750> this<00:01:10.870> really<00:01:13.200> large<00:01:14.200> slide

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
creating this really large slide

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.820 
creating this really large slide
fortunately<00:01:16.090> he<00:01:16.330> was<00:01:16.480> able<00:01:16.600> to<00:01:16.810> cut<00:01:17.020> up<00:01:17.140> trees

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
fortunately he was able to cut up trees

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:25.740 
fortunately he was able to cut up trees
and<00:01:18.700> not<00:01:18.910> get<00:01:19.120> caught<00:01:19.150> so<00:01:19.810> it's<00:01:24.330> really<00:01:25.330> deep

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
and not get caught so it's really deep

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.570 
and not get caught so it's really deep
on<00:01:25.990> one<00:01:26.230> side<00:01:26.500> of<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.770> of<00:01:26.980> the<00:01:27.100> path<00:01:27.340> and

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
on one side of the of the path and

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.030 
on one side of the of the path and
really<00:01:27.820> thin<00:01:28.270> on<00:01:28.420> another<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:29.050> it's<00:01:29.860> just

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
really thin on another and it's just

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.560 
really thin on another and it's just
really<00:01:30.280> worth<00:01:30.550> paying<00:01:30.910> attention<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:31.390> the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
really worth paying attention to the

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.300 
really worth paying attention to the
characteristics<00:01:32.380> of<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.620> slope<00:01:32.950> you're<00:01:33.130> on

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
characteristics of the slope you're on

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.850 
characteristics of the slope you're on
trying<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.390> avoid<00:01:34.660> these<00:01:34.900> thin<00:01:35.170> rock<00:01:35.410> aries

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
trying to avoid these thin rock aries

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.580 
trying to avoid these thin rock aries
where<00:01:36.070> you<00:01:36.130> could<00:01:36.250> potentially<00:01:36.370> drag<00:01:37.000> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
where you could potentially drag a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.740 
where you could potentially drag a
trigger<00:01:38.590> these<00:01:38.740> larger<00:01:39.160> slot<00:01:39.430> so<00:01:40.210> just<00:01:40.510> keep

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
trigger these larger slot so just keep

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.810 
trigger these larger slot so just keep
that<00:01:40.810> in<00:01:41.020> mind<00:01:41.290> as<00:01:41.590> we<00:01:41.650> continue<00:01:42.550> to<00:01:42.640> get<00:01:42.760> more

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
that in mind as we continue to get more

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:58.140 
that in mind as we continue to get more
snow<00:01:43.350> more<00:01:44.350> low

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.500 

we<00:01:59.150> just<00:01:59.330> came<00:01:59.479> across<00:01:59.810> this<00:02:00.430> slide<00:02:01.430> this<00:02:02.060> just

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
we just came across this slide this just

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.210 
we just came across this slide this just
occurred<00:02:02.870> we<00:02:03.140> were<00:02:03.229> riding<00:02:03.470> this<00:02:03.800> area<00:02:04.100> about

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
occurred we were riding this area about

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.820 
occurred we were riding this area about
an<00:02:04.370> hour<00:02:04.490> ago<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:05.090> this<00:02:05.810> slide<00:02:06.050> wasn't<00:02:06.500> here

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
an hour ago and this slide wasn't here

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.630
