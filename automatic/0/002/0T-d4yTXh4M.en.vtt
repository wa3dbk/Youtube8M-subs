00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
that Elena stuff and it looks like

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.050 
that Elena stuff and it looks like

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.640 
to meet mama so it's gonna be either
electrified<00:00:08.700> man<00:00:08.910> or<00:00:09.150> master<00:00:09.630> moving<00:00:09.900> on<00:00:10.050> you

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
electrified man or master moving on you

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.870 
electrified man or master moving on you
think<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:11.130> looks<00:00:11.280> like<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.460> only<00:00:11.610> thing<00:00:11.730> you

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
think it looks like the only thing you

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.270 
think it looks like the only thing you
can<00:00:12.150> do<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:12.450> maybe<00:00:13.200> look<00:00:13.740> forward<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.250> a

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
can do is maybe look forward to a

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.630 
can do is maybe look forward to a
Hellena<00:00:15.000> Mehra<00:00:15.509> match<00:00:16.070> you<00:00:17.070> know<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.340> don't

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
Hellena Mehra match you know I don't

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.830 
Hellena Mehra match you know I don't
think<00:00:17.880> they'll<00:00:18.029> do<00:00:18.119> anything<00:00:18.330> quite<00:00:18.630> that

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
think they'll do anything quite that

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.420 
think they'll do anything quite that
silly<00:00:19.109> but<00:00:19.350> on<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.650> off<00:00:19.770> chance<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.250> they<00:00:20.369> do

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
silly but on the off chance that they do

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.769 
silly but on the off chance that they do
Oh<00:00:20.820> God

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
Oh God

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.609 
Oh God
I<00:00:22.340> think<00:00:23.340> more<00:00:23.490> likely<00:00:23.850> we're<00:00:24.119> gonna<00:00:24.269> see

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
I think more likely we're gonna see

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.900 
I think more likely we're gonna see
either<00:00:25.619> Christy<00:00:26.130> as<00:00:26.250> he's<00:00:26.460> using<00:00:26.730> right<00:00:26.760> now

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
either Christy as he's using right now

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.060 
either Christy as he's using right now
or<00:00:27.420> will<00:00:27.660> Seco<00:00:28.080> grow<00:00:28.289> out<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.500> him<00:00:28.710> because

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
or will Seco grow out of him because

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.830 
or will Seco grow out of him because
he's<00:00:29.250> actually<00:00:29.490> got<00:00:29.760> he's<00:00:30.269> very<00:00:30.449> confident

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
he's actually got he's very confident

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.780 
he's actually got he's very confident
with<00:00:30.960> three<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.230> those<00:00:31.349> characters<00:00:31.800> go<00:00:32.550> grow

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
with three of those characters go grow

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
and Elena yeah he did seem like he's got

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.590 
and Elena yeah he did seem like he's got
a<00:00:35.790> few<00:00:35.880> characters<00:00:38.120> nice<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.300> zoo<00:00:39.450> no

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
a few characters nice the zoo no

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
straight to the floor they're walking

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.979 
straight to the floor they're walking
right<00:00:42.629> all<00:00:42.870> over<00:00:43.260> him

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:48.869 

and<00:00:47.290> this<00:00:47.500> is<00:00:47.649> just<00:00:47.800> gonna<00:00:47.890> be<00:00:48.100> one<00:00:48.430> touch<00:00:48.700> of

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
and this is just gonna be one touch of

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:57.250 
and this is just gonna be one touch of
death<00:00:49.059> here<00:00:49.360> and<00:00:49.570> there<00:00:49.750> it<00:00:49.840> is

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.720 

there<00:00:57.620> we<00:00:57.739> go<00:00:57.860> I'm<00:00:58.070> surprised<00:00:58.399> he'd<00:00:58.550> actually

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
there we go I'm surprised he'd actually

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.340 
there we go I'm surprised he'd actually
risk<00:00:59.300> going<00:00:59.510> for<00:00:59.600> his<00:00:59.690> full<00:00:59.840> frame<00:01:00.079> throw

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
risk going for his full frame throw

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.290 
risk going for his full frame throw
they're<00:01:00.559> just<00:01:00.890> for<00:01:01.070> normal<00:01:01.460> dude<00:01:01.640> damage<00:01:02.090> I

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
they're just for normal dude damage I

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.060 
they're just for normal dude damage I
think<00:01:02.480> she<00:01:02.750> gets<00:01:02.870> doesn't<00:01:03.559> she<00:01:03.620> get<00:01:03.739> she<00:01:03.890> used

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
think she gets doesn't she get she used

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.640 
think she gets doesn't she get she used
to<00:01:04.159> get<00:01:04.280> more<00:01:04.489> damage<00:01:04.879> on<00:01:05.030> that<00:01:05.180> throw<00:01:05.420> I<00:01:05.840> mean

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
to get more damage on that throw I mean

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.780 
to get more damage on that throw I mean
she'll<00:01:06.950> still<00:01:07.100> get<00:01:07.220> a<00:01:07.250> lot<00:01:07.400> off<00:01:07.580> a<00:01:07.610> high

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
she'll still get a lot off a high

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.310 
she'll still get a lot off a high
counter<00:01:08.119> it<00:01:08.270> seems<00:01:08.600> like<00:01:08.780> she<00:01:08.930> got<00:01:09.020> more

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
counter it seems like she got more

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.690 
counter it seems like she got more
because<00:01:09.650> they<00:01:09.800> increased<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.220> overall<00:01:10.250> life

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
because they increased the overall life

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.370 
because they increased the overall life
it<00:01:11.060> seems<00:01:11.270> like<00:01:11.390> he's<00:01:11.479> doing<00:01:11.510> less<00:01:11.810> now<00:01:11.990> but

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
it seems like he's doing less now but

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.539 
it seems like he's doing less now but

I think after what he saw with black mom
it's<00:03:01.730> like<00:03:01.880> it<00:03:02.090> may<00:03:02.240> be<00:03:02.300> time<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:03.700> pull<00:03:04.700> out<00:03:04.820> a
