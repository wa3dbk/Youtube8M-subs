00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.240 
within the box now this companion app is
a<00:01:45.360> bit<00:01:45.630> all<00:01:45.780> over<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.049> place<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.680> essentially

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
a bit all over the place so essentially

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.649 
a bit all over the place so essentially
once<00:01:47.460> you've<00:01:47.579> actually<00:01:47.700> connected<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.299> device

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
once you've actually connected to device

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.840 
once you've actually connected to device
via<00:01:48.960> bluetooth<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:50.100> would<00:01:50.250> already<00:01:50.430> need<00:01:50.729> to

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
via bluetooth you would already need to

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.389 
via bluetooth you would already need to
have<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.149> app<00:01:51.329> pre<00:01:51.750> downloaded<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.560> then<00:01:53.220> it

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
have the app pre downloaded and then it

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.969 
have the app pre downloaded and then it
will<00:01:53.579> automatically<00:01:54.299> run<00:01:54.570> once<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.380> senses

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
will automatically run once it senses

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.830 
will automatically run once it senses
the<00:01:56.009> watch<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.460> connected<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.360> course<00:01:57.509> there

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
the watch is connected of course there

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.389 
the watch is connected of course there
are<00:01:57.930> different<00:01:58.290> modes<00:01:58.500> such<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:58.740> sleep<00:01:59.130> and

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
are different modes such as sleep and

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.580 
are different modes such as sleep and
sports<00:02:00.210> mode<00:02:00.540> because<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.049> can<00:02:01.290> double<00:02:01.530> up

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
sports mode because this can double up

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.340 
sports mode because this can double up
also<00:02:01.860> as<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.219> sports<00:02:02.700> watch<00:02:02.869> so<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.960> can<00:02:04.110> track

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
also as a sports watch so you can track

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.219 
also as a sports watch so you can track
your<00:02:04.530> fitness<00:02:04.890> how<00:02:05.369> much<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.670> walk<00:02:05.909> etc<00:02:06.689> but

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
your fitness how much you walk etc but

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.960 
your fitness how much you walk etc but
to<00:02:07.320> me<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.560> companion<00:02:08.009> app<00:02:08.129> itself<00:02:08.610> looks

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
to me the companion app itself looks

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.940 
to me the companion app itself looks
very<00:02:09.209> clustered<00:02:09.780> it's<00:02:09.959> not<00:02:10.110> very<00:02:10.319> clean<00:02:10.679> and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
very clustered it's not very clean and

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.280 
very clustered it's not very clean and
can<00:02:11.400> get<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.640> bit<00:02:11.819> complicated<00:02:11.970> sometimes

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
can get a bit complicated sometimes

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.929 
can get a bit complicated sometimes
my<00:02:13.409> personal<00:02:13.829> preference<00:02:14.069> on<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.519> I<00:02:14.670> don't

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
my personal preference on it I don't

my personal preference on it I don't
really<00:02:15.120> see<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.569> need<00:02:15.599> for<00:02:16.019> this<00:02:16.379> companion

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
really see the need for this companion

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.679 
really see the need for this companion
up<00:02:17.099> that<00:02:17.400> much<00:02:17.640> instead<00:02:18.090> what<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.420> would<00:02:18.569> have

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
up that much instead what I would have

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.750 
up that much instead what I would have
liked<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.870> see<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.409> downloading<00:02:20.310> separate

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
liked to see is downloading separate

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.759 
liked to see is downloading separate
applications<00:02:21.450> or<00:02:21.659> widgets<00:02:22.079> that<00:02:22.170> work<00:02:22.590> with

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
applications or widgets that work with

major stand point of this new watch is

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.110 
major stand point of this new watch is
that<00:03:04.919> the<00:03:05.040> fact<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.370> can<00:03:05.519> make<00:03:05.639> phone<00:03:05.849> calls

now<00:03:06.720> I've<00:03:06.870> used<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.230> feature<00:03:07.409> quite<00:03:07.919> a<00:03:07.950> bit

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
now I've used this feature quite a bit

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.979 
now I've used this feature quite a bit
and<00:03:08.489> it's<00:03:08.760> quite<00:03:08.939> interesting<00:03:09.209> when<00:03:09.900> you're

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
and it's quite interesting when you're

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.509 
and it's quite interesting when you're
making<00:03:10.139> a<00:03:10.290> phone<00:03:10.500> call<00:03:10.739> you<00:03:10.919> can<00:03:11.099> check<00:03:11.370> you

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
making a phone call you can check you

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
all from your SmartWatch course you can

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:16.759 
all from your SmartWatch course you can
look<00:03:15.599> a<00:03:15.659> bit<00:03:15.689> weird<00:03:16.019> if<00:03:16.139> you're<00:03:16.260> on<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.470> street

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
look a bit weird if you're on the street

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.860 
look a bit weird if you're on the street
and<00:03:16.859> you're<00:03:16.980> talking<00:03:17.189> to<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.609> watch<00:03:17.909> it's<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.690> bit

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
and you're talking to a watch it's a bit

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.020 
and you're talking to a watch it's a bit
far-fetched<00:03:19.199> but<00:03:19.979> it<00:03:20.159> does<00:03:20.370> make<00:03:20.549> me<00:03:20.790> feel<00:03:20.819> a

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
far-fetched but it does make me feel a

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.270 
far-fetched but it does make me feel a
bit<00:03:21.120> like<00:03:21.510> James<00:03:21.750> Bond<00:03:22.139> now<00:03:22.650> internal<00:03:22.889> call

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
bit like James Bond now internal call
