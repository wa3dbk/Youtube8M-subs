00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.039 

and<00:00:01.860> then<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:03.510> put<00:00:03.659> it<00:00:03.750> back<00:00:03.870> in<00:00:04.140> just<00:00:05.899> lay<00:00:06.899> it

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
and then to put it back in just lay it

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.940 
and then to put it back in just lay it
on<00:00:07.200> top<00:00:07.470> right<00:00:08.370> where<00:00:08.519> it<00:00:08.610> should<00:00:08.639> be<00:00:09.950> snap

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
on top right where it should be snap

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.870 
on top right where it should be snap
down<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:12.440> at<00:00:13.440> first<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:14.130> looks<00:00:14.429> like<00:00:14.639> it's

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
down and at first it looks like it's

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.380 
down and at first it looks like it's
flimsy<00:00:15.870> there's<00:00:16.440> no<00:00:16.650> screw<00:00:17.010> securing<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.699> but

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
flimsy there's no screw securing it but

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.689 
flimsy there's no screw securing it but
there's<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.720> hole<00:00:18.900> here<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.910> a<00:00:20.910> hole<00:00:21.090> here

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
there's a hole here and a hole here

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.630 
there's a hole here and a hole here
where<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.570> screws<00:00:24.960> for<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.380> top<00:00:25.769> go<00:00:26.310> through

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
where the screws for the top go through

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.820 
where the screws for the top go through
so<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.359> more<00:00:27.930> secure<00:00:28.349> than<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.650> last

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
so this is more secure than the last

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.180 
so this is more secure than the last
version<00:00:30.560> and<00:00:32.719> after<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.899> just<00:00:34.620> continue

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
version and after that just continue

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.450 
version and after that just continue
putting<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.610> drive<00:00:35.790> back<00:00:36.059> together<00:00:37.460> this

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
putting the drive back together this

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.369 
putting the drive back together this
optical<00:00:39.090> drive<00:00:39.329> top<00:00:40.610> has<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.910> same<00:00:42.180> caveat<00:00:42.899> is

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
optical drive top has the same caveat is

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.389 
optical drive top has the same caveat is
my<00:00:43.649> last<00:00:43.980> one<00:00:44.899> hold<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.320> optical<00:00:46.890> drive<00:00:47.100> top

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
my last one hold the optical drive top

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.190

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
have a line of hdmi enabled here so it

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.180 
have a line of hdmi enabled here so it
won't<00:02:40.500> show<00:02:40.739> up<00:02:40.860> on<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.130> screen<00:02:42.200> but<00:02:43.200> looks

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
like we've got green we've got our tests

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.830 
like we've got green we've got our tests
disk<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:49.640> i'm<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:50.790> going<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.150> test<00:02:51.660> the

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
disk and i'm just going to test the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:02.530 
disk and i'm just going to test the
insertion<00:02:53.510> there<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.660> go<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.620> inserts

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.839 

and<00:03:03.140> it's<00:03:03.409> reading<00:03:04.930> it's<00:03:05.930> just<00:03:06.140> a<00:03:06.230> junk<00:03:06.590> disk<00:03:06.920> I

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.470 

as<00:03:10.849> always<00:03:11.510> I<00:03:11.840> suggest<00:03:12.739> that<00:03:13.329> when<00:03:14.329> you're

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480
