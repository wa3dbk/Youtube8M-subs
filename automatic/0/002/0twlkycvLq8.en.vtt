let's<00:00:57.059> see<00:00:57.180> how<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.329> build<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:58.050> do<00:00:58.170> this

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
let's see how to build it to do this

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.540 
let's see how to build it to do this
we're<00:00:58.590> gonna<00:00:58.649> need<00:00:58.890> your<00:00:59.010> building<00:00:59.370> block<00:00:59.520> of

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
so in this case I just have a 3x3 wall

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.600 
so in this case I just have a 3x3 wall
with<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> hole<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.500> middle<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.280> where

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
with a hole in the middle this is where

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.910 
with a hole in the middle this is where
you<00:01:17.729> will<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.000> right-click<00:01:18.299> through<00:01:18.920> so
