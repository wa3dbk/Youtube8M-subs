00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
basic the green is supposed to represent

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.750 
basic the green is supposed to represent
light<00:01:12.380> shining<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.530> because<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.490> realize

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
light shining on it because you realize

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.980 

right<00:01:51.360> there<00:01:52.110> we<00:01:52.200> go

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
right there we go

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.270

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
this is basically just taking like this

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.980 
this is basically just taking like this
pull<00:02:04.050> these<00:02:04.170> down<00:02:05.450> put<00:02:06.450> legs<00:02:06.660> all<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.870> way

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
pull these down put legs all the way

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.660 
pull these down put legs all the way
down<00:02:08.750> feet<00:02:09.750> they<00:02:10.410> are<00:02:10.440> backwards<00:02:11.039> that's<00:02:11.490> for

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
down feet they are backwards that's for

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.780 
down feet they are backwards that's for
a<00:02:11.700> really<00:02:11.910> good<00:02:12.060> reason<00:02:13.370> close<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.550> out<00:02:14.640> you

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
a really good reason close it out you

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.199 
a really good reason close it out you
need<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.000> get<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.450> standing<00:02:16.850> then<00:02:17.850> take<00:02:18.060> the

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
need to get it standing then take the

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.540 
need to get it standing then take the
hands<00:02:18.660> just<00:02:19.350> very<00:02:19.680> basic<00:02:19.950> easy

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
hands just very basic easy

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.320 
hands just very basic easy
transformation<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.940> can<00:02:24.090> go<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.300> can

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
transformation you can go you can

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.240 
transformation you can go you can
position<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.080> lights<00:02:25.380> give<00:02:25.860> them<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.070> cool

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
position the lights give them a cool

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.060 
position the lights give them a cool
look<00:02:26.459> he's<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.270> hunchback<00:02:27.630> so<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.470> think<00:02:28.860> that

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
look he's a hunchback so I think that

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.400 
look he's a hunchback so I think that
looks<00:02:29.250> really<00:02:29.310> good<00:02:29.700> though

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
looks really good though

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:39.170 
looks really good though
get<00:02:31.410> these<00:02:31.560> eyes<00:02:34.880> situated<00:02:37.820> there<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:38.940> have

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
get these eyes situated there you have

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.510 
get these eyes situated there you have
him<00:02:39.390> call<00:02:40.230> them<00:02:40.380> volt<00:02:40.910> for<00:02:41.910> now<00:02:42.980> there<00:02:43.980> he<00:02:44.100> is

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.990 

so<00:02:47.520> uh<00:02:47.720> yep<00:02:48.720> that's<00:02:49.320> basically<00:02:49.770> him<00:02:50.070> punch

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
it's smooth only thing I'd say different

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.470

is<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:39.250> wideness<00:04:39.700> of<00:04:39.850> it<00:04:39.940> but<00:04:40.060> I<00:04:40.120> had<00:04:40.270> to<00:04:40.360> do

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
is the wideness of it but I had to do

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.840 
is the wideness of it but I had to do
that<00:04:40.630> with<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:40.870> legs<00:04:41.080> so<00:04:41.590> you<00:04:42.340> know<00:04:42.430> room<00:04:42.670> for

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
that with the legs so you know room for

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:43.560 
that with the legs so you know room for
a<00:04:42.910> version<00:04:43.090> too

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
a version too

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.890 
a version too
but<00:04:44.380> I<00:04:44.410> think<00:04:44.500> it<00:04:44.710> looks<00:04:44.740> really<00:04:45.490> really<00:04:45.520> good

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900
