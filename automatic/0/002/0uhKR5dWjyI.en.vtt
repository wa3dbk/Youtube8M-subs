00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.720
 application that is a game called 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.240
 clubs and ninja 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.939
 this free game is free in the 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.470
 appstore and I do not know if it's due to time 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.220
 limited or they will leave it free for 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.199
 always good is the bottom in the 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.540
 video description I will put the link 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:42.710
 so you can download it and we're going to 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.650
 see what this game presents us with success 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.470
 let's remove the sound 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.230
 good first like 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.850
 we go many games give us coins 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.460
 when we go through the day I have two 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:59.160
 we will continue with the 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.160
 game level 14 if we are going to see 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.780
 I have two thousand four hundred and fifty and 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.820
 five coins and one ruby ​​of these is what 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.040
 what to do in this in this game 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.570
 is this doll that we have here that 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.140
 is a ninja is a bit clumsy and we have 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.630
 to go getting let's say let's see 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.479
 a little bit we have to get the 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.940
 levels and we also have to 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.920
 getting what are the 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.110
 belts you see I'm already going by the 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.550
 brown belt then the clothes also the 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:35.000
 we can change but that's going to go 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:37.150
 progressively worth let's go here we 're going to 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.150
 watch 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.920
 has integrated purchases in what is in 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:47.940
 the game we have many things have to 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.850
 make tests and go testing and 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.140
 moment I go through level 13 and I am 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.550
 a little chicken that is here has come out 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.610
 asleep is worth and the eggs also of 50 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.730
 puntillos what are we going to see I 'm going to 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.840
 teach what would be the map that is 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.289
 here in this 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.190
 what is this signal here we are 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.310
 in the city 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.140
 I do not know how many the city will have 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.120
 how much 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.670
 little screen but then the hills have 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.150
 16 and the temple has 36 that for now 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.150
 is there 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.860
 this has stopped because I can not the 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.099
 moment is for disk because I can not 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.780
 get in there well let's see so that 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.210
 see more or less the dynamics of the game 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.950
 before starting 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:43.610
 here would be the ninja 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.280
 and to train it we have to catch up 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.090
 example let's do a test him 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.569
 we can take the arm 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.060
 you see here we are going to take it from the arm you see 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.780
 here how are you raising your arm and what 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.580
 we can raise the ninja then also 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.350
 we can do one thing we can leave it 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.660
 fall and you will see how he gives us points 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.130
 well now it has not dropped anymore because I 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.480
 I have well trained 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.670
 we started with colors and more 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.010
 Well there we have it we will do we go 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.100
 to throw it back to see if it gives us 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.530
 points 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.440
 good one of a points what we have to 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.620
 to do is to train the ninja 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.770
 do a test with one of the tests 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.380
 that there is a good sack we have 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.350
 here a trampoline as you see happen 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.620
 the mastery of the first two would be 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.830
 the jumper then we have here too 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.120
 some sacks 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:50.660
 I have spent a few also and 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.100
 then these meloncitos or balls that 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.710
 I'm wearing and for the red star we're going to 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.380
 try a hand so you can see what 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.270
 has to do there we are placed the 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.480
 ninja and then I what I have to 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.430
 to do is to throw what the balls are 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.260
 we remove the balls and he has to 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.550
 go stopping and as you see on the left 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:13.340
 does not know what is the score of those 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:17.090
 balls is worth and above the level that is going 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:21.840
 loading as we go by a little bit 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:25.110
 of points you see there is catching points 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.330
 as you can see there is and now we 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.479
 a bag of coins that is here comes out 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.639
 this red bag we press it and what 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.370
 I would catch what we can do with this 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:38.160
 little doll we can spin it throw it 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.169
 we can tickle the floor 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.249
 we do with keels him when he feels 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:46.099
 since he can not anymore he runs 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:49.009
 the daughter and she's running away and she 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:52.909
 hides behind a barrel then what 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.529
 what we have to do is good we are going to 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:57.769
 see the trampoline so you can see how 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:05:00.900
 jumps and that's the dynamics of the game not 

00:04:57.769 --> 00:05:03.979
 it has more to see 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.850
 what we have as we normally do 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.850
 they use this computer 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.700
 well let's have him do another test 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:18.780
 of the ninja like for example jumping 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:23.070
 and so you see the dynamics again we're going to 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:25.800
 see the now just click on what 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.390
 which is the trampoline would go up 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.810
 as I have it in half because yesterday 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:33.030
 I played a little bit and we'll see for 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.780
 do this we have to move the sights and 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:39.780
 you see what is the trampoline that already 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.830
 we are with the while I speak I am 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.240
 playing but the screen does not come out 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.560
 let's see there you see how 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.200
 is jumping 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:55.150
 it's cut in half but we're going to 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.820
 take the coin you have already taken it 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.580
 you can do everything with the little man 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:03.400
 You can also put some balloons 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.840
 let's put it over so you can see 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.540
 how funny 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.780
 and the celestial globe 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:15.729
 let's put one so you can see how 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.830
 the ninja goes up to heaven 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:20.770
 but then this is today's game that 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.539
 I wanted to teach has no more what 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.639
 you have to go do the tests there 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:26.229
 you have how it's going to go up you have to go 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:31.169
 doing tests with this ninja is worth 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:34.999
 to do it much more much better 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.999
 of what it is now 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.830
 or that is a ninja not now that 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:45.040
 it is a little awkward 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:47.070
 there we have him with the balloons going up 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.230
 in the air 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.400
 Well, you know if you liked the 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:53.810
