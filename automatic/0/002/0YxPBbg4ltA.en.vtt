to me my dogs have always been part of
my<00:02:16.599> family<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.730> difficulty<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.510> have

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
my family and the difficulty you have

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.360 
my family and the difficulty you have
when<00:02:19.930> you<00:02:20.019> diagnose<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.470> dog<00:02:20.739> at<00:02:20.920> under<00:02:21.130> 12

months of age you don't know how they're

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.500 
months of age you don't know how they're
gonna<00:02:22.900> continue<00:02:23.349> to<00:02:23.410> develop<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:24.239> no<00:02:25.239> one<00:02:25.390> has

the<00:02:33.519> initial<00:02:33.880> problems<00:02:34.780> are<00:02:34.930> that<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.200> dogs

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
the initial problems are that the dogs

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.809 
the initial problems are that the dogs
can't<00:02:35.680> get<00:02:36.040> up<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.280> down<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.430> they<00:02:36.579> can't

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
can't get up and down and they can't

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.090 
can't get up and down and they can't
move<00:02:37.000> easily<00:02:37.359> and<00:02:37.870> as<00:02:38.109> it<00:02:38.260> time<00:02:38.500> goes<00:02:38.709> on<00:02:38.859> they

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
move easily and as it time goes on they

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.620 
move easily and as it time goes on they
get<00:02:39.280> more<00:02:39.489> and<00:02:39.579> more<00:02:39.609> arthritis<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.299> the<00:02:40.390> joint

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
get more and more arthritis in the joint

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
get more and more arthritis in the joint
and<00:02:41.100> immobility<00:02:42.100> sets<00:02:42.579> in<00:02:43.019> if<00:02:44.019> she<00:02:44.230> did<00:02:44.350> start

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
and immobility sets in if she did start

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.990 
and immobility sets in if she did start
having<00:02:44.920> clinical<00:02:45.310> signs<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.850> other

having clinical signs the other

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.640 
having clinical signs the other
alternative<00:02:46.600> in<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.810> future<00:02:47.170> as<00:02:47.380> she<00:02:47.530> got

alternative in the future as she got

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.050 
alternative in the future as she got
older<00:02:47.709> would<00:02:48.130> be<00:02:48.250> having<00:02:48.519> a<00:02:48.670> total<00:02:48.819> hip

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
older would be having a total hip

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.580 
older would be having a total hip
replacement<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:49.959> would<00:02:50.109> be<00:02:50.319> a<00:02:50.350> very

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
replacement that would be a very

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.870 
replacement that would be a very
traumatic<00:02:50.829> surgery<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.519> would<00:02:51.639> have<00:02:51.760> taken

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
traumatic surgery that would have taken

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.150 
traumatic surgery that would have taken
months<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.870> months<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:53.139> heal<00:02:53.470> plus<00:02:54.010> they

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
months and months to heal plus they

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.520 
months and months to heal plus they
would<00:02:54.280> have<00:02:54.370> had<00:02:54.459> to<00:02:54.549> done<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.790> other<00:02:54.970> side

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
would have had to done the other side

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.259 
would have had to done the other side
and<00:02:56.530> I<00:02:56.680> decided<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.100> would<00:02:57.160> not<00:02:57.430> like<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.000> do

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
and I decided I would not like to do

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.890 
and I decided I would not like to do
surgery<00:02:58.510> I<00:02:58.870> was<00:02:59.769> given<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.160> name<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.900> dr.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
technique on an animal which you can't

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.910 
technique on an animal which you can't
really<00:03:19.389> say<00:03:19.660> hey<00:03:19.840> relax<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.470> do<00:03:20.530> this<00:03:20.680> or<00:03:20.889> that

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
really say hey relax and do this or that

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.979 
really say hey relax and do this or that
this<00:03:21.700> will<00:03:21.880> actually<00:03:22.030> go<00:03:22.299> in<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.510> what<00:03:22.870> it

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
this will actually go in and what it

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.229 
this will actually go in and what it
does<00:03:23.079> is<00:03:23.260> sets<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.680> spine<00:03:23.980> in<00:03:24.130> motion<00:03:24.549> this<00:03:25.060> is

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
does is sets the spine in motion this is

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.949 
does is sets the spine in motion this is
a<00:03:25.319> Apollo<00:03:26.319> cold<00:03:27.099> laser<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:27.910> what<00:03:28.299> lasers<00:03:28.750> do

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
a Apollo cold laser and what lasers do

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.589 
a Apollo cold laser and what lasers do
is<00:03:29.109> it's<00:03:29.290> like<00:03:29.950> a<00:03:29.980> like<00:03:30.639> photosynthesis<00:03:31.420> for

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
is it's like a like photosynthesis for

is it's like a like photosynthesis for

in<00:03:34.440> working<00:03:35.440> with<00:03:35.470> humans<00:03:35.859> and<00:03:36.010> it<00:03:36.370> actually

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
in working with humans and it actually

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.999 
in working with humans and it actually
works<00:03:36.849> down<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.299> RNA<00:03:37.750> level<00:03:38.139> it<00:03:38.560> stimulates

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:39.009 
works down the RNA level it stimulates

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:40.710 
works down the RNA level it stimulates
the<00:03:39.130> healing<00:03:39.459> through<00:03:39.729> that<00:03:39.940> deep<00:03:40.479> of<00:03:40.630> a

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
the healing through that deep of a

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.750 
the healing through that deep of a
penetration<00:03:41.560> as<00:03:41.949> far<00:03:42.160> as

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
penetration as far as

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.490 
penetration as far as
through<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.910> skin<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.210> working<00:03:45.020> at<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.140> RNA

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
through the skin and working at the RNA

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.920 
through the skin and working at the RNA
level<00:03:45.860> this<00:03:46.100> is<00:03:46.250> an<00:03:46.400> alpha<00:03:46.640> sonic<00:03:46.940> machine<00:03:47.270> and

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
level this is an alpha sonic machine and

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.300 
level this is an alpha sonic machine and
what<00:03:48.050> it<00:03:48.140> does<00:03:48.260> is<00:03:48.440> it<00:03:48.470> stimulates<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.100> blood

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
what it does is it stimulates the blood

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.210 
what it does is it stimulates the blood
and<00:03:49.340> lymph<00:03:49.610> drainage<00:03:49.670> in<00:03:50.210> the<00:03:50.690> body<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.500> so<00:03:52.010> I

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
and lymph drainage in the body and so I

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.970 
and lymph drainage in the body and so I
would<00:03:52.550> work<00:03:52.910> her<00:03:53.720> spine<00:03:54.110> and<00:03:54.410> I<00:03:54.710> would<00:03:54.860> also

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
would work her spine and I would also

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.650 
would work her spine and I would also
