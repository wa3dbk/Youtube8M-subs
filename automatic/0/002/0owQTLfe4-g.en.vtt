00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
court in a snare and struggling he might

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.870 
court in a snare and struggling he might
have<00:03:11.560> struggled<00:03:11.769> for<00:03:12.070> days<00:03:12.280> before<00:03:12.640> he

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
have struggled for days before he

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.940 
have struggled for days before he
managed<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.150> break<00:03:13.359> that<00:03:13.570> snare<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.109> get<00:03:14.829> away

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
managed to break that snare and get away

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.410 
managed to break that snare and get away
with<00:03:15.100> it<00:03:15.400> although<00:03:15.579> it<00:03:15.730> was<00:03:15.910> constricted

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
with it although it was constricted

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.810 
with it although it was constricted
around<00:03:16.630> his<00:03:16.780> waist<00:03:17.190> it's<00:03:18.190> not<00:03:18.400> something<00:03:18.790> that

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
around his waist it's not something that

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.310 
around his waist it's not something that
might<00:03:19.060> have<00:03:19.209> happened<00:03:19.239> in<00:03:19.660> an<00:03:19.750> instant<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:20.290> he

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
might have happened in an instant and he

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.660 
might have happened in an instant and he
ran<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:20.709> got<00:03:20.799> away<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.070> think<00:03:21.400> he<00:03:21.489> would<00:03:21.609> have

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
ran and got away I think he would have

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.640 
ran and got away I think he would have
set<00:03:21.910> for<00:03:22.150> where<00:03:22.720> at<00:03:22.810> least<00:03:22.989> a<00:03:23.140> couple<00:03:23.320> of<00:03:23.440> days

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
set for where at least a couple of days

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.099 
set for where at least a couple of days
in<00:03:23.980> that<00:03:24.010> entire<00:03:24.820> caught<00:03:25.540> in<00:03:25.720> that<00:03:25.750> snare

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
in that entire caught in that snare

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.199 
in that entire caught in that snare
before<00:03:26.470> he<00:03:26.650> got<00:03:27.250> free<00:03:27.519> from<00:03:27.730> where<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:28.000> snare
