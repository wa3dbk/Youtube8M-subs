good because I had just changed my

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.050 
good because I had just changed my
masteries<00:00:25.160> hook-and-eye<00:00:26.160> all<00:00:26.519> say<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.730> change

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
masteries hook-and-eye all say to change

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.470 
masteries hook-and-eye all say to change
my<00:00:27.210> runes<00:00:27.449> up<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.840> do<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.910> more<00:00:29.910> efficiently

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
my runes up to do this more efficiently

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.179 
my runes up to do this more efficiently
now<00:00:30.750> there's<00:00:31.050> going<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> be<00:00:31.439> better<00:00:31.740> rune

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
now there's going to be better rune

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.580 
now there's going to be better rune
pages<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.940> better<00:00:33.360> masteries<00:00:33.989> for<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.350> but

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
pages and better masteries for this but

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.490 
pages and better masteries for this but
just<00:00:35.250> think<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:35.790> video<00:00:36.170> I'm<00:00:37.170> going<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.440> be

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
using just standard jungling masteries

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.310 
using just standard jungling masteries
and<00:00:41.070> for<00:00:42.000> runes<00:00:42.620> I'm<00:00:43.620> going<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.890> be<00:00:44.040> using

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
and for runes I'm going to be using

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.010 
and for runes I'm going to be using
ability<00:00:46.320> power<00:00:46.500> quince<00:00:46.980> just<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.820> help<00:00:47.969> at<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
ability power quince just to help at the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.380 
ability power quince just to help at the
beginning<00:00:49.289> because<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:50.250> hella<00:00:50.789> difficult

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
beginning because it's hella difficult

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.880 
beginning because it's hella difficult
to<00:00:52.100> you<00:00:53.100> know<00:00:53.329> sustained<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.570> jungle<00:00:55.050> with

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
to you know sustained in the jungle with

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.869 
to you know sustained in the jungle with
him<00:00:56.129> but<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.239> look<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.520> I<00:00:59.520> had<00:01:00.260> tax<00:01:01.260> be<00:01:01.469> marks

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
him but I look like I had tax be marks

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:09.039 
him but I look like I had tax be marks
and<00:01:05.150> armor<00:01:06.150> seals<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.080> magic<00:01:07.320> resist<00:01:07.560> glyphs

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.990 
and armor seals and magic resist glyphs
now<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.110> reason<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.650> got<00:01:10.799> drought<00:01:11.760> attack

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
now the reason I got drought attack

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.070 
now the reason I got drought attack
speed<00:01:12.270> marks<00:01:12.299> because<00:01:13.020> i<00:01:13.650> found<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.400> helps<00:01:14.640> out

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
speed marks because i found it helps out

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.620 
speed marks because i found it helps out
very<00:01:16.159> well<00:01:17.159> when<00:01:17.490> jungling<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.450> any

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
very well when jungling just any

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.969 
very well when jungling just any
champion<00:01:19.490> such<00:01:20.490> as<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.990> know<00:01:22.110> skarner<00:01:22.770> bull

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
champion such as you know skarner bull

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.679 
champion such as you know skarner bull
it<00:01:23.310> pretty<00:01:23.520> much<00:01:23.610> helped<00:01:24.030> out<00:01:24.180> with<00:01:24.210> every

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
it pretty much helped out with every

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.499 
it pretty much helped out with every
chance<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.979> be<00:01:26.100> completely<00:01:26.670> honest<00:01:27.119> with<00:01:27.270> you

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
chance to be completely honest with you

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.800 
chance to be completely honest with you
because<00:01:28.610> obviously<00:01:29.610> more<00:01:30.150> hits<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.540> going<00:01:30.750> to

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
because obviously more hits is going to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.580 
because obviously more hits is going to
do<00:01:30.960> more<00:01:31.170> damage<00:01:31.409> than<00:01:33.020> consistent<00:01:34.020> tolman

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
do more damage than consistent tolman

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.700 
do more damage than consistent tolman
like<00:01:35.070> 50<00:01:36.000> damage<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:37.110> don't<00:01:37.470> know<00:01:37.530> how<00:01:37.619> to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
like 50 damage I don't know how to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.120 
like 50 damage I don't know how to
explain<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:39.659> seems<00:01:39.900> like<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.409> tech

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
explain it but it just seems like a tech

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.969 
explain it but it just seems like a tech
speed<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.060> way<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> go<00:01:42.509> for<00:01:42.979> jungling

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
speed is just the way to go for jungling

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.770 
speed is just the way to go for jungling
and<00:01:44.369> professor<00:01:44.850> clear<00:01:45.060> time<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.630> better

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
and professor clear time and better

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.179 
and professor clear time and better
sustained<00:01:46.549> attack<00:01:47.549> speed<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:49.189> without

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
sustained attack speed is so without

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.140 
sustained attack speed is so without
further<00:01:50.250> ado<00:01:50.990> show<00:01:51.990> you

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.010 

he<00:01:56.150> is<00:01:56.990> very<00:01:57.260> here<00:01:57.620> it<00:01:58.430> basically<00:01:59.120> pushes

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
he is very here it basically pushes

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.880 
he is very here it basically pushes
verticals<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:01.130> effective<00:02:02.090> area<00:02:02.590> away<00:02:03.590> from

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
verticals the effective area away from

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.550 
verticals the effective area away from
you<00:02:06.670> I've<00:02:07.670> been<00:02:07.910> doing<00:02:08.180> is<00:02:08.360> kinda<00:02:09.320> you<00:02:09.530> know

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
you I've been doing is kinda you know

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.040 
you I've been doing is kinda you know
full<00:02:11.110> minions

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
full minions

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.600 
full minions
or<00:02:15.050> push<00:02:15.410> them<00:02:15.620> away<00:02:15.740> from<00:02:15.890> me<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:16.280> that<00:02:16.460> I<00:02:16.490> can

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
or push them away from me so that I can

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.470 
or push them away from me so that I can
tie<00:02:16.970> them<00:02:17.120> when<00:02:17.330> they<00:02:17.450> try<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.690> walk<00:02:17.930> back<00:02:18.550> so<00:02:19.550> I

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
tie them when they try to walk back so I

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:30.100 
tie them when they try to walk back so I
kind<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:20.930> messed<00:02:21.110> up<00:02:21.320> in<00:02:21.590> my<00:02:21.830> past<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:29.110> coming
