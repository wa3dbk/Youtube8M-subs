00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.350
 tarred with teal 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.910
 but the Parisians who had to be despite everything is well 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.910
 they are about to win their first win away from the 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.630
 season 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.630
 so that gave them here 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.700

 in March it would be well seen is that tactically the moment when it was necessary 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.769
 to do it is a little bit in the defense of a mac os x 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:40.619
 but that's yours I 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.619

 on the match sheet it takes 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.619

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:07.369

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.359
