00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
adjustments and I can tell already after

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.129 
adjustments and I can tell already after
only<00:04:31.400> a<00:04:31.550> few<00:04:31.610> hours<00:04:31.789> of<00:04:32.120> riding<00:04:32.240> off-road<00:04:32.720> I

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
only a few hours of riding off-road I

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.050 
only a few hours of riding off-road I
haven't<00:04:33.590> bottomed<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:34.039> bike<00:04:34.220> out<00:04:34.400> yet<00:04:34.700> and<00:04:34.970> on

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
haven't bottomed the bike out yet and on

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.940 
haven't bottomed the bike out yet and on
the<00:04:35.210> older<00:04:35.450> models<00:04:35.630> it<00:04:36.020> was<00:04:36.139> common<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:36.560> bottom

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.339 
the older models it was common to bottom
them<00:04:37.070> out<00:04:37.250> must<00:04:37.580> you<00:04:37.700> had<00:04:37.789> some<00:04:37.970> aftermarket

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349

parts<00:04:39.349> on<00:04:39.770> the<00:04:39.919> suspension<00:04:40.310> so<00:04:40.700> I<00:04:40.729> think

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
parts on the suspension so I think

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.830 
parts on the suspension so I think
they've<00:04:41.210> really<00:04:41.479> done<00:04:41.570> a<00:04:41.630> good<00:04:41.780> job

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840

and rock we just did a river crossing
here<00:05:21.840> and<00:05:21.990> it<00:05:22.050> does<00:05:22.200> those<00:05:22.440> just<00:05:22.740> fine<00:05:22.980> because

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
here and it does those just fine because

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.830

it's got the taller travel suspension
and<00:05:25.380> it's<00:05:25.530> a<00:05:25.620> just<00:05:26.370> ideally<00:05:26.940> suited<00:05:27.390> for<00:05:27.420> a

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
and it's a just ideally suited for a

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.770 
and it's a just ideally suited for a
wide<00:05:27.960> range<00:05:27.990> of<00:05:28.380> terrain
