00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
it's something that makes the first rut

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.899 
it's something that makes the first rut
like<00:01:15.090> run<00:01:15.420> almost<00:01:15.720> unplayable<00:01:16.220> so<00:01:17.220> let's<00:01:17.790> uh

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
like run almost unplayable so let's uh

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.100 
like run almost unplayable so let's uh
let's<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> look<00:01:18.570> here<00:01:18.689> I'm<00:01:18.810> using<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
let's have a look here I'm using the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.230 
let's have a look here I'm using the
same<00:01:19.290> skill<00:01:19.590> sets<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.040> both<00:01:20.189> put<00:01:20.400> their<00:01:21.060> guys

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
same skill sets in both put their guys

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.230 
same skill sets in both put their guys
so<00:01:21.450> there's<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.750> slight<00:01:22.369> pause<00:01:23.369> whenever<00:01:24.150> i

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
so there's a slight pause whenever i

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.940 
so there's a slight pause whenever i
activate<00:01:24.960> my<00:01:25.110> skills<00:01:25.409> there<00:01:25.560> that's<00:01:25.740> pretty

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
activate my skills there that's pretty

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.960

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
experience now let's go find some elites

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.740

cuz that's where it usually really kicks

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.020 
cuz that's where it usually really kicks
in<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.280> you're<00:01:32.520> seeing<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.820> lot<00:01:33.000> of

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
in so this you're seeing a lot of

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.749 
in so this you're seeing a lot of
stuttering<00:01:33.570> now<00:01:33.780> as<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.520> different<00:01:35.520> effects

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
stuttering now as the different effects

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.280 
stuttering now as the different effects
and<00:01:35.939> spells<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.360> things<00:01:36.570> he<00:01:36.659> used<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:37.079> that

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
and spells and things he used like that

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.800 
and spells and things he used like that
let's<00:01:38.159> go<00:01:38.340> ahead<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.880> find<00:01:39.090> elite<00:01:39.360> yes<00:01:39.600> but

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
let's go ahead and find elite yes but

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.390 
let's go ahead and find elite yes but
hopefully<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.439> something<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.740> yeah<00:01:41.250> there

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
hopefully it's something like yeah there

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.280 
hopefully it's something like yeah there
we<00:01:41.460> go<00:01:41.490> more<00:01:41.820> look<00:01:42.540> at<00:01:42.630> all<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.899> stuttering

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
we go more look at all that stuttering

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.380 
we go more look at all that stuttering
there<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.920> that's<00:01:44.040> as<00:01:44.280> all<00:01:44.549> these<00:01:44.759> elites<00:01:45.210> use

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
there so that's as all these elites use

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.660 
there so that's as all these elites use
all<00:01:45.540> their<00:01:45.689> effects<00:01:46.020> we've<00:01:46.200> got<00:01:46.290> plagued

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
all their effects we've got plagued

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.010 
all their effects we've got plagued
Mordor<00:01:47.670> all<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.899> legendary

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
Mordor all that and a legendary

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.130 
Mordor all that and a legendary
affection<00:01:49.740> no<00:01:49.979> less<00:01:50.220> haha<00:01:51.000> as<00:01:51.180> all<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.780> their

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
affection no less haha as all of their

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.840 
affection no less haha as all of their
well<00:01:52.619> I'm<00:01:52.710> glad<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:53.100> was<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.520> client

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
well I'm glad this was on this client

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.510 
well I'm glad this was on this client
not<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> other<00:01:54.329> one<00:01:54.509> as<00:01:54.659> all<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.770> as<00:01:56.189> all<00:01:56.399> of

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
not the other one as all that as all of

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.649 
not the other one as all that as all of
those<00:01:56.640> things<00:01:56.700> are<00:01:57.000> loaded<00:01:57.299> there's<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> lot<00:01:57.630> of

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
those things are loaded there's a lot of

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.240 
those things are loaded there's a lot of
stuttering<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.469> was<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.890> was<00:01:58.979> pretty

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
stuttering and that was that was pretty

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.830 
stuttering and that was that was pretty
obvious<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.790> was<00:01:59.880> pre<00:02:00.030> Nosal<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.689> I'm<00:02:00.750> gonna

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
obvious that was pre Nosal so I'm gonna

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.810 
obvious that was pre Nosal so I'm gonna
switch<00:02:01.020> over<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.290> PTR<00:02:01.649> client<00:02:02.009> now<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.369> test

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
switch over the PTR client now and test

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.280 
switch over the PTR client now and test
out<00:02:02.969> whether<00:02:03.149> it's<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.479> same<00:02:03.659> on<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.990> one<00:02:04.110> or

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
out whether it's the same on that one or

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.639 
out whether it's the same on that one or
whether<00:02:04.500> it's<00:02:04.710> non-existent<00:02:06.140> ok<00:02:07.140> guys<00:02:07.320> here<00:02:07.619> i

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
whether it's non-existent ok guys here i

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.650 
whether it's non-existent ok guys here i
am<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.039> PTR<00:02:08.369> clamp<00:02:08.789> let's<00:02:09.149> do<00:02:09.300> our<00:02:09.420> first

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
am on the PTR clamp let's do our first

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.080 
am on the PTR clamp let's do our first
initial<00:02:09.959> skill<00:02:10.440> check<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:10.860> before

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
initial skill check like before

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.360 
initial skill check like before
so<00:02:12.720> that's<00:02:12.870> really<00:02:13.080> smooth<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:13.739> does<00:02:14.129> really

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
so that's really smooth this does really

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.369 
so that's really smooth this does really
no<00:02:14.610> pauses<00:02:14.940> or<00:02:15.209> anything<00:02:15.540> there<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.230> that's

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
no pauses or anything there so that's

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.080 
no pauses or anything there so that's
that's<00:02:16.769> nice<00:02:17.010> but<00:02:17.190> let's<00:02:17.370> go<00:02:17.550> do<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.849> elite

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
that's nice but let's go do the elite

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.369 
that's nice but let's go do the elite
test<00:02:18.330> again<00:02:18.569> because<00:02:18.810> again<00:02:19.019> that's<00:02:19.140> the

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
test again because again that's the

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.759 
test again because again that's the
that's<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.010> real<00:02:20.250> test<00:02:20.519> of<00:02:20.700> this<00:02:21.080> now<00:02:22.080> I'm<00:02:22.290> I'm

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
that's the real test of this now I'm I'm

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.229 
that's the real test of this now I'm I'm
really<00:02:23.099> hoping<00:02:23.459> this<00:02:23.580> has<00:02:23.790> been<00:02:23.970> fixed

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
really hoping this has been fixed

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.509 
really hoping this has been fixed
because<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:25.560> asset<00:02:25.800> loading<00:02:26.069> layer<00:02:26.220> is<00:02:26.340> just

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
because the asset loading layer is just

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:33.170 
because the asset loading layer is just
a<00:02:26.610> constant<00:02:27.090> annoyance<00:02:27.450> in<00:02:27.629> this<00:02:30.709> not<00:02:32.180> some

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
a constant annoyance in this not some

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
a constant annoyance in this not some
some<00:02:33.690> very<00:02:34.140> slight<00:02:34.560> pauses<00:02:35.900> nothing<00:02:36.900> quite

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
some very slight pauses nothing quite

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.170 
some very slight pauses nothing quite
like<00:02:37.230> what<00:02:37.769> we<00:02:38.099> experienced<00:02:38.700> in<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.849> last<00:02:38.879> one

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
like what we experienced in the last one

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.729 
like what we experienced in the last one
you<00:02:39.330> saw<00:02:39.569> how<00:02:39.720> prominent<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.290> wasn't<00:02:40.560> lost<00:02:40.650> on

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
you saw how prominent it wasn't lost on

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.619 
you saw how prominent it wasn't lost on
especially<00:02:41.250> on<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.430> death<00:02:41.640> there<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.120> often

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
especially on the death there is often

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.509 
especially on the death there is often
quite<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.900> large<00:02:43.110> pores<00:02:43.590> on<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.010> death<00:02:44.220> of<00:02:44.400> the

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
quite a large pores on the death of the

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.059 
quite a large pores on the death of the
elites<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:44.910> things<00:02:45.120> like<00:02:45.239> that<00:02:46.069> another

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
elites and things like that another

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.710 
elites and things like that another
legendary<00:02:47.610> man<00:02:47.880> I'm<00:02:48.030> just<00:02:48.209> having<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.510> best

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
legendary man I'm just having the best

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.740 
legendary man I'm just having the best
luck<00:02:48.930> today<00:02:50.569> so<00:02:51.569> on<00:02:52.459> that's<00:02:53.459> 100%<00:02:54.000> conclusive

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
luck today so on that's 100% conclusive

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.240 
luck today so on that's 100% conclusive
but<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:55.079> would<00:02:55.260> say<00:02:55.410> that's<00:02:55.620> that's<00:02:55.980> fairly

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
but I would say that's that's fairly

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.710 
but I would say that's that's fairly
telling<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.849> there's<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.090> significant
