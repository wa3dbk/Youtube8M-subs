00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:05.600
 so a little video about the phones 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.050
 explay 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.469
 I have three pieces here right now 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:17.569
 This is the most ancient for him already two years 3 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:20.960
 7 books model b240 served me faith and 

00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:24.169
 true despite the hellish conditions in 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.109
 whom he visited worked he very 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:30.139
 well despite the fact that he had 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:34.370
 All 3 SIM cards are usually on the network 

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:36.500
 always kept batteries pretty good 2-3 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.920
 a day without any problems this is what you teach her 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.670
 I sometimes listened to music on it baby 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.219
 but went online but also read in 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.980
 I loved to read a book on it 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:52.460
 books despite all this enough 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.179
 he has good indicators of this phone 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.149
 already as i said two years this 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:04.390
 here are two new explay phones too 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:07.270
 They bought dvuhsimochnye well literally 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.369
 a few days ago 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.790
 bought as a gift people do not need much 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:20.930
 chic phone and nowhere to climb with 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:23.180
 they will not need dialers and two 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.049
 Sims seemed to me pretty now 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:32.979
 Still relevant given the fact that prices 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:39.229
 on communication, etc. etc. Well, so comfortable 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:43.420
 that we have a model of 240 p . 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:47.899
 here it is here white here 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.619
 built-in TV receiver and even in my 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.359
 areas where pretty bad and 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:57.640
 television signal 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:59.950
 oddly he catches one channel and 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.719
 shows up 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.310
 black and white image why are you 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.950
 black and white don't know maybe so 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.030
 put with a little hindrance but she 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.470
 there is 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.450
 maybe somewhere in the city where the signal 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.129
 better he will catch more and 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:22.220
 show more he has increased 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.220
 The battery here is 1200 microampere hours 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:32.569
 also has a flashlight well, where do without 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.569
 flashlight is on 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:58.700
 so here it is interesting unlocked 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:03.530
 see on the screen some order by 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:11.650
 here android clock supposedly time date 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:14.659
 the screen is not quite good bright well 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.090
 when we go to the main menu we see in 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:19.120
 The principle is the same as on old ones 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.810
 explay models 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:28.040
 nothing extraordinary here she 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:31.190
 old menu here is a little bigger 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.379
 despite the fact that the display hike him 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:39.730
 everyone has the same diagonal here 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:43.790
 2 and 4 inches screen but this one 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:51.920
 turn on see approximately the same 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:55.609
 most in general it seems to me 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.709
 The dialers will be good but just 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.199
 Specifically, here's how to call the phone 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.120
 can they be used more they 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:06.909
 principle, it is unlikely that then one little book 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:18.979
 read music listen as stated 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:21.500
 they support up to 32 gigabytes but me 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.810
 it seems so straight with a powerful card 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.970
 they should not be put on painfully 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:31.639
 strongly slow down the cameras on both 13 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:35.510
 megapixels yes they are 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:43.190
 and on both phones hardly any of them 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:46.320
 something good turns out to shoot but so 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:51.630
 in order to be clicked on 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:55.920
 avatar or something else is not so 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.090
 bad before collected phones are very good not 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.430
 creak do not play 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.790
 here here is some kind of hint 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:06.320
 design here this strip it is not straight 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:11.310
 a curved lid corresponds to it 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:13.490
 when no gaps closes either 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:17.900
 backlash and squeaks nothing dangles 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.900
 assembly is very good explay 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:27.500
 Well, in general, something like this 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:36.930
 boxes by the way pretty 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:39.840
 poor quality so let's say but before that 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.640
 here two years ago, what it was that 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.530
 there is if let's make a gift 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:48.680
 I need some kind of film 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:51.350
 wind inside the standard we have charging 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.900
 500 milliamps 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.820
 headset connecting cable to 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.620
 could connect to mfp or in 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:03.150
 charging user book 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.810
 there inside is pretty good 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.910
 description in Russian what are you like 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.000
 I saw this thing before it is not 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:15.300
 watched the telephone hotline 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.730
 about the guarantee back and forth supposedly 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:21.890
 You can call for free is the address 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:24.890
 site well and warranty card from the store 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.890
 everything
