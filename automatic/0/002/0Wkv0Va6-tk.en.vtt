on<00:02:15.850> it<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.120> little<00:02:16.390> bit<00:02:16.540> more<00:02:16.660> heavy<00:02:16.900> up<00:02:17.110> now<00:02:17.590> I

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
on it a little bit more heavy up now I

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.490 
on it a little bit more heavy up now I
could<00:02:17.950> find<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:18.400> quite<00:02:19.000> painful<00:02:19.510> ready<00:02:19.750> push

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
could find that quite painful ready push

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.690 
could find that quite painful ready push
down<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.280> then<00:02:22.030> slowly<00:02:22.690> kick<00:02:23.050> forward<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:24.580> me

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
down and then slowly kick forward to me

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.260 
down and then slowly kick forward to me
that's<00:02:24.970> really<00:02:25.540> painful<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.910> would<00:02:28.090> do

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
that's really painful and you would do

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.170 
that's really painful and you would do
about<00:02:28.570> six<00:02:29.020> to<00:02:29.230> eight<00:02:29.440> reps<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:30.100> this<00:02:33.030> do<00:02:34.030> it

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
about six to eight reps of this do it

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.380 
about six to eight reps of this do it
nice<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.420> slow<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:36.210> that's<00:02:37.210> about<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:40.150> I'm

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
nice and slow and that's about it so I'm

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.600 
nice and slow and that's about it so I'm
not<00:02:40.420> suggesting<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:41.140> doing<00:02:42.070> these<00:02:42.160> massages

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
not suggesting that doing these massages

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.210 
not suggesting that doing these massages
will<00:02:43.209> actually<00:02:43.510> solve<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.990> issue<00:02:44.140> of<00:02:44.470> pain

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
will actually solve the issue of pain

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.890 
will actually solve the issue of pain
for<00:02:45.550> example<00:02:45.610> that<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.180> might<00:02:46.390> feel<00:02:46.660> in<00:02:46.780> your

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
for example that you might feel in your

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.440 
for example that you might feel in your
fire<00:02:47.140> and<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.650> need<00:02:47.860> your<00:02:48.370> leg<00:02:48.610> in<00:02:49.150> your<00:02:49.270> back

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
fire and you need your leg in your back

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.350 
fire and you need your leg in your back
way<00:02:49.660> in<00:02:49.810> your<00:02:50.080> buttock<00:02:50.350> so<00:02:51.090> it's<00:02:52.090> best<00:02:52.270> that

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
way in your buttock so it's best that

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.840 
way in your buttock so it's best that
you<00:02:52.450> see<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:52.750> professional<00:02:53.140> such<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.709> myself<00:02:54.160> or

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
you see a professional such a myself or

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.930
