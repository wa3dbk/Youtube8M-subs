00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
and first of all you're not going to

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.149 
and first of all you're not going to
have<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.600> be<00:01:45.689> wasting<00:01:46.049> tons<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.590> your<00:01:46.890> neon

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
nail polish and second of all it's going

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.109 
nail polish and second of all it's going
to<00:01:49.229> prevent<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:50.130> know<00:01:50.280> polish<00:01:50.549> from<00:01:50.700> chipping

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
to prevent you know polish from chipping

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.260 
to prevent you know polish from chipping
that<00:01:51.450> much<00:01:51.630> quicker<00:01:52.040> also<00:01:53.040> i<00:01:53.310> notice<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.180> if

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
that much quicker also i notice that if

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.230 
that much quicker also i notice that if
use<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.600> base<00:01:54.780> coat<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.409> helps<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.280> base<00:01:57.000> coat

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
use the base coat it helps a base coat

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.289 
use the base coat it helps a base coat
in<00:01:57.509> my<00:01:58.200> opinion<00:01:58.500> acts<00:01:58.860> like<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> primer<00:01:59.520> for

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
in my opinion acts like a primer for
