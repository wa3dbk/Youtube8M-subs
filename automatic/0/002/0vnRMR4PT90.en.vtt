00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.450
 how about youtube friends welcome from 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:07.670
 new this your music channel my 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.700
 name is manuel and on this occasion 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.459
 I want to talk to you about a new 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.300
 disc a review about the new album 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:19.450
 of the Swedish band that goes by name 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:22.990
 diablo swing orchestra 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.230
 the devil's swing orchestra is a 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.170
 very interesting band that has achieved 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.020
 attract the attention of both the people of 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.510
 metalhead environment as I am as 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:39.289
 people from other types of 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.940
 musical cultures mainly the 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:45.420
 park and gothic 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.850
 heck and night he got his first 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.600
 material back in 2005 2006 with a 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.519
 disc that was called the butcher is powder 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.549
 later and another disc is to my liking 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:02.790
 it was much better that we are and we are not 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:06.030
 by dt and end the derby is long the 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:10.590
 name and now we come this 2012 with 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.690
 an album called pandora is piñata and it's 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.250
 very to what the title when the 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.500
 piñatas because because they are authentic 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.190
 piñata is a hodgepodge a salad 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.899
 tremendous of many styles very 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.080
 different 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.090
 incorporation of many elements 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.979
 Latin sounds encounters I find the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.800
 metal that we are used to 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.800
 listen to operatic voices section 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.380
 strings it is very difficult to catalog this 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.439
 to this to this type of music 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.890
 they call him to bank me 2 a metal of 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.680
 Vanguard 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.050
 but it's not the only thing that is not me not what 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.850
 I would only consider metal 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.650
 here there are too many elements to be 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.650
 considered exclusively metal 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.140
 and they could go a little bit to 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.090
 back and see the origins of this kind of 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.080
 bands I think everything has to do 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.170
 mainly with a band that 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:11.160
 originated more than twenty years ago 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.410
 romain tis 24 years old who was minister 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.140
 our background of Mongols the father of 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.180
 all is after such mixtures 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.190
 although someone that someone could give the 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.490
 argument that everything comes from that for 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.410
 but I think that mainly within the 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.450
 underground rock is covered in the 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.580
 question of the minister our fund 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.380
 side is the precursor subsequently 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.930
 people arrived as it is transferred as 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.239
 21st century stress like 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.859
 who else can we think of another band that 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.129
 I like a lot that we're going to 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:45.430
 talk later that is this clip and 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.959
 tango round being very good band 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:54.049
 is a little bit more in the roll more 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:56.420
 heavy and progressive and jazzy but of 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.849
 there comes directly this 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.099
 in this band of devils without watch this 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.830
 I like it a lot for its use of 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.260
 Trumpets mainly is very special 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.340
 that sound one would never imagine that 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.250
 trumpets could work 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.430
 adequately within what is the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.220
 metal or rock of this underground type 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.800
 the operatic voices without fear of 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.770
 use things that really are very 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.380
 studied as they are those of opera with 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.800
 voices shrill voices of rock 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.720
 traditional play with the full range of 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.910
 vocal this group which makes very 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.670
 interesting and very rich the sound that 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.470
 this band manages to project 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.569
 talk that the string section in this 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.760
 disk is not as prominent as in the 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:44.100
 previous but still fundamental 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.160
 to create that that 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.590
 perfect mix of what the band is about 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.870
 of projecting the band for itself created 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.239
 a myth around them that they 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:04:00.720
 they say they are the ones 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:04.080
 descendants of a group of musicians who 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.400
 they were persecuted in the middle ages by 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.800
 run 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.110
 precisely music and what 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.620
 before giving in to their 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.150
 to give up their ideals decided 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.739
 present after having lived 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.530
 as long in form as the resin 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.510
 they decided to introduce themselves and make a 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.520
 live presentation and submit to 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.910
 martyrdom of the 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.710
 of government and religion 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.050
 and they are now declaring their 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.200
 descendants who are rescuing 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.140
 exactly the music that these these 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.100
 fictitious yesteryear musicians 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.720
 supposedly interpreted and by the 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.480
 which were martyred 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.990
 go the story does not support it but it's 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.569
 interesting that he believes in them like that a 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:56.719
 a legend around them 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:59.899
 because it has brought both this and the 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:04.309
 environment darks of euros mainly 

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:06.379
 why not the end fins do not think so much 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:08.149
 because they are not they are not letters really 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:10.009
 they are understandable they look like an ogre c's and 

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:12.139
 listen and really pay attention to 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.779
 the net would only think so we wanted 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.089
 are adding up these guys are very 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:18.649
 Entertaining is very fun music 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:20.330
 too cheerful for what is the 

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:21.649
 dark environment but nevertheless has 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.479
 managed to capture attention I think that 

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:25.279
 It has a lot to do with the issue 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.300
 operatic and suddenly also something 

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:31.849
 poetic that is the origin of the band 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:35.419
 in addition to the appearance that they 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:37.999
 project we could talk about what is this 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:41.270
 is this this hodgepodge of age music 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:43.969
 it is very cacophonous there is a me for me in 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:47.119
 My personal taste is the culmination of 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:50.389
 his work I sincerely doubt that 

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:53.320
 are going to be able to produce something that 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:55.480
 do not be repetitive 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.960
 until now they have managed to maintain 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:01.720
 gone line and have managed to progress but 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.580
 I do not think that any more of this will be able to 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.500
 yes that there is a radical change in his 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.770
 style that will cost you fans because 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.020
 or they are marketed or flat bands to 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.000
 touch territories that are already going to alienate 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.310
 some of its bases now have achieved 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.230
 maintain that perfect balance of what 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:22.570
 what heavy rock is the operatic what 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.510
 give that they have made a perfect 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:29.890
 combination the very heavy curls in 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:31.690
 this on this in these devils records 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.220
 swing orchestra that along them 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.249
 have been characterized for me are rhythms 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.049
 what 

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:37.729
 I wish I do not have suddenly I listen 

00:06:36.049 --> 00:06:39.769
 suicide that will do and how can I how 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:42.409
 can combine the so perfectly with 

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:44.749
 trumpets with openable cube strings 

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:45.950
 but it fits perfectly and they fit very 

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:47.960
 all right 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.330
 heck, this is a band that everything 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.740
 stamp metalhead and every person who does not even 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.510
 want all metal in every person that 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.960
 it would be about the rock that he likes 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.910
 you must know thoroughly and that's how you 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.620
 they like the background as they are chewing gum 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:06.050
 chips like estrada steve mix I propose 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.910
 very same transforms for must put 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.330
 attention to this band because they work 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:13.940
 very very good music that for me is something 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.190
 which is a guarantee there is a lot of coherence in 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.890
 what they are doing does not feel like 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:21.500
 Although so many elements are used 

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:23.270
 so many influences you do not feel something that 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.970
 be simple and simply a 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:29.840
 hodgepodge make the result possible 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:31.490
 know exquisite is very good music and I 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.440
 I highly recommend and I think the 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.910
 can enjoy as much as a metalhead 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.860
 as a person who is inclusive 

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.960
 within the progressive or even people from 

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.610
 jazz everyone can enjoy this 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.460
 if you really appreciate the music 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.810
 I think that's all for today has been very 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.990
 pleasant to listen to this record I 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:50.720
 I highly recommend get it and so 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.880
 we will continue later with them 

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.200
 all kinds of music I thank you very much 

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.520
 my name is manuel, let's move forward 

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.520
 here we were until later
