a<00:01:04.260> very<00:01:04.530> very<00:01:04.769> simple<00:01:05.070> mechanism<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:06.119> is

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
a very very simple mechanism that is

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.120 
a very very simple mechanism that is
very<00:01:06.869> very<00:01:07.049> simple<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:08.420> attach<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:10.130> you

very very simple to attach and you

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.310 
very very simple to attach and you
mention<00:01:11.490> disconnect<00:01:12.030> magnetized<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.140> it's

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
mention disconnect magnetized so it's

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.710 
mention disconnect magnetized so it's
very<00:01:13.530> easy<00:01:13.700> magnets<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.909> sort<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.330> allow<00:01:15.659> you

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
very easy magnets that sort of allow you

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
to automatically you know when you

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.300 
to automatically you know when you
insert<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.659> as<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> magnets<00:01:19.259> engage<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:20.070> lock

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
insert it as the magnets engage to lock

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.149 
insert it as the magnets engage to lock
the<00:01:20.670> device<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.540> place<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.409> it's<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.799> very<00:01:23.009> very

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
sort of casual interaction with it I can

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.199 
sort of casual interaction with it I can
do<00:02:52.230> both<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.500> those<00:02:52.739> things<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.940> that's<00:02:54.060> how

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
do both of those things and that's how

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.050 
do both of those things and that's how
did<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.570> soften<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:56.160> bottom<00:02:56.489> part<00:02:56.850> this

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
did it soften the the bottom part this

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.890 
did it soften the the bottom part this
is<00:02:57.120> on<00:02:57.360> metal<00:02:57.690> or<00:02:57.980> we<00:02:58.980> got<00:02:59.190> metal<00:02:59.850> on<00:03:00.750> the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
is on metal or we got metal on the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.000 
is on metal or we got metal on the
outside<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.709> then<00:03:01.860> it's

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
outside of it and then it's

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.640 
outside of it and then it's
approximately<00:03:02.580> nice<00:03:02.790> iam<00:03:03.500> construction<00:03:04.500> in

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
approximately nice iam construction in

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.949 
approximately nice iam construction in
the<00:03:04.739> middle<00:03:04.770> and<00:03:05.370> again<00:03:05.790> hinge<00:03:06.450> is<00:03:06.660> probably

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
the middle and again hinge is probably

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.110 
the middle and again hinge is probably
the<00:03:07.080> most<00:03:07.170> advanced<00:03:07.709> piece<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.850> really

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
the most advanced piece of it you really

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.120 
the most advanced piece of it you really
look<00:03:09.269> at<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.600> know<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.750> very<00:03:10.410> very<00:03:10.500> advanced
