because this one gets in the way as one

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.740 
because this one gets in the way as one
downside<00:02:32.280> or<00:02:32.550> just<00:02:33.030> using<00:02:33.270> them<00:02:33.360> as<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.510> normal

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.540 
going to go back there no there no there
no<00:03:41.450> so<00:03:42.450> it's<00:03:42.780> not<00:03:42.900> very<00:03:42.990> flexible<00:03:43.200> however<00:03:43.920> it

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.690 
doesn't matter because the mic the mic
is<00:03:48.870> very<00:03:49.290> sensitive<00:03:49.770> which<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.460> good<00:03:50.550> thing

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
is very sensitive which is a good thing

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.250 
is very sensitive which is a good thing
because<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.210> picks<00:03:51.330> up<00:03:51.450> your<00:03:51.630> voice<00:03:51.810> very

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
clearly in high quality but it picks up

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.260 
clearly in high quality but it picks up
a<00:03:55.350> lot<00:03:55.380> of<00:03:55.590> background<00:03:55.830> noise<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.610> like

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
a lot of background noise and like
