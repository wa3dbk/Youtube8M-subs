00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
of each other directly I mean there's

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.800 
of each other directly I mean there's
all<00:01:59.050> sorts<00:01:59.380> of<00:01:59.470> things<00:01:59.620> like<00:01:59.830> ppm<00:02:00.310> and<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:00.850> you

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
all sorts of things like ppm and and you

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.660 
all sorts of things like ppm and and you
know<00:02:01.840> pitch<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:02.980> whether<00:02:03.190> even<00:02:03.460> the

groove of the loop is compatible with
other<00:02:06.250> loops<00:02:06.550> so<00:02:06.910> you<00:02:07.150> can<00:02:07.300> actually<00:02:07.420> check

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
other loops so you can actually check
