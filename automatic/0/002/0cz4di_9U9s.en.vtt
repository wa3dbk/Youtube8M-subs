components in DIY with PC Mag comm here
to<00:00:09.809> show<00:00:09.960> you<00:00:10.019> how<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.290> install<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.679> processor

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
to show you how to install a processor

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.950 
to show you how to install a processor
in<00:00:11.580> your<00:00:11.730> desktop<00:00:12.120> computers<00:00:12.509> motherboard

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
in your desktop computers motherboard

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.829 
in your desktop computers motherboard
now<00:00:13.889> when<00:00:14.490> we<00:00:14.730> install<00:00:15.059> processors<00:00:15.599> we

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
now when we install processors we

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:16.849 
now when we install processors we
usually<00:00:16.170> do<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.350> with<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.590> motherboard

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
usually do it with the motherboard

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.920 
usually do it with the motherboard
outside<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.850> case<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.779> have<00:00:18.900> a

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
outside of the case so that you have a

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.269 
outside of the case so that you have a
lot<00:00:19.109> more<00:00:19.140> room<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.470> work<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:20.010> that's<00:00:20.130> what

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
lot more room to work and that's what

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.960 
lot more room to work and that's what
we're<00:00:20.400> doing<00:00:20.580> here

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
we're doing here

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.460 
we're doing here
first<00:00:21.570> thing<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.810> do<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.140> open<00:00:22.320> the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
first thing to do is open the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.189 
first thing to do is open the
motherboard<00:00:22.890> socket<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.970> do<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.420> find<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
motherboard socket to do that find the

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.650 
motherboard socket to do that find the
metal<00:00:25.439> rod<00:00:25.800> here<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.340> holds<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.699> down<00:00:26.849> pull

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
metal rod here that holds it down pull

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.810 
metal rod here that holds it down pull
it<00:00:27.689> out<00:00:27.960> lift<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.830> up<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.279> socket<00:00:29.670> will

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
it out lift it up and the socket will

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.910 
it out lift it up and the socket will
race<00:00:30.000> before<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.750> though<00:00:30.960> find<00:00:31.679> out

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
race before you do that though find out

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.040 
race before you do that though find out
which<00:00:32.430> corner<00:00:32.880> has<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.270> triangle<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:33.899> it

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
which corner has the triangle on it

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.389 
which corner has the triangle on it
you'll<00:00:34.350> need<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.620> know<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.100> minute<00:00:35.309> in

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
you'll need to know this in a minute in

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.130 
you'll need to know this in a minute in
other<00:00:35.550> case<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:35.880> right<00:00:36.030> here<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.780> we<00:00:36.899> found

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
other case it's right here so we found

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.400 
other case it's right here so we found
that<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:38.070> I'll<00:00:38.160> lift<00:00:38.340> up<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.670> socket<00:00:38.879> cover

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
that and I'll lift up the socket cover

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.549 
that and I'll lift up the socket cover
now<00:00:40.410> once<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.520> your<00:00:41.910> processor<00:00:42.809> find

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
now once you have your processor find

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.639 
now once you have your processor find
the<00:00:43.800> golden<00:00:44.399> triangle<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.320> line<00:00:46.620> it

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
the golden triangle on it and to line it

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.670 
the golden triangle on it and to line it
up<00:00:46.920> with<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.850> corner<00:00:48.170> or<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.230> triangle

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
up with the corner or the triangle

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.490 
up with the corner or the triangle
appeared<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.460> socket<00:00:50.960> place<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.230> very

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
appeared on the socket place it in very

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.180 
appeared on the socket place it in very
gently<00:00:52.820> then<00:00:53.820> close<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.870> cover<00:00:55.079> once<00:00:56.039> you've

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
gently then close the cover once you've

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.330 
gently then close the cover once you've
done<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.910> need<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.149> add<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.510> CPU<00:00:57.899> cooler

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
done that you need to add the CPU cooler

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.830 
done that you need to add the CPU cooler
in<00:00:59.340> our<00:00:59.460> case<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.059> has<00:01:00.300> thermal<00:01:00.600> grease

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
in our case this has thermal grease

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.240 
in our case this has thermal grease
attached<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.739> might<00:01:01.890> have<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.129> add

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
attached to it you might have to add

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.380 
attached to it you might have to add
some<00:01:02.280> yourself<00:01:02.699> if<00:01:03.030> you're<00:01:03.149> buying<00:01:03.270> your

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
some yourself if you're buying your

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.149 
some yourself if you're buying your
cooler<00:01:03.660> separately<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> stock<00:01:04.830> cooler

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
cooler separately this is a stock cooler

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.429 
cooler separately this is a stock cooler
so<00:01:05.280> we<00:01:05.369> don't<00:01:05.489> have<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.670> do<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.990> so<00:01:06.990> all<00:01:07.229> we're

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
so we don't have to do that so all we're

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.380 
so we don't have to do that so all we're
doing<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.830> we're<00:01:08.010> lining<00:01:08.340> up<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.640> posts<00:01:09.240> on

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
doing is we're lining up the posts on

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.990 
doing is we're lining up the posts on
the<00:01:09.540> side<00:01:10.170> here<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.610> they<00:01:11.729> all<00:01:11.850> go

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
the side here so that they all go

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.850 
the side here so that they all go
through<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> holes<00:01:12.510> then<00:01:13.080> press<00:01:13.380> down<00:01:13.650> on

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
through the holes then press down on

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.740 
through the holes then press down on
opposing<00:01:14.159> corners<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:16.200> secure<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.009> fan<00:01:17.750> like

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
opposing corners to secure the fan like

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.020 
opposing corners to secure the fan like
so<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.560> try<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.799> tug<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.280> up<00:01:20.369> gently<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.880> it

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
so if you try to tug it up gently and it

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.060 
so if you try to tug it up gently and it
doesn't<00:01:21.299> cop<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.659> know<00:01:21.750> you're<00:01:21.930> okay<00:01:22.200> then

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
doesn't cop you know you're okay then

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.710 
doesn't cop you know you're okay then
simply<00:01:23.610> plug<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.600> heatsink<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:26.720> to

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
processors there are two bars that you

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.880 
processors there are two bars that you
need<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.060> open<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.630> instructions<00:01:49.470> printed<00:01:49.799> on

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
need to open and instructions printed on

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.649 
need to open and instructions printed on
the<00:01:50.009> socket<00:01:50.250> will<00:01:50.729> tell<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.210> which<00:01:51.390> one<00:01:51.420> you

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
the socket will tell you which one you

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.480 
the socket will tell you which one you
need<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.960> open<00:01:52.049> first<00:01:52.439> after<00:01:53.189> you've<00:01:53.310> put<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
need to open first after you've put the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.370 
need to open first after you've put the
processor<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.090> close<00:01:54.570> them<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:54.990> opposite

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
processor in close them in the opposite

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.350 
processor in close them in the opposite
order<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.710> you're<00:01:55.799> ready<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.040> go<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.460> you're

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
order and you're ready to go if you're

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.999 
order and you're ready to go if you're
installing<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.810> CPU<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.350> an<00:01:58.439> AMD<00:01:58.770> motherboard

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
installing a CPU in an AMD motherboard

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.130 
installing a CPU in an AMD motherboard
the<00:01:59.369> process<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.030> little<00:02:00.570> bit<00:02:00.810> different

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
the process is a little bit different

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.399 
the process is a little bit different
again<00:02:02.240> we<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> bar<00:02:03.630> here<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:04.049> it's<00:02:04.320> a

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
again we have a bar here but it's a

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.440 
again we have a bar here but it's a
slightly<00:02:04.770> different<00:02:04.950> type<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.000> pull<00:02:06.360> it

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
slightly different type so you pull it

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.109 
slightly different type so you pull it
out<00:02:06.570> lift<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.530> up<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.039> socket<00:02:08.489> shifts

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
out lift it up and the socket shifts

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.979 
out lift it up and the socket shifts
ever<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.810> slightly<00:02:10.129> line<00:02:11.129> up<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.750> triangle<00:02:12.750> on

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
ever so slightly line up the triangle on

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.490 
ever so slightly line up the triangle on
the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.070 
the
processor<00:02:14.010> with<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.900> triangle<00:02:15.900> in<00:02:15.990> the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
processor with the triangle in the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.870 
processor with the triangle in the
socket<00:02:16.530> place<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:16.980> very<00:02:17.340> carefully<00:02:17.550> you

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
socket place it very carefully you

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.220 
socket place it very carefully you
really<00:02:18.240> don't<00:02:18.360> want<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.540> bend<00:02:18.690> these<00:02:18.870> pins

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
really don't want to bend these pins

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.980 
really don't want to bend these pins
then<00:02:19.980> push<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.460> bar<00:02:20.640> down<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.210> walk<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.870> into

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
then push the bar down and walk it into

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.950 
then push the bar down and walk it into
place<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.890> cooler<00:02:23.160> for<00:02:23.700> AMD<00:02:24.360> processors

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
place so the cooler for AMD processors

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.750 
place so the cooler for AMD processors
is<00:02:25.200> really<00:02:25.710> where<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.980> major<00:02:26.130> difference<00:02:26.610> is

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
is really where the major difference is

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.690 
is really where the major difference is
here<00:02:27.170> just<00:02:28.170> place<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.440> down<00:02:28.620> on<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.250> processor

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
here just place it down on the processor

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.360 
here just place it down on the processor
like<00:02:29.910> that<00:02:30.180> then<00:02:30.959> line<00:02:31.170> up<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.350> metal<00:02:31.800> clip

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
like that then line up the metal clip

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.630 
like that then line up the metal clip
with<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:32.850> plastic<00:02:33.600> hook<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.770> just<00:02:35.070> slide<00:02:35.400> the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
with the plastic hook and just slide the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.870 
with the plastic hook and just slide the
bar<00:02:35.910> back<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.780> secure<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.440> in<00:02:37.530> place<00:02:37.880> and

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
bar back to secure it in place and

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.310 
bar back to secure it in place and
that's<00:02:39.000> all<00:02:39.240> there<00:02:39.360> is<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.780> for<00:02:39.990> more<00:02:40.140> tips

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
that's all there is to it for more tips
