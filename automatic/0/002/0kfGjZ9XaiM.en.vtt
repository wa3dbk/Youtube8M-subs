the pace and how much better he is the
matage<00:01:21.420> but<00:01:21.750> phenomenal<00:01:22.380> matic<00:01:22.880> so<00:01:23.880> left<00:01:24.270> me

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
matage but phenomenal matic so left me

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.929 
matage but phenomenal matic so left me
look<00:01:24.689> what<00:01:24.869> Eden<00:01:25.439> Hazard<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.159> now<00:01:26.340> here's<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
look what Eden Hazard so now here's the

look what Eden Hazard so now here's the
guy<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.900> bumps<00:01:28.320> up<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.500> process<00:01:28.799> but<00:01:29.250> so

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
guy that bumps up the process but so

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.230 
guy that bumps up the process but so
he's<00:01:29.579> prophesying<00:01:29.790> about<00:01:30.890> 220,000<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.610> if<00:01:33.000> you

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
he's prophesying about 220,000 so if you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.960 
he's prophesying about 220,000 so if you
have<00:01:33.540> someone<00:01:33.840> might<00:01:34.079> surely<00:01:34.500> he<00:01:35.490> will<00:01:35.700> go

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
have someone might surely he will go

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.270 
have someone might surely he will go
down<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.780> squabble<00:01:37.200> go<00:01:37.320> down<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> lot<00:01:37.770> more<00:01:37.950> so

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
down this squabble go down a lot more so

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.210 
down this squabble go down a lot more so
at<00:01:38.640> right<00:01:39.000> now<00:01:39.030> we<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.630> salad<00:01:40.020> with<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.500> 93

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
at right now we have salad with that 93

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.139 
at right now we have salad with that 93
pace<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:43.020> here's<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.470> here's<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.520> blister<00:01:45.060> on

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
pace so here's a here's a blister on

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.530 
pace so here's a here's a blister on
that<00:01:45.329> pace<00:01:46.369> it's<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.060> difficult<00:01:48.299> to

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
that pace it's just so difficult to

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.740 
that pace it's just so difficult to
catch<00:01:48.689> him<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.110> can<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:50.009> matter<00:01:50.479> but<00:01:51.479> I

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
catch him so can we have matter but I

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.990 
catch him so can we have matter but I
think<00:01:52.259> he's<00:01:52.350> got<00:01:52.530> perfect<00:01:52.979> stats<00:01:53.399> for<00:01:53.579> cam<00:01:53.790> you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
think he's got perfect stats for cam you
