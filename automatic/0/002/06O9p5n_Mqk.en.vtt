00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.100
 general failure church march 1 russia on 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.950
 month becomes chairman of the board 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.050
 UN security about how it will affect 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.610
 on the agenda of the organization we will talk 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.500
 with a russian representative in the un 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.179
 Vitaly Churkin named Vitaly Ivanovich 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.379
 thank you very much for agreeing 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.270
 chat with rt 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.550
 tell us about the priorities of the Russian 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.210
 Security Council Presidency List 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.760
 big isn't it he since in March us 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.619
 there is a lot of work to be done by one 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.599
 among the priorities will be a discussion on 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.090
 Afghanistan at the ministerial level 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.430
 The mandate of the un mission in this country will be 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.860
 extended for another year and it will be very 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.399
 an important period for afghanistan light 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.340
 upcoming April presidential election 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:46.559
 2014 he Putin let's talk about 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.750
 another equally important issue is that 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.510
 continue to do a series of council members 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.160
 there is no unity on this issue as russia 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.079
 going to bring all these different 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.359
 opinions to a common denominator our position 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.520
 Yes, we simply can’t believe it’s time 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.379
 end the violence and for that 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.750
 it is necessary to conduct a dialogue without any 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.880
 prerequisite Syrian 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.250
 the government has already announced that it has appointed 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.049
 her team of negotiators she 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.560
 put forward their suggestions on this 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.840
 dialogue 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.939
 Unfortunately, in recent days, the opposition 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.280
 moved away from her original promises 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.710
 made by the leader of the national coalition 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.140
 ahmed al-hatib's willingness to start 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.509
 negotiations with the government this is 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.520
 the main problem I'm afraid without 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.380
 negotiations and without political will with 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.810
 parties of all the Syrian participants 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.030
 conflict the international community is unlikely 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.700
 Is it capable of something to help comments but 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.920
 think posts with last us message 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.750
 promised to lend to the Syrian opposition 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.659
 non-combat support 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.549
 what about military support who her 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.640
 provides and what thinks about it 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.310
 Russia scorpion demar from the safe at the bureau 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.350
 for certain reasons, the united states do not want 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.600
 be involved in direct delivery 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.149
 weapons militants among which there are 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.520
 terrorists and other figures and ties to 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.219
 which they would like to spoil their 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.500
 reputation but at the same time they encourage 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.239
 actions of those who provide direct 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.140
 military support in armed 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.450
 groupings 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.030
 opposition and Syrian National Council 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.130
 must fulfill their previous promise about 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.900
 willingness to engage in dialogue let them 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.880
 will develop a detailed political 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.580
 the program because they have never 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.770
 presented nothing like in January 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.120
 President Bashar al-Assad 's speech was 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.670
 outlined the political program 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.950
 government can be opposition she and 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.290
 not satisfied but at least it is 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.570
 the opposition has long been outlined 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.480
 response program with which she could 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.830
 would go into negotiations with the government 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.570
 Russia and we hope others 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.700
 influential members of the international 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.010
 communities will contribute to this 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.780
 Negotiations in bizerte packaged must 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.790
 will say let's go now to 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.590
 Iran’s problem as far as we know 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.019
 No negotiations in Kazakhstan 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.489
 breakthrough did not happen iran stated that in 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.510
 in a certain sense they passed in 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.480
 in a positive way 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.410
 but everyone agrees that in general they were 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.880
 the participants are unsuccessful simply 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.510
 have appointed the next round of negotiations 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.790
 how do you comment on the six 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.070
 made a number of new initiatives with 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.690
 active participation of Russia can you say 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.560
 that in these negotiations were put forward 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.790
 some fundamentally new proposals 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.680
 I would not say that they were 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.750
 fundamentally new but appeared 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.880
 individual new items which 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.890
 may help attract finally 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.540
 Iranians in the dialogue on the most important 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.200
 a question to give them still to be 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.200
 work
