00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
and slowly add the power since you can

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.770 
and slowly add the power since you can
drive<00:01:11.010> through<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> situation<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.240> having

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
is if it snows at least three times a

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.340 
is if it snows at least three times a
year<00:01:26.670> where<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.030> are<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.570> temperatures<00:01:28.140> dip

below 30 degrees you probably need

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.140 
below 30 degrees you probably need
winter<00:01:31.170> tires<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.829> don't<00:01:32.430> forget<00:01:32.700> about<00:01:32.759> that

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
winter tires and don't forget about that

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.660 
winter tires and don't forget about that

tonight<00:02:05.329> because<00:02:05.659> of<00:02:05.929> a<00:02:06.049> widespread<00:02:06.409> threat

here's<00:02:07.640> how<00:02:07.850> black<00:02:08.119> ice<00:02:08.360> happens<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:08.959> starts

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
here's how black ice happens it starts

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.110 
here's how black ice happens it starts
off<00:02:09.440> when<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:09.950> have<00:02:10.129> precipitation<00:02:10.670> falling

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
off when you have precipitation falling

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.119 
off when you have precipitation falling
but<00:02:11.360> kind<00:02:11.629> of<00:02:11.720> at<00:02:11.810> that<00:02:11.840> marginal<00:02:12.590> temperature

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
but kind of at that marginal temperature

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:15.820 
but kind of at that marginal temperature
snow<00:02:13.580> might<00:02:14.090> hit<00:02:14.239> the<00:02:14.390> ground<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:15.019> melt<00:02:15.530> at

snow might hit the ground and melt at

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.890 
snow might hit the ground and melt at
first<00:02:16.250> but<00:02:16.519> once<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.879> temperatures<00:02:17.330> drop<00:02:17.660> at

first but once the temperatures drop at

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.470 
first but once the temperatures drop at
night<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.290> will<00:02:18.379> then<00:02:18.560> refreeze<00:02:19.489> on<00:02:19.819> the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
night it will then refreeze on the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.750 
night it will then refreeze on the
ground<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:20.959> it<00:02:21.019> refreezes<00:02:21.410> in<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.769> very<00:02:22.280> thin

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
ground and it refreezes in a very thin

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.839 
ground and it refreezes in a very thin
almost<00:02:23.660> an<00:02:23.840> invisible<00:02:23.930> layer<00:02:24.620> it<00:02:25.160> looks<00:02:25.489> black

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
almost an invisible layer it looks black

almost an invisible layer it looks black
from<00:02:26.299> above<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:26.930> can<00:02:26.959> sometimes<00:02:27.440> only<00:02:27.680> see<00:02:27.829> it

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
from above you can sometimes only see it

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.470 
from above you can sometimes only see it
because<00:02:28.099> your<00:02:28.220> headlights<00:02:28.700> shine<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.120> little

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
because your headlights shine a little

because your headlights shine a little
differently<00:02:29.930> sometimes<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.470> looks<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.739> more

differently sometimes it looks a more

differently sometimes it looks a more
dull<00:02:31.250> or<00:02:31.549> it<00:02:31.670> shines<00:02:32.000> back<00:02:32.390> at<00:02:32.599> you<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:32.989> that

dull or it shines back at you and that

dull or it shines back at you and that
can<00:02:33.860> be<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.010> very<00:02:34.099> dangerous<00:02:34.579> situation<00:02:34.940> very

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
can be a very dangerous situation very

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.769 
can be a very dangerous situation very
