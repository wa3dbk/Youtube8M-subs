you<00:00:52.379> can't<00:00:52.710> really<00:00:52.860> see<00:00:52.980> how<00:00:53.670> she<00:00:53.730> looks<00:00:54.510> like

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
you can't really see how she looks like

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.139 
you can't really see how she looks like
I<00:00:55.110> mean<00:00:55.680> how<00:00:55.800> her<00:00:55.949> hair<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.730> there<00:00:56.910> it's

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
I mean how her hair is in there it's

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.510 
I mean how her hair is in there it's
pretty<00:00:57.719> dark<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> background<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.250> I'm

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
pretty dark like the background but I'm

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.599 
pretty dark like the background but I'm
assuming<00:01:00.149> like<00:01:00.420> it's<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.989> braided<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:02.190> twist

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
assuming like it's a braided or a twist

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.539 
assuming like it's a braided or a twist
but<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.210> did<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> twist<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:05.339> very

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
but I you I did a twist so it's very

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.230 
but I you I did a twist so it's very
simple<00:01:06.299> all<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:07.320> need<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.580> hair<00:01:09.000> tie

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
simple all you need is just a hair tie

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.030 
simple all you need is just a hair tie
and<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:10.380> think<00:01:10.799> that's<00:01:11.010> about<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.610> guess<00:01:13.040> but

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
and I think that's about it I guess but

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.999 
and I think that's about it I guess but
yeah<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.119> stay<00:01:15.720> tuned<00:01:16.049> for<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.830> want

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
yeah so stay tuned for that if you want

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.350 
yeah so stay tuned for that if you want
to<00:01:17.070> keep<00:01:17.189> if<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.490> want<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.119> look
