00:00:01.811 --> 00:00:04.265
 A few raw vegans 

00:00:06.701 --> 00:00:09.477
 Hi, I'm Alison Andrews and I'm 34 years old. 

00:00:09.512 --> 00:00:11.723
 And I'm Jay Lentin and I'm 33 years old. 

00:00:11.724 --> 00:00:14.290
 We both follow the lifestyle of raw veganism 

00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:15.457
 with lots of fruits. 

00:00:15.458 --> 00:00:18.493
 We follow the principles of 80/10/10 by Dr. Douglas Graham. 

00:00:18.494 --> 00:00:22.486
 We've been together for 7 years, including 4 years. 

00:00:22.487 --> 00:00:26.134
 We met at work in night clubs in South Africa. 

00:00:26.135 --> 00:00:29.421
 Earlier our lives were revolving around long night shifts, 

00:00:29.422 --> 00:00:32.309
 drinking and a few hours of sleep over the day. 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.645
 We were both looking for someone to challenge and inspire us. 

00:00:35.646 --> 00:00:38.222
 So when we got together, there was a strong bond between us. 

00:00:38.223 --> 00:00:42.175
 Much of our relationship and social life revolved around food. 

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:44.170
 We loved eating in restaurants. 

00:00:44.171 --> 00:00:47.859
 We loved it when we could stay home and have our food delivered. 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.212
 We tried to switch to raw food for several years. 

00:00:50.213 --> 00:00:52.750
 Together we became vegans and then largely raw vegans 

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:54.511
 and we gradually switched to completely raw food. 

00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:58.029
 The best news for me was that I can eat how much fruit I want. 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.998
 The biggest challenge for us was to unite 

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:08.634
 cooked gourmet meals in restaurants and eat raw and healthy food. 

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:12.083
 Luckily, we came across on our way to hell 

00:01:12.118 --> 00:01:15.421
 the work of doctors like John McDougall and Joel Fuhrman. 

00:01:15.422 --> 00:01:20.800
 So we managed to clarify the health benefits of herbal diet. 

00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:23.889
 When we finally discovered the work of Dr. Douglas Graham 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.009
 it was like a cherry on a banana pudding. 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.424
 It was so simple and it made a lot of sense. 

00:01:28.425 --> 00:01:33.164
 It works because we are planning success, rather than failure. 

00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:40.072
 We challenge each other to be the best, not to endure it. 

00:01:40.073 --> 00:01:42.620
 It's really all about being inspired and 

00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:45.823
 surrounded by people who were successful and followed people 

00:01:45.824 --> 00:01:47.608
 who have achieved what you want to achieve. 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:51.644
 The biggest reason that keeps me on a raw diet is the level of happiness 

00:01:51.645 --> 00:01:53.676
 which I am able to achieve on a raw diet. 

00:01:53.677 --> 00:01:56.213
 It's incomparable to anything else I can do. 

00:01:56.214 --> 00:01:58.466
 But I totally fight for fruit together. 

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:02.016
 Jaye likes to eat all my mature manga before I even get a chance. 

00:02:02.017 --> 00:02:07.450
 I often get home in anticipation of fantastic dates and find that they have already eaten them. 

00:02:07.451 --> 00:02:12.677
 It is really important in the relationship to ensure enough good food for both. 

00:02:12.678 --> 00:02:18.158
 We both have our own Vitamix mixer, so we don't have to look for it when it comes to cocktail time. 

00:02:18.668 --> 00:02:20.137
 Jaye strongly supports me. 

00:02:20.137 --> 00:02:24.763
 It mixes the melon that I can take with me to work for breakfast. 

00:02:24.764 --> 00:02:29.320
 When I'm late for work, Alison often has a great salad prepared for me. 

00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:32.545
 It's really great to have a partner that supports your lifestyle. 

00:02:32.546 --> 00:02:40.551
 This way of life inspired us to become my greatest passion in life. 

00:02:40.552 --> 00:02:43.676
 And that was the reason for my website: LovingItRaw.com 

00:02:43.677 --> 00:02:47.255
 I just wanted to share everything about this lifestyle with the rest of the world. 

00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:57.795
 It's really wonderful to be in a relationship where both have a passion for healthy food. 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.602
 It's so tasty and beautiful. It will make the relationship much better. 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.913
 Eat fruits. It's very good for your relationship. 

00:03:14.914 --> 00:03:16.879
