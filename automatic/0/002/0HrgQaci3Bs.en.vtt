00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.569
 today is a bit 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:13.600
 or a special plaster as they compose masses 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.650
 that they present then they get these 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:25.840
 vetoes making those balls that said 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:27.640
 filled with these compounds are masses and 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.220
 accepted everything an expensive ball is 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.940
 cutting will not tend on the table 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.940
 with great skill 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:42.740
 has its frame 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.740
 just now this is what happens 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.519
 look they played if you want that is a 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.519
 little is still hot 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.700
 to work all the time 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.540
 they are advancing and that we queue 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:03.670
 rabbit that acts as retarded then 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:05.699
 already once you have your mass that more or 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.699
 less 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.630
 Well, then it's a job 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.530
 devastated like natural stone the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.240
 plaster stucco 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:25.860
 according to what I think I have read is a 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:30.030
 Italian technique that was born a bit to 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.030
 counteract that 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.190
 the hard stone school of the 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.530
 medici that did all this work 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.050
 even tare employees et cetera but in 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.190
 natural stone with the work that the 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.190
 stucco is much bigger 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.380
 in which I have been able to cut these lines 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.070
 and you see it a little are the hands of 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.610
 the Sistine Chapel and made here the 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.610
 empty the letters 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.700
 and that 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.560
 Well, from this work they go 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.560
 doing times 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.740
 she for example
