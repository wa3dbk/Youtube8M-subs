00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
four four two and the reason I did that

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.229

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
sort of made a few teams that I could

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.110 
sort of made a few teams that I could
possibly<00:03:23.120> work<00:03:24.049> towards<00:03:24.769> and<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.850> ones<00:03:26.030> that

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.809 
possibly work towards and the ones that
I<00:03:26.209> made<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.690> best<00:03:26.840> ones<00:03:27.140> were<00:03:27.440> 442<00:03:28.190> so<00:03:28.609> I

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
I made the best ones were 442 so I

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.750 
I made the best ones were 442 so I
thought<00:03:29.299> I'd<00:03:29.510> sort<00:03:30.500> of<00:03:30.709> swap<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.370> that<00:03:31.400> right

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
thought I'd sort of swap to that right

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.400 
thought I'd sort of swap to that right

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
quite strong as I built this team up and

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.400 
quite strong as I built this team up and
my<00:04:33.060> phone<00:04:33.360> is<00:04:33.390> going<00:04:34.200> off<00:04:34.440> crazy<00:04:35.100> so<00:04:36.410> basically

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
my phone is going off crazy so basically

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.400 
my phone is going off crazy so basically
what<00:04:37.560> I'm<00:04:37.680> trying<00:04:37.950> to<00:04:38.010> do<00:04:38.220> now<00:04:38.430> is<00:04:38.610> build<00:04:38.910> a

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
what I'm trying to do now is build a

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.990 
what I'm trying to do now is build a
basic<00:04:40.410> Premier<00:04:41.100> League<00:04:41.250> team<00:04:41.580> that<00:04:41.760> I<00:04:41.820> can

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
basic Premier League team that I can

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.610 
basic Premier League team that I can
build<00:04:42.240> on<00:04:42.450> when<00:04:42.630> I<00:04:42.660> get<00:04:42.960> a<00:04:42.990> lot<00:04:43.200> of<00:04:43.260> coins

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
build on when I get a lot of coins

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.440 
build on when I get a lot of coins
because<00:04:43.950> obviously<00:04:44.280> I<00:04:44.610> can't<00:04:44.940> just<00:04:45.120> go<00:04:45.300> out

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
because obviously I can't just go out

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.300 
because obviously I can't just go out
and<00:04:45.480> buy<00:04:45.720> someone<00:04:46.050> like<00:04:46.230> Aguero<00:04:46.710> because

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
and buy someone like Aguero because

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.750 
and buy someone like Aguero because
there<00:04:48.120> are<00:04:48.240> a<00:04:48.270> hell<00:04:48.570> of<00:04:48.600> a<00:04:48.780> lot<00:04:48.930> of<00:04:49.050> money<00:04:49.080> so

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
there are a hell of a lot of money so

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.280 
there are a hell of a lot of money so
right<00:04:50.760> now<00:04:50.790> I'm<00:04:51.090> just<00:04:51.120> building<00:04:51.450> it<00:04:51.690> up<00:04:51.810> and<00:04:52.050> I

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
right now I'm just building it up and I

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.650 
right now I'm just building it up and I
think<00:04:52.590> that<00:04:52.830> did<00:04:52.980> say<00:04:53.190> you<00:04:53.250> play<00:04:53.490> for<00:04:53.760> QPR<00:04:54.180> so

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
think that did say you play for QPR so

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.600 
think that did say you play for QPR so
we're<00:04:55.350> going<00:04:55.470> to<00:04:55.560> replace<00:04:55.890> one<00:04:56.160> of<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:56.340> strike

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
we're going to replace one of the strike

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.700 
we're going to replace one of the strike
is<00:04:56.820> here<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.240> just<00:04:57.450> fiddle<00:04:57.780> around<00:04:57.870> a<00:04:58.200> bit

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
is here and just fiddle around a bit

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.440 
is here and just fiddle around a bit
just<00:04:59.040> to<00:04:59.220> get<00:04:59.400> as<00:04:59.610> much<00:04:59.820> chemistry<00:05:00.240> as

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
just to get as much chemistry as

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.820 
just to get as much chemistry as
possible<00:05:00.930> we're<00:05:01.050> on<00:05:01.140> 73<00:05:01.800> right<00:05:02.340> now<00:05:02.550> and<00:05:03.830> I

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
possible we're on 73 right now and I

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.630 
possible we're on 73 right now and I
believe<00:05:05.670> I'm<00:05:05.910> going<00:05:06.090> to<00:05:06.270> be<00:05:06.420> buying<00:05:06.720> like<00:05:07.170> one

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
believe I'm going to be buying like one

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.580 
believe I'm going to be buying like one
or<00:05:08.640> two<00:05:09.030> more<00:05:09.330> players<00:05:09.660> in<00:05:10.050> this<00:05:10.230> episode

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
or two more players in this episode

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.830 
or two more players in this episode
there<00:05:11.400> won't<00:05:11.520> be<00:05:11.700> any<00:05:11.820> gameplay<00:05:12.090> this<00:05:12.450> episode

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
there won't be any gameplay this episode

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.480 
there won't be any gameplay this episode
because<00:05:13.050> like<00:05:13.410> I<00:05:13.560> said<00:05:13.620> I've<00:05:14.040> been<00:05:14.070> really

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
because like I said I've been really

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.480 
because like I said I've been really
busy<00:05:14.760> so<00:05:15.270> I<00:05:15.570> just<00:05:16.260> thought<00:05:16.470> I'd<00:05:16.530> record<00:05:17.040> a<00:05:17.280> bit

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
busy so I just thought I'd record a bit

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.150 
busy so I just thought I'd record a bit
of<00:05:17.610> like<00:05:17.850> team<00:05:18.480> management<00:05:18.870> and<00:05:19.290> next<00:05:19.800> episode

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
of like team management and next episode

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.850 
of like team management and next episode
there<00:05:20.370> will<00:05:20.490> be<00:05:20.670> at<00:05:20.940> least<00:05:21.000> two<00:05:21.480> games<00:05:21.780> so<00:05:22.320> I'm

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
there will be at least two games so I'm

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.910 
there will be at least two games so I'm
gonna<00:05:23.010> record<00:05:23.430> a<00:05:23.580> few<00:05:23.790> in<00:05:23.940> advance<00:05:24.300> so<00:05:24.920> there

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
gonna record a few in advance so there

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.520 
gonna record a few in advance so there
will<00:05:26.040> definitely<00:05:26.280> be<00:05:26.550> new<00:05:26.910> gameplay<00:05:27.390> soon<00:05:27.720> but

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
will definitely be new gameplay soon but

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.730 
will definitely be new gameplay soon but
we<00:05:29.100> go<00:05:29.580> for<00:05:29.910> Odemwingie<00:05:30.600> who<00:05:30.990> is<00:05:31.260> a<00:05:31.290> bit<00:05:31.590> of<00:05:31.680> a

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
we go for Odemwingie who is a bit of a

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.250 
we go for Odemwingie who is a bit of a
beast<00:05:31.920> plays<00:05:32.310> for<00:05:32.580> West<00:05:32.880> Brom<00:05:33.150> he's<00:05:33.750> got<00:05:33.930> 81

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
beast plays for West Brom he's got 81

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.360 
beast plays for West Brom he's got 81
pace<00:05:34.590> as<00:05:34.830> well<00:05:35.010> so<00:05:35.340> quite<00:05:36.090> quick<00:05:36.390> and<00:05:37.010> pace<00:05:38.010> in

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
pace as well so quite quick and pace in

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.160 
pace as well so quite quick and pace in
this<00:05:38.520> game<00:05:38.730> even<00:05:38.910> though<00:05:39.180> EA<00:05:39.420> said<00:05:39.900> it

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
this game even though EA said it

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.140 
this game even though EA said it
wouldn't<00:05:40.560> rely<00:05:40.800> on<00:05:40.950> pace<00:05:41.160> it<00:05:41.460> really<00:05:41.670> does<00:05:41.940> so

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
wouldn't rely on pace it really does so
