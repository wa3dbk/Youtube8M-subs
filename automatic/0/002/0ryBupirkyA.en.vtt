noises these cans would light up in the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.980 
noises these cans would light up in the
tip<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.250> he's<00:00:21.029> light<00:00:21.210> up<00:00:21.359> green<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.930> I

notice<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:24.750> painted<00:00:26.029> the<00:00:27.619> these<00:00:28.619> would<00:00:28.800> be

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
notice I have painted the these would be

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.650 
notice I have painted the these would be
clear<00:00:29.220> plastic<00:00:29.490> normally<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.210> painted<00:00:30.510> them

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
clear plastic normally I painted them

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.930 
clear plastic normally I painted them
black<00:00:30.689> but<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.199> did<00:00:31.410> leave<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:32.009> front<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.850> them

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
black but I did leave the front of them

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.069 
black but I did leave the front of them
it's<00:00:33.059> hard<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.270> tell<00:00:33.420> here<00:00:33.630> but<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.840> did<00:00:33.960> leave

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
it's hard to tell here but I did leave

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.410 
it's hard to tell here but I did leave
the<00:00:34.230> Front's<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.530> them<00:00:34.680> clear<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.399> if<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.270> were

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the Front's of them clear so if you were

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.639 
the Front's of them clear so if you were
to<00:00:36.540> fire<00:00:36.719> them<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.960> would<00:00:37.140> still<00:00:37.380> see<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
to fire them you would still see the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.950 
to fire them you would still see the
LEDs<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:39.090> then<00:00:39.239> they<00:00:39.360> but<00:00:39.600> they<00:00:39.660> don't<00:00:39.840> look

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
LEDs but then they but they don't look

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.950 
LEDs but then they but they don't look
quite<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:40.260> out<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.559> place<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:42.000> just<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
quite as out of place is the just the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.440 
quite as out of place is the just the
clear<00:00:43.200> plastic<00:00:43.350> ones<00:00:43.910> on<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.059> turret<00:00:45.300> does

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
clear plastic ones on the turret does

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.439 
clear plastic ones on the turret does
rotate<00:00:47.570> on<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.520> this<00:00:50.520> shirt<00:00:50.820> rotates

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
rotate on this and this shirt rotates

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.920 
rotate on this and this shirt rotates
independently<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:53.149> the<00:00:54.149> cannon<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.780> be

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
independently and the cannon can be

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.080 
independently and the cannon can be
raised<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.620> lowered<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:56.070> few<00:00:56.430> degrees<00:00:58.910> we<00:00:59.910> can

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
raised and lowered a few degrees we can

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.549 
raised and lowered a few degrees we can
position<00:01:00.270> these<00:01:00.660> kind<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.199> with<00:01:01.350> their<00:01:01.469> own

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
position these kind of with their own

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.870 
position these kind of with their own
springs<00:01:01.980> they<00:01:02.129> tend<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.399> pop<00:01:02.579> back<00:01:02.789> into<00:01:03.000> place

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
springs they tend to pop back into place

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.789 
springs they tend to pop back into place
for<00:01:05.880> comparison<00:01:06.540> size<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.020> tank<00:01:07.229> load<00:01:07.409> areas

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
for comparison size and tank load areas

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.300 
for comparison size and tank load areas
next<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:09.619> movie<00:01:10.619> bumblebee

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
next to movie bumblebee

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.030 
next to movie bumblebee
it's<00:01:12.119> about<00:01:12.299> near<00:01:13.290> as<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.530> figure<00:01:13.619> that's

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
it's about near as I can figure that's

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.350 
it's about near as I can figure that's
actually<00:01:14.369> probably<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.790> fairly<00:01:15.090> accurate

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
actually probably a fairly accurate

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.990 
actually probably a fairly accurate
scale<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> don't<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.340> tank<00:01:17.640> next<00:01:17.850> to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
scale but I don't have this tank next to

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.640 
scale but I don't have this tank next to
this<00:01:18.119> car<00:01:18.390> -<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.780> don't<00:01:18.869> hire<00:01:19.110> pictures<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.560> it

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
this car - I don't hire pictures of it

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.760 
this car - I don't hire pictures of it
to<00:01:19.680> confirm<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.530> guessing<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.650> how

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
to confirm that but just guessing on how

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.340 
to confirm that but just guessing on how
big<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> person<00:01:23.430> would<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:24.290> comparison<00:01:25.290> I

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
big a person would be in comparison I

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.080 
big a person would be in comparison I
would<00:01:25.500> assume<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:25.970> close<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.180> actual<00:01:28.110> scale

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
would assume it's close to actual scale

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.219 
would assume it's close to actual scale
probably<00:01:30.090> not<00:01:30.240> exact<00:01:30.659> but<00:01:30.930> close

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.530 

transformation<00:01:34.759> start<00:01:35.759> off<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.299> want

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
transformation start off you just want

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.080 
transformation start off you just want
to<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.960> push<00:01:37.200> these<00:01:37.430> tank<00:01:38.430> lights<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.000> you'll

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
to you push these tank lights and you'll

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.230 
to you push these tank lights and you'll

see the side panels automatically flip
back<00:01:42.420> some<00:01:43.399> and<00:01:44.399> from<00:01:45.030> there<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.509> can

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
if you want I'm going to rotate them out

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.610 
if you want I'm going to rotate them out
at<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.540> knees<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:48.280> forward-facing<00:02:48.820> position

and<00:02:50.620> then<00:02:50.709> open<00:02:51.070> up<00:02:51.130> this<00:02:51.280> feet<00:02:52.230> like<00:02:53.230> so<00:02:54.570> he

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
and then open up this feet like so he

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.750 
and then open up this feet like so he
does<00:02:55.750> have<00:02:55.930> some<00:02:56.170> angle<00:02:57.010> swivels<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:57.519> help

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.120 

plugs<00:03:57.030> in<00:03:58.460> then<00:03:59.460> this<00:03:59.670> side<00:04:00.060> panel<00:04:00.360> right<00:04:00.660> here

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
plugs in then this side panel right here

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.200 
plugs in then this side panel right here
pops<00:04:02.130> off<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.570> can<00:04:03.720> pull<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.020> gun<00:04:04.230> out<00:04:05.210> or

pops off and you can pull the gun out or

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.100 
pops off and you can pull the gun out or
just<00:04:06.270> pull<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:06.960> all<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.080> way<00:04:07.170> off<00:04:08.690> like<00:04:09.690> that<00:04:09.900> I

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
just pull it all the way off like that I

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.330 
just pull it all the way off like that I
just<00:04:10.380> broke<00:04:10.710> it<00:04:11.990> genius<00:04:12.990> well<00:04:13.260> normally<00:04:14.220> this

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
just broke it genius well normally this

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.920 
just broke it genius well normally this
would<00:04:14.490> not<00:04:14.580> break<00:04:14.850> like<00:04:15.090> that<00:04:15.300> I'll<00:04:15.570> fix<00:04:15.870> it

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
would not break like that I'll fix it

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.580 
would not break like that I'll fix it
when<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.140> get<00:04:16.200> home<00:04:17.720> but<00:04:18.720> you<00:04:18.840> pull<00:04:19.049> this<00:04:19.170> turret

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
when I get home but you pull this turret

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.660 
when I get home but you pull this turret
up<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:20.670> the<00:04:20.760> side<00:04:21.000> here<00:04:21.330> and<00:04:22.130> then<00:04:23.130> this<00:04:23.340> piece

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
up to the side here and then this piece

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.520 
up to the side here and then this piece
snaps<00:04:24.180> back<00:04:24.360> into<00:04:24.420> place<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.140> then<00:04:25.410> the

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
snaps back into place and then the

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.480 
snaps back into place and then the
turret<00:04:25.890> can<00:04:26.040> either<00:04:26.160> rotate<00:04:27.060> out<00:04:28.190> to<00:04:29.190> point

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
turret can either rotate out to point

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.160 
turret can either rotate out to point
forward<00:04:29.760> or<00:04:30.120> I<00:04:30.360> usually<00:04:30.750> just<00:04:30.900> leave<00:04:30.990> it

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
forward or I usually just leave it

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.490 
forward or I usually just leave it
hanging<00:04:31.830> down<00:04:32.160> to<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.490> side<00:04:32.730> in<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.030> back

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
hanging down to the side in the back

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:45.800 
hanging down to the side in the back
because<00:04:34.500> it<00:04:34.650> just<00:04:34.800> gets<00:04:34.950> in<00:04:35.040> the<00:04:35.130> way

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.399 

the<00:04:46.810> arms<00:04:47.169> just<00:04:48.039> a<00:04:48.159> simple<00:04:48.490> matter<00:04:48.699> of

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:49.409 
the arms just a simple matter of

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:51.450 
the arms just a simple matter of
rotating<00:04:50.409> them<00:04:50.499> down<00:04:50.710> so<00:04:50.919> the<00:04:51.039> Gold's<00:04:51.370> in

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
rotating them down so the Gold's in

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.550 
rotating them down so the Gold's in
front<00:04:51.840> rotating<00:04:52.840> them<00:04:52.930> around<00:04:53.169> at<00:04:53.409> the

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
front rotating them around at the

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.929 
front rotating them around at the
shoulder<00:04:54.520> school

00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:54.939 
shoulder school

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:58.619 
shoulder school
this<00:04:55.659> gun<00:04:55.960> flips<00:04:56.499> up<00:04:56.680> and<00:04:56.830> around<00:04:57.129> and<00:04:57.629> snaps

00:04:58.619 --> 00:04:58.629 
this gun flips up and around and snaps

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:01.290 
this gun flips up and around and snaps
onto<00:04:58.900> his<00:04:59.050> forearm<00:04:59.560> like<00:04:59.919> that<00:05:00.219> you<00:05:01.060> can<00:05:01.180> open

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
onto his forearm like that you can open

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.929 
onto his forearm like that you can open
up<00:05:01.449> poses<00:05:02.139> fingers<00:05:02.499> I<00:05:02.680> mean<00:05:03.430> if<00:05:03.550> you<00:05:03.639> slide

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:03.939 
up poses fingers I mean if you slide

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:07.469 
up poses fingers I mean if you slide
this<00:05:04.090> forward<00:05:05.099> cannon<00:05:06.099> extends<00:05:06.699> and<00:05:06.849> sight

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
this forward cannon extends and sight

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:11.790 
this forward cannon extends and sight
pops<00:05:07.810> up<00:05:08.849> and<00:05:09.849> this<00:05:10.090> arms<00:05:10.389> same<00:05:10.629> thing<00:05:10.900> rotate

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
pops up and this arms same thing rotate

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.159 
pops up and this arms same thing rotate
it<00:05:11.889> so<00:05:12.009> the<00:05:12.129> Gold's<00:05:12.460> on<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.639> front<00:05:12.879> and<00:05:13.169> then

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
it so the Gold's on the front and then

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.839 
it so the Gold's on the front and then
you<00:05:14.560> be<00:05:14.710> normal<00:05:14.800> I<00:05:15.069> think<00:05:15.099> it's<00:05:15.400> rotated

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
you be normal I think it's rotated

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.070 
you be normal I think it's rotated
during<00:05:15.939> transformation<00:05:16.389> but<00:05:16.689> your<00:05:16.779> rotator

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
during transformation but your rotator

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.260 
during transformation but your rotator
around<00:05:17.259> so<00:05:17.349> that's<00:05:17.439> facing<00:05:17.860> forward<00:05:18.270> cannon

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
around so that's facing forward cannon

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.959 
around so that's facing forward cannon
on<00:05:19.389> this<00:05:19.509> side<00:05:19.659> also<00:05:19.900> rotates<00:05:20.319> up<00:05:20.439> and<00:05:20.590> snaps

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:20.969 
on this side also rotates up and snaps

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:25.409 
on this side also rotates up and snaps
you<00:05:21.969> can<00:05:22.120> flip<00:05:22.330> up<00:05:22.449> a<00:05:22.569> Gatling<00:05:22.960> gun<00:05:24.300> kind<00:05:25.300> of<00:05:25.389> a

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
you can flip up a Gatling gun kind of a

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.510 
you can flip up a Gatling gun kind of a
machine<00:05:25.750> gun<00:05:25.930> there<00:05:26.110> on<00:05:26.229> his<00:05:26.590> arm<00:05:26.800> as<00:05:27.039> well<00:05:27.340> as

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
machine gun there on his arm as well as

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.570 
machine gun there on his arm as well as
if<00:05:27.669> you<00:05:27.759> slide<00:05:28.000> this<00:05:28.120> peaceful<00:05:28.539> backwards

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
if you slide this peaceful backwards

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.999 
if you slide this peaceful backwards
blades<00:05:30.580> pop<00:05:30.969> up<00:05:31.180> and<00:05:31.870> again<00:05:32.620> you've<00:05:32.770> got<00:05:32.800> the

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
blades pop up and again you've got the

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.809 
blades pop up and again you've got the
poseable<00:05:33.370> fingers<00:05:33.699> over<00:05:33.909> here<00:05:35.610> and<00:05:36.610> then<00:05:36.729> on

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:36.819 
poseable fingers over here and then on

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:41.850 
poseable fingers over here and then on
the<00:05:36.939> back<00:05:38.550> this<00:05:39.550> separate<00:05:40.300> cannon<00:05:40.659> tank<00:05:40.930> our

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
the back this separate cannon tank our

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.800 
the back this separate cannon tank our
turret<00:05:42.279> rotates<00:05:42.669> all<00:05:42.819> the<00:05:42.939> way<00:05:43.029> up<00:05:43.560> and<00:05:45.810> these

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
turret rotates all the way up and these

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.700 
turret rotates all the way up and these
pieces<00:05:47.110> right<00:05:47.439> here<00:05:47.639> can<00:05:48.639> be<00:05:48.669> split<00:05:49.089> to<00:05:49.710> come

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
pieces right here can be split to come

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.610 
pieces right here can be split to come
up<00:05:50.860> and<00:05:51.509> rotate<00:05:52.509> around<00:05:52.870> up<00:05:53.229> over<00:05:53.500> his

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
up and rotate around up over his

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.149 
up and rotate around up over his
shoulders

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:57.159 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.570 

so<00:05:58.029> from<00:05:58.239> the<00:05:58.360> front<00:05:59.039> it<00:06:00.039> becomes<00:06:00.309> a<00:06:00.399> very

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
so from the front it becomes a very

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:10.700 
so from the front it becomes a very
heavily<00:06:00.969> armored<00:06:01.529> tank

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710

now he's got pretty good articulation

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.850 
now he's got pretty good articulation
he's<00:06:12.780> got<00:06:13.070> shoulders<00:06:14.070> forward<00:06:14.550> and<00:06:14.580> ratchets

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
he's got shoulders forward and ratchets

he's got shoulders forward and ratchets
swivel<00:06:17.870> here<00:06:18.870> he<00:06:19.710> does<00:06:19.919> have<00:06:20.130> the<00:06:20.340> move<00:06:21.180> his
