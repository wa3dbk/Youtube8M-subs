 in the second third acerina next to 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.060
 stellar class that powers x 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.860
 the outside to five bodies of 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.630
 this one is in fifth place 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.610
 the laurentis specimen after the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.880
 stream and still lady ashton in the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.550
 last place 800 meters to the end 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.550
 dominating town king but huasca 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.490
 huasca approaches two long huÃ¡scar 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.130
 numbers in 75 seconds and a fifth 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.590
 huasca against tanking is in the mouth 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.600
 warns head in the final 600 meters 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.460
 meanwhile stellar class this 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.409
 third six long with the fifth exit 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.360
 laurentis after that lady follows 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.330
 ashton eliminated in the last place 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.240
 they are turning the last curve though 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.820
 wraps against huesca when they enter the 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.160
 right to talking dominating guasch to 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.470
 cost in the final 300 meters 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.470
 they left hundreds in sheaf attacks 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.509
 laurentis for the third although 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.519
 dominate half the straight huesca 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.550
 I feel effort for the inside 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:14.400
 so kin dominating huesca stuck in the 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.580
 medium long for second place it 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.420
 it comes down to them in the liked classic 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.690
 jota calabria carried forward talking 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.040

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.040
 talking from end to end 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.040
 second huasca third laurentis fourth 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.190
 far star class after the 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.140
 Acerina Creek and Lady Ashton just like 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.140
