00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.390
 presents the cereal bar so for 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.719
 do our bar serve it 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.450
 we need 70 g of cereals 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.089
 so these are honey balls that we 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.490
 found in supermarkets and then we 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.490
 70 g sweetened condensed milk 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.419
 then after that we will need about 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.419
 100 g of milk chocolate 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.690
 we put sweetened condensed milk to 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:46.330
 boil once that happens and we 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.030
 mix with cereals is the 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:52.030
 cook until the sugar 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:56.710
 caramelizes so we'll see it in the 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:00.150
 bottom of the pan then after us the 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.150
 heels on film paper 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.229
 so here we see that the milk 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.969
 concentrated caramelizing 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.969
 so it's time to remove it from the gas 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.020
 then in the baking paper 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.719
 we will try to make a good 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.109
 rectangle to be able to develop 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.109
 beautiful bars 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.890
 and let it cool for two hours at 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.810
 freezer then after we take a 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.740
 kitchen knife and we detail this 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:10.119
 So mark the long the size that 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.119
 you want it does not matter 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.990
 knowing that in supermarkets the bars 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.100
 weighed at 25 g here are the bars either 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.100
 about cardiac 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.090
 so here are the ponds are cut 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.870
 we have more than she is diving 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.870
 in chocolate 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.870
 so I melted the chocolate 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:55.379
 microwave milk and it does not stay anymore 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.760
 than put the bar on a cardboard and 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.760
 cool in the fridge 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.569
 here is the recipe is over I you 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.440
 give an appointment on the cakes of the 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.440
