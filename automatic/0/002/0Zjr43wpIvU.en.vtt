Defen tool box it accepts HDMI in and it

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.859 
Defen tool box it accepts HDMI in and it
will<00:02:04.439> output<00:02:04.829> HDMI<00:02:05.430> out<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.360> what<00:02:06.540> we<00:02:06.630> do<00:02:06.750> is

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869

whatever camera we happen to be using so

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.320 
whatever camera we happen to be using so
for<00:02:17.890> using<00:02:18.160> everything<00:02:18.519> right<00:02:19.090> now<00:02:19.120> we're

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
for using everything right now we're

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.420 
for using everything right now we're
using<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.569> Panasonic<00:02:20.110> f100<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.040> everything<00:02:21.310> is

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
using a Panasonic f100 so everything is

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.720 
using a Panasonic f100 so everything is
1080i<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:23.170> we<00:02:23.709> just<00:02:23.920> make<00:02:24.340> everything<00:02:24.550> in

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
1080i and we just make everything in

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.759 
1080i and we just make everything in
that<00:02:24.879> format<00:02:25.239> so<00:02:25.720> with<00:02:25.870> that<00:02:26.019> said<00:02:26.290> let's<00:02:26.590> go

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
that format so with that said let's go

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.229 
that format so with that said let's go
ahead<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.220> go<00:02:27.370> kind<00:02:27.640> of<00:02:27.700> go<00:02:27.790> behind<00:02:28.120> the

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
ahead and go kind of go behind the

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.670 
ahead and go kind of go behind the
scenes<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.690> we<00:02:28.840> will<00:02:28.989> use<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.260> camera<00:02:29.530> on

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
scenes and we will use the camera on

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.559 
scenes and we will use the camera on
this<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:30.069> see<00:02:30.190> what's<00:02:30.400> going<00:02:30.519> on<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.360> I'm<00:02:31.450> gonna

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
go ahead and kind of use that camera and

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.350 
go ahead and kind of use that camera and
again<00:02:39.310> this<00:02:39.670> will<00:02:39.819> show<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.030> some<00:02:40.209> of<00:02:40.239> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
again this will show you some of the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.080 
again this will show you some of the
limitations<00:02:40.900> kind<00:02:41.200> of<00:02:41.260> going<00:02:41.530> back<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.709> forth

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
limitations kind of going back and forth

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
limitations kind of going back and forth
so<00:02:43.090> now<00:02:43.209> we're<00:02:43.330> kind<00:02:43.420> of<00:02:43.510> going<00:02:43.629> behind<00:02:43.840> the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
so now we're kind of going behind the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.360 
so now we're kind of going behind the
scenes<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:46.450> if<00:02:46.599> you<00:02:46.750> look<00:02:46.930> over<00:02:47.200> here<00:02:47.230> in<00:02:47.799> terms
