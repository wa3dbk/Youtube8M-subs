performance in terms of battery
everything's<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.990> let's<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:25.380> do<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:26.010> quick

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
everything's so so let's just do a quick

everything's so so let's just do a quick
app<00:00:26.939> opening<00:00:27.480> speed<00:00:27.810> test<00:00:28.019> here<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:29.250> check<00:00:29.550> out

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
app opening speed test here to check out

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.060 
app opening speed test here to check out
the<00:00:29.849> speed<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.510> let's<00:00:31.500> just<00:00:31.679> close<00:00:31.890> everything

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
the speed so let's just close everything

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.090 
the speed so let's just close everything
in<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.430> background<00:00:32.960> so<00:00:33.960> let's<00:00:34.410> just<00:00:34.710> do<00:00:34.890> this

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
in the background so let's just do this

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.220 
in the background so let's just do this
first<00:00:36.090> i'm<00:00:36.210> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.390> open<00:00:36.450> up<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.930> dollar

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
first i'm going to open up the dollar

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.900 
first i'm going to open up the dollar
here<00:00:37.649> one<00:00:37.890> two<00:00:38.070> three<00:00:38.399> go<00:00:40.219> seems<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.640> pretty

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
here one two three go seems to be pretty

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.610 
here one two three go seems to be pretty
equal<00:00:42.420> there<00:00:43.040> let's<00:00:44.040> open<00:00:44.399> up<00:00:44.640> these<00:00:44.969> settings

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
equal there let's open up these settings

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
equal there let's open up these settings
from<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:47.270> from<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> app<00:00:48.510> drawer<00:00:48.950> so<00:00:49.950> one<00:00:50.399> two

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
from the from the app drawer so one two

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.299 
from the from the app drawer so one two
three<00:00:51.000> go<00:00:53.120> see<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.300> nexus<00:00:54.870> 5<00:00:55.170> vols<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.829> little

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
three go see like nexus 5 vols a little

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.729 
three go see like nexus 5 vols a little
bit<00:00:56.399> quicker<00:00:56.610> let's<00:00:56.969> do<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.239> one<00:00:58.170> more<00:00:58.410> time

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
bit quicker let's do this one more time

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.060 
bit quicker let's do this one more time
I<00:01:02.030> mean<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.300> personally<00:01:03.530> notice<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.769> that

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
I mean I personally notice that that

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.130 
I mean I personally notice that that
battery<00:01:05.880> life<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> performance<00:01:06.780> has

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
battery life and the performance has

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.890 
battery life and the performance has
been<00:01:07.170> improved<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.830> lot<00:01:08.040> i<00:01:08.100> flash<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:09.600> two

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
been improved a lot i flash it like two

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.399 
been improved a lot i flash it like two
days<00:01:10.110> ago<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:11.100> i<00:01:11.130> didn't<00:01:11.400> make<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.549> video<00:01:12.409> you

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
days ago so i didn't make a video you

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.230 
days ago so i didn't make a video you
know<00:01:13.530> when<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:14.040> flash<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.670> i<00:01:14.729> used<00:01:15.060> it

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
know when I just flash it so i used it

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.890 
know when I just flash it so i used it
for<00:01:15.479> some<00:01:15.689> days<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.110> have<00:01:16.290> my<00:01:16.500> experience<00:01:16.979> so

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
for some days to have my experience so

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.800 
for some days to have my experience so
let's<00:01:18.900> do<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.110> again<00:01:19.200> one<00:01:19.530> two<00:01:19.560> three<00:01:19.890> go<00:01:20.810> again

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
let's do it again one two three go again

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.090 
let's do it again one two three go again
the<00:01:22.200> Nexus<00:01:22.500> 5<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.369> little<00:01:23.909> bit<00:01:24.030> quicker

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
the Nexus 5 is a little bit quicker

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.670 
the Nexus 5 is a little bit quicker
let's<00:01:26.100> open<00:01:26.909> up<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:28.610> let's<00:01:29.610> see<00:01:29.759> which<00:01:30.210> app

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
let's open up the let's see which app

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.020 
let's open up the let's see which app
calculator<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.579> default<00:01:32.990> calculator<00:01:33.990> app<00:01:35.030> so

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
calculator the default calculator app so

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.200 
calculator the default calculator app so
here<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.020> calculator<00:01:40.189> yes<00:01:41.189> see<00:01:41.490> ya

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
here we have the calculator yes see ya

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.310 
here we have the calculator yes see ya
one<00:01:42.930> two<00:01:43.079> three<00:01:43.110> go<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:45.360> again<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.840> seems<00:01:46.049> like

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
one two three go and again it seems like

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.679 
one two three go and again it seems like
the<00:01:46.500> Nexus<00:01:46.920> 5<00:01:47.159> vols<00:01:47.520> little<00:01:48.360> bit<00:01:48.479> quicker

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
the Nexus 5 vols little bit quicker

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.670 
the Nexus 5 vols little bit quicker
there<00:01:50.180> so<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.630> see<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.140> very

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
there so you can see that it is very

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.120 
there so you can see that it is very
well<00:01:52.860> optimized<00:01:53.430> now<00:01:53.899> let's<00:01:54.899> open<00:01:55.320> up<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
well optimized now let's open up the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.039 
well optimized now let's open up the
Geekbench<00:01:56.729> 3<00:01:57.140> app<00:01:58.140> here<00:01:58.469> one<00:01:58.710> two<00:01:58.860> three<00:01:59.130> go

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
Geekbench 3 app here one two three go

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.370 
Geekbench 3 app here one two three go
gain<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.200> Nexus<00:02:01.530> 5<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.770> quicker<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:03.350> by<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
gain the Nexus 5 is quicker and by the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.740 
gain the Nexus 5 is quicker and by the
way<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.829> quad-core<00:02:05.250> snaring<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:05.939> 800<00:02:06.540> and

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
way this is quad-core snaring in 800 and

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.520 
way this is quad-core snaring in 800 and
this<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.560> delay<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> chipset<00:02:08.819> dual<00:02:09.330> core<00:02:09.750> 64

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
this is a delay a chipset dual core 64

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.890 
this is a delay a chipset dual core 64
bit<00:02:11.039> where<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.280> versus<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.200> 32-bit<00:02:13.200> here

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
bit where this versus the 32-bit here

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.920 
bit where this versus the 32-bit here
let's<00:02:14.379> open<00:02:14.920> up<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:18.480> messaging<00:02:19.480> app<00:02:19.629> here

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
let's open up the messaging app here

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.759 
let's open up the messaging app here
that<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.140> use<00:02:20.530> versus<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.519> messaging<00:02:21.939> app<00:02:22.090> here

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
that I use versus the messaging app here

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:30.860 
that I use versus the messaging app here
so<00:02:23.970> one<00:02:24.970> two<00:02:25.120> three<00:02:25.360> go<00:02:27.269> so<00:02:28.269> almost<00:02:28.950> equal

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
so one two three go so almost equal

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:38.099
