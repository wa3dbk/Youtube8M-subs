00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
guys I'm gonna show you how to make

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.240 
guys I'm gonna show you how to make
these<00:00:08.519> little<00:00:08.700> gumdrop<00:00:09.389> meringues<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.710> you

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
these little gumdrop meringues and you

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.730 
these little gumdrop meringues and you
can<00:00:11.400> either<00:00:11.639> have<00:00:12.030> them<00:00:12.269> with<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.809> red<00:00:13.200> swirl

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
can either have them with the red swirl

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.000 
can either have them with the red swirl
so<00:00:14.460> they<00:00:14.580> almost<00:00:14.820> look<00:00:15.299> like<00:00:15.330> mint<00:00:16.080> candies<00:00:16.590> or

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
so they almost look like mint candies or

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.740 
so they almost look like mint candies or
then<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.400> can<00:00:17.520> just<00:00:17.640> have<00:00:17.699> them<00:00:17.910> plain<00:00:18.300> and

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
then you can just have them plain and

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.060 
then you can just have them plain and
then<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.080> can<00:00:19.230> put<00:00:19.410> dip<00:00:19.740> them<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.039> chocolate

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
then you can put dip them in chocolate

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.670 
then you can put dip them in chocolate
on<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.850> bottom<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.869> then<00:00:22.050> it's<00:00:22.170> just<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.410> plain

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
on the bottom so then it's just a plain

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.620 
on the bottom so then it's just a plain
one<00:00:22.859> with<00:00:23.130> some<00:00:23.400> chocolate<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.240> I'm<00:00:24.539> gonna

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
one with some chocolate so I'm gonna

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.150 
one with some chocolate so I'm gonna
show<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.869> how<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.050> do<00:00:25.170> both<00:00:25.350> ways<00:00:25.619> but<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.010> can

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.899 
whites or I took the easy way out and
just<00:01:12.960> use<00:01:13.560> some<00:01:13.860> egg<00:01:14.040> white<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.430> box<00:01:14.670> and

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
just use some egg white to the box and

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.660 
just use some egg white to the box and
it<00:01:15.390> gives<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.409> instructions<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:17.130> two

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
of a teaspoon now I just did it a little

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.030 
of a teaspoon now I just did it a little
bit<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.000> then<00:01:36.479> you're<00:01:36.600> going<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.200> whip<00:01:37.799> this

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
bit and then you're going to whip this

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.149 
bit and then you're going to whip this
up<00:01:38.310> beat<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.360> egg<00:01:39.600> whites<00:01:39.930> until<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:40.890> form

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
up beat the egg whites until they form

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.370 
up beat the egg whites until they form
soft<00:01:41.460> peaks<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.360> can<00:01:42.630> see<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.020> know<00:01:43.140> they

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
soft peaks so you can see you know they

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.139 
soft peaks so you can see you know they
hold<00:01:43.829> their<00:01:44.070> shape<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.549> they're<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:44.880> too

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
hold their shape but they're not too

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.810 
hold their shape but they're not too
firm<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:46.680> took<00:01:46.860> about<00:01:47.070> five<00:01:47.369> minutes<00:01:47.640> of

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
firm and this took about five minutes of

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.510 
firm and this took about five minutes of
whipping<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.329> then<00:01:48.869> we're<00:01:49.079> gonna<00:01:49.290> add<00:01:49.560> 3/4

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
whipping and then we're gonna add 3/4

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.149 
whipping and then we're gonna add 3/4
cup<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.790> sugar<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:51.869> add<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.380> gradually<00:01:53.009> so

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
cup of sugar but add it gradually so

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.429 
cup of sugar but add it gradually so
after<00:01:54.030> each<00:01:54.180> little<00:01:54.450> bit<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:54.899> whip<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.110> and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
after each little bit just whip it and

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.319 
after each little bit just whip it and
then<00:01:55.860> we're<00:01:56.040> gonna<00:01:56.130> whip<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.520> until<00:01:56.700> we<00:01:57.030> form

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
then we're gonna whip this until we form

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.289 
then we're gonna whip this until we form
stiff<00:01:57.810> peaks<00:01:57.950> which<00:01:58.950> might<00:01:59.310> already<00:01:59.520> exactly

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
stiff peaks which might already exactly

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.940 
stiff peaks which might already exactly
stiff<00:02:00.540> peaks<00:02:00.810> but<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.140> was<00:02:01.320> after<00:02:01.469> seven

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
stiff peaks but this was after seven

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.620 
stiff peaks but this was after seven
more<00:02:02.130> minutes<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.579> whipping<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> was<00:02:03.420> just

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
more minutes of whipping in I was just

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.389 
more minutes of whipping in I was just
done<00:02:03.780> whipping<00:02:03.960> uh-huh<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:04.920> then<00:02:05.100> I'm<00:02:05.280> gonna

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
done whipping uh-huh so then I'm gonna

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.270 
done whipping uh-huh so then I'm gonna
use<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:06.000> piping<00:02:06.479> bag<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.079> star-shaped<00:02:07.560> tip

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
use a piping bag and a star-shaped tip

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.570 
use a piping bag and a star-shaped tip
and<00:02:08.550> then<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.330> get<00:02:09.539> our<00:02:09.750> kind<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.500> red<00:02:10.800> color<00:02:11.280> I

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
and then to get our kind of red color I

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.110 
and then to get our kind of red color I
am<00:02:12.030> using

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
am using

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.210 
am using
I'll<00:02:13.180> color<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.200> instead<00:02:14.530> of<00:02:14.590> food<00:02:14.950> coloring

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
I'll color so instead of food coloring

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.339 
I'll color so instead of food coloring
which<00:02:15.250> is<00:02:15.549> liquid<00:02:15.730> I'm<00:02:16.209> using<00:02:16.510> gel<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.200> this

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
which is liquid I'm using gel so this

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.369 
which is liquid I'm using gel so this
was<00:02:17.560> because<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:19.510> would<00:02:19.720> be<00:02:19.900> easier<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.260> make

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
was because it would be easier to make

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.530 
was because it would be easier to make
the<00:02:20.590> two<00:02:20.769> different<00:02:21.069> types<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:21.489> mark<00:02:21.970> three

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
the two different types so mark three

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.740 
the two different types so mark three
lines<00:02:23.019> in<00:02:23.470> your<00:02:24.010> piping<00:02:24.430> bag<00:02:24.489> as<00:02:24.849> I<00:02:25.120> showed<00:02:25.450> and

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
lines in your piping bag as I showed and

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.949 
lines in your piping bag as I showed and
then<00:02:26.200> we're<00:02:26.349> just<00:02:26.379> gonna<00:02:26.620> put<00:02:26.739> in<00:02:27.400> our

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
then we're just gonna put in our

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.199 
then we're just gonna put in our
meringue<00:02:28.959> mixture<00:02:29.440> into<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.980> bag<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.579> then

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
meringue mixture into the bag and then

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.869 
meringue mixture into the bag and then
we're<00:02:31.480> just<00:02:31.510> going<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:31.959> pipe<00:02:32.409> down<00:02:32.879> these

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
we're just going to pipe down these

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.089 
we're just going to pipe down these
colors<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.750> I<00:02:34.900> haven't<00:02:35.200> touched<00:02:35.379> the<00:02:35.650> bag<00:02:35.799> so

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
colors and I haven't touched the bag so

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.309 
colors and I haven't touched the bag so
the<00:02:36.250> color<00:02:36.459> is<00:02:36.549> still<00:02:36.849> in<00:02:37.030> there<00:02:37.239> and<00:02:37.390> yeah<00:02:38.049> I

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
the color is still in there and yeah I

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.210 
the color is still in there and yeah I
just<00:02:38.590> made<00:02:38.739> them<00:02:38.890> into<00:02:39.129> like<00:02:39.280> quarter<00:02:39.700> sized

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
just made them into like quarter sized

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.830 
just made them into like quarter sized
rosettes<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.430> guess<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:42.940> then<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.599> get<00:02:43.720> these

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
rosettes I guess and then to get these

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.440 
rosettes I guess and then to get these
columns<00:02:44.379> I<00:02:44.500> mush<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:45.099> bag<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.790> little<00:02:45.819> bit<00:02:46.090> just

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
columns I mush the bag a little bit just

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.630 
columns I mush the bag a little bit just
to<00:02:46.540> get<00:02:46.720> that<00:02:46.840> color<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.230> bit<00:02:47.379> looser<00:02:47.769> and<00:02:47.920> did

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
to get that color a bit looser and did

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.849 
to get that color a bit looser and did
the<00:02:48.879> same<00:02:49.150> just<00:02:49.690> piping<00:02:50.079> them<00:02:50.260> then<00:02:50.680> we're

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
the same just piping them then we're

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.190 
the same just piping them then we're
gonna<00:02:50.980> bake<00:02:51.250> it<00:02:51.400> at<00:02:51.489> 225<00:02:52.450> degrees<00:02:52.510> Fahrenheit

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
gonna bake it at 225 degrees Fahrenheit

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.020 
gonna bake it at 225 degrees Fahrenheit
a<00:02:53.230> low<00:02:53.500> temperature<00:02:53.859> for<00:02:54.190> 90<00:02:54.640> minutes<00:02:54.760> and

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
a low temperature for 90 minutes and

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.720 
a low temperature for 90 minutes and
after<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.599> turn<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.140> oven<00:02:56.260> off<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:57.040> they

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
after that turn the oven off and they

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.369 
after that turn the oven off and they
should<00:02:57.940> be<00:02:58.030> nice<00:02:58.239> and<00:02:58.269> formed<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:58.989> all<00:02:59.079> puffed

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
should be nice and formed and all puffed

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.490 
should be nice and formed and all puffed
up<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.769> then<00:03:00.280> just<00:03:00.579> prop<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.209> oven<00:03:01.599> open<00:03:02.079> with

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
up and then just prop the oven open with

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.160 
up and then just prop the oven open with
a<00:03:02.530> spatula<00:03:02.950> or<00:03:03.250> something<00:03:03.609> so<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.540> air<00:03:04.720> hot

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
a spatula or something so the air hot

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.039 
a spatula or something so the air hot
air<00:03:05.290> can<00:03:05.440> seep<00:03:05.680> out<00:03:05.829> but<00:03:06.280> not<00:03:07.030> completely<00:03:07.720> so

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
air can seep out but not completely so

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.420 
air can seep out but not completely so
you're<00:03:08.230> gonna<00:03:08.349> leave<00:03:08.590> those<00:03:08.769> in<00:03:08.829> for<00:03:09.159> another

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
you're gonna leave those in for another

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.729 
you're gonna leave those in for another
three<00:03:09.760> hours<00:03:09.790> so<00:03:10.239> they<00:03:10.359> completely<00:03:10.930> dry<00:03:11.170> so

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
three hours so they completely dry so

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.309 
three hours so they completely dry so
then<00:03:11.890> they're<00:03:12.040> nice<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.310> crisp<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.750> dipped

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
then they're nice and crisp and I dipped

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.979 
then they're nice and crisp and I dipped
the<00:03:14.650> white<00:03:14.950> ones<00:03:15.159> into<00:03:15.700> dark<00:03:16.450> chocolate<00:03:16.900> I

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
the white ones into dark chocolate I

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.120 
the white ones into dark chocolate I
melted<00:03:17.349> dark<00:03:17.500> chocolate<00:03:17.590> in<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.010> microwave

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
melted dark chocolate in the microwave

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.610 
melted dark chocolate in the microwave
and<00:03:18.639> then<00:03:18.700> just<00:03:19.150> dip<00:03:19.359> them<00:03:19.569> in<00:03:19.720> I<00:03:19.870> don't<00:03:20.440> know

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
and then just dip them in I don't know

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.289 
and then just dip them in I don't know
where<00:03:20.799> my<00:03:20.919> footage<00:03:21.220> went<00:03:21.459> on<00:03:21.609> that<00:03:21.760> but<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.180> was

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
where my footage went on that but it was

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:23.129 
where my footage went on that but it was
pretty<00:03:22.569> self-explanatory

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
pretty self-explanatory

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.170 
pretty self-explanatory
the<00:03:23.889> only<00:03:24.130> hard<00:03:24.430> part<00:03:24.489> is<00:03:24.790> just<00:03:24.910> kind<00:03:25.150> of

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
the only hard part is just kind of

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.640 
the only hard part is just kind of
holding<00:03:25.630> them<00:03:25.750> rack<00:03:25.959> so<00:03:26.169> the<00:03:26.260> whole<00:03:26.440> thing

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
holding them rack so the whole thing

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.129 
holding them rack so the whole thing
doesn't<00:03:26.799> fall<00:03:27.099> in<00:03:27.280> there<00:03:27.569> so<00:03:28.569> I<00:03:28.599> hope<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:28.989> guys

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139
