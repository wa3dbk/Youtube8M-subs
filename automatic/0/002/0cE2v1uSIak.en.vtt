00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.500
 and now I have the great opportunity 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.790
 I turn on an airfield 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.490
 and you can see that there are a few breaks 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.139
 am a model first to drive and we 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.420
 want the whole time out and see if 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:23.079
 that is really as crazy as that 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:28.810
 Everyone says where is the ignition key 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:30.880
 that is the question well the automatic 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.399
 yeah sure you just got me brake and 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.950
 gas is on the brake start the car 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.260
 approach 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.719
 now it is only the gang 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.719
 so to speak it is with the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.820
 Mercedes made 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.219
 the proportion of germany to quite 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:57.449
 press down and that I'm out of the 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.449
 actually now the 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:06.900
 After all, it's easy 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:13.140
 So I feel like it has to be so 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:15.030
 yes I am coming but that is one 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.130
 I think so 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.540
 start so I have to tackle was yes 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.710
 often on the track soon become fast 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.360
 we were eight from photos 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:29.430
 I can be a little bit on it 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:30.360
 yes yes that is kasseler so there 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.320
 I am very much now 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.119
 So I had and then just now 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.860
 gas and there is no circuit and 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.690
 Nick could hold and expert simple 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.210
 Translation through from bottom to top 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.990
 make maximum speed slip 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.830
 we represent 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.990
 only at 200 stored 200 sealed off 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.520
 we make turn we will turn then 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.260
 I could do it a bit now 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.180
 We have times the distance I explore 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.979
 would from the standstill one yes times 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.830
 out of gas pipe nothing happens 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:07.550
 there to the iv rules 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:09.140
 the street is dry equipped 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.860
 because it is just so then just go full time 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:19.880
 it 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:23.450
 curious is the burned and 100 the 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.170
 he just does not do it at all 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.170
 Sounds 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.840
 in all cars and the range of 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:40.300
 The car is definitely determined that I 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.430
 at the moment 212 km 300 purely electric 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.230
 usually drives when fully charged 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.830
 is 400 kilometers other partner but 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.830
 normal already 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.260
 OK 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.180
 really really make century 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:10.459
 and there still is not 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.459
 at night, 52 said 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:18.719
 the motorization motorissimo the so far 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.310
 already more than compensated now for 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:22.500
 five people with a performance and 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.909
 then this so that we here so so 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.680
 I say that it's relaxation 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:29.219
 so somehow when driving has because 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.049
 exactly it is also convenient if you 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.310
 somewhere on the mountain or any 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.959
 other things also a bit 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.280
 deciding to go with it 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.719
 really the engine off that is yes 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.970
 that just does not happen there is none 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:40.650
 Weighing is mean clutch that is one 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.859
 very quite relaxed 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.859
 drive 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:55.000
 again through the 130th 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:15.810
 that is really a bit on the 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.670
 form you can see then as it were 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.959
 He drives from the very consumer 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.880
 get it in the middle again 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.040
 can push large one by its 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:33.290
 what you want to see is now handy 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:33.290
 very bad so to say others 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:42.499
 march 1960 160 if always held like this 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.400
 this is the most expensive sports car with five 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.810
 So they are very sporty 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.259
 likely to get off a 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.259
 a bit faster 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.180
 Always there 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.130
 160 m coupe 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.230
 Well, if we were underestimated that was 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.700
 so now the applause is too 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.690
 not there is nothing there now 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.280
 I do not want it now 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.110
 the handbrake everything in there just us 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.060
 in the back so belonged to ours now 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:32.060
 The behind bars so films pack too ok 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:32.660
 as a parking brake and communicate so must 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.480
 the existence 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.070
 Okay, that's what I want to do from here 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.890
 people have seen that is gone 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:45.380
 we have the car from the front youtube yes 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.280
 the hammer so that's a whole 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.230
 different feeling 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.510
 the feeling and we are just 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.890
 so back and forth and is on 160 steps 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.660
 a bit and then you sit in it 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.660
 So that's just that wind rushing 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:10.730
 I'm quite apart that the test is 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.000
 a nice car and watch her next 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.730
 year 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 next year is next for youtube 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.000
 year on
