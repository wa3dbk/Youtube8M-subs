00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
gave in the days and Noah and I think in

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.400 
gave in the days and Noah and I think in
the<00:02:24.030> light<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.480> fact<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.870> he's<00:02:25.080> going<00:02:25.320> to

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
the light of the fact that he's going to

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.100 
the light of the fact that he's going to
come<00:02:25.710> to<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.070> earth<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.430> die<00:02:27.090> for<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.540> sins

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110

come to the earth and die for the sins
of<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.470> world<00:02:28.580> now<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:30.030> think<00:02:30.210> that<00:02:30.540> probably

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
of the world now I think that probably

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.410 
of the world now I think that probably
we<00:02:31.530> ought<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.710> be<00:02:32.220> maybe<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.790> little<00:02:32.970> bit<00:02:33.180> more

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
we ought to be maybe a little bit more

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.220 
we ought to be maybe a little bit more
specific<00:02:34.380> here<00:02:34.710> now<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.640> says<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.420> Jesus

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
specific here now it says that Jesus

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.180 
specific here now it says that Jesus
descends<00:02:38.100> into<00:02:38.340> hell<00:02:39.260> now<00:02:40.260> let<00:02:40.530> me<00:02:40.680> go<00:02:40.890> on<00:02:41.010> and

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
descends into hell now let me go on and

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.660 
descends into hell now let me go on and
read<00:02:41.400> which<00:02:42.330> sometime<00:02:42.990> were<00:02:43.020> disobedient
