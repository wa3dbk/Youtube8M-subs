another oil test using this Vargo
titanium<00:00:17.279> hexagon<00:00:18.000> wood<00:00:18.960> stove<00:00:19.320> man<00:00:19.770> that's<00:00:20.010> a

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
titanium hexagon wood stove man that's a

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.939 
titanium hexagon wood stove man that's a
mouthful

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
mouthful

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.920 
mouthful
previously<00:00:24.170> my<00:00:25.170> first<00:00:25.470> test<00:00:26.510> like<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.689> with

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
previously my first test like I do with

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.050 
previously my first test like I do with
any<00:00:28.050> wood<00:00:28.320> stove<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.859> get<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.279> try<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.880> out

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
any wood stove that I get I try it out

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.700 
any wood stove that I get I try it out
with<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.449> mini<00:00:30.720> transia<00:00:31.520> put<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.730> there

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
with the mini transia put it in there

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.260 
with the mini transia put it in there
right<00:00:34.710> on<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.920> tray<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:35.940> made<00:00:36.149> it

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
right on the tray so that I made it

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.569 
right on the tray so that I made it
about<00:00:36.450> two<00:00:36.690> inches<00:00:37.020> between<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.680> top<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
about two inches between the top of the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.119 
about two inches between the top of the
burner<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.059> bottom<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.600> pot<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:40.170> little

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
burner to the bottom of the pot a little

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.880 
burner to the bottom of the pot a little
bit<00:00:41.460> too<00:00:41.640> much<00:00:41.879> space<00:00:42.570> there<00:00:42.930> plus<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.770> was

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
bit too much space there plus it was

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.810 
bit too much space there plus it was
blocking<00:00:44.190> up<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:46.070> air<00:00:47.070> holes<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.579> are<00:00:47.640> on

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
blocking up the air holes that are on

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.350 
blocking up the air holes that are on
the<00:00:47.910> bottom<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.989> know<00:00:50.930> so<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.960> thought<00:00:52.379> that

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
the bottom you know so I thought that

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.610 
the bottom you know so I thought that
blocking<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> air<00:00:54.600> holes<00:00:54.809> meant<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.379> maybe

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
blocking the air holes meant that maybe

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.340 
blocking the air holes meant that maybe
the<00:00:55.829> burner<00:00:56.070> wasn't<00:00:56.489> getting<00:00:56.730> enough<00:00:56.850> air

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
the burner wasn't getting enough air

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.099 
the burner wasn't getting enough air
what<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.379> wanted<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.859> do<00:00:59.300> was<00:01:00.300> make<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.660> stand

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
what I wanted to do was make a stand

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.750 
what I wanted to do was make a stand
that<00:01:01.230> would<00:01:01.410> go<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.739> there<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.010> lift<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
that would go in there to lift the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.170 
that would go in there to lift the
burner<00:01:03.030> up<00:01:03.300> but<00:01:03.960> then<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.170> had<00:01:04.379> others<00:01:04.739> say<00:01:05.180> do

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
burner up but then I had others say do

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.020 
burner up but then I had others say do
the<00:01:06.360> test<00:01:06.630> with<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> door<00:01:07.590> open<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.729> did

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the test with the door open so I did

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.789 
the test with the door open so I did
that<00:01:09.950> got<00:01:10.950> worse<00:01:11.189> time<00:01:12.110> let's<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.590> was

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
that got worse time let's see that was

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.020 
that got worse time let's see that was
two<00:01:14.790> cups<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.150> water<00:01:15.299> starting<00:01:15.689> at<00:01:15.810> 60<00:01:16.290> degrees

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
two cups of water starting at 60 degrees

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.960 
two cups of water starting at 60 degrees
candle<00:01:18.030> boil<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.509> 6<00:01:18.780> minutes<00:01:18.990> 58<00:01:19.710> when<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.729> did

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
candle boil in 6 minutes 58 when I did

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.630 
candle boil in 6 minutes 58 when I did
it<00:01:21.060> with<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.420> Trangia<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:22.290> there<00:01:22.560> 2<00:01:23.400> cups

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
it with just the Trangia in there 2 cups

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.230 
it with just the Trangia in there 2 cups
of<00:01:23.700> water<00:01:23.909> starting<00:01:24.570> at<00:01:24.830> 59<00:01:25.830> degrees<00:01:26.090> came<00:01:27.090> to

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
of water starting at 59 degrees came to

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.039 
of water starting at 59 degrees came to
a<00:01:27.270> boil<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.720> 6<00:01:28.049> minutes<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.439> 11<00:01:28.650> seconds<00:01:30.049> so

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
a boil in 6 minutes and 11 seconds so

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.980 
a boil in 6 minutes and 11 seconds so
leaving<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.500> door<00:01:31.710> didn't<00:01:32.070> really<00:01:32.460> help<00:01:32.990> it

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
leaving the door didn't really help it

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.080 
leaving the door didn't really help it
looked<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.530> all<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> flame<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.880> stuff

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
looked like all of the flame and stuff

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.969 
looked like all of the flame and stuff
came<00:01:36.390> out<00:01:36.420> through<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.930> front<00:01:37.170> door<00:01:37.560> through

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
came out through the front door through

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.830 
came out through the front door through
through<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.220> door<00:01:38.490> rather<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.360> up<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.659> side

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
through the door rather and up the side

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.230 
through the door rather and up the side
of<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.049> pot<00:01:40.310> rather<00:01:41.310> than<00:01:41.610> coming<00:01:41.880> out<00:01:42.090> of

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
of the pot rather than coming out of

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.590 
of the pot rather than coming out of
these<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:43.220> don't<00:01:44.220> want<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.700> call<00:01:44.880> them<00:01:45.000> ports<00:01:45.420> or

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
these I don't want to call them ports or

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.139 
these I don't want to call them ports or
whatever<00:01:45.950> so<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.979> think<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.549> door<00:01:47.759> has<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.000> be

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
whatever so I think the door has to be

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.780 
whatever so I think the door has to be
closed<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.710> heat<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:49.950> focused<00:01:50.610> up

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
closed so that the heat is focused up

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.160 
closed so that the heat is focused up
onto<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.270> pot<00:01:52.399> what<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.430> wanted<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.880> do<00:01:54.049> and<00:01:55.049> I'm

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
onto the pot what I wanted to do and I'm

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.490 
onto the pot what I wanted to do and I'm
going<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.380> try<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.149> test<00:01:57.500> is

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
going to try it this in this test is

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.859 
going to try it this in this test is
make<00:01:58.799> something<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.310> would<00:01:59.369> fit<00:01:59.640> flat<00:01:59.969> into

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
make something that would fit flat into

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.709 
make something that would fit flat into
the<00:02:01.079> bag<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.070> stove<00:02:02.340> comes<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.939> I'm

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
the bag that the stove comes in I'm

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.539 
the bag that the stove comes in I'm
thinking<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.380> something<00:02:04.619> like<00:02:05.070> although<00:02:05.399> I

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
thinking of something like although I

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.850 
thinking of something like although I
don't<00:02:05.909> think<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.270> will<00:02:06.450> work<00:02:06.509> as<00:02:07.350> good<00:02:07.560> as<00:02:07.710> it

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
don't think this will work as good as it

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.240 
don't think this will work as good as it
should<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.360> ever<00:02:09.959> new<00:02:10.200> titanium<00:02:10.709> cross

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
should is the ever new titanium cross

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.430 
should is the ever new titanium cross
pieces

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
pieces

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.130 
pieces
I<00:02:12.550> got<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.670> get<00:02:13.760> some<00:02:15.250> aluminum<00:02:16.250> plate<00:02:17.140> some

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
I got to get some aluminum plate some

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.990 
I got to get some aluminum plate some
straps<00:02:18.440> whatever<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.190> make<00:02:19.490> something<00:02:19.760> like

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
straps whatever and make something like

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.760 
straps whatever and make something like
this<00:02:20.240> this<00:02:20.540> is<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.720> little<00:02:20.960> bit<00:02:21.140> taller<00:02:21.380> than

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770

one<00:02:22.070> inch<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:23.210> that<00:02:23.360> means<00:02:23.540> we<00:02:23.720> won't<00:02:23.930> have

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
one inch so that means we won't have

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.420 
one inch so that means we won't have
that<00:02:24.350> one<00:02:25.100> inch<00:02:25.310> sweet<00:02:25.670> spot<00:02:26.800> but<00:02:27.800> just<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.280> see

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
if I'm on the right idea I thought I'd

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.730 
if I'm on the right idea I thought I'd
try<00:02:30.590> this<00:02:30.650> today<00:02:31.720> what<00:02:32.720> I'll<00:02:32.840> do<00:02:33.020> is<00:02:33.170> just<00:02:33.200> lay

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
try this today what I'll do is just lay

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.870 
try this today what I'll do is just lay
this<00:02:33.980> in<00:02:34.160> here<00:02:34.370> like<00:02:34.400> this

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.600 

now<00:02:37.880> you<00:02:37.970> got<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.180> do<00:02:38.300> this<00:02:38.510> with<00:02:38.720> it<00:02:38.870> open

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
now you got to do this with it open

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.640 
now you got to do this with it open
because<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:41.000> Trangia<00:02:41.510> burner<00:02:42.020> doesn't<00:02:42.260> fit

because the Trangia burner doesn't fit

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.840 
because the Trangia burner doesn't fit
in<00:02:42.800> here<00:02:43.630> otherwise<00:02:44.630> but<00:02:45.080> can<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:45.320> see<00:02:45.500> that

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
so now the air can come up through these

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.570 
so now the air can come up through these
holes<00:02:48.920> on<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.250> bottom<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:49.810> feed<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:51.020> burner

it's<00:03:23.780> kind<00:03:23.930> of<00:03:24.019> hard<00:03:24.200> for<00:03:24.290> me<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.620> control<00:03:24.830> the

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
it's kind of hard for me to control the

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.020 
it's kind of hard for me to control the
temperature<00:03:27.319> of<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.530> water<00:03:27.830> that's<00:03:28.730> so

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
temperature of the water that's so

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.160 
temperature of the water that's so
freakin<00:03:29.660> hot<00:03:29.989> in<00:03:30.200> here<00:03:31.569> this<00:03:32.569> was<00:03:32.780> sixty

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
freakin hot in here this was sixty

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.710 
freakin hot in here this was sixty
degrees<00:03:33.500> just<00:03:33.860> a<00:03:34.430> minute<00:03:34.700> ago<00:03:37.150> let's<00:03:38.150> wait<00:03:38.510> to

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
degrees just a minute ago let's wait to

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:46.530 
degrees just a minute ago let's wait to
this<00:03:38.840> blooms<00:03:43.540> come<00:03:44.540> on

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.479 
now I think with this being up off those
holes<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:50.470> air<00:03:50.709> can<00:03:50.920> come<00:03:51.099> in<00:03:51.220> through<00:03:51.310> the

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
holes the air can come in through the

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.850 
holes the air can come in through the
bottom<00:03:51.640> get<00:03:52.480> heated<00:03:52.750> up<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:53.080> lift<00:03:53.319> out<00:03:53.530> okay

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860

the<00:05:25.449> other<00:05:25.630> two<00:05:25.900> runs<00:05:26.199> and<00:05:26.440> here<00:05:26.650> it's<00:05:26.740> the

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
the other two runs and here it's the

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:36.620 
the other two runs and here it's the
worst<00:05:27.130> run<00:05:27.460> of<00:05:27.610> them<00:05:27.729> all<00:05:30.960> don't<00:05:31.960> understand

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.860 

hmm

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
hmm

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.850 
hmm
no<00:05:38.470> the<00:05:38.800> only<00:05:38.919> thing<00:05:39.130> I<00:05:39.220> can<00:05:39.400> see<00:05:39.639> is<00:05:39.840> the<00:05:40.860> ever

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
no the only thing I can see is the ever

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.939 
no the only thing I can see is the ever
new<00:05:42.039> is<00:05:42.310> that<00:05:42.340> is<00:05:43.050> we<00:05:44.050> need<00:05:44.229> about<00:05:44.349> one<00:05:44.740> inch

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
new is that is we need about one inch

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:46.529 
new is that is we need about one inch
between<00:05:45.190> the<00:05:45.400> top<00:05:45.729> of<00:05:45.759> the<00:05:46.000> burner<00:05:46.180> to<00:05:46.300> the

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
between the top of the burner to the

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.080 
between the top of the burner to the
bottom<00:05:46.840> of<00:05:46.960> the<00:05:47.020> pot<00:05:47.229> that<00:05:47.470> seems<00:05:47.770> to<00:05:48.009> be<00:05:48.190> the

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
bottom of the pot that seems to be the

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.279 
bottom of the pot that seems to be the
sweet<00:05:49.659> spot<00:05:49.889> you<00:05:50.889> might<00:05:51.099> say<00:05:51.630> for<00:05:52.630> the<00:05:52.780> best

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
sweet spot you might say for the best

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:57.360 
sweet spot you might say for the best
fastest<00:05:54.099> heating<00:05:54.789> up<00:05:54.909> of<00:05:55.060> water<00:05:56.039> so<00:05:57.039> I<00:05:57.070> thought

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
fastest heating up of water so I thought

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.430 
fastest heating up of water so I thought
raising<00:05:57.820> it<00:05:57.940> up<00:05:58.030> one<00:05:58.330> inch<00:05:58.570> would<00:05:59.139> give<00:05:59.349> me

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
raising it up one inch would give me

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.529 
raising it up one inch would give me
that<00:05:59.590> one<00:05:59.830> inch<00:06:00.009> on<00:06:00.219> the<00:06:00.340> top<00:06:00.550> but<00:06:00.969> this

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:01.539 
that one inch on the top but this

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:04.529 
that one inch on the top but this
ever-new<00:06:02.080> is<00:06:02.229> a<00:06:02.560> little<00:06:02.889> bit<00:06:02.979> more<00:06:03.360> than<00:06:04.360> an

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
ever-new is a little bit more than an

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:07.080 
ever-new is a little bit more than an
inch<00:06:04.719> so<00:06:05.020> the<00:06:05.289> distance<00:06:05.770> between<00:06:05.830> this<00:06:06.699> to<00:06:06.969> the

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
inch so the distance between this to the

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.700 
inch so the distance between this to the
bottom<00:06:07.360> of<00:06:07.449> the<00:06:07.539> pot<00:06:07.750> is<00:06:07.960> more<00:06:08.169> like<00:06:08.349> seven

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
bottom of the pot is more like seven

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.709 
bottom of the pot is more like seven
eighths<00:06:08.860> of<00:06:09.009> an<00:06:09.130> inch<00:06:09.250> I<00:06:09.610> really<00:06:10.389> didn't<00:06:10.659> think

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:10.719 
eighths of an inch I really didn't think

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:11.820 
eighths of an inch I really didn't think
that<00:06:10.870> would<00:06:11.050> make<00:06:11.229> that<00:06:11.409> much<00:06:11.590> of<00:06:11.620> a

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
that would make that much of a

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.180 
that would make that much of a
difference<00:06:12.009> I<00:06:13.620> mean<00:06:14.620> now<00:06:14.770> it's<00:06:14.919> getting

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
difference I mean now it's getting

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.490 
difference I mean now it's getting
plenty<00:06:15.370> of<00:06:15.550> air<00:06:15.789> I<00:06:16.030> think<00:06:16.509> you<00:06:16.810> saw<00:06:17.020> on<00:06:17.229> camera

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
plenty of air I think you saw on camera

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.850 
plenty of air I think you saw on camera
two<00:06:18.090> hopefully<00:06:19.090> it<00:06:19.210> showed<00:06:19.479> up<00:06:19.659> the<00:06:20.530> flames

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
two hopefully it showed up the flames

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.010 
two hopefully it showed up the flames
were<00:06:21.069> all<00:06:21.219> blue<00:06:21.610> rather<00:06:22.000> than<00:06:22.330> yellow<00:06:22.659> like

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
were all blue rather than yellow like

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.320 
were all blue rather than yellow like
last<00:06:23.349> time<00:06:23.650> this<00:06:24.610> is<00:06:24.759> what<00:06:24.880> it<00:06:25.000> looked<00:06:25.180> like

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
last time this is what it looked like

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.510 
last time this is what it looked like
last<00:06:25.360> time<00:06:25.900> I'll<00:06:26.080> put<00:06:26.289> it<00:06:26.380> up<00:06:26.500> here<00:06:26.770> all<00:06:26.949> yellow

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
last time I'll put it up here all yellow

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.180 
last time I'll put it up here all yellow
and<00:06:27.639> stuff<00:06:28.030> this<00:06:28.930> time<00:06:29.259> it<00:06:29.440> was<00:06:29.560> blue<00:06:29.860> pretty

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190 
and stuff this time it was blue pretty

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.839 
and stuff this time it was blue pretty
near<00:06:30.460> all<00:06:30.729> blue<00:06:32.250> so<00:06:33.250> that<00:06:33.310> should<00:06:33.580> have<00:06:33.699> meant

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:33.849 
near all blue so that should have meant

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:39.910 
near all blue so that should have meant
that<00:06:33.969> it<00:06:34.060> was<00:06:34.150> burning<00:06:34.419> good

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:39.920 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.040 

just<00:06:40.920> don't<00:06:41.130> know<00:06:41.810> okay

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
just don't know okay

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.980 
just don't know okay
well<00:06:43.380> I<00:06:43.590> guess<00:06:43.860> I<00:06:44.210> have<00:06:45.210> to<00:06:45.330> get<00:06:45.420> some<00:06:45.660> one<00:06:45.810> inch

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
well I guess I have to get some one inch

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
well I guess I have to get some one inch
flat<00:06:46.200> stock<00:06:46.710> and<00:06:47.040> cut<00:06:48.030> a<00:06:48.800> cross-section<00:06:49.800> thing

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
flat stock and cut a cross-section thing

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.180 
flat stock and cut a cross-section thing
like<00:06:50.190> this<00:06:50.400> myself<00:06:50.970> and<00:06:51.830> try<00:06:52.830> it<00:06:52.890> with<00:06:53.160> one

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.190 
like this myself and try it with one

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.280 
like this myself and try it with one
inch<00:06:53.670> rather<00:06:53.970> than<00:06:54.240> that<00:06:54.360> this<00:06:54.600> taller<00:06:54.930> thing

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.290 
inch rather than that this taller thing

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.390 
inch rather than that this taller thing
I<00:06:57.440> really<00:06:58.440> I<00:06:58.620> really<00:06:58.800> thought<00:06:59.070> that<00:06:59.130> would

00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 
I really I really thought that would

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.010 
I really I really thought that would
have<00:06:59.490> done<00:06:59.670> it<00:06:59.840> okay

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
have done it okay

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.290 
have done it okay
well<00:07:01.230> talking<00:07:01.920> to<00:07:02.070> myself<00:07:02.220> here<00:07:02.520> now<00:07:02.730> although

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 
well talking to myself here now although

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.950 
well talking to myself here now although
