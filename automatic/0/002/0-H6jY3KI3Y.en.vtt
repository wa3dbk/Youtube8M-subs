00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
hello and welcome to nephron news the

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.480 
hello and welcome to nephron news the
show<00:00:09.059> for<00:00:09.480> all<00:00:09.599> things<00:00:09.840> renal<00:00:10.349> coming<00:00:11.190> up<00:00:11.340> in

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
show for all things renal coming up in

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.980 
show for all things renal coming up in
today's<00:00:11.639> show<00:00:12.090> we're<00:00:12.300> going<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.509> be<00:00:12.630> looking

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
today's show we're going to be looking

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.379 
today's show we're going to be looking
at<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.259> formation<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.070> glomerular<00:00:14.849> filtrate

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
at the formation of glomerular filtrate

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.200 
at the formation of glomerular filtrate
and<00:00:15.630> how<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.320> nephron<00:00:16.920> reabsorbs<00:00:17.730> all<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
and how the nephron reabsorbs all of the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.019 
and how the nephron reabsorbs all of the
useful<00:00:18.449> products<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:20.039> let's<00:00:20.250> start<00:00:20.789> by

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
useful products so let's start by

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.700 
useful products so let's start by
familiarizing<00:00:21.420> ourselves<00:00:21.900> with<00:00:22.320> what's

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
familiarizing ourselves with what's

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.460 
familiarizing ourselves with what's
being<00:00:22.920> shown<00:00:23.300> here<00:00:24.300> we<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.019> afferent

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
being shown here we have the afferent

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.009 
being shown here we have the afferent
arteriole<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.910> goes<00:00:27.240> into<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.840> glomerulus

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
arteriole this goes into the glomerulus

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.740 
arteriole this goes into the glomerulus
and<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.220> encased<00:00:29.640> by<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.119> renal<00:00:30.510> capsule

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
and this is encased by the renal capsule

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.590 
and this is encased by the renal capsule
or<00:00:31.289> Bowman's<00:00:31.859> capsule<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:33.059> good<00:00:33.239> Merrill<00:00:33.510> of

filtrate<00:00:34.050> continues<00:00:34.649> along<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.040> proximal

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
filtrate continues along the proximal

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.360 
filtrate continues along the proximal
convoluted<00:00:35.760> tubule<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:37.380> then<00:00:37.649> enters<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
convoluted tubule this then enters the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.389 
convoluted tubule this then enters the
loop<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.670> Henle<00:00:39.559> then<00:00:40.559> travels<00:00:41.100> up<00:00:41.370> through

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
loop of Henle then travels up through

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.030 
loop of Henle then travels up through
into<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.390> distal<00:00:42.840> convoluted<00:00:43.020> tubule<00:00:43.860> and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
into the distal convoluted tubule and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.700 
into the distal convoluted tubule and
down<00:00:44.610> into<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> collecting<00:00:45.719> ducts<00:00:46.020> where<00:00:46.469> if

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
down into the collecting ducts where if

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.790 
down into the collecting ducts where if
there's<00:00:46.920> anything<00:00:47.190> left<00:00:48.230> it<00:00:49.230> continues<00:00:49.770> down

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
there's anything left it continues down

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.700 
there's anything left it continues down
into<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.489> ureter<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.090> onto<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> bladder<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
into the ureter and onto the bladder the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.709 
into the ureter and onto the bladder the
red<00:00:52.949> bricks<00:00:53.250> represent<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.000> blood<00:00:54.180> vessels

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
red bricks represent the blood vessels

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.600 
red bricks represent the blood vessels
and<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.320> can<00:00:55.500> see<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.829> they<00:00:55.920> lie<00:00:56.100> close<00:00:56.399> to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
and you can see that they lie close to

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.760 
and you can see that they lie close to
the<00:00:56.730> tubules<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.629> maximize<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.350> reabsorption

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.229 

here<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.340> see<00:01:02.550> how<00:01:02.760> some<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
here we can see how some of the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.030 
here we can see how some of the
molecules<00:01:03.420> flow<00:01:04.019> around<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.439> nephron

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
molecules flow around the nephron

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.609 
molecules flow around the nephron
so<00:01:05.460> let's<00:01:05.670> now<00:01:05.850> zoom<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.930> take<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> closer

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619
