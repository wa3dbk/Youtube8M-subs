00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.709
 with cecilia we had the grace of 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.100
 to know us when I started working 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:18.310
 in Radio Maria Argentina I found in that 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.880
 time volunteering at radio marÃ­a 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.290
 he was nice and the following year 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.090
 I knew good that I am my husband 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.010
 christian and there were many 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.680
 volunteers who are responsible for 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.989
 publicize the radio and between them 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.850
 I was cecilia and that's how good we left 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.520
 knowing the gare that I loved from 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.480
 the first moment a former seminarian 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:45.230
 above all it was fun he sang 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.300
 super spontaneous good I went knowing the 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.290
 cecilia 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.210
 and we got together and well they arrived 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.449
 the moments in which also God 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.879
 He was inviting us to take steps 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.600
 good something like that since the year already well 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.269
 we already found out I had to 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.400
 make the decision to take the step and 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.400
 propose to him I bought two there 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.830
 wooden rings and good and finally 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.869
 we got married it was nice to put together the 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.450
 marriage because for us it was a 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.420
 special sacrament and we wanted to do it 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.520
 different good there is step that we said 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.520
 new to the first year we do not want to have 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.320
 babies because not yet so good a year 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.080
 we said nothing good is already so 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.990
 we are looking for is already and good we started 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.030
 to look and start that was not given not 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.690
 I did not give I came with a subject of 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.300
 Maiden myomas good I operated on this 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.310
 moment a mine had not grabbed me the 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.560
 left trunk then complicated the 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.509
 operation almost lost the horn 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.399
 finally they left me but it seems that 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.229
 was covered and walton there and what do I know 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.840
 well we started to see that this in 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.400
 easy relationship how we would create 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.260
 there was the possibility of not having 9 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:04.020
 and well there was the moment in which 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.690
 we find this reality that does not 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.640
 it was because we did not have good 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.310
 explanation, what was it that is 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.950
 happening and so they started dating 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.760
 from within ours as our 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.380
 claims no good bye how is good sir 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.170
 we have a relationship as long as possible 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.620
 pure possible we got married 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.290
 before your law we seek you pray 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.450
 we were participating in the mass we went 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.380
 to the church we had the groups and now 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.900
 what happens what is your answer to this no 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.940
 you are going to keep your promises and really 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.420
 we were as hopeless as 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.490
 hurt as not knowing where 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.290
 shoot and good but the doctor 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.290
 injured but yes but good and we started 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.600
 to spend silver months silver months we do 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.459
 a test another test we take pills 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.380
 arrested that I will not fix the days the 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.920
 date was like pretty complicated and 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.650
 pretty ugly 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.590
 and well in a moment I planted 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.680
 cristian that maybe god was the 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.739
 possibility of adopting I was not in 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.030
 conditions and I did not want to adopt that the 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.390
 another possibility that had been shuffling 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.410
 and finally in this time that we are 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.530
 as tired means of treatment 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.200
 appears let's say as a dissidence 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.150
 we say we in my boss propose me 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.190
 take children in custody at the end of 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.850
 week we went 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.770
 the idea was to look for it on a Friday to have it 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.950
 with us during the weekend and 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.440
 deliver it the institute on Sunday 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.200
 they are in the institute in a moment 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.700
 judicial process with his family and actually 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.930
 wait for them to be resolved so they come back 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.060
 with his family so we 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.670
 we are clear that these children were not 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:54.440
 to adopt them that were not going to be for 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.270
 we went to see him in Gonzalo and there 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.310
 we are good with a reality 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.290
 that we really moved from inside 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.410
 us when we first went to the 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.820
 institute not the truth that we 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.970
 shocked because seeing the amount of 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.160
 little children who are there who are alone 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.160
 that you saw that they despair because you 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.410
 go visit them they ask you to stay 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.390
 is they ask you to take them with them and 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.070
 there as if to me the equation was 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.049
 grabbing decide on us we search 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.390
 children these children look for parents that is 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.390
 why is it so complicated the end and 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.610
 well he started coming home on weekends 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.960
 negrito a beautiful week that good 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.069
 won the heart because 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.750
 very funny it was like children are 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:38.090
 spontaneous he won the heart of 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.500
 cristian in a second well then well 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.849
 that we started bringing them to the month 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.310
 they are super my birthday I remember 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:47.900
 we went one day the slopes we had 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.190
 said that if we take the little sisters 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.889
 because the little sisters were with 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.660
 Gonzalo, there they were not going to leave us 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.979
 take them more like us 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.410
 complicated because the house was very 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.169
 little girl did not encourage us either 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.539
 So many children, well, I just spoke with my 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.910
 sister-in-law my sister-in-law also ten years ago 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.650
 that she was married and could not have the 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.509
 sister of christian and she tells me 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.830
 well I'm hooked says the draft 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:12.349
 they took the girls the little sisters 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.360
 well they took us down we were introduced 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:16.639
 again the court with all the 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.320
 history and well there they accept us and the 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.750
 little hand of Gonzalo another says they were 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.270
 four in total 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.040
 a good day I had no one to go with and we 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.290
 They ask if you could show us if good by 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.270
 a weekend brings it because I know 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:33.100
 I wanted to come with us then 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:36.830
 started to be two who went home 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:39.680
 a priest was accompanying us 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.900
 hard what he told me many times but 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.490
 very clear and at the same time as a firm father 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.800
 who was with us with us 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.660
 in the decisions that we are giving me 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.980
 says you want to be a clear father 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.620
 I want to be a father 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.990
 good where it is conceived and then it 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:58.190
 he conceives of the belly he does not conceive the 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:01.430
 heart or grow father you want to have baby 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.690
 impact us at the end of the year that year what 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.350
 we ask 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:09.350
 with 2009 we ask ourselves in how in 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.580
 permanent guard that took us about 34 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.790
 years until they were in three 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:17.510
 years were left as free to the mother left 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:19.310
 of asking for them and well they were like a 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.970
 keep us preadoptive for the 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.700
 Adoption trial with Mary with con 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:29.110
 we 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:31.740
 we are super happy and happy 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.229
 we had discovered that god 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.889
 fulfill his promises I felt that God 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:38.970
 He was talking about healing me from a place 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:41.250
 gynecological that for me was all a 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.180
 subject the fibroids well being and were and 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.880
 they are still 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.729
 and well at the time we found out that 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.410
 we were pregnant good was a tea 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:52.110
 summer for the children we always 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.639
 we had told him what we wanted and that 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.169
 We were looking for babies and they were going 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:58.479
 to have little hands and what good to the best 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:00.310
 It was many eggs with friends but 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:02.740
 well the truth is that they are about 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.509
 sisters, I have a 12 year old daughter 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.699
 that is a mother the truth but our 

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:09.639
 baby because it was a gift for us 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:13.120
 and also for them I believe as brothers 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:16.700
 and well I there we enjoyed three children 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:20.120
 from a large family that did not expect more 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:22.190
 and it's worth the joy that God proposed in 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.470
 this project that obviously never 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.990
 we would have imagined we feel it is the 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:30.890
 better shape and the greatest joy that 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:32.780
 God fulfilled his way and thank you 

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.820
 we can tell you so that for that 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.370
 because many do not follow us 

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:40.030
 we see many couples who suffer many 

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:43.200
 but like us too 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:46.360
 that in his time not afflicting he used to 

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:49.080
 because we felt that good because 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.080
 it was our turn 

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.750
 and good and today we can enjoy the 

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:58.680
 another way and from another place 

00:07:54.750 --> 00:08:00.890
 these children that with their differences but 

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:04.580
 totally conceived in the heart 

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:04.580
 they form our family
