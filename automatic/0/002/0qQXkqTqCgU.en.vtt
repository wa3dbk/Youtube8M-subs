00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
as strong or knows this map fairly well

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.360 
as strong or knows this map fairly well
knowing<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.079> he<00:00:46.260> has<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.620> go<00:00:46.770> ahead<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.160> move

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
knowing that he has to go ahead and move

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.450 
knowing that he has to go ahead and move
out<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.820> try<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.090> scout<00:00:48.480> me<00:00:48.660> out<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:50.129> he's<00:00:50.280> now

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
out and try to scout me out so he's now

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.819 
out and try to scout me out so he's now
moving<00:00:50.850> out<00:00:51.059> with<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.539> probe<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.140> order<00:00:52.620> to

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
moving out with this probe in order to

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.770 
moving out with this probe in order to
do<00:00:52.980> some<00:00:53.160> early<00:00:53.460> scouting<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.449> believe

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
do some early scouting and I believe

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.840 
do some early scouting and I believe
that<00:00:54.809> he<00:00:55.050> knows<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.949> Terran<00:00:56.699> player

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
that he knows that a Terran player

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.760 
that he knows that a Terran player
really<00:00:57.360> likes<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.719> go<00:00:57.840> Reapers<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.559> map

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
really likes to go Reapers on this map

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.340 
really likes to go Reapers on this map
so<00:00:59.280> Reapers<00:00:59.850> are<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.030> very<00:01:00.329> very<00:01:00.600> strong<00:01:00.719> option

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
so Reapers are a very very strong option

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.810 
so Reapers are a very very strong option
he<00:01:01.469> sees<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.859> there's<00:01:02.039> already<00:01:02.250> an<00:01:02.460> early

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
he sees that there's already an early

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.570 
he sees that there's already an early
gas<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.629> play<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.470> now<00:01:04.860> trying<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.369> look

gas in in play and now trying to look

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.070 
gas in in play and now trying to look
for<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.820> barracks<00:01:06.180> will<00:01:06.330> find<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.750> barrack

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
to make sure that it gets taken down

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.950

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
go straight attack that probe as well

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.760 
go straight attack that probe as well

Phoenix the Stargate opening and I think

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.520 
Phoenix the Stargate opening and I think
it's<00:04:20.830> a<00:04:20.890> really<00:04:21.100> strong<00:04:21.640> opening<00:04:22.120> for<00:04:22.660> Protoss
