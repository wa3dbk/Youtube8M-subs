00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.490
 an application for android devices 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.830
 called free tv online I know that the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.950

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.910
 we can have something nice with this 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.369
 good application this application can 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.890
 explain something and a correct warning 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.290

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.950
 okay 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.390

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.640
 in some matches with transmission to 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.930
 real time but in others it does not have 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.820
 Real-time transmission of ok 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.820

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.270
 and stable 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:56.640
 and can get to see and have delayed 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:01.020
 how the volume was produced ok has 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:04.220
 delayed like a few seconds like 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.220

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.520
 that I would like you to load this 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.900

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.220

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.610
 with a little bit of the but in reality 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.370

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.930
 the transmission if it is in real time but 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.290
 with a few seconds overdue then 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:17.070
 let's remove 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.570
 and let's say there are channels that of those that 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.420
 they have 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.680
 sanjuÃ¡n punto tv that yes if they have in 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.510
 real transmission or that we're going to put 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.040
 although there is one that says justin tv or 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.610
 that our mission below put 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.610

 and there are others that we do not have in translation 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.990
 of water 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:54.270
 let's see channels let's see 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.080
 other channels we're going to see one from the USA 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.670
 the truth about me not me 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:03.440
 I wanted to try like mc but I did not 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:07.220
 how it worked 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.380
 you load it and it does not show up so these 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.200
 channels good even if you're from 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:16.570
 mexico try not to 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.130

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.630
 so far they did not work for me but 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.330
 let's try some of the other nation 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.849
 or some rare nation 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.389
 I value 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:43.749
 and here we have even a channel 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.119
 if you speak if you are interested in the culture of 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:48.849
 afghanistan so here we can prove it 

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:51.629
 although we will try something from france and 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.629
 do everything 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.930
 and the tv 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:05.550
 ok let's see mirabelle 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.550
 we'll see 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.980
 so let's see 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.450
 how can they see the application is very 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.120
 simple in the description I'm going to 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.910
 leave a link 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.600
 preferably download them in your 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:27.350
 Android device com so if I 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.639
 I get in here and automatically 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.850
 just that line here we're not going to 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:35.580
 walk to a link and automatically you 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.889
 is going to take you to the link and it 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.020
 is going to the sores this to 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.910
 automatically 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:47.009
 as the one that the application has said 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:48.810
 is not sure and it does not work 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:51.659
 many channels even the 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.380
 Mexican transmission from here we are 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:56.590
 well 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:59.980
 Mexican pride is even good 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:03.460
 it's not many channels like television 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:06.190
 open if it has got good transmission 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.410
 and others because I've realized that the 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.840
 that are not in this transmission have 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:14.650
 commercial transmission of that same 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:18.370
 day or between the week 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:20.950
 Most do not leave the zinc standard ok 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.490
 thank you very much this was all about you 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:26.490
 alcohol and visit our other videos 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.490
 OK
