00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
is inspired from the Eagle wing so

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.890 
is inspired from the Eagle wing so
that's<00:00:23.580> why<00:00:23.730> all<00:00:23.760> his<00:00:24.119> models<00:00:24.510> had<00:00:24.630> like<00:00:24.869> a

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
that's why all his models had like a

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.830 
that's why all his models had like a
wing<00:00:25.199> theme<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.980> every<00:00:26.340> -<00:00:26.970> every<00:00:27.000> model<00:00:27.539> and

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
actually the penny - is one of the first

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.319 
actually the penny - is one of the first
if<00:00:30.630> not<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.929> first<00:00:31.230> shoe<00:00:31.710> with<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.430> air<00:00:33.059> max

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
if not the first shoe with the air max

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.920 
if not the first shoe with the air max
heel<00:00:33.570> bag<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.350> Zoom<00:00:34.559> air<00:00:34.770> combined<00:00:35.840> so<00:00:36.840> if

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
heel bag and the Zoom air combined so if

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.180 
heel bag and the Zoom air combined so if
you<00:00:37.020> didn't<00:00:37.230> know<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.320> that's<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.739> little<00:00:37.920> a

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
you didn't know that that's a little a

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.139 
you didn't know that that's a little a
little<00:00:38.969> pointer<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.270> throw<00:00:39.540> out<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.870> there<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.680> I

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
little pointer I throw out it there so I

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.690 
little pointer I throw out it there so I
guess<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.329> as<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:43.410> did<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> black<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
guess a as I did the black you have the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.060 
guess a as I did the black you have the
original<00:00:45.210> here<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.690> then<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.020> have<00:00:46.230> last

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
except for the top of them on the retro

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.529 
except for the top of them on the retro
you<00:01:37.280> have<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:38.270> blue<00:01:38.539> material<00:01:39.530> right<00:01:40.039> here

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
you have the blue material right here

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.859 
you have the blue material right here
but<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:41.689> original<00:01:42.229> has<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.130> blue<00:01:43.280> material

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
but the original has the blue material

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.719 
but the original has the blue material
going<00:01:44.869> around<00:01:45.110> this<00:01:45.319> panel<00:01:45.679> right<00:01:45.830> here<00:01:46.069> so

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
going around this panel right here so

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.130 
going around this panel right here so
that's<00:01:46.849> one<00:01:47.090> of<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.270> major<00:01:47.420> differences<00:01:47.959> on

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
that's one of the major differences on

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.219 
that's one of the major differences on
the<00:01:48.259> Atlantic<00:01:48.649> pair<00:01:49.450> those<00:01:50.450> attorneys<00:01:50.780> around

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.410 

you<00:01:54.229> have<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:54.770> contrast<00:01:55.250> silver<00:01:55.970> stitching

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
you have the contrast silver stitching

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.910 
you have the contrast silver stitching
on<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:57.049> OG<00:01:57.349> pair<00:01:57.789> and<00:01:59.200> the<00:02:00.200> retro<00:02:00.409> has<00:02:00.740> the

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
on the OG pair and the retro has the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.889 
on the OG pair and the retro has the
white<00:02:01.069> stitching<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:02.209> another<00:02:02.599> slight

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
white stitching so another slight

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.289 
white stitching so another slight
difference<00:02:03.319> and<00:02:03.909> then<00:02:04.909> you<00:02:05.030> have<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.270> bottoms

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
difference and then you have the bottoms

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:16.679 
difference and then you have the bottoms
and<00:02:08.299> those<00:02:08.929> are<00:02:09.079> pretty<00:02:09.259> much<00:02:09.410> identical

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.449 

and<00:02:17.689> there's<00:02:18.409> one<00:02:18.620> more<00:02:18.769> look<00:02:18.980> at<00:02:19.280> the

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
and there's one more look at the

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.750 
and there's one more look at the
original<00:02:19.969> and<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.329> retro<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:24.549> that<00:02:25.549> pretty

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
original and the retro and that pretty

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.119 
original and the retro and that pretty
much<00:02:25.939> sums<00:02:26.239> it<00:02:26.420> up<00:02:26.510> for<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:27.530> Atlantic<00:02:27.950> blue

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
much sums it up for the Atlantic blue

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.369 
much sums it up for the Atlantic blue
