by<00:00:33.519> lightning<00:00:34.000> when<00:00:34.660> set<00:00:35.050> so<00:00:35.350> i<00:00:35.379> think<00:00:35.440> with

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
by lightning when set so i think with

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.560 
by lightning when set so i think with
defaults<00:00:35.890> every<00:00:36.040> 10<00:00:36.220> seconds<00:00:36.580> so<00:00:37.239> basically

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
defaults every 10 seconds so basically

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.650 
defaults every 10 seconds so basically

point<00:01:07.930> by<00:01:08.110> left-clicking<00:01:08.380> and<00:01:08.770> then<00:01:09.670> the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
point by left-clicking and then the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.480 
point by left-clicking and then the
other<00:01:09.880> point<00:01:10.119> in<00:01:10.330> jail<00:01:10.600> by<00:01:10.869> right-clicking

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
other point in jail by right-clicking

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.000 
other point in jail by right-clicking
indeed<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:12.759> then<00:01:13.479> you<00:01:14.259> will<00:01:14.380> need<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.680> go

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
indeed and then you will need to go

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.350 
indeed and then you will need to go
inside<00:01:15.160> it<00:01:15.660> so<00:01:16.660> go<00:01:16.810> inside<00:01:17.050> the<00:01:17.140> jail<00:01:18.360> walk

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
inside it so go inside the jail walk

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.670 
inside it so go inside the jail walk
inside<00:01:19.690> and<00:01:19.750> then<00:01:20.110> do<00:01:20.260> Joh<00:01:20.920> set<00:01:21.550> jail<00:01:24.630> okay

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
inside and then do Joh set jail okay

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.280 
inside and then do Joh set jail okay
right<00:01:26.680> okay<00:01:27.510> so<00:01:28.510> that's<00:01:28.720> where<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.050> jail

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
right okay so that's where the jail

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.670 
right okay so that's where the jail
location<00:01:29.830> is<00:01:29.980> so<00:01:30.340> whenever<00:01:30.670> you<00:01:30.850> Jo<00:01:31.120> someone

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
location is so whenever you Jo someone

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.370 
location is so whenever you Jo someone
that's<00:01:32.680> where<00:01:32.830> I<00:01:32.860> would<00:01:33.040> go<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.930> you<00:01:35.050> want<00:01:35.230> to

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
that's where I would go if you want to

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.310 
that's where I would go if you want to
add<00:01:35.620> protection<00:01:35.830> to<00:01:36.220> it<00:01:36.370> do<00:01:36.790> you<00:01:37.030> use<00:01:37.480> jrh

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
add protection to it do you use jrh

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.960 
add protection to it do you use jrh
protect<00:01:40.680> mm-hmm<00:01:41.680> and<00:01:41.860> that<00:01:42.580> will<00:01:42.700> stop<00:01:42.820> the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
protect mm-hmm and that will stop the

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.290 
protect mm-hmm and that will stop the
journal<00:01:43.870> documents<00:01:44.409> from<00:01:44.530> being<00:01:45.240> allowed<00:01:46.240> to

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.219 
configure it for lightning will strike
down<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:01.150> the<00:02:01.240> place<00:02:01.450> of<00:02:01.659> the<00:02:02.130> job<00:02:04.080> that's<00:02:05.080> how

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
down to the place of the job that's how

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.880 
down to the place of the job that's how
that<00:02:05.290> works<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:07.259> now<00:02:08.259> that<00:02:08.289> we've<00:02:08.709> actually

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
that works so now that we've actually

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.080 
that works so now that we've actually
created<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:10.170> let's<00:02:11.170> well<00:02:11.980> as<00:02:12.099> your<00:02:12.819> jaunt<00:02:13.000> to
