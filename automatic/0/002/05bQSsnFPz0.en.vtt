00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.580
 and what's up guys this is partner life and 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.290
 today I wanted to talk about a tea about a 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.990
 debate that originated on twitter does 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.770
 a few days that prompted him praised 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.240
 affirming first that all 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.060
 youtubers in spain ' make a content 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.860
 totally totally amateur and for 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.170
 statement by which they jumped for their 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.370
 youtubers as light especially I think that 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.810
 He was the first one to answer and he said 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.730
 that there are people who really do 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.310
 quality content and others and that 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.930
 prompted the praise of letting go of 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.580
 affirmation that any youtuber of 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.610
 Spain is on YouTube just like 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.010
 a means to be on television 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.870
 Then he also said that any 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.950
 youtuber 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.780
 totally generalizing any 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.700
 youtube I would lose my ass could the 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.200
 television even though this time 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.750
 said I had to leave youtube not 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.190
 be that youtube is simply a medium 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.420
 to get to television from a 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.160
 television asks you to leave youtube 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.930
 anyone would leave that obviously 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.430
 made blisters have been generated 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.140
 thousands of interactions there is a lot of debate 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.170
 and many to seo that you are cool 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.460
 you can go to twitter and see it if 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.680
 you search through the blogs 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.480
 surely you will find it 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.890
 and we also think we do not know 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.449
 but the Thai then to say for 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.060
 all the interactions that there were and 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.410
 We said that we particularly 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.330
 just as I said red-haired jack said what 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.850
 others we are not on youtube to be 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.280
 on television we were accused of demagogues 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.500
 that is to say that we are really saying 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.000
 that to please the fans and others and 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
 I wanted to give a little explanation 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.820
 wider here in a video than the one 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.370
 I could give on Twitter evidently with 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.100
 140 characters does not give you much 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.990
 I do not know what opinion I will have, I am going to give you the 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.390
 mine not even the back video 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.770
 because I'm going to talk not agreed on 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.360
 aragón álvaro of video legs and of 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.690
 partner the others simply is my 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.130
 opinion I particularly no no I do not think 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.430
 that we let youtube put the 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.260
 TV 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.670
 not by the fact that we make a 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.410
 content for the fans and not 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.490
 we want to abandon the fans and such that 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.690
 we think that the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.460
 subscribers yes but we do 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.500
 content for people not for 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.700
 subscribers or the fans if we 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.710
 we could do the content that 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.040
 we do for television and have a 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.930
 audience and be able to really do 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.150
 the videos that we like and when we 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.380
 I would love to be in 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.700
 television and that instead of a million 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.560
 people a month what they are seeing us 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.300
 could see ten million of course 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.280
 yes we will leave youtube of course 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.330
 Yes, that is, we make content 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.320
 for people and people are in 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.580
 internet and people are in the 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.530
 television just like people are in the 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.300
 cinema if they offered to be able to make a 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.830
 movie with a million euros and that does not 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.239
 if we know that we will see a lot of 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.370
 of course our goal in 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.050
 reality is to get to the movies is what we 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.310
 I would really like to do or have a 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.200
 television series but that we did 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.250
 us with our style we 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.050
 we have worked television and that 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.670
 generally if not hundred per 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.989
 hundred of cases is not possible when 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.670
 you work you are working for a 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.739
 television is always subject to a 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.030
 address that will cut you the type of 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.590
 videos that will not let you do what 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.600
 you think it's going to succeed there's always 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.580
 someone who thinks he knows more than you and that 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.600
 is our experience of which of what 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.030
 what happened to us when we have been 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.400
 television imagine that to praise 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.860
 passed in true in a certain way the same 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.180
 I do not think there is a supreme 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.740
 program that they wanted to do is 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.420
 exactly when what comes to do and 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.310
 how they wanted to do it there will be a person 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.560
 a content manager some people from 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.450
 script reviewers who will have been 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.340
 cutting everything that forms 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.440
 things are not suitable for television 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.610
 politically incorrect and others and that 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.530
 has done better that the program is not 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.940
 totally from an invoice that you see it 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.440
 and say what this has made it logical 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.300
 sure there is a very big difference 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.560
 between what the logical thing does if doing 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.970
 well because there is the theory and I do not know why 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.340
 what do I do like this for another I did not see the 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.220
 television but good what I said 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.020
 that the program did not think it was 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.000
 totally what they wanted to do in 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.740
 television imagine that's why it has 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.810
 generated all this debate I simply 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.400
 I wanted to give you our opinion 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.380
 we would go to television for a price 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.290
 obviously if they offer us power to do 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.910
 what we like a price then power 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.230
 make a living with doing what we 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.990
 like on television like we do 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.060
 on the internet if you just throw the 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.890
 question that the unco the logical of yes by 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.290
 a price we would leave the internet on the side 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.750
 on television if you will be going to the 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.280
 television to make a series 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.390
 for others who are reviewing us 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.590
 million or even that is not for 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.300
 we who are simply there 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.470
 so many working as in the face of 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.620
 camera as behind the camera 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.090
 I prefer to earn a hundred thousand times your channel 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.040
 thousand euros and be on the internet doing 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.020
 what I like with my friends and here 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.840
 when I like to be winning three 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.190
 thousand euros in a real real salary that 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.810
 can be on television and be 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.040
 working on camera in save me or in 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.080
 any other program with something that does not 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.560
 I like me I am like that there will be people who will 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.790
 like more to earn more money despite 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.220
 to be working on something that I do not like 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.290
 I left him a job with the one I had 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.520
 a salary and I was working doing 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.560
 program for a local television that 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.370
 I really did not see many people but 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.900
 I was working 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.280
 and I had an old salary and I left it for 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.930
 dedicate myself to youtube when I did not have 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.229
 no salary insured I am like that 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.090
 I want to dedicate myself to what I like and the 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.229
 work is most of our 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.760
 time and if you're really working 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.160
 what you do not like you are pretty unhappy 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.300
 I was at least I do not know Orlando 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.930
 this question to the air you what 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.460
 would you stop doing a job that does not 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.630
 you like nothing but where you are 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.280
 charging enough money for one that 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.750
 really fills you up and where you do not 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.760
 you want a lot of money I think that is 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.660
 the debate is not about whether we would leave youtube 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.190
 two million euros 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.570
 of course we will leave youtube for 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.220
 two million euros per please 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.449
 please if scarlett johansson comes to me and 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.100
 says leave everything that comes next 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.660
 with me I leave it but it 's that I do not know it's not going 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.610
 to spend no TV is going to tell you that 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.750
 leave u2 paul and television because 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.100
 YouTube is a platform that can 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.350
 promote television and that's what 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.940
 realizing now that if we are 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.110
 negotiating with televisions and we 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.479
 would love television if we 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.310
 they offer a good salary for being 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.930
 making content for television that 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.030
 we want it of course complement 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.500
 with youtube all the proposals 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.639
 what we have done is we make this 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.260
 content for television but what 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.310
 we promote from youtube is what 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.880
 they want the chains is also 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.740
 totally absurd to be told what 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.360
 and much more absurd is still that 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.980
 no chain is going to tell you I give you three 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.540
 million euros because you leave youtube 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.160
 which is an indecent proposal with the 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.510
 movie that they offer you a 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.150
 million group when you sleep with an aunt 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.320
 know that we are crazy 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.790
 you that for million euros that 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.800
 would you learn your mother ' 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.990
 normal normal bastards is that it is normal 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.370
 and what would leave is the work of 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.050
 you charge four thousand euros but that is a 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.540
 shit and you're making a mamporrero 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.680
 a horse in exchange for winning 700 euros 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.350
 but be doing what you really 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.350
 like what do you think come on then
