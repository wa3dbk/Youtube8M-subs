00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
this but about how to make a cake up a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.740 
this but about how to make a cake up a
right<00:00:37.649> paper<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.700> cut<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.059> round<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.570> it's

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
right paper just cut it round so it's

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.729 
right paper just cut it round so it's
about<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:40.350> size<00:00:41.420> but<00:00:42.420> if<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.570> don't<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:43.590> what

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
about that size but if you don't is what

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.090 
about that size but if you don't is what
to<00:00:43.860> do<00:00:43.980> you'll<00:00:44.370> need<00:00:44.579> air<00:00:45.390> scissors<00:00:47.120> tippex

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
to do you'll need air scissors tippex

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.319 
to do you'll need air scissors tippex
and<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.190> whole<00:00:50.309> bunch<00:00:51.770> okay<00:00:52.770> piece<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.070> paper

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
and a whole bunch okay piece of paper

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.670 
and a whole bunch okay piece of paper
you'll<00:00:54.329> probably<00:00:54.539> know<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.809> rough<00:00:54.989> size<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.620> a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
you'll probably know the rough size of a

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.119 
you'll probably know the rough size of a
cape<00:00:56.059> so<00:00:57.059> cut<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.539> out<00:00:57.829> and<00:00:58.829> then<00:01:00.980> make<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.100> a

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
cape so cut that out and then make it a

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.830 
cape so cut that out and then make it a
bit<00:01:02.250> smaller<00:01:02.550> by<00:01:02.879> cutting<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> edges<00:01:03.690> off<00:01:03.809> a

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
bit smaller by cutting the edges off a

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.340 
bit smaller by cutting the edges off a
bit<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.460> these<00:01:05.460> are<00:01:05.519> quite<00:01:05.760> sharp<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.990> maybe

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
bit so these are quite sharp so maybe

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:17.450 
bit so these are quite sharp so maybe
put<00:01:07.560> them<00:01:07.710> bit<00:01:07.950> curved<00:01:14.780> yeah

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
put them bit curved yeah

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.520 
put them bit curved yeah
then<00:01:18.460> you'll<00:01:18.880> get<00:01:18.999> your<00:01:19.119> hole<00:01:19.270> punch<00:01:19.530> down

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
then you'll get your hole punch down

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.359 
then you'll get your hole punch down
there<00:01:20.829> make<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:21.819> holes<00:01:22.319> since<00:01:23.319> eyes<00:01:25.439> then<00:01:26.439> get

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
there make the holes since eyes then get

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.039 
there make the holes since eyes then get
your<00:01:27.460> figure<00:01:27.670> I<00:01:28.000> look<00:01:28.479> through<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.689> jet<00:01:28.840> packs

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
your figure I look through the jet packs

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.340 
your figure I look through the jet packs
on<00:01:29.200> when<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:29.439> do<00:01:29.500> this<00:01:32.490> put<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:33.640> on<00:01:33.789> here<00:01:34.350> one

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
on when you do this put it on here one

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.990 
on when you do this put it on here one
hole<00:01:35.560> first<00:01:35.859> and<00:01:36.159> then<00:01:36.819> the<00:01:36.849> other<00:01:37.829> then<00:01:39.000> put

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
hole first and then the other then put

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.130 
hole first and then the other then put
his<00:01:40.119> helmet<00:01:40.599> on<00:01:40.869> and<00:01:42.450> that's<00:01:43.450> how<00:01:43.869> you<00:01:43.959> make<00:01:44.049> a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
his helmet on and that's how you make a

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.139 
his helmet on and that's how you make a
cape<00:01:46.140> secondly<00:01:47.140> its<00:01:48.130> helmet<00:01:48.549> this<00:01:48.880> is<00:01:49.030> the

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
cape secondly its helmet this is the

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.479 
cape secondly its helmet this is the
hardest<00:01:49.509> bit<00:01:49.750> as<00:01:50.649> you<00:01:50.829> can<00:01:50.979> see<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:52.299> is

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:53.489 
hardest bit as you can see this is

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:59.639 
hardest bit as you can see this is
completely<00:01:55.560> wait<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:58.689> you<00:01:59.079> see<00:01:59.349> if<00:01:59.590> you

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
completely wait and as you see if you

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.619 
completely wait and as you see if you
can<00:02:00.009> see<00:02:00.280> right<00:02:00.549> here<00:02:01.299> on<00:02:02.200> his<00:02:02.379> picture<00:02:03.629> create

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:04.629 
can see right here on his picture create

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:08.279 
can see right here on his picture create
my<00:02:04.780> picture<00:02:05.170> of<00:02:05.229> up<00:02:05.379> it's<00:02:06.250> not<00:02:06.520> exact<00:02:07.149> I<00:02:07.569> mean

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
my picture of up it's not exact I mean

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.800 
my picture of up it's not exact I mean
like<00:02:08.500> it's<00:02:08.859> not<00:02:09.220> has<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.179> doesn't<00:02:10.420> have<00:02:10.599> to<00:02:10.690> be

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
like it's not has to doesn't have to be

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.990 
like it's not has to doesn't have to be
perfect<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:11.769> as<00:02:11.859> you<00:02:11.920> can<00:02:12.010> see<00:02:12.190> mine<00:02:12.489> it's<00:02:12.819> not

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
perfect so as you can see mine it's not

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.530 
perfect so as you can see mine it's not
perfect<00:02:13.569> but<00:02:14.489> what<00:02:15.489> you<00:02:15.609> do<00:02:16.829> is<00:02:18.239> get<00:02:19.239> your<00:02:19.329> tip

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
perfect but what you do is get your tip

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
perfect but what you do is get your tip
X<00:02:19.950> check<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.099> and<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:22.720> look<00:02:22.900> up<00:02:23.019> at<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.380> get

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
X check it and you look up at you get

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.229 
X check it and you look up at you get
picture<00:02:23.950> while<00:02:24.130> doing<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:24.579> then<00:02:24.700> your<00:02:24.880> way

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
picture while doing it and then your way

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.839 
picture while doing it and then your way
to<00:02:25.299> the<00:02:25.900> squad<00:02:26.200> John<00:02:26.700> look<00:02:27.700> make<00:02:28.599> a<00:02:28.630> line<00:02:29.849> then

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
to the squad John look make a line then

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.470 
to the squad John look make a line then
one<00:02:31.660> line<00:02:31.870> over<00:02:32.109> there<00:02:32.319> and<00:02:32.700> one<00:02:33.700> line<00:02:34.030> over

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
one line over there and one line over

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.930 
one line over there and one line over
there<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:36.030> if<00:02:37.030> you've<00:02:37.180> got<00:02:37.359> any<00:02:37.569> on<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.109> visor

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
there and if you've got any on the visor

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.580 
there and if you've got any on the visor
here<00:02:39.940> let's<00:02:40.540> try<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.049> take<00:02:41.230> away<00:02:41.440> with<00:02:41.530> your

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
here let's try and take away with your

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.740 
here let's try and take away with your
fingernails<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:45.090> that's<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.269> summit<00:02:46.569> and

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
fingernails so that's a summit and

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.500 
fingernails so that's a summit and
that's<00:02:47.079> basically<00:02:47.290> all<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:48.180> done<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.329> other

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
that's basically all is done the other

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.009 
that's basically all is done the other
