now<00:00:09.360> I've<00:00:09.540> been<00:00:09.690> driving<00:00:09.900> this<00:00:10.170> thing<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:10.559> far

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
now I've been driving this thing so far

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.980 
now I've been driving this thing so far
just<00:00:10.980> using<00:00:11.340> MIDI<00:00:11.670> controllers<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.570> the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
just using MIDI controllers and the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.620 
just using MIDI controllers and the
mouse<00:00:13.139> but<00:00:13.830> we<00:00:13.950> can<00:00:14.099> also<00:00:14.219> use<00:00:14.630> timecodes

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
mouse but we can also use timecodes

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.769 
mouse but we can also use timecodes
control<00:00:16.379> records<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.949> cds<00:00:17.340> I've<00:00:17.609> got<00:00:17.779> record

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
control records and cds I've got record

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.340 
control records and cds I've got record
up<00:00:18.900> here<00:00:20.570> so<00:00:21.570> I'm<00:00:21.630> going<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.900> do<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.199> go

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
up here so I'm going to do is we go

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.590 
up here so I'm going to do is we go
ahead<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.830> engage<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.670> timecode<00:00:24.150> control

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
ahead and engage the timecode control

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.660 
ahead and engage the timecode control
within<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.289> preference<00:00:25.650> now<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.010> can<00:00:26.519> actually

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
within the preference now I can actually

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.140 
within the preference now I can actually
drop<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.599> needle<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:27.930> record<00:00:28.580> and<00:00:29.580> control<00:00:30.029> it

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
drop the needle on record and control it

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.340 
drop the needle on record and control it
combined<00:00:32.210> of<00:00:33.210> course<00:00:33.510> moving<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.050> needle<00:00:34.170> to

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
combined of course moving the needle to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.139 
combined of course moving the needle to
a<00:00:34.500> different<00:00:34.770> location<00:00:34.829> causes<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.790> song<00:00:36.000> to

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
a different location causes the song to

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.549 
a different location causes the song to
seek<00:00:36.719> ahead<00:00:37.250> just<00:00:38.250> like<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> real<00:00:38.640> record<00:00:39.559> or

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
seek ahead just like a real record or

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.979 
seek ahead just like a real record or
back<00:00:40.920> towards<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.280> beginning<00:00:43.730> and<00:00:44.840> right<00:00:45.840> now

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
back towards the beginning and right now

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.479 
back towards the beginning and right now
we<00:00:46.050> are<00:00:46.230> using<00:00:46.500> something<00:00:46.860> called<00:00:47.039> absolute

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
we are using something called absolute

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.220 
we are using something called absolute
mode<00:00:47.850> meaning<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.329> every<00:00:48.539> where<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.840> put<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
mode meaning that every where I put the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.840 
mode meaning that every where I put the
needle<00:00:49.500> root<00:00:49.739> represents<00:00:50.309> an<00:00:50.399> absolute

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
needle root represents an absolute

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.270 
needle root represents an absolute
location<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> music<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.710> if<00:00:52.949> i<00:00:53.039> were<00:00:53.160> to

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
location in the music so if i were to

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.959 
location in the music so if i were to
scratch<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.239> cause<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.020> needle<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.320> skip<00:00:55.969> i

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
scratch and cause the needle to skip i

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.490 
scratch and cause the needle to skip i
end<00:00:57.180> up<00:00:57.270> being<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.690> different<00:00:57.989> location<00:00:58.079> on

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
end up being in a different location on

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.119 
end up being in a different location on
the<00:00:58.590> song<00:00:59.359> to<00:01:00.359> prevent<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.710> option

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the song to prevent that this option

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.210 
the song to prevent that this option
right<00:01:02.340> here<00:01:02.750> switches<00:01:03.750> us<00:01:03.899> into<00:01:04.350> relative

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
right here switches us into relative

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.510 
right here switches us into relative
mode<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:06.540> now<00:01:06.770> it<00:01:07.770> doesn't<00:01:08.040> matter<00:01:08.070> where<00:01:08.490> i

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
mode so now it doesn't matter where i

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.890 
mode so now it doesn't matter where i
cook<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> record<00:01:09.210> all<00:01:09.420> i'm<00:01:09.600> doing<00:01:09.630> is

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
cook a record all i'm doing is

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.140 
cook a record all i'm doing is
controlling<00:01:10.470> playback<00:01:10.920> speed<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.939> if<00:01:12.030> i

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
controlling playback speed so if i

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.440 
controlling playback speed so if i
scratch<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.680> needle<00:01:13.950> skips<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.490> don't

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
scratch and the needle skips I don't

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.480 
scratch and the needle skips I don't
lose<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.780> sound<00:01:16.020> I'm<00:01:16.170> scratching<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.369> is

another<00:01:31.619> epic<00:01:31.979> here

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.500 

we've<00:01:35.950> got<00:01:36.130> something<00:01:36.520> called<00:01:36.730> quick<00:01:37.120> scratch

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
we've got something called quick scratch

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.570 
we've got something called quick scratch
which<00:01:38.170> basically<00:01:38.530> allows<00:01:38.680> you<00:01:39.040> to<00:01:39.130> take<00:01:39.340> any

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
which basically allows you to take any

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.490 
which basically allows you to take any
sample<00:01:40.150> that's<00:01:40.330> loaded<00:01:40.660> in<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.870> sampler<00:01:41.320> and

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
sample that's loaded in the sampler and

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.110 
sample that's loaded in the sampler and
immediately<00:01:42.010> replace<00:01:42.490> what<00:01:42.820> you're<00:01:42.940> playing

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
immediately replace what you're playing

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.420 
immediately replace what you're playing
on<00:01:43.330> a<00:01:43.360> deck<00:01:43.600> with<00:01:43.870> that<00:01:43.900> sample<00:01:44.590> so<00:01:45.190> for

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
on a deck with that sample so for

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.420 
on a deck with that sample so for
example<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:46.030> hit<00:01:46.840> us<00:01:47.140> one<00:01:47.410> and<00:01:47.710> I<00:01:48.250> end<00:01:48.370> up

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
example a hit us one and I end up

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.980 
example a hit us one and I end up
getting<00:01:48.760> the<00:01:49.440> infamous<00:01:50.440> awesome<00:01:51.870> which<00:01:52.870> we've

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
getting the infamous awesome which we've

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.860 
getting the infamous awesome which we've
all<00:01:53.140> heard<00:01:53.350> before<00:01:53.500> I<00:01:57.330> would<00:01:58.330> scratch<00:01:58.600> if<00:01:58.750> I

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
all heard before I would scratch if I

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.260 
all heard before I would scratch if I
could<00:01:59.110> but<00:01:59.290> I<00:01:59.380> can't<00:01:59.410> but<00:02:00.220> I'm<00:02:00.340> sure<00:02:00.550> some<00:02:00.760> care

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
could but I can't but I'm sure some care
