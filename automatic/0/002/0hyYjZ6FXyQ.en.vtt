like this one a lot it's great because
it<00:00:09.420> mimics<00:00:09.780> some<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.050> patterns<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.469> you

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
it mimics some of the patterns that you

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.580 
it mimics some of the patterns that you
find<00:00:10.860> in<00:00:11.070> regroup<00:00:11.519> situations<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.349> it's<00:00:13.349> I

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
find in regroup situations and it's I

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.650 
find in regroup situations and it's I
like<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.950> because<00:00:14.040> it's<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.519> bit<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.269> confined

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
like it because it's a bit of a confined

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.540 
like it because it's a bit of a confined
space<00:00:15.750> drill<00:00:16.199> there's<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.440> lot<00:00:16.680> going<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.400> a

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
then on the next whistle the opposite

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.970 
then on the next whistle the opposite
two<00:00:49.920> lines<00:00:50.129> will<00:00:50.340> go<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.239> start<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> drill

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
two lines will go so to start the drill

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
without a puck and start turning up ice

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.170 
without a puck and start turning up ice
the<00:00:58.620> first<00:00:59.280> player<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.609> other<00:00:59.730> other<00:00:59.940> line

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the first player of the other other line

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.970 
the first player of the other other line
is<00:01:00.329> doing<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> same<00:01:00.750> thing<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.469> second

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
is doing the same thing so the second

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.640 
is doing the same thing so the second
player<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:03.059> each<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.719> these<00:01:03.870> two<00:01:04.140> lines<00:01:04.409> needs

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
player in each of these two lines needs

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.899

to be ready with a puck

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.340 
to be ready with a puck
so<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> second<00:01:06.689> player<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:06.960> line<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.200> going<00:01:07.290> to

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
so the second player in line is going to

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.370

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.719 
from the same line that he or she left

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.309 
from so that final pass comes out and at
this<00:02:09.119> point<00:02:09.390> what<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.629> wanted<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.929> just<00:02:10.110> quickly

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
this point what I wanted to just quickly

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.630 
this point what I wanted to just quickly
mention<00:02:10.530> every<00:02:10.890> coach<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.069> different<00:02:11.489> my

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
mention every coach is different my

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.949 
mention every coach is different my
philosophy<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.180> don't<00:02:12.540> take<00:02:12.750> your<00:02:12.840> eye<00:02:12.930> off

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
philosophy is don't take your eye off

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.490 
philosophy is don't take your eye off
the<00:02:13.140> pocket

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the pocket

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.590 
the pocket
you<00:02:13.680> absolutely<00:02:14.100> have<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.370> but<00:02:15.210> try<00:02:15.450> your

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
you absolutely have to but try your

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.270 
you absolutely have to but try your
hardest<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:16.170> never<00:02:16.740> have<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.010> take<00:02:17.130> your<00:02:17.250> eye

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
hardest to never have to take your eye

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.790 
hardest to never have to take your eye
off<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.940> off<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.390> passer<00:02:18.810> because<00:02:19.710> the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
off the off the passer because the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.110 
off the off the passer because the
passer<00:02:20.070> might<00:02:20.220> need<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.430> make<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.670> pass

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
passer might need to make the pass

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.060 
passer might need to make the pass
at<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.870> know<00:02:21.900> at<00:02:22.080> any<00:02:22.290> point<00:02:22.650> along<00:02:22.800> this

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
at you know at any point along this

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.760 
at you know at any point along this
trajectory<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.450> what<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.170> recommend<00:02:25.350> is

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
trajectory and so what I recommend is

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.920 
trajectory and so what I recommend is
just<00:02:25.800> do<00:02:26.100> an<00:02:26.340> inside<00:02:26.700> reverse<00:02:26.850> pivot<00:02:27.240> at<00:02:27.480> about

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
just do an inside reverse pivot at about

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.230 
just do an inside reverse pivot at about
the<00:02:28.050> bottom<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.560> little<00:02:29.280> loop<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.700> so

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
the bottom of that little loop and so

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.970 
the bottom of that little loop and so
that<00:02:30.420> way<00:02:30.570> this<00:02:31.020> players<00:02:31.320> never<00:02:31.560> taken<00:02:31.890> his

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
that way this players never taken his

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.520 
that way this players never taken his
eye<00:02:32.100> off<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.910> passer<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.020> little<00:02:34.200> inside

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
eye off the passer so a little inside

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.890 
eye off the passer so a little inside
reverse<00:02:34.770> pivot<00:02:34.950> turn<00:02:35.490> up<00:02:35.670> ice<00:02:35.850> receive<00:02:36.750> that

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
reverse pivot turn up ice receive that

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.620 
reverse pivot turn up ice receive that
fifth<00:02:37.200> pass<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.830> then<00:02:38.490> basically<00:02:39.480> you're

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
fifth pass and then basically you're

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.320 
fifth pass and then basically you're
just<00:02:39.660> off<00:02:39.990> to<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.170> races<00:02:40.350> so<00:02:40.680> then<00:02:41.610> this<00:02:41.850> the

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
just off to the races so then this the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.540 
just off to the races so then this the
puck<00:02:42.480> here<00:02:42.660> take<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.170> down<00:02:43.380> cut<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.370> net

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
puck here take it down cut to the net

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.650 
puck here take it down cut to the net
and<00:02:45.020> take<00:02:46.020> shot<00:02:46.230> on<00:02:46.350> net<00:02:47.239> so<00:02:48.239> like<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.480> said

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
and take shot on net so like I said

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.600 
and take shot on net so like I said
great<00:02:48.900> drill<00:02:49.170> mimic<00:02:49.650> some<00:02:49.830> of<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.010> some<00:02:50.580> of
