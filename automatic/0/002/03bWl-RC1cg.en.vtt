00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:03.729
 Jelle Foxes still bought Tim Thomas so won 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.040
 do you think 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.540
 with them rarely wetzels last week even sweeter and one more states it 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.239
 they have a hard time coming from playing opportunities 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.390
 after the road 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.509
 we keep playing football and then the wit we use for all odds i 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:23.980
 had come and 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.740
 with the fact that I am gone and then further deepen the score 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:29.210
 became thirteenth 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.210
 to buy drugs 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.690
 although the police were looking for order 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.810
 just without an ex-husband 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.040
 but do not want to know themselves 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.380
 try to win for the weeks if you can make the goals 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.710
 but I died there in turn 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.550
 belgacom returns he initially wanted to make it a goal 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.000
 what I think of Westermann 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.620
 It now appears I will go through the sources 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.840
 they drove with such an upgrade but if i wasn't proud he never did 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.930
 so want 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.090
 I don't think so 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.400
 difficult to keep playing football in the first half hour of the trip 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.530
 knowing that those opportunities will arise 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.780
 pity our quality is also the one 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.780
 We know that we should continue to be proud to do so 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.440
 then it is also that he said we expect in cinemec say tired 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.370
 hit in one 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.610
 They were doing things a little less again and both were put to the test 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.930
 now a number of difficult competitions on paper chaos are emerging 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.450
 according to cfo very ready 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.690
 almere 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.690
 today about difficult match or that it is still difficult 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.500
 think that in those easy matches there are moke and have 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.470
 the points that we have that no one takes advantage of 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.560
 with the plans that are very nice closely followed by those that are more difficult 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.560
 then others 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.510
 Kevin the brown hair 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.850
 massive signatures of youth cars in ghent has suggested that for you 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.340
 yes i am very content 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.430
 the people are happy when they have the real art of ammunition 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.930
 I never have problems with three people 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.180
 that you make better and that has nothing to do 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.499
 people are scared and therefore content 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:12.769
 25 to 27 that is a very impressive result 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.079
 yes think so but babos not yet known 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:21.929
 the national and pakske more and I think he was shocked and I do our best 

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:23.249
 in front of 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.909
 I will tell you the game was not noticed 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.370
 but I feel like you know better about organon beforehand 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.469
 football you can skate from last year was all about demonstrators 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.450
 yes i have been you for a year but we know the team in the world is great 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:38.509
 that again 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:41.209
 as well as weak spots they can and 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.499
 that's why we find it harder to find the hangover but I think 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.870
 that it took half an hour to play more and more things the actions went from 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.539
 job and the second half 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:54.539
 trying to persuade it a number of times from 5 satisfied with this achievement 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.789
 we all go almere 

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:03.379
 this market minister of safety is on March 9, as I myself am used to 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.699
 I think that collection after which one with the image that September 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:09.769
 that it is less nice man 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.769
 but in a large number it all but falls 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.729
 where does it go back and forth 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.159
 get as far as possible 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.459
 That makes it more difficult that she makes fun when she is there 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.399
 We can take good points 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:26.990
 last year thought for a bonus of 3 percent 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.419
 with a very difficult game yes always 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.239
 that is not going to be for nothing 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.059
 I only think content can be 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:37.749
 but yes be the judiciary 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:40.689
 we will get a number of teams in the pipeline to play more football 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.929
 maybe that is in favor of the physical 

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:48.359
 yes maybe we also prefer to play football but what the others 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.059
 PhD student 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:53.969
 this week too we may have to sometimes be the way once 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.059
 on cs 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:59.219
 recently his margin dissolved 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.879
 and then a little national team 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.879
 yes we will see if they wish and 

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:08.589
 can you look forward to that 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:10.629
 yes leader 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.889
 cite the story 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.019
 that is 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.079
 they did not even work together once and it was noted
