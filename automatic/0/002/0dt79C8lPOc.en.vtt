seven stability doesn't really seem

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.240 
seven stability doesn't really seem
worth<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.420> me<00:01:42.570> but<00:01:42.780> if<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:42.960> really<00:01:43.259> just

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
worth it to me but if you really just

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.399 
worth it to me but if you really just
really<00:01:44.850> want<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.090> silence<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.570> then<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.229> can

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
really want to silence it then you can

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.859 
really want to silence it then you can
do<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.220> guess<00:01:47.540> so<00:01:48.540> there's<00:01:48.720> what<00:01:48.840> looks

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
do that I guess so there's what looks

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.139 
do that I guess so there's what looks
like<00:01:49.310> so<00:01:50.310> we're<00:01:50.430> not<00:01:50.490> going<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.790> that

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
like so we're not going to do that that

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.389 
like so we're not going to do that that
is<00:01:51.240> making<00:01:51.360> sense<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.750> me<00:01:52.220> we're<00:01:53.220> going<00:01:53.310> to

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
is making sense to me we're going to

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.859 
is making sense to me we're going to
slap<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.759> barrel<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.180> here<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.600> we're<00:01:54.689> going

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
slap this barrel on here and we're going

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.959 
slap this barrel on here and we're going
to<00:01:54.899> slap<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> site<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.829> at<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.490> cost<00:01:56.759> of

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
to slap a site on to it at a cost of

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.310 
to slap a site on to it at a cost of
three<00:01:57.240> concealment<00:01:57.750> but<00:01:57.869> we<00:01:57.960> gained<00:01:58.079> three

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
three concealment but we gained three

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.540 
three concealment but we gained three
stability<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.189> really<00:01:59.820> no<00:01:59.969> reason<00:02:00.149> not<00:02:00.360> to

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.940 

so<00:02:04.550> check<00:02:04.820> that<00:02:04.850> bad<00:02:05.150> boy<00:02:05.300> out<00:02:05.770> it's<00:02:06.770> pretty

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
so check that bad boy out it's pretty

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.770 
so check that bad boy out it's pretty
cool<00:02:07.100> right<00:02:07.160> let's<00:02:08.030> take<00:02:08.180> to<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.390> range<00:02:08.630> and

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
cool right let's take to the range and

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.680 
cool right let's take to the range and
see<00:02:09.320> how<00:02:09.470> it<00:02:09.619> fares<00:02:10.090> all<00:02:11.090> right<00:02:11.210> so<00:02:11.360> we<00:02:11.510> are<00:02:11.600> at

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
see how it fares all right so we are at

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.600 
see how it fares all right so we are at
the<00:02:11.780> shooting<00:02:12.080> range<00:02:12.140> in<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.830> safe<00:02:13.040> house<00:02:13.220> I

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
the shooting range in the safe house I

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.490 
the shooting range in the safe house I
just<00:02:14.510> want<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.690> kind<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:14.870> see<00:02:15.020> how<00:02:15.140> this<00:02:15.290> thing

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
just want to kind of see how this thing

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.810 
just want to kind of see how this thing
fires<00:02:15.740> before<00:02:16.010> I<00:02:16.160> take<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.460> out<00:02:16.550> into<00:02:16.700> the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
fires before I take it out into the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.010 
fires before I take it out into the
actual<00:02:17.060> game<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:17.870> let's<00:02:18.080> see<00:02:18.230> here<00:02:19.990> see<00:02:20.990> a

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
actual game so let's see here see a

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.220 
actual game so let's see here see a
little<00:02:21.170> bit<00:02:21.260> of<00:02:21.320> sway<00:02:21.590> going<00:02:21.860> on<00:02:21.950> there<00:02:23.230> that

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
little bit of sway going on there that

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:32.500 
little bit of sway going on there that
was<00:02:24.320> pretty<00:02:24.530> on<00:02:24.680> target<00:02:31.060> alright<00:02:32.060> as<00:02:32.240> you<00:02:32.300> can

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
was pretty on target alright as you can

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.030 
was pretty on target alright as you can
see<00:02:32.660> it<00:02:32.870> reloads<00:02:33.290> one<00:02:33.560> bullet<00:02:33.800> at<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:34.010> time

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
see it reloads one bullet at a time

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.220 
see it reloads one bullet at a time
which<00:02:34.520> is<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:35.030> know<00:02:35.060> pretty<00:02:35.570> authentic<00:02:35.840> i

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
which is you know pretty authentic i

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:44.650 
which is you know pretty authentic i
would<00:02:36.350> say<00:02:37.060> see<00:02:38.060> we<00:02:38.090> got<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.450> end<00:02:38.570> of<00:02:38.660> here<00:02:43.660> you

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
would say see we got the end of here you

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.510 
would say see we got the end of here you
can<00:02:44.780> see<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.200> sights<00:02:45.950> are<00:02:46.100> a<00:02:46.130> little<00:02:46.280> bit

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
can see the sights are a little bit

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.310 
can see the sights are a little bit
inaccurate<00:02:47.030> you<00:02:47.810> can<00:02:47.930> see<00:02:48.050> it<00:02:48.140> kind<00:02:48.200> of

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
inaccurate you can see it kind of

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.660 
inaccurate you can see it kind of
swaying<00:02:48.530> around<00:02:48.709> but<00:02:49.040> i<00:02:49.070> think<00:02:49.280> it's<00:02:49.430> just<00:02:49.610> a

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
swaying around but i think it's just a

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
swaying around but i think it's just a
graphical<00:02:50.090> thing<00:02:50.240> it<00:02:50.360> doesn't<00:02:50.480> seem<00:02:50.660> like

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
graphical thing it doesn't seem like

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.080 
graphical thing it doesn't seem like
actually<00:02:50.930> affects<00:02:51.350> anything<00:02:51.940> see<00:02:52.940> you<00:02:53.000> look

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
actually affects anything see you look

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.600 
actually affects anything see you look
at<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:57.040> despite<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.160> fact<00:02:58.310> that<00:02:58.430> i'm

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
at that despite the fact that i'm

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.280 
at that despite the fact that i'm
obviously<00:02:58.760> not<00:02:59.030> on<00:02:59.510> point<00:02:59.840> it's<00:03:00.110> still

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
obviously not on point it's still

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.430 
obviously not on point it's still
hitting<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.620> same<00:03:00.770> exact<00:03:01.100> place<00:03:04.720> so<00:03:05.720> there's

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
hitting the same exact place so there's

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.130 
hitting the same exact place so there's
that's<00:03:06.590> consider<00:03:06.860> i<00:03:06.920> guess<00:03:07.930> let's<00:03:08.930> go<00:03:09.050> in

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
that's consider i guess let's go in

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:24.900 
that's consider i guess let's go in
gamma<00:03:09.320> see<00:03:09.530> how<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:09.650> goes

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.190 

alright<00:03:25.910> last<00:03:26.180> but<00:03:26.240> not<00:03:26.420> least<00:03:26.480> let's<00:03:26.930> check

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
alright last but not least let's check

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.450 
alright last but not least let's check
out<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.350> ammo<00:03:27.650> pick<00:03:27.830> up<00:03:27.950> on<00:03:28.100> this<00:03:28.190> thing<00:03:28.250> and

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
out the ammo pick up on this thing and

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.130 
out the ammo pick up on this thing and
see<00:03:28.700> how<00:03:28.910> it<00:03:29.030> stacks<00:03:29.300> up<00:03:29.510> against<00:03:29.930> other

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
see how it stacks up against other

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.560 
see how it stacks up against other
weapons<00:03:30.590> alright<00:03:31.460> so<00:03:31.640> one<00:03:31.820> mo<00:03:32.060> pickup<00:03:32.420> is

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
weapons alright so one mo pickup is

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.880 
weapons alright so one mo pickup is
going<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:32.810> give<00:03:32.900> me<00:03:33.020> one<00:03:33.260> bullet<00:03:33.530> it<00:03:33.740> looks

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
going to give me one bullet it looks

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.080 
going to give me one bullet it looks
like<00:03:34.270> 11<00:03:36.100> this<00:03:37.100> isn't<00:03:37.400> necessarily<00:03:37.850> a<00:03:38.000> bad

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
like 11 this isn't necessarily a bad

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.560 
like 11 this isn't necessarily a bad
pick<00:03:38.780> up<00:03:38.930> rate<00:03:39.200> I<00:03:39.580> guess<00:03:40.580> but<00:03:41.210> it's<00:03:41.390> not

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
pick up rate I guess but it's not

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.840 
pick up rate I guess but it's not
exactly<00:03:41.990> spectacular<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:42.950> honestly<00:03:43.460> most<00:03:43.730> of

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
exactly spectacular and honestly most of

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.830 
exactly spectacular and honestly most of
the<00:03:43.940> other<00:03:44.060> rifles<00:03:44.480> are<00:03:44.720> just<00:03:45.050> better<00:03:46.040> overall

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
the other rifles are just better overall

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.330 
the other rifles are just better overall
not<00:03:47.840> just<00:03:48.050> in<00:03:48.170> terms<00:03:48.290> of<00:03:48.530> ammo<00:03:48.770> pick<00:03:49.040> up<00:03:49.160> right

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
not just in terms of ammo pick up right

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.770 
not just in terms of ammo pick up right
there<00:03:49.490> just<00:03:49.670> generally<00:03:50.210> speaking<00:03:50.240> they're

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
there just generally speaking they're

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.860 
there just generally speaking they're
just<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:51.020> lot<00:03:51.200> more<00:03:51.380> versatile<00:03:51.890> or<00:03:52.040> not<00:03:52.870> better

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
just a lot more versatile or not better

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.640 
just a lot more versatile or not better
guns<00:03:54.530> than<00:03:54.980> this<00:03:55.160> thing<00:03:56.200> so<00:03:57.200> that<00:03:57.230> being<00:03:57.590> said

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
guns than this thing so that being said

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.290 
guns than this thing so that being said
here's<00:03:58.100> my<00:03:58.280> kind<00:03:58.490> of<00:03:58.550> final<00:03:58.880> thoughts<00:03:59.060> about

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
here's my kind of final thoughts about

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.199 
here's my kind of final thoughts about
this<00:03:59.480> gun<00:03:59.800> it<00:04:00.800> is<00:04:00.920> kind<00:04:01.130> of<00:04:01.220> cool<00:04:01.370> it's

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
this gun it is kind of cool it's

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.530 
this gun it is kind of cool it's
different<00:04:03.080> I<00:04:03.530> guess<00:04:03.700> but<00:04:04.700> honestly<00:04:05.060> it's<00:04:05.300> not

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
different I guess but honestly it's not

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.449 
different I guess but honestly it's not
really<00:04:06.110> that<00:04:06.230> good<00:04:06.530> it's<00:04:06.740> not<00:04:06.920> even<00:04:07.190> better<00:04:07.370> I

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
really that good it's not even better I

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:08.890 
really that good it's not even better I
would<00:04:07.580> say<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:07.940> rattlesnake<00:04:08.480> which<00:04:08.750> is

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
would say the rattlesnake which is

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.360 
would say the rattlesnake which is
probably<00:04:09.050> the<00:04:09.230> closest<00:04:09.590> comparison<00:04:09.920> that<00:04:10.280> you

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
probably the closest comparison that you

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.910 
probably the closest comparison that you
could<00:04:10.520> draw<00:04:10.700> another<00:04:11.530> currently<00:04:12.530> existing

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
could draw another currently existing

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.550 
could draw another currently existing
sniper<00:04:13.190> rifle<00:04:13.550> the<00:04:14.270> fact<00:04:14.510> that<00:04:14.600> the<00:04:14.840> mods<00:04:15.290> on

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
sniper rifle the fact that the mods on

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.740 
sniper rifle the fact that the mods on
it<00:04:15.680> are<00:04:15.800> so<00:04:16.010> limited<00:04:16.250> pretty<00:04:17.180> much<00:04:17.330> means<00:04:17.600> that

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
it are so limited pretty much means that

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.520 
it are so limited pretty much means that
you<00:04:17.810> don't<00:04:17.870> really<00:04:18.019> have<00:04:18.170> a<00:04:18.260> whole<00:04:18.380> lot<00:04:18.410> of

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
you don't really have a whole lot of

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.229 
you don't really have a whole lot of
options<00:04:18.739> in<00:04:19.160> terms<00:04:19.220> of<00:04:19.640> what<00:04:19.820> you<00:04:19.880> can<00:04:20.000> do<00:04:20.120> with

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
options in terms of what you can do with

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.260 
options in terms of what you can do with
it<00:04:20.269> and<00:04:20.570> it's<00:04:20.630> just<00:04:21.019> kind<00:04:21.260> of<00:04:21.410> I<00:04:21.910> don't<00:04:22.910> see<00:04:23.150> why

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
it and it's just kind of I don't see why

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.760 
it and it's just kind of I don't see why
you<00:04:23.330> bother<00:04:23.540> to<00:04:23.630> have<00:04:23.870> even<00:04:24.080> a<00:04:24.200> mod<00:04:24.380> slot<00:04:24.650> if

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
you bother to have even a mod slot if

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.860 
you bother to have even a mod slot if
it's<00:04:24.919> just<00:04:25.130> one<00:04:25.490> mod<00:04:25.730> for<00:04:26.030> that<00:04:26.150> one<00:04:26.360> slot<00:04:26.660> it

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
it's just one mod for that one slot it

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.020 
it's just one mod for that one slot it
just<00:04:27.050> seems<00:04:27.260> kind<00:04:27.470> of<00:04:27.530> silly<00:04:28.400> i<00:04:28.580> guess<00:04:28.820> i<00:04:28.970> don't

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
just seems kind of silly i guess i don't

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.250 
just seems kind of silly i guess i don't
know<00:04:29.210> but<00:04:29.300> that's<00:04:29.480> just<00:04:29.600> my<00:04:29.810> thoughts<00:04:30.050> about

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
know but that's just my thoughts about

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.340 
know but that's just my thoughts about
it<00:04:30.410> yeah<00:04:31.340> overall<00:04:31.790> i<00:04:32.000> would<00:04:32.660> just<00:04:33.080> kind<00:04:33.230> of

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
it yeah overall i would just kind of

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.800 
it yeah overall i would just kind of
avoid<00:04:33.560> this<00:04:33.710> gun<00:04:33.919> it's<00:04:34.100> not<00:04:34.630> spectacular<00:04:35.630> it's

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
avoid this gun it's not spectacular it's

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.710 
avoid this gun it's not spectacular it's
not<00:04:35.930> terrible<00:04:36.440> it's<00:04:36.860> just<00:04:37.130> mediocre<00:04:37.640> and<00:04:38.540> i

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
not terrible it's just mediocre and i

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.120 
not terrible it's just mediocre and i
guess<00:04:39.140> a<00:04:39.200> little<00:04:39.290> bit<00:04:39.440> disappointing<00:04:39.980> maybe

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
guess a little bit disappointing maybe

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.490 
guess a little bit disappointing maybe
and<00:04:41.000> i<00:04:41.060> think<00:04:41.300> most<00:04:41.480> damning<00:04:41.930> of<00:04:41.990> all<00:04:42.140> is<00:04:42.380> the

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
and i think most damning of all is the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.420 
and i think most damning of all is the
fact<00:04:42.530> that<00:04:42.860> this<00:04:43.100> gun<00:04:43.370> reloads<00:04:44.300> one<00:04:44.980> bullet<00:04:45.980> at

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
fact that this gun reloads one bullet at

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.480 
fact that this gun reloads one bullet at
a<00:04:47.210> time<00:04:47.650> making<00:04:48.650> it<00:04:48.830> a<00:04:48.950> pain<00:04:49.160> in<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.310> ass<00:04:49.460> to

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
a time making it a pain in the ass to

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.990 
a time making it a pain in the ass to
get<00:04:49.730> reloaded<00:04:50.230> in<00:04:51.230> most<00:04:51.560> circumstances<00:04:52.000> but

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
get reloaded in most circumstances but

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.610 
get reloaded in most circumstances but
let<00:04:53.600> me<00:04:53.630> know<00:04:53.720> if<00:04:53.780> you<00:04:53.870> guys<00:04:53.990> make<00:04:54.169> of<00:04:54.320> this<00:04:54.410> gun
