here in state competition it's amazing
we<00:00:41.540> thought<00:00:41.720> we<00:00:41.900> might<00:00:42.080> make<00:00:42.290> it<00:00:42.440> past

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
we thought we might make it past

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.640 
we thought we might make it past
regionals<00:00:43.460> but<00:00:43.700> to<00:00:44.600> make<00:00:44.750> it<00:00:44.870> to<00:00:44.989> state<00:00:45.230> that's

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
regionals but to make it to state that's

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.800

an<00:01:23.030> idea<00:01:23.360> for<00:01:23.780> an<00:01:23.869> invention<00:01:24.170> I<00:01:24.530> came<00:01:24.920> up<00:01:25.009> with

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
an idea for an invention I came up with

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.080 
an idea for an invention I came up with
this<00:01:25.160> idea<00:01:25.310> because<00:01:25.610> my<00:01:25.729> grandma<00:01:26.000> was

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
this idea because my grandma was

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.550 
this idea because my grandma was
handicapped<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:26.750> it's<00:01:27.140> hard<00:01:27.350> to<00:01:27.410> get<00:01:27.500> her

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
handicapped and it's hard to get her

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.460 
handicapped and it's hard to get her
mail<00:01:28.000> so<00:01:29.000> how<00:01:29.060> about<00:01:29.119> this<00:01:29.360> to<00:01:29.450> get<00:01:29.570> a<00:01:29.600> mail<00:01:29.780> you

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
mail so how about this to get a mail you

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.130 
mail so how about this to get a mail you
have<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.770> market<00:01:31.130> it<00:01:31.300> you<00:01:32.300> have<00:01:32.450> to<00:01:32.570> present<00:01:32.750> it

would<00:02:07.740> double<00:02:07.980> take<00:02:08.100> this<00:02:08.280> experience<00:02:08.610> with

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
would double take this experience with

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.999 
would double take this experience with
me<00:02:09.060> no<00:02:09.179> matter<00:02:09.300> where<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.600> got<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.679> Texas

competing<00:02:34.800> at<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.130> TCA<00:02:35.550> level<00:02:36.060> our<00:02:36.600> kids<00:02:36.870> are

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
competing at the TCA level our kids are

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.630 
competing at the TCA level our kids are
elementary<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:37.740> they've<00:02:37.860> actually<00:02:38.100> been<00:02:38.430> able

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
elementary so they've actually been able

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.570 
elementary so they've actually been able
to<00:02:39.050> further<00:02:40.050> their<00:02:40.290> education<00:02:40.320> any<00:02:41.190> questions

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
to further their education any questions

to further their education any questions
they<00:02:41.670> had<00:02:41.880> in<00:02:42.290> programming<00:02:43.290> their<00:02:43.410> robots

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
they had in programming their robots

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.440 
they had in programming their robots
they<00:02:43.860> were<00:02:43.950> able<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.400> contact<00:02:44.760> TCA<00:02:45.090> at<00:02:45.300> any

responding<00:02:47.459> immediately<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:49.200> allows<00:02:49.440> kids<00:02:49.680> to

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
responding immediately it allows kids to

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.530 
responding immediately it allows kids to
really<00:02:50.220> get<00:02:50.580> creative<00:02:50.790> with<00:02:51.180> what<00:02:51.390> they<00:02:51.480> do

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
really get creative with what they do

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.380 
really get creative with what they do
and<00:02:52.130> show<00:02:53.130> what<00:02:53.340> they're<00:02:53.489> capable<00:02:53.670> of

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
and show what they're capable of

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.310 
and show what they're capable of
I<00:02:54.420> know<00:02:54.630> there's<00:02:54.870> some<00:02:54.959> schools<00:02:55.200> out<00:02:55.290> there

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
I know there's some schools out there

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.870 
I know there's some schools out there
who<00:02:55.500> don't<00:02:55.620> offer<00:02:55.860> these<00:02:56.100> kind<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.310> things<00:02:56.550> and

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
who don't offer these kind of things and

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.250 
who don't offer these kind of things and
this<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.270> a<00:02:57.300> really<00:02:57.570> great<00:02:57.690> way<00:02:57.840> for<00:02:57.870> kids<00:02:58.080> to

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
this is a really great way for kids to

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.840 
this is a really great way for kids to
get<00:02:58.380> involved<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:59.070> schools<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.550> are<00:02:59.700> not

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
get involved the schools that are not

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.180 
get involved the schools that are not
involved<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.420> TCA<00:03:00.870> at<00:03:01.110> this<00:03:01.290> point<00:03:01.590> we<00:03:02.130> really

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
involved in TCA at this point we really

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.699 
involved in TCA at this point we really
need<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.640> come<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.180> visit<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.900> watch<00:03:04.200> some<00:03:04.620> of

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
need to come and visit and watch some of

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.770 
need to come and visit and watch some of
this<00:03:04.830> because<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:06.090> way<00:03:06.239> they<00:03:06.390> could<00:03:06.540> get<00:03:06.630> an

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
this because that way they could get an

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:19.330 
this because that way they could get an
idea<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:07.890> what<00:03:08.459> their<00:03:08.760> kids<00:03:09.060> could<00:03:09.480> be<00:03:09.630> doing
