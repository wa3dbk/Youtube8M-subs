what do you do if there's a power
failure<00:01:02.410> well<00:01:03.190> usually<00:01:03.400> you<00:01:03.850> just<00:01:04.000> wait<00:01:04.360> it

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
failure well usually you just wait it

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.510 
failure well usually you just wait it
out<00:01:04.629> but<00:01:05.230> what<00:01:05.440> if<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.680> power<00:01:05.890> is<00:01:06.070> gone<00:01:06.220> for

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
out but what if the power is gone for

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.760 
out but what if the power is gone for
days<00:01:06.640> or<00:01:06.970> even<00:01:07.000> weeks<00:01:07.230> because<00:01:08.230> of<00:01:08.260> forces

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
can see it's got an outer shell it's got

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.539 
can see it's got an outer shell it's got
an<00:02:36.510> inner<00:02:36.630> shell<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.140> it's<00:02:37.290> two<00:02:37.560> enclosures<00:02:38.370> in

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
an inner shell so it's two enclosures in

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.370 
an inner shell so it's two enclosures in
one<00:02:38.760> obviously<00:02:39.690> like<00:02:39.900> we<00:02:39.989> talked<00:02:40.230> about

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
one obviously like we talked about

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.770 
one obviously like we talked about
that's<00:02:40.709> a<00:02:40.920> very<00:02:41.100> important<00:02:41.579> consideration

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
that's a very important consideration

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.610 
that's a very important consideration
being<00:02:42.780> quiet<00:02:43.079> okay

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
being quiet okay

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.440 
being quiet okay
how<00:02:43.950> does<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.340> work<00:02:44.549> basically<00:02:44.910> this

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
how does this work basically this

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.000 
how does this work basically this
particular<00:02:45.900> generator<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.620> powered<00:02:46.980> by

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
particular generator is powered by

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.210 
particular generator is powered by
natural<00:02:47.370> gas<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:48.540> line<00:02:48.810> coming<00:02:49.260> in<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.950> fuel

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
natural gas the line coming in the fuel

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.120 
natural gas the line coming in the fuel
source<00:02:50.549> comes<00:02:50.910> up<00:02:51.090> here<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:52.290> fuel<00:02:52.530> powers<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
source comes up here the fuel powers the

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.870 
source comes up here the fuel powers the
engine<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:54.150> engine<00:02:54.180> kicks<00:02:54.660> over<00:02:54.959> in<00:02:55.290> this

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
engine the engine kicks over in this

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.849 
engine the engine kicks over in this
alternator<00:02:56.880> in<00:02:57.150> what<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.810> alternator<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.620> is

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
alternator in what the alternator is is

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.860 
alternator in what the alternator is is
basically<00:02:59.340> it's<00:02:59.549> a<00:02:59.640> rotor<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.209> stator<00:03:00.540> the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
basically it's a rotor and a stator the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.930 
basically it's a rotor and a stator the
rotor<00:03:01.079> runs<00:03:01.590> around<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:02.010> stator<00:03:02.280> that's<00:03:02.760> what

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
rotor runs around the stator that's what

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.210 
rotor runs around the stator that's what
produces<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.450> power<00:03:03.750> how<00:03:04.320> is<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.590> controlled

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
produces the power how is it controlled

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.610 
produces the power how is it controlled
well<00:03:05.370> here's<00:03:05.670> your<00:03:05.820> controls<00:03:06.269> okay<00:03:06.750> all<00:03:07.260> your

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
well here's your controls okay all your

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.830 
well here's your controls okay all your
sense<00:03:07.859> of<00:03:08.010> electronics<00:03:08.700> are<00:03:08.880> here<00:03:09.209> this<00:03:09.690> is

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
sense of electronics are here this is

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.240 
sense of electronics are here this is
the<00:03:09.959> brains<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.500> operation<00:03:10.530> right<00:03:11.220> here

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
the brains of the operation right here

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.539 
the brains of the operation right here
so<00:03:12.150> how<00:03:12.630> does<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:13.109> engine<00:03:13.260> start<00:03:13.859> we<00:03:14.130> have<00:03:14.400> the

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
so how does the engine start we have the

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.309 
so how does the engine start we have the
fuel<00:03:14.819> source<00:03:15.060> but<00:03:15.359> you<00:03:15.390> also<00:03:15.630> need<00:03:16.019> an<00:03:16.170> energy

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
fuel source but you also need an energy

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.650 
fuel source but you also need an energy
source<00:03:16.799> that<00:03:17.010> energy<00:03:17.489> source<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.269> battery

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
source that energy source is the battery

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.259 
source that energy source is the battery
12<00:03:19.019> volts<00:03:19.290> feeding<00:03:19.709> into<00:03:20.069> that<00:03:20.760> gives<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.150> to

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
12 volts feeding into that gives it to

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.390 
12 volts feeding into that gives it to
spark<00:03:21.600> okay<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.230> starts<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.709> engine<00:03:23.069> I<00:03:23.220> know

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
spark okay that starts the engine I know

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.759 
spark okay that starts the engine I know
where<00:03:23.639> you<00:03:23.760> go<00:03:24.049> there<00:03:25.049> are<00:03:25.200> many<00:03:25.380> different

is<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.800> unit<00:03:56.100> and<00:03:56.250> then<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.520> major

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
is the unit and then the major

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.360 
is the unit and then the major
consideration<00:03:57.570> how<00:03:58.170> quiet<00:03:58.560> is<00:03:58.800> the<00:03:58.830> generator

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
consideration how quiet is the generator

this is a hands-off automatic system you

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.380 
this is a hands-off automatic system you
do<00:04:04.890> need<00:04:05.100> to<00:04:05.280> maintain<00:04:05.460> the<00:04:05.880> unit<00:04:06.180> their

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
do need to maintain the unit their

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.970 
do need to maintain the unit their
service<00:04:06.900> intervals<00:04:07.320> do<00:04:07.560> need<00:04:07.740> to<00:04:07.860> be
