00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.800 
I believe that with those stink bugs I
did<00:04:08.959> see<00:04:09.519> if<00:04:10.519> I<00:04:10.700> just<00:04:10.849> prayed<00:04:11.030> it<00:04:11.150> all<00:04:11.299> an

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
additional time or two would have known

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.539 
additional time or two would have known
as<00:04:14.390> that<00:04:14.540> pressure<00:04:14.780> might<00:04:15.739> not<00:04:15.980> and<00:04:16.220> I<00:04:16.370> can

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549
