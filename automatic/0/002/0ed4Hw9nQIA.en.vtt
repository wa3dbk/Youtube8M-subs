 She is a Sunni of the Rock King 

00:00:40.158 --> 00:00:43.787
 The first year, last year I participated and was crowned king. 

00:00:43.787 --> 00:00:48.340
 And the year saw the defending of the title, as soon as Alcatraz, 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.401
 Spirit on Samasana Halsna and like Lebanon. 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.427
 You will have a defect of 5 on 5 and a 1 "on 1". 

00:00:54.427 --> 00:00:57.352
 I want to be (physically and physically strong) 

00:00:57.352 --> 00:00:59.041
 This is a game for people of great size. 

00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:01.753
 Paul is the Queen of the Rock, 

00:01:01.753 --> 00:01:04.059
 For the first time, there were girls in which they shared 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.801
 And it is a lot more complicated because I am the last female element 

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.221
 And let us see talent. 

00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:44.347
 What I've never been successful in, I mean, in stores the ball flew away from me 

00:01:44.347 --> 00:01:46.275
 What you can do, 

00:01:46.275 --> 00:01:48.245
 He played (in English) defensive defense, 

00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:50.119
 Succeed with a throw, 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.852
 Anyway, this basket, if you do not lose it will not win again. 

00:01:54.852 --> 00:01:56.500
 (English) It was a strong defense, 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.966
 I tried to access the loop several times 

00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:01.379
 It was pushed hard, but this is a physical game, 

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:03.646
 And I did my best and thank God I won. 

00:02:03.646 --> 00:02:06.170
 (English) Half-finals are a lot harder, 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.407
 So, as far as I'm concerned, the degree of agility 

00:02:08.407 --> 00:02:10.440
 I think this year to me. 

00:02:46.957 --> 00:02:49.201
 It was so sweet - a lot of sweet experience, 

00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:50.978
 InshaAllah, I have worked more than my current, 

00:02:50.978 --> 00:02:52.865
 And appreciate between land. 

00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:55.187
 Play a lot of tips, Besthall wins. 

00:02:55.187 --> 00:02:57.866
 In the last two years, we can do what we can 

00:02:57.866 --> 00:02:59.307
 Lebanon is followed by Bedouins, 

00:02:59.307 --> 00:03:01.394
 InshaAllah, Halshna appreciate we move to the rank of Aktar, 

00:03:01.394 --> 00:03:03.192
 We represent our country in the best way possible.
