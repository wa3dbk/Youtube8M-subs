00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
advocate you could choose any name

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.640 
advocate you could choose any name
really<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.940> wouldn't<00:02:12.480> actually

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
really and it wouldn't actually

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.720 
really and it wouldn't actually
and<00:02:15.739> okay<00:02:16.739> maybe<00:02:17.010> if<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.310> pick<00:02:17.519> something

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
and okay maybe if you pick something

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.250 
and okay maybe if you pick something
really<00:02:17.849> really<00:02:18.450> offensive<00:02:18.689> it<00:02:18.959> would<00:02:19.110> matter

really really offensive it would matter

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.229 
really really offensive it would matter
but<00:02:19.590> for<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:20.189> most<00:02:20.340> part<00:02:20.489> it<00:02:20.790> doesn't<00:02:20.970> matter

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
but for the most part it doesn't matter

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.990 
but for the most part it doesn't matter
because<00:02:21.750> Shakespeare<00:02:22.439> proves<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.579> when<00:02:23.819> he

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000
