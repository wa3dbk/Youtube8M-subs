get<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.380> little<00:02:28.410> bit<00:02:28.740> better<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:29.190> can

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
get a little bit better and you can

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.580 
get a little bit better and you can
because<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:30.480> peace<00:02:30.780> doesn't<00:02:31.110> bother<00:02:31.230> me<00:02:31.350> much

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
because in peace doesn't bother me much

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.530 
because in peace doesn't bother me much
contrary<00:02:32.160> B's<00:02:32.400> doesn't<00:02:32.820> bother<00:02:32.910> me<00:02:33.030> much<00:02:33.239> so<00:02:33.510> I

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
contrary B's doesn't bother me much so I

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.990 
contrary B's doesn't bother me much so I
can<00:02:33.810> some<00:02:33.989> people<00:02:34.320> don't<00:02:35.250> have<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.580> for<00:02:35.910> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
can some people don't have this for the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.670 
can some people don't have this for the
screen<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:39.209> this<00:02:39.989> is<00:02:40.140> pretty<00:02:40.320> good<00:02:40.440> man

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
screen and and this is pretty good man

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.670 
screen and and this is pretty good man
but<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.670> one<00:02:41.850> reason<00:02:42.239> I<00:02:42.390> hit<00:02:42.630> in<00:02:42.870> peace<00:02:43.140> when<00:02:43.650> I

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
episodes but when I impede the glyphs

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.560 
episodes but when I impede the glyphs
makes<00:02:58.260> no<00:02:58.470> sense<00:02:58.770> so<00:02:58.950> there's<00:02:59.610> no<00:02:59.790> feet<00:03:00.120> in<00:03:00.330> the

on the screen and this is pretty

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.170 
on the screen and this is pretty
disappointing<00:03:03.299> I<00:03:04.170> mean<00:03:04.739> is<00:03:05.010> this<00:03:05.340> no<00:03:05.790> reason

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
disappointing I mean is this no reason

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.750 
disappointing I mean is this no reason
to<00:03:06.390> put<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.440> away<00:03:07.560> when<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.519> eat<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:10.549> what<00:03:11.549> else

look at this debt hi is this again like
skyscrapers<00:05:37.720> I<00:05:38.290> think<00:05:38.500> they<00:05:38.710> won't<00:05:39.310> do<00:05:39.550> that

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
skyscrapers I think they won't do that

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.330 
skyscrapers I think they won't do that
again<00:05:39.790> I<00:05:40.390> mean<00:05:41.020> like<00:05:41.290> they<00:05:41.590> should<00:05:41.979> come<00:05:42.160> with

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
again I mean like they should come with

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.750 
again I mean like they should come with
something<00:05:42.669> new<00:05:43.050> and<00:05:44.050> like<00:05:44.530> the<00:05:44.800> arm

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
something new and like the arm

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.120 
something new and like the arm
look<00:05:45.880> like<00:05:46.060> the<00:05:46.570> arm<00:05:46.990> from<00:05:47.230> the<00:05:47.260> left<00:05:47.560> yet<00:05:47.830> so

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
look like the arm from the left yet so

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.200 
look like the arm from the left yet so
you<00:05:48.790> don't<00:05:49.000> have<00:05:49.150> to<00:05:50.280> it's<00:05:51.280> probably<00:05:51.610> fake<00:05:51.940> but

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
you don't have to it's probably fake but

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.190 
you don't have to it's probably fake but
who<00:05:52.360> knows<00:05:52.800> and<00:05:53.800> if<00:05:54.460> it<00:05:54.640> is<00:05:54.910> this<00:05:55.870> gun

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
who knows and if it is this gun

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.680 
who knows and if it is this gun
telescope<00:05:56.800> so<00:05:57.070> it's<00:05:57.370> probably<00:05:57.520> a<00:05:57.910> sniper

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
telescope so it's probably a sniper

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.330 
telescope so it's probably a sniper
rifle<00:05:59.130> but<00:06:00.130> I<00:06:00.970> should<00:06:01.570> as<00:06:01.780> a<00:06:02.080> sniper<00:06:02.380> I<00:06:02.800> used<00:06:03.220> to

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
rifle but I should as a sniper I used to

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.240 
rifle but I should as a sniper I used to
snipe<00:06:03.760> at<00:06:03.940> the<00:06:04.120> black<00:06:04.510> ops<00:06:04.690> so<00:06:04.930> as<00:06:05.530> a<00:06:05.590> sniper<00:06:05.890> I

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
snipe at the black ops so as a sniper I
