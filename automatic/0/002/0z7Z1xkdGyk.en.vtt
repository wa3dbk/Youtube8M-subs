00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.029
 hello I am yes from the near forest 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.100
 as his coach at microstrategy 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.900
 show today how to switch a loop 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.279
 is a loser 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.779
 that's what you're up here behind me 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.820
 the dome see that decides no yes 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.939
 the beginning has an end but once again 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.650
 content is how it works exactly 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.069
 I'll show you with technology too 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.599
 course in this course I have two 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:34.940
 local time models prepared the one 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.970
 would just be an expansion times and indeed 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.550
 once inside and outside the same 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.500
 material and the same color and one 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.780
 second praise the once with two 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.280
 different materials works that 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.110
 means you have a thinner one 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.300
 plain and you have one 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.010
 thicker jersey fabric jersey I say 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.440
 That's why the fabric is elastic and 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.660
 the tree of course not yes 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.810
 the special features of it as the whole 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.730
 looks once the final here 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.829
 model our tree 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.009
 which is when I pull up the song 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.610
 relatively narrow is a bit for that 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.290
 higher 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.940
 that is if i just follow him 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.620
 fold down depending on what you choose 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.390
 material used reminds you 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.210
 Tighter together or it 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.030
 voluminous the whole with our other 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.450
 Model says I have a second one 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.280
 The whole thing looks like it is prepared 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.060
 is now simply a total already 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.940
 a little bit bigger 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.200
 I can double them 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:35.390
 maybe once I'm the gray one 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.450
 side up casual and andrÃ© me that 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.440
 All around once and grab the bright 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.659
 side up 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.310
 So you look like the whole thing 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.080
 here around the neck and depending on whether 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.000
 you a bit the one side or the one 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.520
 The other side can bring this forward 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.950
 whole just look and feel individual 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.530
 a bit with an outfit 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.420
 So complete what you need for it completely 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.400
 of course, the sewing machine completely 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.420
 important to the right needle times us 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.880
 have different ones now 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.350
 materials so once universal needles 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.200
 for the building materials and once for the 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.460
 jersey we need a jersey needle 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.420
 then important for our cut 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.330
 Naturally 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.950
 patchwork ruler and a matte thing with 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.750
 the ball can work better if 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.880
 you can not have that, of course you can 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.190
 even with you with the scissors quite simply 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.330
 to cut out a fabric 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.040
 Of course, it is still important that we have one 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.910
 have tape measure because we have to, of course 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.200
 measure our head circumference and the 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.420
 Of course, fabrics also have to measure so 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.580
 accordingly tape measure or not 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.450
 chalk also so that you can do it beautiful 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.940
 record needle not to forget what 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.620
 Of course, the fabric is also made of 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.750
 you can visit our material market 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.319
 get if you exactly these variants 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.430
 I would like to say otherwise 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.019
 I 'm looking forward to seeing you if you have this 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.489
 super fast beautiful spring 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.489
