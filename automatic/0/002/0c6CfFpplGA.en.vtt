00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
what is going on is a crazy 1870 looking

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.360 
what is going on is a crazy 1870 looking
at<00:00:03.030> that<00:00:03.179> work<00:00:03.389> mate<00:00:03.629> utility<00:00:04.410> case<00:00:04.589> by<00:00:04.830> Sigma

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
at that work mate utility case by Sigma

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.270 
at that work mate utility case by Sigma
now<00:00:05.520> this<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:05.910> two-piece<00:00:06.359> case<00:00:06.600> design

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:07.280 
now this is a two-piece case design

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.129 
now this is a two-piece case design
featuring<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.460> soft<00:00:08.820> TPU<00:00:09.360> material<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:10.050> a

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
featuring a soft TPU material and a

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.560 
featuring a soft TPU material and a
tough<00:00:10.410> shell<00:00:10.800> for<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:11.790> extra<00:00:12.150> shock

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
tough shell for that extra shock

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.900 
tough shell for that extra shock
protection<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.860> install<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.250> case<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.849> a

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
protection so the install the case is a

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.490 
protection so the install the case is a
little<00:00:15.389> different<00:00:15.750> compared<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.379> regular

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
little different compared to a regular

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.380 
little different compared to a regular
case<00:00:17.100> now<00:00:17.369> first<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:17.699> install<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.180> phone

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
case now first you install the phone

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.109 
case now first you install the phone
into<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.900> inner<00:00:19.140> peace<00:00:19.490> then<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.670> align<00:00:20.970> the

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
into the inner peace then you align the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.450 
into the inner peace then you align the
top<00:00:21.359> built-in<00:00:21.930> screen<00:00:22.170> protector<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.220> you're

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
top built-in screen protector and you're

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.460 
top built-in screen protector and you're
pretty<00:00:23.580> much<00:00:23.699> aligned<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.390> place<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.350> be

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
pretty much aligned in place and to be

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.589 
pretty much aligned in place and to be
quite<00:00:25.619> honest<00:00:25.980> it's<00:00:26.400> gonna<00:00:26.730> require<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.180> little

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
quite honest it's gonna require a little

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.140 
quite honest it's gonna require a little
bit<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.930> work<00:00:28.170> because<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.369> have<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.609> snap<00:00:29.910> in

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
bit of work because you have to snap in

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.269 
bit of work because you have to snap in
these<00:00:30.359> little<00:00:30.539> grooves<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.109> go<00:00:31.380> into<00:00:31.679> all

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
these little grooves that go into all

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.639 
these little grooves that go into all
the<00:00:32.340> corners<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.480> case<00:00:33.690> which<00:00:34.140> provide

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
the corners of the case which provide

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.010 
the corners of the case which provide
that<00:00:34.890> solid<00:00:35.460> seal<00:00:35.790> alright<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.719> once<00:00:36.899> you're

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
that solid seal alright so once you're

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.540 
that solid seal alright so once you're
done<00:00:37.110> with<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.290> piece<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.950> should<00:00:38.250> look

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
done with that piece it should look

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.580 
done with that piece it should look
something<00:00:38.610> like<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.300> all<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.840> grooves<00:00:40.200> are

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
something like this all the grooves are

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.040 
something like this all the grooves are
supposed<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.070> be<00:00:41.219> locked<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.670> place<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.870> now

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
supposed to be locked in place so now

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.080 
supposed to be locked in place so now
you<00:00:43.110> simply<00:00:43.469> align<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.430> outer<00:00:44.610> shell

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
you simply align it to the outer shell

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.840 
you simply align it to the outer shell
and<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:46.170> snap<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.739> place<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.610> if<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:47.820> look

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
and you snap in place so if we look

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.430 
and you snap in place so if we look
towards<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.239> bottom<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.750> case<00:00:48.930> there's<00:00:49.320> a

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
towards the bottom of the case there's a

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.350 
towards the bottom of the case there's a
built-in<00:00:49.649> plug<00:00:50.100> for<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.489> headphone<00:00:50.879> jack<00:00:51.180> and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
built-in plug for the headphone jack and

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.819 
built-in plug for the headphone jack and
lightning<00:00:51.930> connector<00:00:52.320> now<00:00:52.440> those<00:00:52.590> are<00:00:52.620> gonna

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
lightning connector now those are gonna

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.549 
lightning connector now those are gonna
help<00:00:53.100> from<00:00:53.370> any<00:00:53.579> dust<00:00:53.910> or<00:00:54.149> any<00:00:54.300> debris<00:00:54.600> from

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
volume buttons are covered but they're

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.460 
volume buttons are covered but they're
not<00:01:02.969> all<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.300> easy<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.930> press<00:01:04.170> they're<00:01:04.379> gonna

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
not all that easy to press they're gonna

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.530 
not all that easy to press they're gonna
require<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.860> little<00:01:05.040> bit<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.309> pressure<00:01:05.580> but

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
require a little bit of pressure but

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.030 
require a little bit of pressure but
nothing<00:01:06.810> impossible<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.500> cut<00:01:07.740> out<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
nothing impossible to cut out for the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.940 
nothing impossible to cut out for the
silence<00:01:08.430> which<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.000> little<00:01:09.479> small<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.890> you

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
silence which is a little small so you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.310

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
might have to use room now I know I did

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.560 
might have to use room now I know I did
because<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.650> do<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.860> big<00:01:14.369> fingers<00:01:14.670> at<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
because I do have big fingers at the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.570 
because I do have big fingers at the
