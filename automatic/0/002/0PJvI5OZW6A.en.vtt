so far it's really really good first
thing<00:00:18.930> you'll<00:00:19.080> probably<00:00:19.289> notice<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.949> how

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
thing you'll probably notice is how

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.730 
thing you'll probably notice is how
visually<00:00:20.910> good<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.630> game<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.260> mean<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
visually good this game is I mean the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.609 
visually good this game is I mean the
crowd<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:24.180> much<00:00:24.510> more<00:00:24.539> animated<00:00:24.960> than<00:00:25.380> in

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
crowd is so much more animated than in

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.740 
crowd is so much more animated than in
previous<00:00:25.830> games<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.730> not<00:00:27.119> right<00:00:27.330> now<00:00:27.539> I'm

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
previous games and not right now I'm

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.990 
previous games and not right now I'm
playing<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.170> as<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.470> live<00:00:29.160> commentary<00:00:29.820> and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
playing this as a live commentary and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.310 
playing this as a live commentary and
I'm<00:00:30.090> just<00:00:30.330> checking<00:00:30.539> out<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.810> new<00:00:30.960> chain

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
I'm just checking out the new chain

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.530 
I'm just checking out the new chain
grapple<00:00:31.830> system<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.850> little<00:00:33.090> mini<00:00:33.210> game

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
grapple system it's a little mini game

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.209 
grapple system it's a little mini game
of<00:00:33.719> rock-paper-scissors<00:00:33.930> which<00:00:34.739> i<00:00:34.920> think<00:00:34.980> is

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
of rock-paper-scissors which i think is

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.280 
of rock-paper-scissors which i think is
cool<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.850> makes<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.510> chain<00:00:36.719> grappling<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
cool it makes the chain grappling a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.170 
cool it makes the chain grappling a
little<00:00:37.530> bit<00:00:37.649> more<00:00:37.800> interesting<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:39.030> little

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
little bit more interesting and a little

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.869 
little bit more interesting and a little
a<00:00:39.510> bit<00:00:39.719> more<00:00:40.320> fun<00:00:40.829> because<00:00:41.040> basically<00:00:41.430> in

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
a bit more fun because basically in

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.270 
a bit more fun because basically in
previous<00:00:42.329> games<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.840> was<00:00:43.050> way<00:00:43.320> too<00:00:43.350> easy<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:44.160> do

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
previous games it was way too easy to do

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.010 
previous games it was way too easy to do
a<00:00:44.309> chain<00:00:44.579> grapple<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.210> there<00:00:45.629> wasn't<00:00:45.780> really

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
a chain grapple and there wasn't really

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.139 
a chain grapple and there wasn't really
a<00:00:46.140> way<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.379> counter<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:46.980> at<00:00:47.190> all<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.969> gotta

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
a way to counter it at all and it gotta

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.729 
a way to counter it at all and it gotta
be<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.300> repetitive<00:00:48.660> at<00:00:49.020> times<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.469> think<00:00:49.500> this

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
be a repetitive at times I think this

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.560 
be a repetitive at times I think this
adds<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.219> little<00:00:50.370> bit<00:00:50.520> more<00:00:50.730> unpredictability

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
adds a little bit more unpredictability

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.500 
adds a little bit more unpredictability
to<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> chain<00:00:52.829> grappling<00:00:53.280> system<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.420> is

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
to the chain grappling system and it is

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.270 
to the chain grappling system and it is
actually<00:00:54.930> really<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.350> fun<00:00:55.800> I'm<00:00:56.070> just

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
actually really really fun I'm just

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.650 
actually really really fun I'm just
having<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.550> little<00:00:56.610> bit<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.879> fun<00:00:57.120> with<00:00:57.149> Roman

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
having a little bit of fun with Roman

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.029 
having a little bit of fun with Roman
reigns<00:00:57.690> at<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.140> moment<00:00:58.500> playing<00:00:58.710> around<00:00:58.890> with

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
reigns at the moment playing around with

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.220 
reigns at the moment playing around with
this<00:00:59.160> chain<00:00:59.460> grapple<00:00:59.879> system<00:01:00.270> once<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.109> hit

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
this chain grapple system once you hit

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.950 
this chain grapple system once you hit
the<00:01:01.379> sweet<00:01:01.649> spot<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.280> pretty<00:01:02.850> much<00:01:02.940> get<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.840> do

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the sweet spot you pretty much get to do

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.329 
the sweet spot you pretty much get to do
another<00:01:04.170> move<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.680> I'm<00:01:04.769> looking<00:01:04.890> around<00:01:05.100> for

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
another move so I'm looking around for

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.940 
another move so I'm looking around for
that<00:01:05.460> sweet<00:01:05.729> spot<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:06.390> he<00:01:06.570> gets<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.930> first<00:01:07.170> he

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
that sweet spot if he gets it first he

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.289 
that sweet spot if he gets it first he
gets<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.220> do<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> move<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.850> if<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.030> get<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.270> first

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
gets to do a move and if I get it first

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.880 
gets to do a move and if I get it first
I<00:01:09.720> get<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.020> do<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> move<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.560> that's<00:01:10.710> pretty

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
I get to do a move and that's pretty

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.140 
I get to do a move and that's pretty
much<00:01:11.010> how<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.280> works<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.670> think<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:11.939> really

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
much how it works I think it's really

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.789 
much how it works I think it's really
fun<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.570> do<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.409> nice<00:01:13.560> little

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
fun to do that and it's a nice little

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.530 
fun to do that and it's a nice little
new<00:01:14.040> feature<00:01:14.340> now<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:15.030> take<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.420> off<00:01:15.509> if

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
new feature now you can take it off if

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.450 
new feature now you can take it off if
you<00:01:15.750> don't<00:01:15.780> like<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.409> but<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.860> actually<00:01:17.009> really

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
you don't like it but I actually really

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.010 
you don't like it but I actually really
really<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.180> something<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.840> do

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
really like it is something you to do

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.870 
really like it is something you to do
and<00:01:19.470> definitely<00:01:20.250> makes<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.729> lot<00:01:20.820> more

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
and definitely makes it a lot more

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.800 
and definitely makes it a lot more
interesting<00:01:21.390> than<00:01:21.860> just<00:01:22.860> doing<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.159> standard

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
interesting than just doing the standard

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.390 
interesting than just doing the standard
thing<00:01:24.810> way<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.409> really<00:01:25.590> hard<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.920> reverse<00:01:26.070> I

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
thing way it's really hard to reverse I

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.649 
thing way it's really hard to reverse I
think<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.640> adds<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.909> lot<00:01:27.000> more<00:01:27.240> predictability

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
think it adds a lot more predictability

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.710 
think it adds a lot more predictability
to<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> game<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.340> first<00:01:29.610> thing<00:01:29.820> well<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
to the game the first thing well the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.420 
to the game the first thing well the
main<00:01:30.900> thing<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.170> notice<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.530> how<00:01:31.650> graphically

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
main thing you notice is how graphically

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.039 
main thing you notice is how graphically
good<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.970> game<00:01:33.150> looks<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.659> mean<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.900> looks

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
good the game looks I mean it looks

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.499 
good the game looks I mean it looks
absolutely<00:01:34.409> amazing<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.670> genuinely<00:01:36.210> looks

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509

looks<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.450> mean<00:01:45.479> I've<00:01:45.720> got<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.350> last<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.740> us<00:01:46.860> on

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
ps4 I've got call of duty but I think

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.649 
ps4 I've got call of duty but I think
visually<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.700> game<00:01:50.970> that's<00:01:51.180> really

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
visually this is the game that's really

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.270 
visually this is the game that's really
stepped<00:01:51.990> up<00:01:52.229> when<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.799> make<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> transition

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
stepped up when you make the transition

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.630 
stepped up when you make the transition
from<00:01:53.759> xbox<00:01:54.240> 360<00:01:54.930> it's<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.439> PlayStation<00:01:56.340> 4

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
from xbox 360 it's the PlayStation 4

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.850 
from xbox 360 it's the PlayStation 4
well<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.659> main<00:01:57.869> thing<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.170> did<00:01:58.320> really<00:01:58.530> noticed

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
well the main thing I did really noticed

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.410 
well the main thing I did really noticed
when<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:58.979> spin<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.340> game<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.729> it's<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.180> lot

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
when I spin this game is it's a lot

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.840 
when I spin this game is it's a lot
slower<00:02:00.750> when<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.560> play<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.100> then<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> xbox

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
slower when you play it then on the xbox

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.899 
slower when you play it then on the xbox
360<00:02:03.390> version<00:02:03.479> on<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.930> xbox<00:02:04.320> 360<00:02:04.799> version

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
360 version on the xbox 360 version

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.190 
360 version on the xbox 360 version
everything<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> little<00:02:06.270> bit<00:02:06.540> faster<00:02:06.869> you

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
everything is a little bit faster you

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.990 
everything is a little bit faster you
can<00:02:07.259> do<00:02:07.469> things<00:02:07.680> really<00:02:08.069> really<00:02:08.429> easily<00:02:08.640> in

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
can do things really really easily in

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.570 
can do things really really easily in
this<00:02:09.289> it's<00:02:10.289> just<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.679> lot<00:02:10.920> more<00:02:10.950> quick<00:02:11.340> pace

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
this it's just a lot more quick pace

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.550 
this it's just a lot more quick pace
this<00:02:11.819> is<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:11.970> lot<00:02:12.090> more<00:02:12.270> slower<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.930> methodical

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
this is a lot more slower and methodical

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.350 
this is a lot more slower and methodical
all<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.370> might<00:02:14.520> say<00:02:14.550> that's<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:14.970> bad<00:02:15.150> thing

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
all and you might say that's a bad thing

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.970 
all and you might say that's a bad thing
but<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.599> definitely<00:02:15.870> feel<00:02:16.170> like<00:02:16.349> it<00:02:16.500> feels<00:02:16.770> like

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
but I definitely feel like it feels like

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.559 
but I definitely feel like it feels like
a<00:02:17.040> real<00:02:17.340> match<00:02:17.610> rather<00:02:17.970> than<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.209> video<00:02:18.510> game

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
a real match rather than a video game

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.199 
a real match rather than a video game
and<00:02:19.230> obviously<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:20.069> can<00:02:20.280> tell<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.760> physics

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
and obviously you can tell the physics

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.839 
and obviously you can tell the physics
in<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.480> game<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.870> lot<00:02:22.349> better<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.890> moves<00:02:23.190> look

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
in this game a lot better the moves look

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.820 
in this game a lot better the moves look

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
away lot smoother and hell of a lot more

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.010

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
obviously I've just hit my signature so

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.319 
obviously I've just hit my signature so
I<00:03:40.109> get<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.319> finisher<00:03:40.739> automatically<00:03:41.519> but

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
I get a finisher automatically but

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.530 
I get a finisher automatically but
basically<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:44.760> have<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:44.940> go<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.239> your

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
basically you have to go to your

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.090 
basically you have to go to your
opponent<00:03:45.690> now<00:03:45.989> you<00:03:46.049> can't<00:03:46.440> do<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.709> wake<00:03:46.889> up

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
opponent now you can't do the wake up

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.440 
opponent now you can't do the wake up
time<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.489> do<00:03:47.579> your<00:03:47.700> finisher<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.239> actually

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
time to do your finisher you actually

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.509 
time to do your finisher you actually
have<00:03:48.569> to<00:03:48.660> press<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.410> triangle<00:03:49.950> when<00:03:50.190> you're

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
have to press the triangle when you're

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.420 
have to press the triangle when you're
next<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.940> them<00:03:51.560> but<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:52.590> think<00:03:53.010> range<00:03:53.250> is

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
next to them but I think range is

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.740 
next to them but I think range is
getting<00:03:53.639> up<00:03:53.730> now<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:53.880> don't<00:03:54.000> know<00:03:54.209> why<00:03:54.329> is<00:03:54.389> over

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
getting up now I don't know why is over

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.140 
getting up now I don't know why is over

glitched there but I'm gonna go for the
power<00:04:02.220> pin<00:04:02.549> which<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:02.880> can<00:04:03.030> do<00:04:03.120> straight

power pin which you can do straight

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.840 
power pin which you can do straight
after<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.840> AAA<00:04:04.019> on<00:04:04.350> this<00:04:04.530> game<00:04:04.739> so<00:04:05.370> once<00:04:05.609> hit

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
after the AAA on this game so once hit

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.090 
after the AAA on this game so once hit
