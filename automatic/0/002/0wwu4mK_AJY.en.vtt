definitely happening but it is actually

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.070 
definitely happening but it is actually
a<00:01:12.750> possibility<00:01:13.500> Lego<00:01:14.460> could<00:01:14.850> do<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.360> some

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
a possibility Lego could do this some

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.520 
a possibility Lego could do this some
people<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.619> also<00:01:16.979> said<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:18.530> they're

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
people have also said that they're

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.440

original<00:01:21.990> minecraft<00:01:22.650> set<00:01:22.890> from<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:23.880> micro

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
original minecraft set from just micro

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.560 
original minecraft set from just micro
world<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:25.409> my<00:01:25.590> frog<00:01:25.860> world<00:01:26.130> dash<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:27.119> forest

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
so why would let go do that if they

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.679 
so why would let go do that if they
weren't<00:01:31.409> gonna<00:01:31.680> make<00:01:32.280> some<00:01:32.549> more<00:01:32.700> sets<00:01:33.000> you

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
I'm pretty excited because i thought the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.749 
I'm pretty excited because i thought the
minecraft<00:01:40.079> set<00:01:40.290> was<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> great<00:01:40.740> little<00:01:40.920> set<00:01:41.220> was

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
minecraft set was a great little set was

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.469 
minecraft set was a great little set was
a<00:01:41.790> little<00:01:42.560> expensive<00:01:43.880> maybe<00:01:44.880> they<00:01:45.119> won't<00:01:45.270> make

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
a little expensive maybe they won't make

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.690 
a little expensive maybe they won't make
it<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.689> expensive<00:01:46.049> next<00:01:46.439> time<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:46.860> somehow<00:01:47.189> i

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
it so expensive next time but somehow i

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.980 
it so expensive next time but somehow i
doubt<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.439> but<00:01:49.439> anyway<00:01:49.979> i<00:01:50.820> thought<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.600> was<00:01:51.720> a

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
doubt it but anyway i thought it was a

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.280 
doubt it but anyway i thought it was a
great<00:01:52.799> thing<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.490> because<00:01:54.240> even<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.020> cuusoo

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
great thing and because even on cuusoo
