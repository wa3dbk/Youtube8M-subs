00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello everyone let's explain a little 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:09.030
 driving position of a motorcycle 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.429
 enduro the subject curves a little bit 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.230
 trialeras climbs lowered as we have 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.670
 to go with the body with the body 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.860
 placed 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.720
 we will start then when for example 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.350
 we make curves that are closed curves 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.150
 of a tone the position where we 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.310
 we have to sit down we see that the bike is 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.770
 long not so to turn better we 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.480
 we have to place it in front 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.580
 this would be a position with the leg 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.460
 taken to make a pretty curve 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.520
 closed because the bike turns a lot 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.040
 better when they are faster curves 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.590
 we are placing a little more back 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.120
 and another more open more back always 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.820
 so you have the back wheel 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.130
 traction when they are slow forward 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.650
 an important thing also when they are 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.440
 straight up climbs down we have to 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.090
 place the weight back 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.400
 when they are straight so they can pull 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.559
 is on the front wheel so that it does not 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.019
 It is never and back that the motorcycle is not 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.800
 skates and pulls your feet very well 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.690
 well placed on the footrests 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.310
 Never take them open because it's very 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.520
 dangerous can throw us in any 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.490
 stone in any root is worth it because 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.510
 feet the tips placed inside 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.480
 placed up to the arms we have 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.780
 fused the legs and ridding the weight 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.630
 forward that would be then to go a 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.290
 straight with potholes a climb a drop 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.660
 in the downstairs so that what 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:37.350
 lift from behind is a way to climb 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.670
 the steps, then we go to 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.160
 attack we are going to do a little 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.990
 right that would be with the wheel forward 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.880
 give a gas tap to give in the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.070
 corner of the top of the step and thus the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.500
 motorcycle and it goes up very easy what we can not 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.030
 do is get there fast and give it down in 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.010
 the step because we will not do anything much 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.290
 It will stay down and not jump the body 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.600
 we do not want to do like a little horse 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.030
 because we will do with the chassis and neither 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.770
 we will go up it is already a bit of touch 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.350
 with the clutch with the gas a tap 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.140
 up on the step and the bike and 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.730
 it goes up very easily 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.560
 Well, it is also very important 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.170
 gas touch 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.510
 we have the attraction in our hands and what 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.870
 that we can not go with male gears 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.880
 very short always in enduro then there 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.709
 there is water or even if it is dry there may be 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.989
 cronos of grass and then the march the 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.690
 very important change I have to with a 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.459
 Optimal gear of the motorcycle as we do not have 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.440
 that has strength but you go attraction 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.510
 I walk with a short gear in second and 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.400
 that because it can react to a lot and 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.739
 we will stay in any trial was the 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.300
 wheel after skating there will take us dice 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.310
 more or less in the middle that we do not have to 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.370
 back traction sometimes we sit very 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.190
 forward it will be fine so that it does not rise 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.989
 from ahead we turn around but 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.420
 we will also lose all the traction in 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.819
 the rear wheel then well a little 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.370
 there in the middle playing with the das with a 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.569
 clutch with the weight with the weight of the 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.120
 motorcycle 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:04.230
 then the ways to take the suitcases 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.060
 brake with one finger or two not 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.829
 we can do is do it with all the 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.829
 hand with the four of then we 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:14.819
 we are not taking well the 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:17.659
 handlebar we only take with one finger 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.659
 we go
