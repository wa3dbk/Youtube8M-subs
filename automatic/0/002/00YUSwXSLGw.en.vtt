00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.370
 O 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.139
 Hello everyone, we received a question for 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.200
 health questioning whether the best 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.330
 activity would be running or swimming our 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.650
 viewer asked this question in the 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.360
 air and we are here today to 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.430
 answer just to answer this 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.070
 question we have a question on top of 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.439
 own question if swimming occurs 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.020
 better what was not clear to us 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.660
 this improvement if we analyze the 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.640
 activity of running and continuous swimming 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.899
 it has two basic objectives and 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.300
 important from the point of view 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.900
 physiological one is the improvement of the 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.690
 cardiovascular aerobic condition Ne 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.760
 oxygenation of human body tissue to 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.490
 improves op that is the goal of improvement 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.980
 but also this same activity of swimming 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.110
 can become a good activity. 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.130
 productive in the direction of weight loss 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.900
 so if they do not improve they improve the 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.060
 weight loss or conditioning 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.370
 aerobic exercise can actually improve 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.930
 two since correctly executed and the 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.909
 People are going to see who the person is. 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.159
 asked not to be this other question 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.929
 side if for example people go 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.939
 talk about swimming science in one 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:13.899
 about the date so choose people 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.270
 obese 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.310
 Of course I'm overweight and 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.109
 depth of water by the pressure 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.060
 Just there, we'll have one. 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:24.159
 weight, our body will have a 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.109
 this influences greatly facilitates 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.509
 impact on joints decreases 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:31.179
 favor that person to achieve 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.399
 do the exercises suffering less action 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.590
 This fact also has a 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.350
 the art problem there and also by the 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.359
 hydrostatic pressure favors this 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.810
 it is very much the greatest benefit 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:45.219
 pregnant women who can and do 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.859
 be directed by the doctor to do 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:50.229
 water activities is also important 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:52.450
 and can make adaptation is already 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.690
 performing adaptation of a book to 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.880
 intensity also favors 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.320
 the moment of the amniotic fluid 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.600
 it means or nothing ' 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.250
 He is cool and very important. 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.140
 see what people think indicated 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.540
 for this population that you have just 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.180
 talk like swimming can be more 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.820
 productive and better than running 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.490
 although the two swimming and running not 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.530
 swimming and running better condition love it and 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.940
 better it has the benefit of 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.580
 only in this population 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.740
 can be particularly productive 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.840
 if we think of our viewer 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.580
 if he is a goalkeeper for the weekend 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.700
 of soccer games on Saturday on Sunday 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.470
 the race might be better because 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.630
 it improves aerobic capacity to 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.940
 play football on Sunday both in dance 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.110
 how much running is more 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.160
 specific soccer game works 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.150
 strengthening the structure of the appliance 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.680
 locomotor 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.750
 and this is important for playing football 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.820
 The weekend exactly runs the 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.790
 People do race race practice 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.370
 the race becomes the best in the 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.350
 that swimming has no sense of improvement 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.660
 cardiovascular system that the appliance 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.209
 more specific locomotive then the 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.950
 you'll always get both 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.930
 Dance as though running 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.120
 depending on their peculiarities of the 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.160
 weekend activity or your 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.170
 body structure the swimming can be 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.030
 more productive, or the 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.420
 because if you join the 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.700
 two go on the walk on which the 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.800
 running on water is a legal activity 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.690
 that you can provide both 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.970
 at the same time knowing also 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.770
 conditions shit budget europe 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.870
 cement and of course depends on the 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.360
 water depth is very common here 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.370
 in our region only exist in cities 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.140
 who work hard to walk on the water and 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.390
 facilitates the motor gesture that I am 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.070
 accustomed to running an antÃ´nio santo day 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.080
 It's the same as I have time to 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.970
 water resistance then we 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.130
 changing the depth of vineyard 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.840
 depth enhances the 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.880
 Movement resistance increases expenditure 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.530
 cally discusses the potentiality 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.020
 weight loss is an activity 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.850
 not very common in the 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.400
 our region but we would only like to 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.680
 tell our viewer that we 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.650
 now we change from blog to sites are 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.650
 Hyacinth is beautiful and inside the training site 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.730
 in focus then www workout in focus point 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.170
 com 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.180
 you will find a health model in 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.550
 action and various other information 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.590
 relevant to your health
