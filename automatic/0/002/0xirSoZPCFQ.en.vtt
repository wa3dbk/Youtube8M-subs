00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:13.879
 the dawn in the forest awakens the most diverse forms of video 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.949
 the green of the forest revealed days later and many 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.890
 the works became stage of where during the spring 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.540
 but the details of the psdc presented in rituals of reproduction 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.270
 of the Atlantic Forest to debut in the river bowl on penalties in a group in the 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.270
 attempt to decide 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.270
 - colorful than the bass 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.270
 in relation to prices 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.430
 in its history 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.000
 more than a thousand miles away in the Amazon rainforest 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 due to the accident with another ten months 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.060
 I left running 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.840
 was also willing to help us bring 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.909
 meanwhile, unemployment imagines 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.780
 Lula received ten years 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.610
 the Indian red head with only seven centimeters does not measure efforts 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.610
 to reach an agreement 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.979
 the pms over 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.979
 state submission 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.200
 ends in a forum for peace 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.380
 Already Japan 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.420
 today is one of the most visibility cities for the event 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.689
 considers that the objective of demarcating the territory 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:12.689
 taxpayer who chooses to build 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.829
 trees mean everything to the arts 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:27.309
 the perfect backdrop for reproduction 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.259
 shelter for nests 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:34.479
 effective food source 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:36.909
 it is not difficult to verify errors 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.510
 to perceive the behavior of cities 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.639
 just take time to intervene 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.979
 but behind what appears to be just a relationship of dependence 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:49.039
 much more than that 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.099
 when you contemplate a closed forest 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.939
 it's hard to see 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:55.979
 a lady 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:57.879
 hid the parts 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.069
 after a complete mission 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.069
 The moment we look at something that stands out the most 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:06.019
 a large telephone 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.179
 already in the price vision 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:09.989
 the one that catches the most attention 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.719
 it's just this other 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.109
 the uprising 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.259
 for us a plant with little importance 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:18.499
 for the bugs 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:20.259
 a coral bar restaurant 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:21.509
 and to the woods 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:24.509
 showing that red 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:31.389
 you must be wondering how sarney got in the middle of the river 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:34.119
 but still far from the recent 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:37.119
 take off as far as you do not bury me 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:41.109
 do this because it's the same for everyone a lot 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.679
 fruits these fruits 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:47.359
 has a large amount of seeds are these elongated fruits but in a 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.969
 kilo of grains we counted a million seeds approximately 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:56.769
 on the other hand the dispersion of it is made because it does not deserve psp has works 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.659
 is practically Arabic that has the largest number of animals in the 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:01.659
 forest 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:07.760
 and we spent 10% of the monkeys at the end a multitude of animals feed on 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.869
 side and let's go 

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:13.469
 space along the forest where she will fulfill the paper when necessary 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.549
 in brazil there are about 40 species of then 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.560
 are different in size of things format 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.770
 but all have a very good future stayed in 10 days and adopted by the 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.699
 Ceará 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.699
 the yahoo 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:37.339
 a few hours before its release some modifications 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:42.879
 in any case it is impressed with the quantity of species that visit 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:47.689
 the acquisition of natural weapons 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:50.610
 the name of our people added 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.349
 their race 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.849
 I dreamed south of the amazon 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.050
 dream about why 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.969
 already with the subject 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:01.330
 Fernanda is blue 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.759
 the black beak toucan 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.759
 left brown head 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.449
 I leave u 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:13.479
 out of bank 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.479
 and when you think you've seen the sabesp 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.470
 in the forest 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.120
 Cyprian 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.120
 what about the seven worst damages 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:28.520
 everyone loves 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.319
 fruit of the intel 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:33.690
 and each visitor to kill the hunger 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.930
 takes life away from the form of seeds that are scattered 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.759
 it's in the air a question 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.499
 the most abundant seed of the forest and that of itaú 

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:47.630
 because there are 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.689
 are few in the woods 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:53.909
 It may not look like it, but I'm walking. 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:57.029
 on an old runway in the south of Para 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.360
 it was here 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.469
 in 1995 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:05.559
 our team of yours to record an excerpt from a globe reporter on fishing 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:06.409
 sport 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:09.409
 two years later the track was deactivated 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.389
 in an action of man the whole area 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.120
 in just over ten years 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.120
 transformed into a regenerating forest 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.719
 the rival 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:25.869
 is a precise work to germinate this seed without any condition of much 

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:30.459
 light only then in environments that have been opened as is the case of this track 

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:31.289
 landing gear 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:35.879
 that the seed may find a condition of great light to grow and become 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:40.159
 become a borges that formed solely by embaúbas and offer 

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:43.789
 these fruits for a series of animals get more wrong here 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:45.969
 while feeding involved 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:50.129
 they run cogitava where they were seeds of other species that today the 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:51.310
 I already saw that you do not have 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.249
 I have clay 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:54.930
 they die later 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.530
 they end up precisely because of the evolution of regeneration 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:02.599
 the environment that is changing and the growth of other areas 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:07.020
 in this embaúbas race will find a more closed environment of low light and 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.190
 so just a few older individuals first let us ask 

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:13.940
 still reaching there in the canopy high above 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.759
 managing to capture the light the vast majority 

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:19.889
 dying and being replaced by these forest species 

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:26.409
 forest life manifests itself in the days of the facts said 

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:29.299
 but second green cable
