 only on a small section of the rails all 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.820
 truly even speed gains as 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.860
 their big brothers where programs stand 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.590

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.590
 branch build new deal not 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.450
 cheap laughs need sum six 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.459
 zeros but this is if you buy everything in 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.590
 shops in essence can only pay 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.750
 for rails and trains them at the collector and 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.230
