soon<00:02:53.760> as<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:54.970> ran<00:02:55.180> away<00:02:55.330> I<00:02:55.660> realized<00:02:56.200> that<00:02:56.350> I

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
soon as I ran away I realized that I

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.300 
soon as I ran away I realized that I
forgot<00:02:56.739> to<00:02:56.830> talk<00:02:57.040> about<00:02:57.190> sound<00:02:57.550> isolation<00:02:59.310> the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
forgot to talk about sound isolation the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.699 
forgot to talk about sound isolation the
sound<00:03:00.580> isolation<00:03:01.239> on<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.570> Sennheiser<00:03:01.989> PMX

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
sound isolation on the Sennheiser PMX

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.350 
sound isolation on the Sennheiser PMX
ATS<00:03:03.190> is<00:03:03.400> not<00:03:03.640> complete

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
ATS is not complete

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.570 
ATS is not complete
they<00:03:05.170> don't<00:03:05.350> actually<00:03:05.560> fit<00:03:05.890> into<00:03:06.070> your<00:03:06.340> ear

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
they don't actually fit into your ear

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.729 
they don't actually fit into your ear
canals<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.270> it<00:03:07.540> doesn't<00:03:07.840> seal<00:03:08.050> out<00:03:08.260> everything

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
canals so it doesn't seal out everything

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.979 
canals so it doesn't seal out everything
I<00:03:09.239> would<00:03:10.239> rate<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.540> sound<00:03:10.780> isolation<00:03:11.320> as<00:03:11.680> mm

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
I would rate the sound isolation as mm

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.370 
I would rate the sound isolation as mm
maybe<00:03:13.989> half<00:03:14.650> isolated<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.810> more<00:03:17.110> sound

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
maybe half isolated so more sound

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.590 
maybe half isolated so more sound
isolation<00:03:18.010> than<00:03:18.160> your<00:03:18.310> standard<00:03:18.519> iPod<00:03:19.269> white

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
isolation than your standard iPod white

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.000 
isolation than your standard iPod white
earphones<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.790> quite<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.850> bit<00:03:22.000> less<00:03:22.180> than<00:03:22.510> the

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
earphones and quite a bit less than the

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.210 
earphones and quite a bit less than the
ones<00:03:24.010> that<00:03:24.190> stick<00:03:24.459> into<00:03:24.640> your<00:03:24.790> ears<00:03:25.800> so<00:03:26.800> for

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
ones that stick into your ears so for

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.650 
ones that stick into your ears so for
people<00:03:27.519> for<00:03:27.940> whom<00:03:28.090> safety<00:03:28.510> is<00:03:28.600> a<00:03:28.630> factor

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
people for whom safety is a factor

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.890 
people for whom safety is a factor
if<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:31.740> need<00:03:31.950> more<00:03:32.460> isolation<00:03:33.180> which<00:03:33.750> is

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
if you need more isolation which is

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.010 
if you need more isolation which is
something<00:03:34.110> other<00:03:34.380> than<00:03:34.530> this<00:03:34.710> but<00:03:35.010> for

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
something other than this but for

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.850 
something other than this but for
average<00:03:37.020> isolation<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:38.340> could<00:03:38.490> pick<00:03:38.670> these
