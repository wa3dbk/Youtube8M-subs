00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello in one of the videos we give you 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.599
 told about the sculpture mage or how else 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.000
 called antip to which it uses in 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.800
 as a stock for vaccination 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.320
 means cherries and sweet cherries and here we are 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.359
 We are near the magician modeling look 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.019
 the flowers have faded 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.470
 and tied on the cherries shield these 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.710
 the cherries are still green but they will 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.610
 carol 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.930
 will be dark blue almost black 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:41.329
 here then it will be possible to tear them 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:46.289
 stratify or sow before winter 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:49.559
 ground but if suddenly 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.559
 there are situations when cherry 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.260
 magnetka may not allow to ascend that 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.640
 need to do here we now look under 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.059
 tree under the tree means these cherries 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.750
 fall off and 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.270
 also germinate and it turns out already ready 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.450
 stock mage sculpting here let's see 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.340
 so look how much sprouted 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:17.490
 pits magician sculpting here are already 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.930
 small process this annual here 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.500
 look they are so gentle grassy 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.170
 right here we can see already 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.130
 lignified it is already possible 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.990
 three year old or two year old 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.930
 if more here under the tree then we 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:41.880
 let's see one more thing but what does it mean 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:45.200
 we need to do this now dig it 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.200
 these shoots 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:02:00.580
 Now look here such otrostochki here 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:13.260
 annual herbaceous right now I will 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:15.730
 choose them so I dug magician modeling 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:21.880
 I will put some water to the roots not 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:24.730
 dried up and I will land to land 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.580
 better when already with 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:33.790
 in the evening here or in cloudy weather 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:36.750
 when the sun burns well it is necessary to water and 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.330
 be sure to bring 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:44.410
 although mage modeling does not like picking but 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:49.420
 if you create conditions that is good 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:52.269
 pour over here and lightly apply 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.829
 agrofibre can pull cane 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:03:01.959
 here to keep the humidity good 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:04.090
 taking root takes root and under the lung 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:08.230
 shading is needed for two weeks 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:12.989
 about until the roots grab here 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.290
 then you need to clean continue to care 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.930
 water 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.100
 before planting these seedlings need 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.560
 will dunk 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:26.109
 de triac blue or other koryugin and 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.600
 This method gives good results. 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:31.410
 we have already checked for more than one year means 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:37.890
 we plant these young 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.890
 seedlings they grow 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.370
 if for some reason after winter 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.049
 Bone did not germinate then here you can 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.989
 use that kind of method to dig up 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.099
 means such young seedlings to plant and 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:56.019
 with good care 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:58.780
 can already be circulating late summer here 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:01.260
 if they do not reach the desired thickness here 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:06.310
 like a pencil let's say then 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:08.189
 peek at them on the next attack and 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.040
 seedlings can be planted 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:16.379
 when there is no foliage or early spring or 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.379
 autumn winter
