00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:10.980
 all good health for two years I 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:15.480
 planted about 15 fruit trees and 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.699
 once i think so 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.660
 special trees for growing 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:25.260
 fruits there are plums and apricots apple 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.539
 mulberry, etc. etc. then for the trees 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.700
 need to care so that they are normal 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.680
 grew and gave good fruit one of 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.500
 tree care 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.640
 this spring pruning pruned trees with 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.870
 with help of such 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.579
 scissors which are called pruner and here 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.500
 such a pruner just the other day 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.449
 has gained 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.350
 now as it is no longer spring or 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.140
 at least 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.590
 spring may month but late trees you already 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.410
 prune though some gardeners like 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.549
 would not mind later under later trimming 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.530
 but nevertheless, I still seem to be busy 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.650
 I just try to speak 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.390
 growing strawberries and there too 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.049
 pruning so as if shears me 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.030
 necessary so i went to the market on 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.380
 the market I like to go because in 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.740
 In principle, the product is the same as 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.630
 the stores mostly and plus you can 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.689
 twist talk talk i mean 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.869
 not like there is more close to buy 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:35.270
 some things some things on the market and 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:38.549
 so pruner special some there 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.710
 I have no requirements for him where I am more 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:46.200
 contact grower beginner so I kind of 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.930
 I decided to start with a simple bought ordinary 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.600
 pruner issue price there limits 10 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.380
 dollars firm 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.930
 I honestly admit that I did not even look 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.200
 On the Internet, what is this company from ? 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.750
 if I'm not mistaken and maybe I'm wrong 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.659
 this is a german company maybe polish 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.460
 Well, it seems to be no matter why I bought 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:15.650
 First I like this pruner 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:19.680
 its ergonomics i.e. pen 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.310
 it seems to be created 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.130
 under my arm there are all sorts 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.970
 bends on the handle and is very comfortable 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:33.660
 pruning arm further principle how would this 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:36.920
 not news and in which all such 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.930
 the function is that there is an opportunity to open 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.580
 that is, do not open and put on 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.240
 blocker pruner lest it 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.670
 opened holding it with one hand here 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.730
 there is such a lever here that is, I have it 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.030
 open and secateurs opened secateurs and 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.450
 In principle, everything is not in principle, but I'm different 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.300
 just did not see all stocked 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.390
 such a special spring so that they themselves 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.910
 I only opened when I cut 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.340
 trees need only do as it were 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.520
 such push all the necessary effort 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.530
 the rest is done by a smaller hand spring 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.020
 gets tired 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.630
 that is, one hand is comfortable here and 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.750
 securely fix and pruner why 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.790
 because here's the blade 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.570
 quite sharply and I still think it 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.030
 a little sharpen so if pruner 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.210
 will open up somewhere in the bag in 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.430
 you can hurt yourself in your pocket 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:40.140
 so it closes 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:42.630
 more ergonomic further comfortable here comfortable 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.240
 the handle is covered by the metal secateur itself 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.550
 the handle is covered somehow 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.980
 synthetic material like 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.760
 stuff on the handle of sports equipment 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.750
 or 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.490
 simulator more precisely or something similar to 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.410
 bike handle I once was 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:03.990
 very similar further this pruner can 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:07.980
 disassemble I do not know you will be seen or 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:10.110
 no, that is, here is such a screw 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.390
 what lock is also fixed 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.570
 that is, you can pull up to let go 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:19.410
 pruner adjusting here thickness care 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:23.490
 between the two between the two 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.380
 halves i mean plus me 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.370
 I liked it almost completely 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.530
 demountable 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.410
 that is, it can be disassembled there 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:35.550
 brush lubricate head back 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:39.750
 collect as if without problems I really like it 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.570
 how would you like and the latter how 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.090
 but not the last selection criterion 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:49.380
 last thing i want to talk about 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:53.040
 this shears and this is very important 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.040
 the moment you come to the store or on 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.400
 market and will choose a secateur 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.860
 be sure to test it for the first time 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.060
 came just looked at that 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.360
 the market is 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.990
 and the second time I got ready I brought with 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.580
 a sprig of apple and a sprig of apricot 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.419
 because some apricot is more 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.940
 tough is a tree and i started cutting 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:21.930
 these pruners and sometime when first 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:24.770
 Once I chose I took such a very similar 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.540
 pruner on the Soviet such completely 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.790
 all-metal what brutal i 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.370
 so cut bad he cuts that even 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:35.880
 pinched myself like that 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.260
 I know how it happened here in 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.610
 pen see they don't fit either 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.009
 something prize 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.280
 thousand have yourself unreal there pen 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:45.810
 it converges as it so I bent disinformation 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.780
 pinched my finger even here 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.270
 I felt like I was on a finger 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.319
 if you can put it that is just 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.240
 not attention mares 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.039
 take a wand or ask 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.009
 seller's wand normal sell a 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:01.439
 the wand is there and I tried to cut it 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:04.379
 pruner and all inexpensive let's say so 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:07.020
 models he mode is very good answer to 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:10.349
 unfortunately does not have enough home 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:13.439
 the thickness of the wand took such that's how it is 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:16.439
 called skewer on which by the way I 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:20.479
 listened to my homemade dried apricots and plan 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:23.750
 do it this year that is he cuts 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:26.039
 Very good 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.590
 I cut already some branches so 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:31.199
 I tried it because I 'm trying to trim 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:35.669
 now is not made and cut off 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:39.240
 the strawberries are already a little very very good 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:44.389
 cuts I really like the fact that when 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:48.270
 one branch is cut a branch of a tree 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:50.550
 I so that you could see that is necessary 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:54.120
 try to branch closer to the base 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:56.639
 blades move and then make an effort 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:00.479
 on as if without ppm get angry and when 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:05.039
 you cut strawberries catch up here 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:07.229
 this place doesn't always work in 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:10.199
 basically this part from 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:13.279
 mid to tip I tested and 

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:16.349
 cuts with the tips of the center but it is like 

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:20.669
 no obstacle to normal pruner 

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:24.900
 but cuts very well so contact called 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:28.039
 cuts name is cut principle how would this 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:32.250
 all I wanted to say about this 

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:36.169
 device this pruner thanks for that 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.169
 watched see you bye
