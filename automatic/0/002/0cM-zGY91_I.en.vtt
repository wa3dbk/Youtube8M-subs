00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
land that was pretty good because it

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.669 
land that was pretty good because it
means<00:00:27.539> i<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:27.869> turn<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.490> night<00:00:30.230> is<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.320> lotus

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
cobra on to which is pretty much the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.369 
cobra on to which is pretty much the

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.530 

can<00:00:40.379> really<00:00:41.370> spike<00:00:41.640> its<00:00:41.820> percentages<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
can really spike its percentages in the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:51.290 
can really spike its percentages in the
matchup<00:00:43.160> by<00:00:44.160> getting<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.879> cobra<00:00:45.270> active<00:00:50.300> so

here<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.660> make<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> pretty<00:00:52.829> big<00:00:53.039> mistake<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.780> play

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
here I make a pretty big mistake I play

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.080 
here I make a pretty big mistake I play
a<00:00:54.809> jace<00:00:55.079> off<00:00:55.730> of<00:00:56.730> night<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.500> I<00:00:58.789> knew<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.820> I

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
a jace off of night and I knew that I

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.200 
a jace off of night and I knew that I
still<00:01:00.359> had<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.780> lamb<00:01:01.050> chop<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.379> make<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.210> for

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
still had a lamb chop to make and for

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.280 
still had a lamb chop to make and for
whatever<00:01:03.690> reason<00:01:03.930> i<00:01:05.600> equated<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> land<00:01:07.020> drop

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
whatever reason i equated the land drop

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.270 
whatever reason i equated the land drop
with<00:01:07.650> night<00:01:07.920> being<00:01:08.159> untapped<00:01:09.619> but<00:01:10.619> i<00:01:10.890> needed

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
with night being untapped but i needed

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.289 
with night being untapped but i needed
to<00:01:11.400> use<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.820> night<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.210> get<00:01:12.299> double<00:01:12.570> blue<00:01:12.750> so

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
to use the night to get double blue so

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:21.310 
to use the night to get double blue so
in<00:01:15.299> my<00:01:15.659> crazy<00:01:15.990> head<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.560> had<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> blocker<00:01:17.280> but<00:01:18.210> I

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.590 

didn't<00:01:22.320> actually<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.729> reality<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:26.600> now

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
didn't actually in in reality and so now

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.050 
didn't actually in in reality and so now
all<00:01:27.630> he<00:01:28.170> needs<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.829> any<00:01:29.189> land<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.939> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
all he needs to have is any land and a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.800 
all he needs to have is any land and a
time<00:01:30.270> warp<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:31.579> Jace<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:32.790> gets<00:01:32.970> eaten<00:01:33.920> and

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
time warp and Jace just gets eaten and

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.569 
time warp and Jace just gets eaten and
that's<00:01:37.460> bad<00:01:38.960> for<00:01:39.960> me<00:01:40.470> what<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.369> should<00:01:41.430> have

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
that's bad for me what I should have

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:49.069 
that's bad for me what I should have
done<00:01:41.840> was<00:01:43.159> bounced<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.250> Cobra<00:01:46.369> because<00:01:48.079> then

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
done was bounced the Cobra because then

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.730 
done was bounced the Cobra because then
it<00:01:49.200> forces<00:01:49.530> him<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.680> have<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:51.229> fetch<00:01:52.229> land<00:01:52.530> and

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
it forces him to have a fetch land and

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.899 
it forces him to have a fetch land and
to<00:01:53.159> time<00:01:53.430> warps<00:01:53.729> or<00:01:55.100> he's<00:01:56.100> forced<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.549> legend

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
to time warps or he's forced to legend

to time warps or he's forced to legend
rule<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.180> Jace<00:01:57.390> which<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.649> time<00:01:58.950> walking

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
rule to Jace which is like time walking

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.590 
rule to Jace which is like time walking
him<00:01:59.340> because<00:01:59.549> he<00:01:59.759> doesn't<00:02:00.030> get<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.270> replay<00:02:00.540> the

Cobra<00:02:00.990> firms<00:02:01.950> are<00:02:02.100> because<00:02:02.250> he<00:02:02.369> doesn't<00:02:02.579> get

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
Cobra firms are because he doesn't get

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.609 
Cobra firms are because he doesn't get
to<00:02:02.850> just<00:02:03.000> attack<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.299> with<00:02:03.450> Cobra<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.200> he<00:02:04.350> held

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
to just attack it with Cobra so he held

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.859

land Jason leben rule it which would be
okay<00:02:12.330> by<00:02:12.510> me

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
okay by me

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:24.199 
okay by me

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
double-time work and it's not really

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.580 
double-time work and it's not really
getting<00:02:40.709> any<00:02:40.890> value<00:02:41.340> out<00:02:41.579> of<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.930> Jace<00:02:43.230> if<00:02:43.470> he

getting any value out of the Jace if he

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:51.410 
getting any value out of the Jace if he
just<00:02:43.769> legend<00:02:44.040> rules<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:50.150> bouncing<00:02:51.150> cobras

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
just legend rules it so bouncing cobras

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.199 
just legend rules it so bouncing cobras
to<00:02:51.540> play<00:02:51.690> there<00:02:51.840> because<00:02:52.140> feeling<00:02:53.180> you're<00:02:54.180> not

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
to play there because feeling you're not

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.300

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
really doing anything but if you bounce

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.289 
really doing anything but if you bounce
Cobra<00:02:56.730> then<00:02:57.950> be<00:02:58.950> forced<00:02:59.220> him<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.400> reinvest

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
Cobra then be forced him to reinvest

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.559 
Cobra then be forced him to reinvest
mana<00:03:00.569> in<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.370> you<00:03:02.370> know<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:03.060> takes<00:03:03.299> a

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
mana in it and you know that takes a

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.059 
mana in it and you know that takes a
pretty<00:03:04.200> big<00:03:04.319> portion<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.769> his<00:03:04.859> turn

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
pretty big portion of his turn

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.970 
pretty big portion of his turn
especially<00:03:06.140> when<00:03:07.140> his<00:03:07.319> next<00:03:07.470> turn<00:03:07.709> he's<00:03:07.859> going

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
especially when his next turn he's going

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.949 
especially when his next turn he's going
to<00:03:08.040> have<00:03:08.190> like<00:03:08.659> you<00:03:09.659> know<00:03:09.720> five<00:03:11.780> it's<00:03:12.780> going<00:03:12.900> to

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
to have like you know five it's going to

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.750 
to have like you know five it's going to
be<00:03:13.049> his<00:03:13.140> fifth<00:03:13.349> land<00:03:13.560> drop<00:03:13.769> so<00:03:13.980> like<00:03:14.159> he<00:03:14.579> could

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
be his fifth land drop so like he could

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.870 
be his fifth land drop so like he could
play<00:03:14.909> you<00:03:15.329> know<00:03:15.450> minus<00:03:15.659> point<00:03:15.840> for<00:03:15.989> four<00:03:16.230> or

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
play you know minus point for four or

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.490 
play you know minus point for four or
time<00:03:17.880> warp<00:03:18.090> off<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.359> top<00:03:18.569> land<00:03:18.780> or<00:03:18.930> what<00:03:19.049> there

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
time warp off the top land or what there

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.900 
time warp off the top land or what there
are<00:03:19.560> so<00:03:19.680> many<00:03:19.739> things<00:03:20.220> that<00:03:20.400> he<00:03:20.549> can<00:03:20.579> do<00:03:20.790> at

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
are so many things that he can do at

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.280 
are so many things that he can do at
this<00:03:21.120> point<00:03:21.440> in<00:03:22.440> his<00:03:22.680> development<00:03:22.950> that

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
this point in his development that

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.920 
this point in his development that
throwing<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.410> wrench<00:03:25.560> into<00:03:25.769> it<00:03:26.040> by<00:03:26.790> setting<00:03:27.750> him

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
throwing a wrench into it by setting him

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.080 
throwing a wrench into it by setting him
back<00:03:28.079> to<00:03:28.200> Cobra<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.739> forcing<00:03:29.519> him<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.730> waste

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
back to Cobra and forcing him to waste

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.349 
back to Cobra and forcing him to waste
this<00:03:30.239> turn<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.810> play<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:30.989> jace<00:03:31.910> would<00:03:32.910> really<00:03:33.239> be

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
this turn to play a jace would really be

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.720 
this turn to play a jace would really be
a<00:03:33.389> nice<00:03:33.629> nice<00:03:34.049> tempo<00:03:34.440> boost<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:35.430> then<00:03:35.579> the

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
a nice nice tempo boost and so then the

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.009 
a nice nice tempo boost and so then the
turn<00:03:35.910> after<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.269> I<00:03:36.299> could<00:03:36.510> play<00:03:36.660> both<00:03:36.810> my

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
turn after that I could play both my

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.809 
turn after that I could play both my
three<00:03:37.200> drops<00:03:37.440> off<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.620> night<00:03:37.859> and<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.400> really

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
three drops off a night and and really

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.400 
three drops off a night and and really
get<00:03:38.940> aggro<00:03:39.299> but<00:03:40.260> instead<00:03:40.739> I<00:03:40.799> brainstorm<00:03:41.370> and

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
get aggro but instead I brainstorm and

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.110 
get aggro but instead I brainstorm and
expose<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.560> time<00:03:43.799> warp<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.280> draw<00:03:44.819> a<00:03:44.849> billion

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
expose it to time warp I draw a billion

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.789 
expose it to time warp I draw a billion
lands<00:03:45.449> I<00:03:45.540> put<00:03:45.750> two<00:03:45.840> lands<00:03:46.019> back<00:03:46.169> actually<00:03:46.530> put

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
lands I put two lands back actually put

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.400 
lands I put two lands back actually put
us<00:03:46.889> a<00:03:46.980> jury<00:03:47.220> step<00:03:47.519> back<00:03:47.760> there<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:49.139> should

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
us a jury step back there and I should

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.140 
us a jury step back there and I should
have<00:03:49.500> just<00:03:49.590> held<00:03:49.829> on<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.160> that<00:03:50.190> let's<00:03:50.699> do<00:03:50.910> step

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
have just held on to that let's do step

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.089 
have just held on to that let's do step
in<00:03:51.299> hand<00:03:51.540> since<00:03:52.109> I<00:03:52.169> have<00:03:52.199> two<00:03:52.440> in<00:03:52.590> my<00:03:52.680> deck<00:03:52.859> I

still have one in my library it's a

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.789 
still have one in my library it's a
fetch<00:03:55.530> up<00:03:55.680> if<00:03:55.799> I<00:03:55.859> need<00:03:56.069> it<00:03:56.220> but<00:03:57.650> having<00:03:58.650> one<00:03:58.769> in

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
fetch up if I need it but having one in

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:05.210 
fetch up if I need it but having one in
hand<00:03:59.269> means<00:04:01.040> that<00:04:02.040> i<00:04:02.400> can<00:04:03.680> like<00:04:04.680> attack<00:04:05.010> with<00:04:05.190> a

my other night and get them both through
you<00:04:13.560> know<00:04:13.680> an<00:04:13.769> Avenger<00:04:14.160> or<00:04:14.250> whatever<00:04:14.489> and<00:04:14.760> so

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
you know an Avenger or whatever and so

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:16.819 
you know an Avenger or whatever and so
having<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:15.840> surgery<00:04:16.019> step<00:04:16.440> in<00:04:16.590> hand

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
having that surgery step in hand

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.379 
having that surgery step in hand
actually<00:04:17.220> was<00:04:17.340> more<00:04:17.519> valuable<00:04:17.669> than<00:04:18.030> one<00:04:18.299> of

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
actually was more valuable than one of

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.569 
actually was more valuable than one of
these<00:04:18.510> multiple<00:04:19.079> basics<00:04:19.470> so<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.250> publisher

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
these multiple basics so the publisher

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.400 
these multiple basics so the publisher
just<00:04:20.760> kept<00:04:20.940> it

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
just kept it

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.250 
just kept it

last card in Hannah's Avenger and he

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.550 
last card in Hannah's Avenger and he
