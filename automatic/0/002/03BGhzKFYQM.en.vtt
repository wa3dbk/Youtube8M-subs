00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 hello everyone i'm me 'chu anidi tilly 2 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.160
 today I will present the first part of the computer course 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.439
 I will present all the topics 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:12.679
 one computer definition 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.389
 two basic programs of a computer 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.640
 three computer boxes 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.339
 4 introduction of computers 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:24.130
 five programs like word and excel and 6 history of computers 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.249
 because we will start with the definition of the computer 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:34.250
 is an electronic machine that receives and processes data to convert them into 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.640
 useful information 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.520
 a computer is a collection of integrated circuits and other components 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.830
 related that can be executed exactly quickly and according to what 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.230
 indicated by a user automatically by another program 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.500
 a variety of sequences or instruction routines that are 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.350
 ordered by hailstorms and systematized according to a wide 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.630
 range of practical applications and precisely determined 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.180
 process which has been called the programming name and to which 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.180
 performs is called a programmer 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.300
 Computer 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.670
 In addition to the routine or computer program you need data 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.450
 specific to these data together is known as input in English or from 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.570
 input that must be supplied 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.570
 and that are required at the time of execution to provide the product 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.560
 end of processing of deals 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.990
 that receives the name of august of exit 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.680
 the information can then be used reinterpreted 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.350
 copied 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.659
 transferred by retransmitted to other people computers or components 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.150
 electronic, locally or remotely using different telecommunication systems 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.870
 can be saved saved or stored in some type of device 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.570
 storage unit 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.130
 to make the definition easier 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.820
 my definition would be 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.460
 a computer is a programmable electronic device that can 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.820
 save recover and process data 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.280
 because we were going to the next topic 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.810
 basic programs of a computer 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.280
 we'll start with the operating system 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.590
 the operating system of a computer can be windows or linux 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.579
 I will use windows xp because it is the one that he used 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.199
 an operating system is software that acts as an interface between 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:16.119
 jabouri devices the programs used by the user to use a 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:17.099
 computer 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.930
 is responsible for managing 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.709
 coordinate the activities will be carried out the exchange of resources and 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.060
 acts as a station for the applications that run on the 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.799
 machine 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.430
 one of the purposes of an operating system like station program 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.340
 principal 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.430
 consists of managing the location and access protection resources 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.140
 of the jaguar fact that relieves application programmers of having 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.079
 to deal with these details 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.430
 are found in most of the electronic devices that they use 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.299
 microprocessors to work 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.349
 mobile phones dvd players 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.129
 computers and radios 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.799
 in my opinion it is a software that controls the computer and helps you with 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.799
 the programs and applications that you install on the computer 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.449
 because we were going to the applications of computers 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.469
 I'll start with Gordy Excel 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:09.219
 microsoft word is a software for word processing 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:12.480
 It was created by the Microsoft company 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.909
 and now it is integrated into the office suite microsoft office 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:19.820
 there's not much to talk about because he does not have much information 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.820
 it's just to make documents for the work offices 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:25.929
 excel is a program similar to gore 

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:30.509
 Microsoft Office Excel better known as Microsoft Excel is an application 

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:32.829
 to handle spreadsheets 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.719
 this program is developed and distributed by maricÃ³n the suns and is 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.719
 normally used in financial and accounting tasks 

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:44.669
 microsoft excel has several open alternatives which are 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.989
 available for multiple operating systems and distributions unlike 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.369
 of excel which only works windows and macintosh systems 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.659
 most before free alternatives have document compatibility 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.529
 native excel 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:03.570
 because we were going to other applications like utilities 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.529
 such as wyngard and fiat 

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:10.409
 has its own compression format the bar that includes full support 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.010
 but it is also compatible with other formats 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.209
 such as appointment 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.200
 seven zeta 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.859
 ac art v 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.969
 bz2 jar iso 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:23.099
 this program also allows you to create compressed or non-autostrated archives iv 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.860
 of secse for which no other decompression software is necessary 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.620
 has a better compression rate than the one provided by cip and also allows 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.949
 generate files in various files and encrypt the contents of files 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.080
 up to 128 from version 3 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.370
 It is very popular especially in the microsoft windows environment 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.159
 let's talk about the cicpc 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.340
 in computing 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.560
 cipo appointment is a storage format without loss very 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.659
 used for data compression as images 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.770
 programs or documents 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.330
 for this type of files the extension is generally used 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.280
 many programs 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.940
 both commercial and free use it and allow its most usual use 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.270
 an example of cypress 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.500
 if you want to download a file of 100 megabytes civil program or compress and 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.240
 the weight drops and you can leave it at 10 megabits without the program losing its 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.189
 utility 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:18.289
 let's go to the next topic 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.129
 what does a computer do 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:23.159
 but let's talk about the basics of a computer 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:24.789
 only in three steps 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:29.050
 1 entry or imputs two processing and 3 exit aut putt 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.520
 in computer input 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.930
 a of the original in English imputed up ut is the collection of interfering sque they use 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.419
 the different functional units subsystems of a system 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.129
 information processing to communicate with each other or the 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:46.129
 information signals sent through those interferences 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:50.770
 the inputs are the signals received by the unit while the outputs 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.139
 are the signals sent by this 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:53.980
 example 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.310
 you write something with the keyboard and enter the computer and the computer executes 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.119
 or process what you wrote and take it out to the monitor 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:04.610
 as the keyboard is input and the output monitors 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.710
 the keyboard enters and the computer processes it and then sends it to the monitor 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:12.639
 these are the input devices 

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:14.660
 me and strict 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.850
 optical pencil 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.460
 microphone 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.139
 barcode scanner and scanner 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:21.619
 the output ones are 

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:22.419
 monitor 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:23.290
 speaker 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:24.290
 headphones 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.180
 printer 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.729
 projector lottery 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:28.499
 let's go to the next topic 

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:29.710
 the ce peru 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.530
 the central processing unit or fp u by the acronym in English the 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.949
 central processing and unique 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:38.580
 or simply the processor or microprocessor is the component of 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.280
 computer and other programmable devices 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.760
 that interprets the instructions contained in the programs and processes 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.729
 the data 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:50.319
 cpv provide the fundamental characteristic of the digital computer the 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:53.939
 skill program and are one of the necessary components found in 

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:58.150
 computers of any time along with primary storage and 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.490
 the input and output devices 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.400
 is known as a microprocessor cp uqe is manufactured with circuits 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.539
 integrated 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:10.219
 the fundamental operation of most cpd uu is to execute a sequence 

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:13.039
 of stored instructions called program 

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:17.069
 the program is represented by a series of numbers that would remain in 

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:19.629
 a certain kind of computer memory 

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:24.219
 there are four steps that almost all human bonne architecture cpv have in their 

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:27.529
 operation fetuses of copper execute iul and the back 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.349
 decode execute and write 

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:35.589
 As you saw in the images the cpv is the central processing unit of 

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:36.770
 Computer 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.439
 let's go to the next 

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:40.469
 the basic components 

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:41.800
 they are the computer 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.520
 the keyboard and the monitor 

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.699
 As you can see, do not mention the mouse because it is not a basic component 

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:49.839
 it's just to improve accessibility 

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:53.009
 those are the three basic components 

00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:56.689
 The first part of our computer course is over 

00:07:56.689 --> 00:07:58.479
 see the next part 

00:07:58.479 --> 00:07:59.699
 greetings and goodbye
