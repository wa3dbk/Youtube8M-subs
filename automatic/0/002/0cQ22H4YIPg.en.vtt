binding<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.890> guess<00:00:50.039> you'd<00:00:50.219> call<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:51.800> right<00:00:52.800> and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
binding I guess you'd call it right and

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.639 
binding I guess you'd call it right and
the<00:00:53.760> binding<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.420> quite<00:00:54.690> large<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.140> made<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.440> two

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
the binding is quite large I made it two

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.959 
the binding is quite large I made it two
and<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.860> half<00:00:55.980> inches<00:00:56.899> see<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.020> right<00:00:58.410> there

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
and a half inches see it right there

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.540 
and a half inches see it right there
they<00:00:59.969> open<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.719> then<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.350> first<00:01:01.620> page<00:01:02.250> I

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
they open it and then the first page I

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.609 
they open it and then the first page I
guess<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.910> could<00:01:03.059> say<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.600> don't<00:01:04.290> really<00:01:04.409> know
