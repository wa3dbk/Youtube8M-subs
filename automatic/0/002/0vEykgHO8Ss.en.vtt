 our background we will pour her plaster for 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.350
 of this we must first cook it 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:23.710
 base and what density should be getz 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.710
 we knead childhood condition 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.450
 why did you put in the pots of traces well 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.369
 that's 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.049
 noticed that at the bottom there are pots 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.719
 holes to plaster thread to 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.640
 we closed it with mica well and secondly we 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.350
 we can not spoil our container but 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.719
 since our cat doesn't look very 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.719
 decoratively we wrap it in bright mica 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.709
 we have prepared the basis for our dividing 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.840
 and now we will form a ball of 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.870
 rectangular office pre 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.590
 soak in water we have a rectangular shape 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.219
 need to get a circle a circle 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.709
 receive 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:31.650
 and squared like a square cube for 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:39.840
 in order to get the circle we cut 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:42.599
 first the corners of our square and why 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.750

 now we need to put on the ball on 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.030
 folder if we put it so it will be 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.540
 too tall for our tree 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.379
 so from the calculation we take 2 distance 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.379
 of our ball 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.270
