00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
fede okey so here's the cube and I

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.640 
fede okey so here's the cube and I
alright<00:00:33.720> so<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.020> looks<00:00:34.080> like<00:00:34.320> there's<00:00:34.500> some

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
alright so it looks like there's some

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.580 
alright so it looks like there's some
Springs<00:00:35.510> and<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.840> finally<00:00:37.170> remembered<00:00:37.500> to

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
Springs and I finally remembered to

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.240 
Springs and I finally remembered to
order<00:00:37.829> some<00:00:38.039> 2<00:00:38.280> by<00:00:38.430> 2<00:00:38.489> stickers<00:00:39.829> for<00:00:40.829> this

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
order some 2 by 2 stickers for this

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.610 
order some 2 by 2 stickers for this
thing<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.940> my<00:00:42.059> LAN<00:00:42.390> LAN<00:00:42.770> and<00:00:46.160> a<00:00:47.160> cubicle<00:00:48.620> move

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
thing and my LAN LAN and a cubicle move

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.310 
thing and my LAN LAN and a cubicle move
over<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.520> finally<00:00:51.510> remember<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.840> order<00:00:52.050> some

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
over I finally remember to order some

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.630 
over I finally remember to order some
cores<00:00:52.590> also<00:00:53.309> for<00:00:53.789> my<00:00:54.030> V<00:00:54.629> cubes<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:56.600> that's<00:00:57.600> it

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
cores also for my V cubes and that's it

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.250 
cores also for my V cubes and that's it
so<00:01:00.920> looks<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:01.980> there's<00:01:02.899> extra<00:01:03.899> Springs

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
so looks like there's extra Springs

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.990 
so looks like there's extra Springs
there<00:01:04.800> probably<00:01:05.100> different<00:01:05.430> tension<00:01:05.880> I'm

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
there probably different tension I'm

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.840 
there probably different tension I'm
guessing<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:09.500> now<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.979> be<00:01:11.009> honest<00:01:11.369> with<00:01:11.640> you

of<00:01:43.740> these<00:01:43.860> things<00:01:44.570> turning<00:01:45.570> out<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> box

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.350 

kind<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.310> feels<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.520> little<00:01:50.729> scratchy<00:01:51.000> it's

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.400 

so<00:02:07.030> but<00:02:07.360> it<00:02:07.630> feels<00:02:07.900> very<00:02:08.259> smooth<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:09.429> fluid

so but it feels very smooth and fluid
I'd<00:02:11.410> say<00:02:11.680> right<00:02:11.890> now<00:02:13.680> feels<00:02:14.680> nice<00:02:14.920> feels<00:02:15.310> kind

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
I'd say right now feels nice feels kind

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.780 
I'd say right now feels nice feels kind
of<00:02:15.760> loose<00:02:16.000> ish<00:02:16.390> like<00:02:17.160> it's<00:02:18.160> causing<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.670> little

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
of loose ish like it's causing a little

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.229 
of loose ish like it's causing a little
bit<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.060> catching<00:02:19.569> but<00:02:20.819> right<00:02:21.819> off<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:22.060> bat<00:02:22.209> I

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
bit of catching but right off the bat I

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.340 
bit of catching but right off the bat I
can<00:02:22.480> tell<00:02:22.660> you<00:02:22.750> it's<00:02:22.840> got<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:22.959> lot<00:02:23.140> less

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
can tell you it's got a lot less

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.220 
can tell you it's got a lot less
catching<00:02:23.860> than<00:02:24.010> my<00:02:24.190> shangzhou

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
catching than my shangzhou

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.750 
catching than my shangzhou
which<00:02:26.230> just<00:02:26.590> catches<00:02:27.010> all<00:02:27.160> over<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.550> place

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
which just catches all over the place

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.600 
which just catches all over the place
even<00:02:28.090> with<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.690> mod<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.900> right<00:02:32.440> now<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.890> feels

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
even with the mod so right now it feels

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.940 
even with the mod so right now it feels
very<00:02:34.090> good

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.479 

tensions<00:02:38.950> feel<00:02:39.160> pretty<00:02:39.430> even<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.950> it's

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
tensions feel pretty even and it's

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.050 
tensions feel pretty even and it's
obviously<00:02:42.910> pre<00:02:43.269> ludes<00:02:43.480> with<00:02:43.690> some<00:02:43.900> kind<00:02:44.470> of<00:02:44.590> I

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
obviously pre ludes with some kind of I

I'm not going to time this gotta look
through<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.140> viewfinder<00:03:22.620> right<00:03:23.970> good<00:03:24.970> enough

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
through the viewfinder right good enough

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:38.240 
through the viewfinder right good enough
scramble

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.920 

the<00:03:38.580> shades<00:03:38.819> on<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.210> are<00:03:39.450> pretty

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
the shades on this are pretty

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.000 
the shades on this are pretty
interesting<00:03:40.860> also<00:03:41.370> it's<00:03:42.060> got<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.240> nice<00:03:43.010> like

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
interesting also it's got a nice like

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.059 
interesting also it's got a nice like
really<00:03:44.430> light<00:03:44.760> but<00:03:45.060> yet<00:03:45.540> bright<00:03:45.930> orange<00:03:46.620> it

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
really light but yet bright orange it

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.790 
really light but yet bright orange it
looks<00:03:47.280> like<00:03:50.240> but<00:03:51.240> recognition<00:03:52.050> is<00:03:52.230> pretty

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
looks like but recognition is pretty

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.350 
looks like but recognition is pretty
good<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:53.220> far<00:03:53.250> I<00:03:53.790> mean<00:03:55.670> looking<00:03:56.670> at<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.940> side

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
good so far I mean looking at the side

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.699 
good so far I mean looking at the side
of<00:03:57.720> my<00:03:57.840> camera<00:03:58.320> here<00:04:02.900> metal<00:04:03.900> slices<00:04:04.260> are<00:04:04.410> very

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
of my camera here metal slices are very

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.780 
of my camera here metal slices are very
smooth<00:04:06.080> it's<00:04:07.080> definitely<00:04:07.800> for<00:04:08.070> sure

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:36.740 

oops<00:04:11.790> I've<00:04:12.420> done<00:04:12.690> that<00:04:12.870> wrong<00:04:16.310> pairing

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.520 

all<00:04:37.750> right<00:04:37.960> you<00:04:38.650> guys<00:04:38.800> three<00:04:39.040> stage<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:41.380> outer

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
all right you guys three stage the outer

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.900 
all right you guys three stage the outer
layers<00:04:41.860> I<00:04:42.100> feel<00:04:42.490> a<00:04:42.520> little<00:04:42.640> bit<00:04:42.820> loose<00:04:43.060> so<00:04:44.910> I

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
layers I feel a little bit loose so I

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.930 
layers I feel a little bit loose so I
might<00:04:46.300> tension<00:04:46.780> that<00:04:46.980> I<00:04:47.980> feel<00:04:48.580> a<00:04:48.610> little<00:04:48.730> bit

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
might tension that I feel a little bit

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.580 
might tension that I feel a little bit
uncontrollable<00:04:51.600> yes<00:04:52.600> still<00:04:52.930> it's<00:04:53.320> not<00:04:53.530> like

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
uncontrollable yes still it's not like

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.310 
uncontrollable yes still it's not like
that<00:04:53.980> bad<00:04:54.190> but<00:04:54.430> I<00:04:54.700> would<00:04:55.600> prefer<00:04:55.780> it<00:04:56.050> to<00:04:56.110> be<00:04:56.200> a

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
that bad but I would prefer it to be a

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.420 
that bad but I would prefer it to be a
little<00:04:56.650> bit<00:04:56.830> tighter<00:04:58.470> okay<00:04:59.470> so<00:04:59.770> there's<00:05:00.340> a

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
little bit tighter okay so there's a

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:07.650 
little bit tighter okay so there's a
first<00:05:00.880> solve<00:05:01.150> there<00:05:03.870> physically<00:05:04.870> it's<00:05:06.660> pretty

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
first solve there physically it's pretty

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.450 
first solve there physically it's pretty
much<00:05:07.840> the<00:05:07.990> same<00:05:08.140> size<00:05:08.440> as<00:05:08.770> the<00:05:08.920> shangzhou

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
much the same size as the shangzhou

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.280 
much the same size as the shangzhou
I<00:05:10.230> would<00:05:11.230> say<00:05:11.500> half<00:05:12.310> a<00:05:12.490> millimeter<00:05:12.970> bigger<00:05:13.290> but

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
I would say half a millimeter bigger but

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.700 
I would say half a millimeter bigger but
no<00:05:14.440> more<00:05:14.650> than<00:05:14.710> that<00:05:14.890> it's<00:05:15.310> really<00:05:16.320> similar<00:05:17.320> if

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
no more than that it's really similar if

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.530 
no more than that it's really similar if
I<00:05:17.800> can<00:05:17.980> line<00:05:18.130> them<00:05:18.250> up<00:05:19.080> it<00:05:20.080> looks<00:05:20.350> a<00:05:20.620> lot<00:05:20.890> bigger

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
I can line them up it looks a lot bigger

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.900 
I can line them up it looks a lot bigger
because<00:05:22.540> the<00:05:23.110> stickers<00:05:23.800> are<00:05:24.100> like<00:05:24.340> smaller

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
because the stickers are like smaller

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.260 
because the stickers are like smaller
but<00:05:25.770> trust<00:05:26.770> me<00:05:26.860> it's<00:05:27.130> a<00:05:27.580> very<00:05:28.000> small

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
but trust me it's a very small

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:35.970 
but trust me it's a very small
difference<00:05:29.370> corner<00:05:30.370> cutting<00:05:30.550> wise<00:05:34.140> see<00:05:35.140> not

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
difference corner cutting wise see not

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.100 
difference corner cutting wise see not
that<00:05:36.220> much<00:05:36.430> this<00:05:37.030> might<00:05:37.240> be<00:05:37.390> tight<00:05:37.780> alright

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
that much this might be tight alright

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.890 
that much this might be tight alright
this<00:05:38.260> sides<00:05:38.530> a<00:05:38.680> little<00:05:38.800> bit<00:05:39.010> looser<00:05:39.750> so<00:05:40.750> that

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
this sides a little bit looser so that

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.080 
this sides a little bit looser so that
gets<00:05:41.110> like<00:05:41.230> a<00:05:41.290> full<00:05:41.560> QB<00:05:41.950> eye<00:05:42.250> it<00:05:42.670> feels<00:05:42.910> very

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
gets like a full QB eye it feels very

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.470 
gets like a full QB eye it feels very
limited<00:05:43.750> by<00:05:43.900> tensions<00:05:44.440> like<00:05:44.880> I'm<00:05:45.880> pushing<00:05:46.210> it

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
limited by tensions like I'm pushing it

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.940 
limited by tensions like I'm pushing it
a<00:05:46.540> lot<00:05:46.720> here<00:05:47.020> so<00:05:49.140> like<00:05:50.140> I<00:05:50.230> can<00:05:50.410> feel<00:05:50.650> it's<00:05:50.800> on

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
a lot here so like I can feel it's on

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.990 
a lot here so like I can feel it's on
the<00:05:51.100> end<00:05:51.250> of<00:05:51.340> the<00:05:51.490> on<00:05:51.970> the<00:05:52.120> spring<00:05:52.420> there<00:05:54.000> so

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
the end of the on the spring there so

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.070 
the end of the on the spring there so
inner<00:05:55.660> layers<00:05:56.610> it<00:05:57.610> does<00:05:57.670> it<00:05:58.210> when<00:05:58.600> I<00:05:58.630> saw<00:05:58.900> that

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
inner layers it does it when I saw that

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.930 
inner layers it does it when I saw that
though<00:05:59.230> it<00:05:59.410> just<00:05:59.440> glides<00:05:59.950> through<00:06:00.310> everything

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
though it just glides through everything

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.200 
though it just glides through everything
really<00:06:01.120> well<00:06:02.010> so<00:06:03.010> that's<00:06:03.700> really<00:06:04.030> what's

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
really well so that's really what's

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.200 
really well so that's really what's
important<00:06:05.040> so<00:06:06.040> I<00:06:06.100> can't<00:06:06.610> really<00:06:06.730> show<00:06:07.030> you<00:06:07.060> a

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
important so I can't really show you a

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.090 
important so I can't really show you a
full<00:06:07.840> capability<00:06:08.830> because<00:06:09.040> it's<00:06:09.220> tight<00:06:09.520> but

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
full capability because it's tight but

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.450 
full capability because it's tight but
anyways<00:06:12.100> it<00:06:12.460> feels<00:06:12.970> like<00:06:13.060> a<00:06:13.090> really<00:06:13.300> nice<00:06:14.430> 4x4

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
anyways it feels like a really nice 4x4

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.190 
anyways it feels like a really nice 4x4
from<00:06:16.240> what<00:06:16.360> I<00:06:16.390> felt<00:06:16.750> those<00:06:16.870> wore<00:06:17.140> so<00:06:18.960> I'm<00:06:19.960> just

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
from what I felt those wore so I'm just

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.410 
from what I felt those wore so I'm just
gonna<00:06:20.320> guess<00:06:20.650> I'll<00:06:21.010> probably<00:06:21.250> replace<00:06:21.700> my<00:06:22.390> old

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:22.420 
gonna guess I'll probably replace my old

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.150 
gonna guess I'll probably replace my old
shangzhou<00:06:23.370> seems<00:06:24.370> not<00:06:24.580> modern<00:06:24.880> very<00:06:25.090> well<00:06:25.270> so

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 
shangzhou seems not modern very well so

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.210 
shangzhou seems not modern very well so
anyways<00:06:27.160> so<00:06:27.690> this<00:06:28.690> is<00:06:28.930> the<00:06:29.230> first<00:06:29.650> impressions

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
anyways so this is the first impressions

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.330 
anyways so this is the first impressions
of<00:06:30.310> this<00:06:30.430> cube<00:06:30.790> and<00:06:31.200> hopefully<00:06:32.200> they<00:06:32.290> say<00:06:32.560> as

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
of this cube and hopefully they say as

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.190 
of this cube and hopefully they say as
well<00:06:34.090> as<00:06:34.450> when<00:06:35.410> I<00:06:35.700> opened<00:06:36.700> this<00:06:36.790> up<00:06:37.200> and

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.200 
well as when I opened this up and

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.619 
well as when I opened this up and
doesn't

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:39.629 
doesn't

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:43.860 
doesn't
slow<00:06:40.629> or<00:06:40.780> anything<00:06:41.020> so<00:06:42.000> stay<00:06:43.000> tuned<00:06:43.240> for<00:06:43.569> the

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
slow or anything so stay tuned for the

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.010 
slow or anything so stay tuned for the
full<00:06:44.229> review<00:06:44.680> which<00:06:45.039> is<00:06:45.539> coming<00:06:46.539> out<00:06:46.629> soon<00:06:46.840> so
