00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello guys and welcome to this new one 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.960
 incredible video latest news 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.019
 I found another dead purple in one 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.599
 of the last videos that I link you here ok 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.230
 click to then understand what I am 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.410
 speaking 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.779
 I have been pointed out by not a few people 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.420
 of having fished an already dead octopus and of 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.010
 having passed off as a catch of a 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.590
 exemplary live Venetian I would like 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.869
 emphasize a lot 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.269
 presumptuous and provocative that those who go to 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.669
 sea ​​only in summer maybe only 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.969
 Sunday when you go to sea with 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.000
 wife children and in any case you can't 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.790
 mature a great experience does not know 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.290
 that shooting even the smallest octopuses or 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.280
 a little bigger in a certain way 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.789
 way 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.309
 what happens that pop burns out and yes 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.219
 curls and it's something that a 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.620
 who goes often to the sea 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.960
 it often happens I had the great blow of 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.239
 ass to find another dead fox is 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.000
 obviously I'm talking ironically in 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.799
 a first descent checking the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.810
 step that is of this shoal that ended 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.820
 on the sand never collected of different 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.930
 because they looked more or less at one 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.750
 area, however, did not stare like them 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.100
 it is customary to point specifically to 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.030
 end aprea 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.689
 I come back succeeding on the point I can't find the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.750
 botto I look under a Freemason is then 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:30.119
 practically they find it soaked as 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.189
 it is said in technical jargon in the side 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.290
 of the stone he burned it out you were with 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.630
 quietly change the frame 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.930
 I admit with a wider wide angle 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.970
 I go back down to the recovery phase 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.970
 it very nice and I did 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.670
 a couple now very little 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.159
 nice indeed I hit a hips 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.590
 a sea friend I hadn't seen a 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.350
 it never happened to me behind it is 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.909
 it was a thrill to see her attached to 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.469
 pop higher because then he did 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.939
 sucks to go and remove it but then I have 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.899
 solved with a knife 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.470
 I hope you enjoy this video 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.870
