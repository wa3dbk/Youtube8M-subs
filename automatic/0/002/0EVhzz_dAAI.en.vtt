00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.049
 so people too, I'll go now 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.799
 comment on the hot topic of vegan versus 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.480
 meat eater 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.920
 yes, I did not think about it for a long time 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.050
 but I have to say that 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.580
 many of you have asked where 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.320
 do you actually stand by the meat 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.430
 Eat or he will go vegan 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.930
 to comment on it 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.060
 and there are two basic points 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.460
 which one should first consider firstly 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.289
 why am I a vegan point one 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.660
 because I do not kill or eat animals 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.829
 want and that is absolutely legit because 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.600
 I can only say that if the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.579
 Hiring someone has been ethical 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.110
 reason it is absolutely fine then 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.329
 should also keep your hands off it 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.170
 the second point is the 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.510
 nutritional reason where many 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.160
 say a vegan hearted automatically 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.820
 healthier the meat eaters and that's right 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.860
 namely not 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.120
 yes and me as a nutritionist 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.920
 will only look at the facts now 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.020
 Trailer not at two sciences 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.940
 there was also enough of a human being 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.890
 which now only kilo g feeds and 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.660
 only meat or all day has 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.520
 I think as little of it as of 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.320
 one of only planning or of 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.540
 plants are nourished and meat is 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.340
 generally bad yes generally bad 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.710
 It is not in masses 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.200
 acidifies our body that's it 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.030
 That's why I am absolute 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.799
 Opponent of kilo gene or atkins diet 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.259
 because with health nothing too 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.689
 but has on the other side 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.640
 of course, offers high quality meat 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.320
 and here i am with the core topic i 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.869
 also does not support the cheap meat 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.310
 yes and I do not support any 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.350
 Massentierhaltung because I think so 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.270
 totally reprehensible that's what i have to do 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.799
 clearly reject but high quality 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.420
 meat because meat becomes certain to me 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.200
 amino acid and certain minerals 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.689
 and vitamins 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.030
 The simple in this synergy also only 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.729
 from the body so delivered from the meat 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.210
 can also be converted 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.479
 can 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.829
 very important not only what I am 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.840
 important and what's in there then how 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.090
 it can transform the body and there 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.549
 just missing in the vegan diet 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.380
 very much of these amino balances 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.270
 not work in this energy and 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.560
 mind you this is really one 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.420
 psychologically proven 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.530
 and if I would advise someone now 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.600
 how are you supposed to 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.940
 then you go yet, or I'll tell you 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.740
 but offers the middle ground because the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.690
 homeostasis that is biological 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.440
 equilibrium there the body feels 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.300
 preferably 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.640
 it is so in the universe on the 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.790
 all over the world so that everything 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.670
 extreme one direction is not good 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.470
 Also that policy is whether the ticket 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.910
 the global economy is also that 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.380
 universe is completely crappy and so on 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.480
 could also see it in the diet 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.130
 feeds you fresh with fresh 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.180
 yes that means with fruit and 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.709
 vegetables and six good organic meats a 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.989
 Not very often in the week though 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.610
 regular and constant and then it is 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.070
 in my opinion the best 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.320
 Nutrition nothing extreme there and 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.660
 nothing extreme there and this whole 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.060
 tobago what's made of that he is 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.440
 propaganda yes because everyone somewhere 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.870
 has an opinion and everyone wants it 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.970
 through boxing but here I go what is 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.370
 Mine and what is yours and what is that? 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.140
 best for you and the best for you 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.970
 is really a middle ground to go out 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.980
 these two communities and more 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.080
 is also much in the vegan diet 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.670
 worked with soja and the topic soja 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.170
 I will do extra video again 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.420
 Because there are extremely new 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.920
 Findings namely exactly whether 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.810
 that's how it is 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.940
 is not healthy and even certain 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.650
 danger I will hide again 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.900
 make it extra otherwise it will blow up 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.910
 here the frame but from nutritional 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.600
 From a technical point of view, it is the use of 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:31.950
 high quality meat 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:34.320
 Beef fillet organic chicken organic good organic 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.600
 So really bio and expensive is quiet 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.459
 a little more money too then 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.350
 also have the mass animal husbandry 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.970
 not too much at the start because of the 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.560
 opponents also the substance from 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.940
 then invest your coal into the 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.620
 expensive meat then also the 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.480
 Incidentally , I find beer tree promoted 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.430
 also a very good story and let 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.100
 it cheap stuff away he remembers you 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.110
 A lot of vegetables are balanced 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.180
 a lot of fruit that your side 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.920
 shaved and then I can you 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.290
 say it is the best way 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.300
 and as with many other things in the world 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.480
 life is also the middle ground of the 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.160
 Midway the best way with the extremes 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.960
 and you will be fine 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.880
 so and now you can watch like to 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.680
 your opinion under the video or post 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.930
 could it simply be bombed 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.030
 say that's my opinion 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.769
 easy if you think I'm right 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.750
 then it will be me 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.880
 What your opinion is interesting 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.750
 So in my opinion always beautiful 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.940
 ignore 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.190
 always beautiful high quality food 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.930
 I would buy products and then I would 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.160
 say from nutritional physiology 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.000
 sight and from the state of today 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.820
 Science is the best way for you 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.220
 So see you next time 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.220
 and always stay clean people
