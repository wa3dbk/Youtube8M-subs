forward<00:02:31.530> but<00:02:32.400> here<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:32.970> stay<00:02:33.150> here

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360

Ronaldo's<00:05:03.650> footwork<00:05:04.160> is<00:05:04.430> perhaps<00:05:04.880> the<00:05:05.270> most

Ronaldo's footwork is perhaps the most

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.960 
Ronaldo's footwork is perhaps the most

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.840 
machines in history but today's tests
have<00:05:14.750> revealed<00:05:14.780> how<00:05:15.620> his<00:05:15.830> body<00:05:16.100> plays<00:05:16.820> a

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
have revealed how his body plays a

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.090 
have revealed how his body plays a
crucial<00:05:17.210> role<00:05:17.420> in<00:05:17.810> his<00:05:17.990> effectiveness<00:05:18.560> on<00:05:18.890> the

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
crucial role in his effectiveness on the

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.910 
crucial role in his effectiveness on the
pitch<00:05:20.050> one<00:05:21.050> of<00:05:21.140> the<00:05:21.200> most<00:05:21.380> impressive<00:05:21.710> things

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
pitch one of the most impressive things

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.830 
pitch one of the most impressive things
about<00:05:22.310> him<00:05:22.490> was<00:05:22.640> his<00:05:22.730> strength<00:05:23.090> and<00:05:23.420> his<00:05:23.540> power

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
about him was his strength and his power

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.710 
about him was his strength and his power
I<00:05:24.170> think<00:05:24.500> this<00:05:24.800> is<00:05:24.920> what<00:05:25.070> sets<00:05:25.310> him<00:05:25.400> apart

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
I think this is what sets him apart

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.450 
I think this is what sets him apart
alongside<00:05:26.720> that<00:05:27.230> high<00:05:27.530> high<00:05:27.770> level<00:05:28.100> of<00:05:28.220> skill

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
alongside that high high level of skill

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.160 
alongside that high high level of skill
he<00:05:28.580> has<00:05:28.610> and<00:05:29.000> something<00:05:29.630> in<00:05:29.720> other<00:05:29.840> players

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
he has and something in other players

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.270 
he has and something in other players
find<00:05:30.410> it<00:05:30.560> very<00:05:30.740> very<00:05:30.919> hard<00:05:31.190> to<00:05:31.340> replicate<00:05:31.820> his

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
find it very very hard to replicate his

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.620 
find it very very hard to replicate his
body<00:05:34.280> strength<00:05:34.700> contributes<00:05:35.390> significantly

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
body strength contributes significantly

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:42.520 
body strength contributes significantly
in<00:05:36.470> all<00:05:36.890> areas<00:05:37.520> of<00:05:37.669> his<00:05:37.790> performance<00:05:41.410> but<00:05:42.410> his

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
in all areas of his performance but his

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.560 
in all areas of his performance but his
technique<00:05:43.070> enables<00:05:43.580> him<00:05:43.970> to<00:05:44.000> generate

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
technique enables him to generate

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.380 
technique enables him to generate
maximum<00:05:44.930> power
