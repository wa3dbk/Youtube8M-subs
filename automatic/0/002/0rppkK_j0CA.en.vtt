coming in to all of us here this is a

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.880 
coming in to all of us here this is a
day<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.420> awaking<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.260> couldn't<00:00:28.560> believe<00:00:28.859> that

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
day of awaking we couldn't believe that

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.880 
day of awaking we couldn't believe that
that<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.580> was<00:00:29.789> going<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.480> such<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:31.650> such<00:00:31.859> a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
that this was going on to such to such a

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.630 
that this was going on to such to such a
level<00:00:32.300> you<00:00:33.300> don't<00:00:33.540> seem<00:00:33.780> too<00:00:33.989> surprised<00:00:34.640> yeah

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
level you don't seem too surprised yeah

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.850 
level you don't seem too surprised yeah
I<00:00:35.670> mean<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:36.000> nice<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.570> believe<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.290> all

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
I mean it's nice to believe that all

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.770 
I mean it's nice to believe that all
sports<00:00:38.250> are<00:00:38.489> cleaner<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.969> nice<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.450> look<00:00:39.570> at<00:00:39.719> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
sports are cleaner is nice to look at a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.840 
sports are cleaner is nice to look at a
game<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.590> enjoy<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.040> game<00:00:41.190> for<00:00:41.489> what<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.730> is

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
game and enjoy the game for what it is

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.690 
game and enjoy the game for what it is
and<00:00:42.120> seems<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.540> people<00:00:42.750> are<00:00:43.530> performing<00:00:44.430> at

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
and seems that people are performing at

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.190 
and seems that people are performing at
their<00:00:45.030> natural<00:00:46.460> ability<00:00:47.460> based<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.960> hard

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
their natural ability based on in a hard

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.740 
their natural ability based on in a hard
work<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.739> training<00:00:50.059> but<00:00:51.059> occasionally<00:00:51.690> you

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
work and training but occasionally you

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.660 
work and training but occasionally you
see<00:00:52.020> athletes<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.620> seems<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.070> bit<00:00:53.219> perform

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
see athletes that seems a bit perform

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.720 
see athletes that seems a bit perform
just<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.030> little<00:00:54.270> bit<00:00:54.390> more<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.280> you<00:00:56.280> hope<00:00:56.489> that

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
just a little bit more and you hope that

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.770 
just a little bit more and you hope that
that's<00:00:56.879> because<00:00:57.300> they're<00:00:57.449> having<00:00:57.690> an

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
that's because they're having an

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.660 
that's because they're having an
outstanding<00:00:58.079> day<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.859> they're<00:00:58.980> not<00:00:59.129> taking

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
outstanding day that they're not taking

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.009 
outstanding day that they're not taking
some<00:00:59.940> form<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:01.219> enhancing<00:01:02.870> medication<00:01:03.870> or

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
some form of enhancing medication or

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.410 
some form of enhancing medication or
drug<00:01:04.460> and<00:01:05.460> particularly<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.060> area<00:01:06.390> that

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
drug and particularly in the area that

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.060 
drug and particularly in the area that
will<00:01:06.600> support<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.140> know<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.380> best<00:01:07.799> is

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
will support that I know of best is

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.039 
will support that I know of best is
cycling<00:01:08.580> now<00:01:08.790> we<00:01:08.850> see<00:01:09.150> some<00:01:09.420> site<00:01:09.689> that

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
cycling now we see some site that

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.870 
cycling now we see some site that
they're<00:01:10.470> all<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:10.770> such<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> high<00:01:11.250> standard

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
they're all it's such a high standard

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.120 
they're all it's such a high standard
and<00:01:12.000> if<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.780> suddenly<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> cyclist<00:01:13.950> this

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
and if you suddenly have a cyclist this

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.429 
and if you suddenly have a cyclist this
goes<00:01:14.369> well<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.909> truly<00:01:15.240> beyond<00:01:15.630> what<00:01:16.200> anybody

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
goes well and truly beyond what anybody

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.730 
goes well and truly beyond what anybody
else<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:17.009> do<00:01:17.270> it's<00:01:18.270> not<00:01:18.479> natural<00:01:18.659> we<00:01:19.409> said<00:01:19.619> if

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
else can do it's not natural we said if

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.490 
else can do it's not natural we said if
you're<00:01:19.830> them<00:01:20.070> recently<00:01:20.340> indeed<00:01:21.090> yeah<00:01:21.570> tell<00:01:22.380> us

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
you're them recently indeed yeah tell us

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.050 
you're them recently indeed yeah tell us
about<00:01:22.619> peptides<00:01:22.950> that's<00:01:23.490> what<00:01:23.640> we've<00:01:23.759> been

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
about peptides that's what we've been

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.580 
about peptides that's what we've been
talking<00:01:24.330> about<00:01:24.509> today<00:01:24.810> that's<00:01:25.140> what's

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
talking about today that's what's

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.340 
talking about today that's what's
alleged<00:01:25.950> has<00:01:26.790> been<00:01:27.030> consumed<00:01:27.479> by<00:01:27.720> perhaps<00:01:28.110> an

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
alleged has been consumed by perhaps an

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.429 
alleged has been consumed by perhaps an
AFL<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.829> NRL<00:01:29.520> players<00:01:29.970> allegations<00:01:30.659> only<00:01:31.259> at

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
AFL and NRL players allegations only at

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.340 
AFL and NRL players allegations only at
the<00:01:31.530> moment<00:01:31.829> what's<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.430> peptide<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.180> why<00:01:33.780> are

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the moment what's a peptide and why are

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.560 
the moment what's a peptide and why are
these<00:01:34.590> players<00:01:35.040> wanting<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.970> take<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.329> so

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
these players wanting to take it so

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.810 
these players wanting to take it so
badly<00:01:36.810> well<00:01:37.320> peptides<00:01:37.799> an<00:01:37.950> amino<00:01:38.280> acid<00:01:38.670> so

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
badly well peptides an amino acid so

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.840 
badly well peptides an amino acid so
it's<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.030> very<00:01:39.060> very<00:01:39.479> small<00:01:39.810> chain<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.040> it

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
it's a very very small chain and it

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.450 
it's a very very small chain and it
creates<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.450> protein<00:01:42.960> through<00:01:43.770> growth<00:01:43.979> hormone

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
creates a protein through growth hormone

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.969 
creates a protein through growth hormone
and<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.450> basically<00:01:45.600> our<00:01:45.899> muscles<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.649> ninety

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
and so basically our muscles and ninety

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.490 
and so basically our muscles and ninety
percent<00:01:47.130> protein<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.149> sort<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.960> greater<00:01:49.320> you

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
percent protein and sort of greater you

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.889 
percent protein and sort of greater you
can<00:01:49.710> build<00:01:50.610> your<00:01:50.790> muscles<00:01:50.970> are<00:01:51.420> stronger<00:01:51.689> they

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
can build your muscles are stronger they

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.539 
can build your muscles are stronger they
get<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.320> bigger<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.649> volume<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.100> muscle<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
get the bigger the volume of muscle the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.910 
get the bigger the volume of muscle the
more<00:01:53.670> power<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.210> produce<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:55.380> also<00:01:55.530> there

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
more power can produce but also there

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.520 
more power can produce but also there
are<00:01:55.950> certain<00:01:56.640> types<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.060> peptides<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.840> stop

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
are certain types of peptides that stop

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.399 
are certain types of peptides that stop
us<00:01:58.860> from<00:01:59.340> aging<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:00.780> actually<00:02:01.110> stop<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
us from aging and so actually stop the

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.399 
us from aging and so actually stop the
degradation<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:02.090> proteins<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.509> normally<00:02:04.320> when

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
degradation of proteins so normally when

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.870 
degradation of proteins so normally when
we<00:02:04.530> exercise<00:02:04.799> there's<00:02:05.399> some<00:02:05.549> damage<00:02:05.820> to

to<00:03:14.360> think<00:03:14.660> in<00:03:14.870> many<00:03:15.050> cases<00:03:15.800> you<00:03:16.460> know<00:03:16.550> in<00:03:16.610> some

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
to think in many cases you know in some

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.550 
to think in many cases you know in some
cases<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.420> individual<00:03:17.900> athlete<00:03:18.200> that<00:03:18.350> really

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
cases the individual athlete that really

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.670 
cases the individual athlete that really
tries<00:03:18.800> to<00:03:18.830> pursue<00:03:19.460> a<00:03:19.930> method<00:03:20.930> of<00:03:21.020> cheating<00:03:21.500> but

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
tries to pursue a method of cheating but

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.430 
tries to pursue a method of cheating but
also<00:03:21.830> I<00:03:22.040> think<00:03:22.130> in<00:03:22.850> some<00:03:23.000> cases<00:03:23.540> some<00:03:24.110> of<00:03:24.350> these

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
also I think in some cases some of these

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.610 
also I think in some cases some of these
people<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:26.060> know<00:03:26.450> courage<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:27.080> go<00:03:27.200> down<00:03:27.440> and

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
people you know courage to go down and

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.170 
people you know courage to go down and
pass<00:03:27.800> where<00:03:28.100> they<00:03:28.160> don't<00:03:28.370> really<00:03:28.550> know<00:03:28.820> that

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
pass where they don't really know that

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.360 
pass where they don't really know that
it's<00:03:29.330> actually<00:03:29.780> illegal<00:03:30.170> or<00:03:30.890> it's<00:03:31.070> cheating

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
it's actually illegal or it's cheating

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.160 
it's actually illegal or it's cheating
they<00:03:31.730> just<00:03:31.970> think<00:03:32.180> it's<00:03:32.300> just<00:03:32.510> another<00:03:32.780> method

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
they just think it's just another method

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.800 
they just think it's just another method
of<00:03:33.790> becoming<00:03:34.790> better<00:03:35.060> and<00:03:35.270> stronger<00:03:35.570> and

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
of becoming better and stronger and

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.170 
of becoming better and stronger and
winning<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.800> game<00:03:36.980> I<00:03:37.310> think<00:03:37.730> you<00:03:37.820> spot<00:03:38.030> on

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
winning the game I think you spot on

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.240 
winning the game I think you spot on
that<00:03:38.210> and<00:03:38.510> that's<00:03:38.630> been<00:03:39.530> a<00:03:39.560> theme<00:03:39.920> that<00:03:40.130> we've

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
that and that's been a theme that we've

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.620 
that and that's been a theme that we've
heard<00:03:40.370> in<00:03:40.460> the<00:03:40.550> last<00:03:40.700> couple<00:03:40.940> of<00:03:41.060> days<00:03:41.270> of

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
heard in the last couple of days of

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.870 
heard in the last couple of days of
players<00:03:42.020> saying<00:03:42.500> they<00:03:42.680> thought<00:03:43.010> what<00:03:43.850> they

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
players saying they thought what they

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.270 
players saying they thought what they
were<00:03:44.090> taking<00:03:44.600> was<00:03:44.900> okay<00:03:45.530> we've<00:03:45.890> heard<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.250> lot

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
were taking was okay we've heard a lot

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.490 
were taking was okay we've heard a lot
about<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.730> benefits<00:03:47.000> of<00:03:47.420> peptides<00:03:47.900> but<00:03:48.290> what

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
about the benefits of peptides but what

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.770 
about the benefits of peptides but what
type<00:03:48.710> of<00:03:48.740> damage<00:03:49.280> can<00:03:50.060> they<00:03:50.210> do<00:03:50.270> to<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.660> human

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
type of damage can they do to the human

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.600 
type of damage can they do to the human
body<00:03:51.110> over<00:03:51.410> time<00:03:51.620> well<00:03:52.160> that's<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.460> problem

we<00:03:52.820> don't<00:03:52.970> know<00:03:53.240> like<00:03:53.570> some<00:03:53.780> of<00:03:53.900> these

we don't know like some of these

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.380 
we don't know like some of these
peptides<00:03:54.350> as<00:03:54.950> we<00:03:55.430> said<00:03:55.670> before<00:03:55.700> they're<00:03:56.210> not

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
peptides as we said before they're not

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.770 
peptides as we said before they're not
not<00:03:57.320> there<00:03:57.620> for<00:03:58.030> human<00:03:59.030> consumption<00:03:59.390> yet<00:03:59.600> they

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
not there for human consumption yet they

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.840 
not there for human consumption yet they
haven't<00:03:59.960> we<00:04:00.110> been<00:04:00.380> tested<00:04:00.920> on<00:04:00.980> humans<00:04:01.040> and

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
haven't we been tested on humans and

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.750 
haven't we been tested on humans and
they<00:04:02.600> might<00:04:02.810> work<00:04:02.990> well<00:04:03.260> in<00:04:03.500> in<00:04:04.280> animal<00:04:04.640> models

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
they might work well in in animal models

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.640 
they might work well in in animal models
but<00:04:05.180> we<00:04:05.330> really<00:04:05.540> don't<00:04:05.660> know<00:04:05.840> what<00:04:06.320> they<00:04:06.470> do<00:04:06.590> to

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
but we really don't know what they do to

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.250 
but we really don't know what they do to
humans<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:07.430> then<00:04:08.210> the<00:04:08.330> classic<00:04:08.570> you<00:04:08.990> know<00:04:09.020> the

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
humans and then the classic you know the

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.920 
humans and then the classic you know the
the<00:04:09.620> old<00:04:09.800> growth<00:04:10.520> hormone<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.360> anabolic

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
the old growth hormone the anabolic

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.390 
the old growth hormone the anabolic
steroid<00:04:12.110> you<00:04:12.710> know<00:04:12.770> it<00:04:12.830> took<00:04:12.980> us<00:04:13.100> a<00:04:13.130> while<00:04:13.340> to

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
steroid you know it took us a while to

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.370 
steroid you know it took us a while to
realize<00:04:14.000> that<00:04:14.030> anabolic<00:04:14.600> steroids<00:04:15.020> can<00:04:15.230> make

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
realize that anabolic steroids can make

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.050 
realize that anabolic steroids can make
women<00:04:15.770> look<00:04:15.800> like<00:04:15.920> men<00:04:16.280> men<00:04:16.520> look<00:04:16.670> like<00:04:16.850> women

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
women look like men men look like women

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.240 
women look like men men look like women
and<00:04:17.330> so<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.410> question<00:04:18.799> is<00:04:18.830> what<00:04:19.040> do<00:04:19.130> the

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
and so the question is what do the

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.700 
and so the question is what do the
peptides<00:04:19.730> do<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.090> people<00:04:20.299> at<00:04:21.170> this<00:04:21.320> point<00:04:21.560> in

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.710 
peptides do to people at this point in

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.980 
peptides do to people at this point in
time<00:04:21.739> we<00:04:22.070> probably<00:04:22.850> don't<00:04:23.060> really<00:04:23.360> know<00:04:23.570> a<00:04:23.930> lot

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
time we probably don't really know a lot

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.440 
time we probably don't really know a lot
of<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:24.500> magenta<00:04:24.919> genetic<00:04:25.370> modifications<00:04:26.120> and

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
of the magenta genetic modifications and

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.850 
of the magenta genetic modifications and
you<00:04:27.169> know<00:04:27.260> love<00:04:27.470> them

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
you know love them

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.170 
you know love them

atrophy<00:04:36.469> and<00:04:36.500> you<00:04:36.919> know<00:04:37.009> they're<00:04:37.490> actually

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:37.819 
atrophy and you know they're actually

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.029 
atrophy and you know they're actually
produced<00:04:38.210> for<00:04:38.389> a<00:04:38.419> purpose<00:04:38.689> in<00:04:39.050> these<00:04:39.710> cases

produced for a purpose in these cases

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.909

that<00:04:40.639> probably<00:04:41.000> are<00:04:41.650> beneficial<00:04:42.650> but<00:04:42.770> like

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
that probably are beneficial but like

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.679 
that probably are beneficial but like
most<00:04:43.129> drugs<00:04:43.490> there<00:04:43.669> are<00:04:43.819> some<00:04:44.060> side<00:04:44.300> effects

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:44.689 
most drugs there are some side effects

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:46.779 
most drugs there are some side effects
yeah<00:04:45.379> this<00:04:45.530> peptide<00:04:45.800> six<00:04:46.370> we're<00:04:46.550> hearing

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
yeah this peptide six we're hearing

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.209 
yeah this peptide six we're hearing
about<00:04:46.969> on<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.780> bottle<00:04:48.139> I<00:04:48.259> it<00:04:48.680> says<00:04:48.949> for

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:49.219 
about on the bottle I it says for

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:51.399 
about on the bottle I it says for
research<00:04:49.580> purposes<00:04:49.610> only<00:04:50.389> so<00:04:50.629> clearly<00:04:51.199> it

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:51.409 
research purposes only so clearly it

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:53.950 
research purposes only so clearly it
it's<00:04:51.620> not<00:04:52.069> ready<00:04:52.310> for<00:04:52.580> for<00:04:53.060> human<00:04:53.479> consumption

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
it's not ready for for human consumption

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.649 
it's not ready for for human consumption
the<00:04:54.620> beauty<00:04:54.949> of<00:04:55.069> these<00:04:55.219> these<00:04:55.789> drugs<00:04:56.360> these

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
the beauty of these these drugs these

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:58.779 
the beauty of these these drugs these
peptides<00:04:56.960> or<00:04:57.500> hormones<00:04:58.099> whatever<00:04:58.400> you<00:04:58.520> call

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
peptides or hormones whatever you call

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.209 
peptides or hormones whatever you call
them<00:04:58.939> for<00:04:59.449> a<00:04:59.479> player<00:04:59.870> is<00:05:00.229> I<00:05:00.259> guess<00:05:01.009> that

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:01.219 
them for a player is I guess that

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:05.589 
them for a player is I guess that
they're<00:05:01.370> very<00:05:01.400> hard<00:05:02.029> to<00:05:02.240> detect<00:05:04.599> they

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
they're very hard to detect they

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.379 
they're very hard to detect they
metabolize<00:05:06.199> very<00:05:06.500> very<00:05:06.740> quickly<00:05:07.180> but<00:05:08.180> also

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
metabolize very very quickly but also

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.959 
metabolize very very quickly but also
that<00:05:08.930> they<00:05:09.139> can<00:05:09.439> help<00:05:09.919> get<00:05:10.189> over<00:05:10.490> an<00:05:10.580> injury

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:10.969 
that they can help get over an injury

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:14.350 
that they can help get over an injury
very<00:05:11.270> quickly<00:05:11.830> exactly<00:05:12.830> and<00:05:12.979> that's<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.699> and

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
very quickly exactly and that's the and

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.119 
very quickly exactly and that's the and
that<00:05:14.509> that<00:05:14.689> new<00:05:14.870> generation<00:05:15.529> of<00:05:15.620> peptide

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:16.129 
that that new generation of peptide

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:18.939 
that that new generation of peptide
which<00:05:16.310> really<00:05:16.550> helps<00:05:17.479> the<00:05:17.539> protein<00:05:18.500> turnover

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
which really helps the protein turnover

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.820 
which really helps the protein turnover
helps<00:05:19.789> to<00:05:20.080> personally<00:05:21.080> cover<00:05:21.349> more<00:05:21.560> quickly

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
helps to personally cover more quickly

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.279 
helps to personally cover more quickly
because<00:05:22.189> you<00:05:22.639> know<00:05:22.729> in<00:05:23.270> reality<00:05:23.419> a<00:05:23.719> muscle

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
because you know in reality a muscle

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.379 
because you know in reality a muscle
injury<00:05:24.439> can<00:05:24.830> take<00:05:25.039> up<00:05:25.189> to<00:05:25.219> 28<00:05:25.729> days<00:05:25.969> to<00:05:26.150> recover

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
injury can take up to 28 days to recover

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:27.999 
injury can take up to 28 days to recover
that's<00:05:26.659> a<00:05:26.750> minor<00:05:26.960> muscle<00:05:27.169> injury<00:05:27.620> that's<00:05:27.770> just

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
that's a minor muscle injury that's just

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.279 
that's a minor muscle injury that's just
the<00:05:28.159> you<00:05:28.340> know<00:05:28.400> this<00:05:28.870> delayed<00:05:29.870> onset<00:05:30.050> muscle

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
the you know this delayed onset muscle

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:32.230 
the you know this delayed onset muscle
soreness<00:05:30.620> that<00:05:31.009> we<00:05:31.219> get<00:05:31.370> if<00:05:31.490> we<00:05:31.520> does<00:05:31.759> done

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
soreness that we get if we does done

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.610 
soreness that we get if we does done
something<00:05:32.599> new<00:05:32.779> so<00:05:32.930> I'm<00:05:32.990> going<00:05:33.110> to<00:05:33.139> customer

something new so I'm going to customer

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.469 
something new so I'm going to customer
custom<00:05:34.190> exercise<00:05:34.699> we've<00:05:34.909> got<00:05:35.060> really<00:05:35.270> sore

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
custom exercise we've got really sore

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:38.170 
custom exercise we've got really sore
muscles<00:05:35.810> 72<00:05:36.169> hours<00:05:36.319> later<00:05:36.589> in<00:05:37.039> fact<00:05:37.940> that

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
muscles 72 hours later in fact that

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.170 
muscles 72 hours later in fact that
takes<00:05:38.419> 28<00:05:38.870> days<00:05:38.900> to<00:05:39.319> recover<00:05:39.560> from<00:05:39.729> and<00:05:40.729> so<00:05:41.120> you

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
takes 28 days to recover from and so you

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.510 
takes 28 days to recover from and so you
in<00:05:42.080> these<00:05:42.349> elite<00:05:42.650> athletes<00:05:43.099> they<00:05:43.219> don't<00:05:43.430> have

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
in these elite athletes they don't have

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.339 
in these elite athletes they don't have
28<00:05:43.909> days<00:05:44.150> to<00:05:44.330> recover<00:05:44.599> and<00:05:45.259> so<00:05:46.389> they<00:05:47.389> yeah<00:05:47.870> any

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:48.349

expected of them and but what surprised

00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:59.740 
expected of them and but what surprised
me<00:05:58.159> actually<00:05:58.370> is<00:05:58.759> that<00:05:59.270> it's<00:05:59.419> actually

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
me actually is that it's actually

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.119 
me actually is that it's actually
happened<00:06:00.050> here<00:06:00.169> in<00:06:00.259> Australia<00:06:00.680> because<00:06:00.830> in

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:01.129 
happened here in Australia because in

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:03.490 
happened here in Australia because in
Europe<00:06:01.789> the<00:06:02.029> money<00:06:02.360> involved<00:06:02.810> is<00:06:03.080> much<00:06:03.289> much

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
Europe the money involved is much much

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.010 
Europe the money involved is much much
much<00:06:03.680> bigger<00:06:03.889> than<00:06:04.069> here<00:06:04.370> in<00:06:04.400> Australia<00:06:05.020> but

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
much bigger than here in Australia but

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.589 
much bigger than here in Australia but
that<00:06:06.139> was<00:06:06.259> before<00:06:06.379> I<00:06:06.620> knew<00:06:06.710> about<00:06:07.599> organized

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 
that was before I knew about organized

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:13.200 
that was before I knew about organized
crime<00:06:08.719> and<00:06:08.960> things<00:06:09.349> like<00:06:09.529> that<00:06:09.589> but<00:06:09.830> I<00:06:10.509> think

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
crime and things like that but I think

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.700 
crime and things like that but I think
well<00:06:14.210> one<00:06:14.449> of<00:06:14.569> the<00:06:14.689> one<00:06:15.319> of<00:06:15.349> the<00:06:15.439> big<00:06:15.589> issues

have you seen that an evolving trend

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.399 
have you seen that an evolving trend
here<00:06:37.699> that<00:06:37.909> the<00:06:38.029> doctors<00:06:38.389> are<00:06:38.539> happy<00:06:39.169> to

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:39.409

prescribe these drugs
yeah<00:06:42.449> I<00:06:42.479> think<00:06:42.630> in<00:06:42.900> certain<00:06:43.169> areas<00:06:44.870> for

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
yeah I think in certain areas for

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.719 
yeah I think in certain areas for
example<00:06:46.350> in<00:06:46.440> weightlifting<00:06:46.889> in<00:06:47.280> places<00:06:47.699> like

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:47.729 
example in weightlifting in places like

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:51.290 
example in weightlifting in places like
that<00:06:47.940> there<00:06:48.840> are<00:06:48.960> people<00:06:49.199> who<00:06:50.030> happen<00:06:51.030> to<00:06:51.210> be

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
that there are people who happen to be

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.850 
that there are people who happen to be
medical<00:06:51.780> practitioners<00:06:52.410> that<00:06:52.560> also

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
medical practitioners that also

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.129 
medical practitioners that also
weight-lift<00:06:53.100> and<00:06:53.639> they're<00:06:54.570> quite<00:06:54.810> happy<00:06:54.960> to
