00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
you want each of those calls for two

pattern<00:02:02.350> i<00:02:02.440> recommend<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.540> stormy

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
pattern i recommend so the stormy

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.030 
pattern i recommend so the stormy
pattern<00:02:04.900> doesn't<00:02:05.260> it's<00:02:05.590> not<00:02:05.830> like

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
pattern doesn't it's not like

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.100 
pattern doesn't it's not like
necessarily<00:02:06.630> necessarily<00:02:07.630> like<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.990> one

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
necessarily necessarily like the one

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.630 
necessarily necessarily like the one
which<00:02:08.290> is<00:02:08.320> played<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.590> natural<00:02:09.009> tracker<00:02:09.220> if<00:02:09.460> it

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
which is played a natural tracker if it

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:21.340 
which is played a natural tracker if it
was<00:02:10.030> cool<00:02:10.210> so<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:10.869> sounds<00:02:11.260> like<00:02:11.320> this

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.100 

so<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.430> is<00:02:22.550> um<00:02:22.910> you've<00:02:23.480> got<00:02:23.660> three<00:02:23.960> down

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
so that is um you've got three down

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.350 
so that is um you've got three down
strums<00:02:24.410> on<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.770> G<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:27.020> then<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.380> down<00:02:27.590> up<00:02:27.800> and

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
strums on the G and then a down up and

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.490 
strums on the G and then a down up and
you've<00:02:29.360> then<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:29.660> change<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:30.080> a<00:02:30.110> see<00:02:30.260> at<00:02:30.350> night

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
you've then you change to a see at night

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.220 
you've then you change to a see at night
on<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.700> sideline<00:02:32.060> you<00:02:32.090> then<00:02:32.330> have<00:02:32.540> down<00:02:32.990> up

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
on the sideline you then have down up

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.650 
on the sideline you then have down up
down<00:02:33.260> down<00:02:33.830> down<00:02:34.310> up<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:37.820> realizes<00:02:38.450> i

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
down down down up so I realizes i

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.210 
down down down up so I realizes i
realized<00:02:39.080> that<00:02:39.140> sounds<00:02:39.470> absolutely<00:02:39.650> nothing

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
realized that sounds absolutely nothing

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.800 
realized that sounds absolutely nothing
like<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.520> strong<00:02:40.700> person<00:02:41.060> but<00:02:41.090> anyways<00:02:41.360> so

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
like the strong person but anyways so

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.540 
like the strong person but anyways so
I'm<00:02:41.990> if<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.470> speed<00:02:42.800> up<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.190> smush<00:02:43.520> it

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
I'm if you speed up and smush it

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.870 
I'm if you speed up and smush it
together<00:02:43.880> on<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.570> G<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:44.960> have<00:02:45.160> down<00:02:46.160> down

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
together on the G you have down down

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.840 
together on the G you have down down
down<00:02:47.570> down<00:02:48.290> down<00:02:49.100> down<00:02:49.820> down<00:02:50.480> down<00:02:51.580> then<00:02:52.580> we<00:02:52.640> do

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
down down down down down down then we do

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.520 
down down down down down down then we do
is<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.120> just<00:02:53.150> repeat<00:02:53.540> that<00:02:53.660> pattern<00:02:53.840> exactly

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
is you just repeat that pattern exactly

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.290 
is you just repeat that pattern exactly
the<00:02:54.620> same<00:02:54.680> on<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:55.100> E<00:02:55.130> minor<00:02:55.460> and<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:56.000> details

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
the same on the E minor and the details

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.570 
the same on the E minor and the details
for<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:56.960> on<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.110> E<00:02:57.140> minor<00:02:57.410> 7<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:58.160> then<00:02:58.340> have

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
for so on the E minor 7 you then have

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.280 
for so on the E minor 7 you then have
down<00:02:59.390> down<00:03:00.110> down<00:03:01.150> change<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.270> you<00:03:02.390> /d<00:03:03.080> source

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
down down down change it you /d source

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.810 
down down down change it you /d source
for<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:03.680> can<00:03:03.860> down<00:03:04.430> up<00:03:04.700> down<00:03:04.880> down<00:03:06.700> so<00:03:07.700> the

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
for you can down up down down so the

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.080 
for you can down up down down so the
whole<00:03:08.000> thing<00:03:08.240> all<00:03:08.480> together<00:03:08.630> nice<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:09.140> slow

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
whole thing all together nice and slow

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.200 
whole thing all together nice and slow
so<00:03:11.090> yeah<00:03:11.240> down<00:03:11.570> down<00:03:12.230> down<00:03:12.800> down<00:03:13.430> up<00:03:13.730> down<00:03:14.000> up

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.530 

 that<00:03:22.459> codes<00:03:22.879> are<00:03:22.999> peanuts<00:03:23.329> just<00:03:23.359> like

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
 that codes are peanuts just like

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.000 
 that codes are peanuts just like
forget<00:03:23.870> I<00:03:24.049> did<00:03:24.230> that<00:03:24.349> last<00:03:24.499> one<00:03:24.709> let's<00:03:24.980> just

forget I did that last one let's just
rewind<00:03:25.249> will<00:03:25.549> do<00:03:25.639> that<00:03:25.760> again<00:03:25.939> k<00:03:26.749> 2<00:03:26.930> so<00:03:27.499> when

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
rewind will do that again k 2 so when

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.729 
rewind will do that again k 2 so when
the<00:03:27.739> do<00:03:27.889> you<00:03:27.980> have<00:03:28.099> down<00:03:28.730> down<00:03:29.269> down<00:03:29.840> down<00:03:30.469> up

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
bouncy that sounds kind of like what

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:33.129 
bouncy that sounds kind of like what
she's<00:03:55.170> playing<00:03:55.350> this<00:03:55.500> yourself

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.200 

okay<00:04:34.139> I'm<00:04:34.319> kind<00:04:34.770> of<00:04:34.939> interesting<00:04:35.939> i<00:04:36.060> say

okay I'm kind of interesting i say
because<00:04:36.479> we're<00:04:37.319> playing<00:04:37.560> a<00:04:37.620> different<00:04:37.740> timing

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
because we're playing a different timing

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.980 
because we're playing a different timing
patterns<00:04:38.370> on<00:04:38.520> that<00:04:38.669> she's<00:04:38.789> playing<00:04:39.030> in<00:04:39.389> song
