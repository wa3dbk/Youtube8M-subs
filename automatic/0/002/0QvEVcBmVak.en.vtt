00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.770
 it was 1983 when fiat decided 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.870
 to give the all-wheel drive to the 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.090
 city â€‹â€‹car that had launched three years 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.120
 first the panda is still at a distance today 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.860
 of thirty we are here talking 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.989
 of the only car capable of combining 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.390
 four wheel drive to the qualities of 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.670
 compactness and proper handling 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.260
 of the segment to small as much 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.600
 mean we read that the new one 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.270
 panda 4x4 at a height from the ground 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.680
 increased by 5 cm compared to 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.420
 basic version 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.490
 we see that it has some protections 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.160
 steel underbody that serve to 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.590
 protect the mechanical parts we have 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.010
 told that he disengages with great 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.110
 easy on very low pass routes 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.970
 adherence in this regard is of course 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.000
 all-wheel drive and also of a 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.240
 device is called e ld and improves the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.070
 check under 50 kilometers per hour and 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.840
 with manual insertion 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.540
 at this point knowing all these things 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.509
 we just have to go and check the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.580
 quality of the panda 4x4 not only on 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.700
 road but also and above all in off 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.700
 road 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.840
 on the road has an agile behavior 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.150
 compound guaranteed as well as by 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.550
 compact size even from work 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.350
 carried out on the suspensions they succeed in 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.840
 dampen vibrations very well 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.340
 transmitted by the asphalt before they enter 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.259
 inside the passenger compartment 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.180
 as for the engines we tested the 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.360
 first twin is a 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.190
 85 horsepower supercharged petrol that 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.530
 yields something in silence but 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.479
 earns a lot compared to having expired 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.280
 terms of brilliance 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.990
 the gearbox is a six-speed manual with 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.180
 the first reduced to deal with 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.070
 better difficult starts the other 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.170
 diesel engine is available 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.170
 multijet 1300 with 75 horses 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.740
 we leave the asphalt we enter the path 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.810
 off road designed inside the 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.600
 fiat testing center of balocco for the purpose 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.190
 to test the 4x4s of the group in the 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.050
 more extreme conditions 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.730
 the tests are passed with great 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.920
 ease from the panda that has 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.210
 the opportunity to work properly 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.550
 all-wheel drive 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.410
 this is managed by a friction joint 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.680
 multiple controlled by a control unit 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.630
 electronic that detects autonomously the 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.670
 need of the moment and transfers 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.209
 then the right portion of the couple to 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.209
 rear 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.380
 furthermore you can help with the 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.209
 device is the of which simulates 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.640
 the intervention of a differential 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.730
 self-locking inserted through a 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.890
 button present on the central tunnel 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.850
 preload the pair on the back 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.190
 improving car control 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.230
 on critical funds such as snow and sand 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.270
 ice the data on the other hand does not 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.340
 leave room for doubts about the 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.170
 capacity of the panda 4x4 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.140
 two on all the maximum slope 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.390
 exceedable is 70 percent while yes 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.140
 reaches a gradient of 55 percent 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.140
 lateral 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.170
 the new panda 4x4 for sale with tires 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.120
 winter even if the estimates yes 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.349
 they can choose without paying any 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.439
 surcharge 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.439
 the list starts from 16 thousand 950 e 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.230
 simultaneously on the four wheels 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.260
 fiat engines also presents the versions 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.420
 trekking and natural power the first at 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.210
 same aesthetic characterizations of the 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.400
 4x4 the same height from the ground and on 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.620
 difficult funds makes up for the lack 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.320
 of all-wheel drive with i 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.070
 maderno tires and especially with the 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.880
 craction traction system that works from 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.880
 differential to guarantee the 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.740
 optimal transfer of the couple e 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.760
 disengage in critical sections with one 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.090
 some ease 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.250
 we say that we are halfway between the 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.030
 the behavior of a basic panda is that 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.030
 of a 4x4 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:32.710
 the panda natural power is instead the 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.349
 methane version too was 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.240
 made on the platform of the 4x4 with the 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:40.209
 cylinders that do not take up space on board 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.039
 because they are placed under the floor 

00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:44.379
 the supercharged engine guarantees 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.749
 associated services 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:50.879
 autonomy on the low consumption 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:50.879
 card reaches 900 kilometers
