going to end up looking after your hive
inspection<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:23.199> certainly<00:00:23.590> isn't<00:00:24.090> clean<00:00:25.090> it's

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.449 
inspection it certainly isn't clean it's

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.390 
inspection it certainly isn't clean it's
been<00:00:25.630> lots<00:00:25.810> of<00:00:25.900> propolis<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.660> let<00:00:29.410> me<00:00:29.560> work<00:00:30.189> on

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
been lots of propolis and let me work on

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.170 
been lots of propolis and let me work on
this<00:00:30.550> focus<00:00:31.210> again<00:00:32.220> it's<00:00:33.220> an<00:00:33.339> ongoing<00:00:33.489> problem

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
this focus again it's an ongoing problem

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.850 
this focus again it's an ongoing problem
for<00:00:34.210> us<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:35.530> you<00:00:35.589> can<00:00:35.800> see<00:00:36.129> this<00:00:37.860> propolis

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
for us so you can see this propolis

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.680 
for us so you can see this propolis
everywhere<00:00:39.430> not<00:00:39.820> only<00:00:40.120> that<00:00:40.269> but<00:00:40.390> you<00:00:40.540> get

everywhere not only that but you get

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.359 
everywhere not only that but you get
your<00:00:40.809> bacteria<00:00:43.170> any<00:00:44.170> sort<00:00:44.530> of<00:00:44.559> illnesses<00:00:45.190> that

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
may exist in the in the hive and you

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.180 
may exist in the in the hive and you
share<00:00:51.010> it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
share it

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.939

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
one of the ways I like to clean my tools

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.439 
one of the ways I like to clean my tools
especially<00:00:59.379> if<00:00:59.799> it's<00:01:00.070> just<00:01:00.580> a<00:01:00.729> one-off<00:01:01.030> five

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
especially if it's just a one-off five

especially if it's just a one-off five
inspection<00:01:02.110> if<00:01:02.860> it's<00:01:03.070> many<00:01:03.610> hives<00:01:03.790> in<00:01:04.119> at<00:01:04.629> a

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
inspection if it's many hives in at a

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.730 
inspection if it's many hives in at a
time<00:01:04.900> you<00:01:05.530> would<00:01:05.619> have<00:01:05.770> a<00:01:05.799> bucket<00:01:06.299> with<00:01:07.740> with

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
time you would have a bucket with with

time you would have a bucket with with
some<00:01:08.950> bleach<00:01:09.159> and<00:01:09.579> you<00:01:10.479> would<00:01:10.600> dip<00:01:10.810> it<00:01:10.929> in<00:01:11.049> into

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
some bleach and you would dip it in into

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.429 
some bleach and you would dip it in into
that<00:01:12.250> little<00:01:12.460> container<00:01:12.869> between<00:01:13.869> each<00:01:14.140> hive

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
that little container between each hive

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.349 
that little container between each hive
yeah<00:01:15.070> but<00:01:15.429> if<00:01:15.520> you're<00:01:15.670> just<00:01:15.820> doing<00:01:15.969> one<00:01:16.210> at<00:01:16.299> a

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:16.359 
yeah but if you're just doing one at a

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:18.380 
yeah but if you're just doing one at a
time<00:01:16.570> you<00:01:17.049> know<00:01:17.079> you're<00:01:17.409> doing<00:01:17.649> so<00:01:17.950> yeah

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.630 
green power tool nuts to wax it knots
the<00:02:02.799> propolis

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.900 

allows<00:02:06.170> you<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.440> then<00:02:07.620> walk<00:02:08.130> it<00:02:08.340> down<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.789> it's

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
allows you to then walk it down and it's

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.500 
allows you to then walk it down and it's
been<00:02:09.090> 8<00:02:09.300> races<00:02:09.710> nothing<00:02:10.710> can<00:02:10.890> really<00:02:11.039> survive

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
been 8 races nothing can really survive

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:20.930 
been 8 races nothing can really survive
is<00:02:12.989> neat<00:02:13.879> so<00:02:14.879> it's<00:02:15.780> quite<00:02:15.989> safe

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.910 

say<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:22.350> don't<00:02:22.470> need<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.800> worry<00:02:22.890> about

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920

anything

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.630 

then<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.760> grab<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.420> tool<00:02:33.980> in<00:02:34.980> your<00:02:35.010> towel<00:02:35.340> and

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
then you grab the tool in your towel and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.190 
then you grab the tool in your towel and
give<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.120> quick<00:02:37.250> quick<00:02:38.250> wipe<00:02:38.760> down<00:02:38.960> you<00:02:39.960> can

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
give it a quick quick wipe down you can

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.280 
give it a quick quick wipe down you can
see<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.800> is<00:02:42.230> relatively<00:02:43.230> pristine<00:02:45.290> nice

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
see that it is relatively pristine nice

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.350 
see that it is relatively pristine nice
and<00:02:46.530> clean<00:02:48.560> ready<00:02:49.560> for<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.760> next<00:02:50.970> job<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.300> I

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
and clean ready for the next job and I

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.020 
and clean ready for the next job and I
won't<00:02:51.570> put<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:51.900> into<00:02:52.140> my<00:02:52.410> hand<00:02:52.880> because<00:02:53.880> it

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
won't put that into my hand because it

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.130 
won't put that into my hand because it
will<00:02:54.240> burn<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:55.290> will<00:02:55.500> burn<00:02:55.710> so<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:57.050> hope<00:02:58.050> you

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
will burn it will burn so I hope you

find this tip useful it is one of the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.960 
find this tip useful it is one of the
best<00:03:00.780> ways<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.020> clean<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:02.280> propolis<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.910> the

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
best ways to clean the propolis and the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.530 
best ways to clean the propolis and the
wax<00:03:03.150> off<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.540> tool<00:03:03.780> certainly<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.830> fastest

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
wax off the tool certainly the fastest

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.910 
wax off the tool certainly the fastest
