00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.390 

and<00:04:07.600> what<00:04:08.600> they<00:04:08.750> actually<00:04:08.960> say<00:04:09.620> on<00:04:09.860> the<00:04:10.010> inside

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
and what they actually say on the inside

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.300 
and what they actually say on the inside
of<00:04:10.550> the<00:04:10.670> shoe<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:12.260> was<00:04:12.320> one<00:04:12.590> of<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.800> key<00:04:13.010> things

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
of the shoe it was one of the key things

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.090 
of the shoe it was one of the key things
I<00:04:13.490> miss<00:04:13.730> because<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.570> read<00:04:15.320> what<00:04:15.620> was<00:04:15.770> inside

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
I miss because I read what was inside

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.250 
I miss because I read what was inside
the<00:04:16.850> left<00:04:17.120> shoe<00:04:17.360> and<00:04:17.630> I<00:04:17.720> thought<00:04:17.930> that<00:04:18.110> was<00:04:18.230> the

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
the left shoe and I thought that was the

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.590 
the left shoe and I thought that was the
same<00:04:18.709> thing<00:04:18.890> those<00:04:19.070> are<00:04:19.100> the<00:04:19.280> right<00:04:19.459> shoe<00:04:19.730> but

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
same thing those are the right shoe but

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.660 
same thing those are the right shoe but
it<00:04:20.930> wasn't<00:04:23.200> so<00:04:24.200> on<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.440> left<00:04:24.680> shoe<00:04:24.920> it<00:04:25.130> has

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
it wasn't so on the left shoe it has

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.930 
it wasn't so on the left shoe it has
that<00:04:26.030> same<00:04:26.660> design<00:04:27.370> on<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.490> inner<00:04:28.640> lining

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
that same design on the inner lining

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.140 
that same design on the inner lining
that's<00:04:29.390> on<00:04:29.630> this<00:04:29.870> back<00:04:30.110> part<00:04:30.410> of<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.830> shoe<00:04:31.150> and

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
that's on this back part of the shoe and

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.660 
that's on this back part of the shoe and
on<00:04:32.510> the<00:04:32.630> inside<00:04:33.080> of<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.350> left<00:04:33.650> shoe<00:04:33.950> I'm

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
on the inside of the left shoe I'm

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.340 
on the inside of the left shoe I'm
pretty<00:04:35.030> sure<00:04:35.240> you<00:04:35.390> should<00:04:35.660> be<00:04:35.690> able<00:04:35.930> to<00:04:36.110> see

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
pretty sure you should be able to see

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.760 
pretty sure you should be able to see
this

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
this

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.630 
this
it<00:04:37.280> says<00:04:37.700> stronger<00:04:38.980> with<00:04:39.980> a<00:04:40.010> nike<00:04:40.400> swoosh

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
it says stronger with a nike swoosh

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:53.480 
it says stronger with a nike swoosh
there<00:04:43.750> on<00:04:44.750> the<00:04:45.020> right<00:04:45.350> shoe

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.360 

but<00:04:54.120> well<00:04:54.419> also<00:04:55.289> you<00:04:55.410> can<00:04:55.560> see<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.800> size<00:04:56.039> tag

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
but well also you can see the size tag

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.339 
but well also you can see the size tag
in<00:04:56.550> there<00:04:56.759> anyway<00:04:57.690> though<00:04:57.900> on<00:04:58.289> the<00:04:58.470> right<00:04:58.680> shoe

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
in there anyway though on the right shoe

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.290 
in there anyway though on the right shoe
I'm<00:05:01.349> gonna<00:05:01.770> give<00:05:01.979> you<00:05:02.130> an<00:05:02.250> overhead<00:05:02.729> view<00:05:03.210> of

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
I'm gonna give you an overhead view of

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.900 
I'm gonna give you an overhead view of
these<00:05:03.539> because<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.080> probably<00:05:04.680> would<00:05:05.610> see<00:05:05.819> it

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
these because you probably would see it

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.629 
these because you probably would see it
better<00:05:06.090> when<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.449> light<00:05:06.630> is<00:05:06.810> coming<00:05:07.639> more

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
better when the light is coming more

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:14.650 
better when the light is coming more
direct<00:05:09.180> on<00:05:09.509> that<00:05:09.990> part<00:05:10.289> of<00:05:10.380> the<00:05:10.530> shoe<00:05:12.440> so

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
direct on that part of the shoe so

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.420 
direct on that part of the shoe so
that's<00:05:15.660> definitely<00:05:15.900> better<00:05:16.410> that's<00:05:16.889> an<00:05:17.069> arrow

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
that's definitely better that's an arrow

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.290 
that's definitely better that's an arrow
right<00:05:17.910> there<00:05:18.210> then<00:05:19.080> that's<00:05:19.380> an<00:05:19.530> X<00:05:19.710> in<00:05:20.099> a<00:05:20.639> chain

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
right there then that's an X in a chain

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.100 
right there then that's an X in a chain
type<00:05:21.990> design<00:05:22.440> then<00:05:23.250> there's<00:05:23.759> a<00:05:24.120> lock<00:05:24.539> and<00:05:24.900> a

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
type design then there's a lock and a

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:34.950 
type design then there's a lock and a
basketball

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.110 

so<00:05:35.960> that's<00:05:36.350> it<00:05:36.710> for<00:05:37.010> today<00:05:37.310> guys<00:05:37.520> tomorrow
