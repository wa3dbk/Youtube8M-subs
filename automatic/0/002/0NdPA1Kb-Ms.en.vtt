00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
entire globe is not up for exploration

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.530 
entire globe is not up for exploration
instead<00:01:38.159> players<00:01:38.759> must<00:01:38.909> fend<00:01:39.119> off<00:01:39.210> what<00:01:39.450> is

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
instead players must fend off what is

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.819 
instead players must fend off what is
called<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.900> melding<00:01:40.320> which<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.560> think<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:40.799> a

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
called the melding which I think it's a

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:41.960 
called the melding which I think it's a
really<00:01:40.979> interesting<00:01:41.070> mechanic<00:01:41.729> which

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
really interesting mechanic which

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.179 
really interesting mechanic which
inhibits<00:01:42.420> movement<00:01:42.899> into<00:01:43.049> certain<00:01:43.470> areas<00:01:43.710> is

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
inhibits movement into certain areas is

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.490 
inhibits movement into certain areas is
the<00:01:44.640> shadowy<00:01:45.000> vortex<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.750> energies<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.380> you

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the shadowy vortex of energies that you

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.929 
the shadowy vortex of energies that you
just<00:01:46.649> cannot<00:01:46.950> penetrate<00:01:47.250> unless<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.820> have

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
just cannot penetrate unless you have

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.899 
just cannot penetrate unless you have
certain<00:01:48.450> perquisite<00:01:48.960> seeeeee<00:01:49.110> met<00:01:49.759> you<00:01:50.759> can

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
certain perquisite seeeeee met you can

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.219 
certain perquisite seeeeee met you can
push<00:01:51.060> back<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.270> melding<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.840> do<00:01:51.899> limited

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
push back the melding and do limited

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.410 
push back the melding and do limited
time<00:01:52.380> events<00:01:52.829> such<00:01:53.040> as<00:01:53.100> raid<00:01:53.399> bosses<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.000> with

time events such as raid bosses and with

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.819 
time events such as raid bosses and with
updates<00:01:54.869> sometimes<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.409> melding<00:01:55.680> will

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
updates sometimes the melding will

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.319 
updates sometimes the melding will
actually<00:01:56.219> clear<00:01:56.460> permanently<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.090> show<00:01:57.210> off

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329

new<00:01:57.570> zones<00:01:57.869> another<00:01:58.710> nice<00:01:58.890> mechanic<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
new zones another nice mechanic to the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.310 
new zones another nice mechanic to the
gameplay<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.299> how<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.960> switch<00:02:01.110> classes

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
gameplay is how you can switch classes

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.190 
gameplay is how you can switch classes
at<00:02:01.649> pretty<00:02:02.159> much<00:02:02.219> any<00:02:02.430> time<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.420> classes<00:02:04.020> of

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
at pretty much any time the classes of

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.959 
at pretty much any time the classes of
fire<00:02:04.380> fall<00:02:04.590> are<00:02:04.799> called<00:02:05.189> battle<00:02:05.549> frames<00:02:05.790> and

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
fire fall are called battle frames and

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.550 
fire fall are called battle frames and
this<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.509> armor<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.049> player<00:02:07.229> wears

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
this is the armor that the player wears

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.050 
this is the armor that the player wears
which<00:02:07.799> determines<00:02:08.250> abilities<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.729> weapons

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
which determines abilities and weapons

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.330 
which determines abilities and weapons
as<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.780> can<00:02:09.959> expect<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.770> possibilities

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
as you can expect the possibilities

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.540 
as you can expect the possibilities
strengths<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.120> weakness

around<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.560> players<00:03:44.770> so<00:03:45.580> it<00:03:45.820> does<00:03:46.120> feel<00:03:46.450> like

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
around the players so it does feel like

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.840 
around the players so it does feel like
an<00:03:46.780> open<00:03:47.020> world<00:03:47.200> that's<00:03:47.800> what<00:03:47.920> counts<00:03:48.220> the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
an open world that's what counts the

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.610 
an open world that's what counts the
downside<00:03:49.180> is<00:03:49.420> that<00:03:49.450> there<00:03:49.989> really<00:03:50.110> isn't<00:03:50.500> a

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
downside is that there really isn't a

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.979 
downside is that there really isn't a
single<00:03:50.970> necessary<00:03:51.970> narrative<00:03:52.480> that<00:03:52.660> drives

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
single necessary narrative that drives

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.050 
single necessary narrative that drives
the<00:03:53.200> experience<00:03:53.709> like<00:03:53.950> in<00:03:54.100> Borderlands<00:03:54.670> but

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
the experience like in Borderlands but

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.729 
the experience like in Borderlands but
there<00:03:55.330> is<00:03:55.510> a<00:03:55.540> main<00:03:55.810> story<00:03:56.110> sort<00:03:56.380> of<00:03:56.410> strong

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
there is a main story sort of strong

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.020 
there is a main story sort of strong
throughout<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.070> gameplay<00:03:57.489> and<00:03:57.700> there's<00:03:57.880> even

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
throughout the gameplay and there's even

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.520 
throughout the gameplay and there's even
episodic<00:03:58.540> missions<00:03:58.930> that<00:03:59.080> players<00:03:59.320> can

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
episodic missions that players can

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.220 
episodic missions that players can
experience<00:04:00.510> but<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.600> core<00:04:01.780> firefall

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
experience but the core firefall

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.010 
experience but the core firefall
basically<00:04:02.830> is<00:04:02.980> you<00:04:03.310> jump<00:04:03.580> in<00:04:03.760> you<00:04:04.090> blast<00:04:04.690> bug

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
basically is you jump in you blast bug

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.690 
basically is you jump in you blast bug
guts<00:04:05.230> all<00:04:05.410> over<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.709> place<00:04:05.890> you<00:04:06.400> kind<00:04:06.550> of<00:04:06.580> let

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
use gliders to fly around there's even

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.300 
use gliders to fly around there's even
real-time<00:04:10.840> transportation<00:04:11.530> with<00:04:11.680> aircrafts

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
real-time transportation with aircrafts

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.620 
real-time transportation with aircrafts
and<00:04:12.340> if<00:04:12.489> you<00:04:12.550> even<00:04:12.760> have<00:04:12.820> player<00:04:13.330> controlled

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
and if you even have player controlled

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.449 
and if you even have player controlled
vehicles<00:04:14.019> which<00:04:14.200> it's<00:04:14.800> pretty<00:04:15.010> satisfying

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
vehicles which it's pretty satisfying

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.370 
vehicles which it's pretty satisfying
overall<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.299> game<00:04:16.450> feel<00:04:16.600> itself<00:04:16.930> is<00:04:17.080> worth

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
overall the game feel itself is worth

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.470 
overall the game feel itself is worth
trying<00:04:17.769> at<00:04:17.919> least<00:04:18.010> once<00:04:18.519> and<00:04:18.820> it<00:04:19.150> has<00:04:19.330> this

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
trying at least once and it has this

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.300 
trying at least once and it has this
unique<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:20.049> colorful<00:04:20.230> world<00:04:20.739> building<00:04:21.160> that

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
unique and colorful world building that

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.550 
unique and colorful world building that
I<00:04:21.340> think's<00:04:21.549> going<00:04:21.669> to<00:04:21.700> keep<00:04:21.850> players<00:04:22.090> playing

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
I think's going to keep players playing

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.550 
I think's going to keep players playing
so<00:04:24.430> what<00:04:24.850> is<00:04:24.880> endgame<00:04:25.480> what<00:04:25.870> is<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.169> worth<00:04:26.350> of

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
so what is endgame what is the worth of

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.560 
so what is endgame what is the worth of
keeping<00:04:26.980> on<00:04:27.190> well<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:27.850> don't<00:04:28.120> really<00:04:28.270> know

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
keeping on well I don't really know

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.180 
keeping on well I don't really know
necessarily<00:04:28.930> it's<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.470> first<00:04:29.680> impressions

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
necessarily it's the first impressions

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.530 
necessarily it's the first impressions
but<00:04:30.310> I<00:04:30.370> do<00:04:30.460> know<00:04:30.730> that<00:04:30.760> there<00:04:31.000> are<00:04:31.030> legendary

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
but I do know that there are legendary

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.510 
but I do know that there are legendary
monsters<00:04:32.050> to<00:04:32.139> fight<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.860> economy<00:04:33.340> seems

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
monsters to fight the economy seems

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.610 
monsters to fight the economy seems
easily<00:04:34.060> accessed<00:04:34.690> and<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.169> open-world

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
easily accessed and the open-world

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.409 
easily accessed and the open-world
gameplay<00:04:35.919> is<00:04:36.310> also<00:04:36.580> easily<00:04:36.910> access<00:04:37.270> because

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
gameplay is also easily access because

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.000 
gameplay is also easily access because
of<00:04:37.630> the<00:04:37.690> mobility<00:04:38.110> so<00:04:38.260> it's<00:04:38.410> pretty<00:04:38.560> easy<00:04:38.800> to

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
of the mobility so it's pretty easy to

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.100 
of the mobility so it's pretty easy to
go<00:04:39.250> different<00:04:39.730> places<00:04:39.760> and<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.510> level<00:04:40.810> up<00:04:40.960> i

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
go different places and to level up i

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.650 
go different places and to level up i
think<00:04:41.139> the<00:04:41.740> open<00:04:41.980> world<00:04:42.070> PvP<00:04:42.669> is<00:04:42.910> pretty<00:04:43.510> much

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
think the open world PvP is pretty much

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.000 
think the open world PvP is pretty much
a<00:04:43.720> concert<00:04:44.139> struggle<00:04:44.410> for<00:04:44.530> dominance<00:04:44.620> and

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
a concert struggle for dominance and

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.500 
a concert struggle for dominance and
resources<00:04:45.520> so<00:04:45.610> we<00:04:45.700> can<00:04:45.820> see<00:04:45.910> this<00:04:46.000> being<00:04:46.180> like

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
resources so we can see this being like

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.300 
resources so we can see this being like
a<00:04:46.780> client<00:04:47.260> specialization<00:04:47.889> kind<00:04:48.070> of<00:04:48.160> thing

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
a client specialization kind of thing

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.580 
a client specialization kind of thing
probably<00:04:48.580> not<00:04:48.820> competitive<00:04:49.570> maybe<00:04:50.139> pseudo

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
probably not competitive maybe pseudo

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.960 
probably not competitive maybe pseudo
competitive<00:04:51.160> probably<00:04:51.610> not<00:04:51.669> as<00:04:51.760> competitive

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
competitive probably not as competitive

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.940 
competitive probably not as competitive
as<00:04:52.180> planetside<00:04:52.600> 2<00:04:52.840> but<00:04:53.139> definitely<00:04:53.830> nothing

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
as planetside 2 but definitely nothing

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.710 
as planetside 2 but definitely nothing
eise<00:04:54.280> portage<00:04:54.669> but<00:04:54.850> maybe<00:04:55.000> we'll<00:04:55.180> see<00:04:55.330> arenas

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
eise portage but maybe we'll see arenas

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.930 
eise portage but maybe we'll see arenas
but<00:04:55.930> right<00:04:56.350> now<00:04:56.530> all<00:04:56.770> there<00:04:57.130> is<00:04:57.250> is<00:04:57.580> there's

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
but right now all there is is there's

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.120 
but right now all there is is there's
raid<00:04:58.389> bosses<00:04:58.660> and<00:04:59.110> pretty<00:04:59.860> much<00:04:59.919> the<00:05:00.100> whole

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
raid bosses and pretty much the whole

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.370 
raid bosses and pretty much the whole
game<00:05:00.639> is<00:05:00.880> just<00:05:01.060> focused<00:05:01.630> around<00:05:01.750> resource

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
game is just focused around resource

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.200 
game is just focused around resource
gathering<00:05:02.590> so<00:05:03.010> that's<00:05:03.370> where<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.580> PvP<00:05:03.970> comes

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
gathering so that's where the PvP comes

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.640 
gathering so that's where the PvP comes
in<00:05:04.360> that's<00:05:04.690> where<00:05:04.840> fighting<00:05:05.020> these<00:05:05.169> monsters

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
in that's where fighting these monsters

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.750 
in that's where fighting these monsters
comes<00:05:05.860> in<00:05:05.979> that's<00:05:06.100> where<00:05:06.310> pushing<00:05:06.610> back<00:05:06.729> the

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
comes in that's where pushing back the

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.520 
comes in that's where pushing back the
melding<00:05:07.150> comes<00:05:07.360> in<00:05:07.510> it's<00:05:07.870> all<00:05:08.110> about<00:05:08.320> getting

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
melding comes in it's all about getting

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.409 
melding comes in it's all about getting
to<00:05:08.919> these<00:05:09.010> different<00:05:09.310> areas<00:05:09.460> killing<00:05:10.330> these

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
to these different areas killing these

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.120 
to these different areas killing these
monsters<00:05:10.870> killing<00:05:11.229> these<00:05:11.320> people<00:05:11.380> so<00:05:12.010> that

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
monsters killing these people so that

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.860 
monsters killing these people so that
you<00:05:12.220> can<00:05:12.310> get<00:05:12.370> these<00:05:12.490> resources<00:05:13.000> in<00:05:13.419> order<00:05:13.630> to

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
you can get these resources in order to

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.930 
you can get these resources in order to
make<00:05:14.020> new<00:05:14.229> items<00:05:14.650> and<00:05:14.860> I<00:05:15.280> think<00:05:15.550> that<00:05:15.729> works

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
make new items and I think that works

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.670 
make new items and I think that works
really<00:05:16.150> well<00:05:16.300> an<00:05:16.690> MMO<00:05:17.020> that<00:05:17.169> focuses<00:05:17.590> on

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
really well an MMO that focuses on

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.530 
really well an MMO that focuses on
economy<00:05:18.190> sounds<00:05:18.669> like<00:05:18.729> eve<00:05:18.910> online<00:05:19.030> and<00:05:19.510> I

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
economy sounds like eve online and I

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.210 
economy sounds like eve online and I
think<00:05:19.750> it's<00:05:19.840> gonna<00:05:19.930> work<00:05:20.020> plus<00:05:20.680> it<00:05:20.860> has<00:05:20.979> really

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
think it's gonna work plus it has really

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.800 
think it's gonna work plus it has really
awesome<00:05:21.580> shooting<00:05:21.850> mechanics<00:05:21.970> and<00:05:22.389> the<00:05:22.419> game
