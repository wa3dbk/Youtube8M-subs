 respectively chudit into various pieces and 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.180
 in the beginning we explored some cave

 but in general could a real adventure 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.130
 but she seems to have a minus 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.669
 there are bugs which in principle are not 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:48.100
 interferes with the gameplay and it is incomplete that is 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:52.150
 it is as if done so that only here 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.620
