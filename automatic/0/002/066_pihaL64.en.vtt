00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.870

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.850
 Our country bringing you more 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.420
 dragon ball z ultimate tenkaichi now 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.609
 have become galera story mode of the new 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.740
 I already have the videos 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.689

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.740
 now between us because you're going to bet everything 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.089
 in order 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.030
 this fight bardotti versus 3 to 0 put 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:35.010
 fled in the analysis between button and it tal 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.660
 braga who went to buy the price you 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.970
 They know the story we come in 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.100
 museum team is here we are here for a RTP 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.560
 Fucking video is on average 10 minutes 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.170
 each video is personal 10 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.050
 to just over 22 depending on the day 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.430
 It depends a lot on the day, it's isolated 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.390
 Now, let's go to the wall. 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.860
 people when history does not to you 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.270
 forget to bookmark for 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.650
 prove the wine is doing the same 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.600
 willingness to help 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.150
 We warn you always to go to 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.490
 It's better for you to stay out of the team. 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:12.390
 fly that will be on a homepage 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:16.289
 on the canal there will stop the beautiful lake 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.649
 in the production of our final fitting manner 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:21.990
 and here too the story mode of the 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.369
 then you just have to go there and 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.520
 It's too late because they show 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.530
 characters were running smoothly. 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.450
 like when we were a mother in history is 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.670
 much more elastic 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.119
 with you somewhere this technique does not 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.119
 I know how it is 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:43.200
 oh I know the caracas where I will forgive 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:47.520
 You take the river and roll prison and 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:51.049
 catch just do not fucking kill him 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.049
 I started the demanding technique 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.340
 these people can not leave but just not 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.200
 can win 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.590
 I raise my tension in my head 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.179
 plays in power but he can not win 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.709
 support does not seem strange that it is 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.789
 finishing was the first video and well 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.579
 short on 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.019
 it's a fuck but that's right the first video 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.120
 detonated is short 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.220
 The cool thing is that the first track of the newspaper 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.640
 indeed it is short this fight only and is 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.690
 fucking care you put forth 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.709
 take on your ass the rumba 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.090
 old 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.360
 no matter how much you struggle yet 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.620
 popcorn on letting the bar know it will 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:36.239
 win 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:38.790
 Look this is soccer 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.690
 unfortunately did not yield to win not 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:49.260
 had like bardotti back pass dollar 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:51.299

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.709
 thousand 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.870
 but it's one thing and I hope you 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.630
 they also enjoy the tornado 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:11.459
 resident evil detonator 5 and we fight more 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:14.660
 and we are but it's just me it 's complicated 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.700
 I'll be more videos there for you guys. 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.069
 other detonated new games and also 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.660
 more light struggles of work will bring 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.910
 back to the channel but I'll wait 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.980
 give the group a break for a while 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.310
 to complete those of tornadoes and things 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.780
 so we continue 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.280
 we can because we still have this 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:37.310
 your routine and after that we started to do 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.260
 it there was bad guys by the way I 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.830
 I said that they do not depend very often 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.599
 It so happens that now we start the galley 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:50.590
 to understand and we start the gazette where 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:53.870
 radite is the first enemy is not known 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:59.170
 which when the Corinthians take the ass and 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.380
 before who makes fashion as normal only 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.010

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.590

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:12.920
 I think the goal and will only say one more thing 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.100
 I'm leaving here is not good to say so 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.280

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:23.620

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.650

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.680
 different for me - dragon ball naruto 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.410

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.970
 It is yes and other also can not really 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.479

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.479

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.880

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.680
 I leave you all now, I'm 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.810
 learning to watch the last two 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.050

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.010
 absolutely Fernando tells the story 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.280
 which is then appearing to build the 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.770
 story is going to stay for you I found 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.510
 which had already ended 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:28.430
 Strange going on that is very tense 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.080
 My new system was doing to you the 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:34.750
 little face in the corner of the screen that you 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:37.729
 You see, I find it more interesting. 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.370

 I do this, you do not want to vote for 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:50.840
 rock project in the negative because that 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.880
 very damaging the channel and gives a bit of 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.440
 work make the videos only person but 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.650
