00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: In recent years Sundance
has shifted to showing movies by more and

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.590
more recognizable talent.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.490
In its place, South by Southwest
is taking up the mantle with

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.240
the first time filmmaker and
the undiscovered star,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.305
these are the top five films
from South by Southwest 2014.

00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:18.179
&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Number five,
Before I Disappear.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.528
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: My name is Richard and
I am your uncle.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:31.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I don't care.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.585
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Our number five spot is the
featured debut of writer, director, star,

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:39.281
Shawn Christensen who has adapted
his Academy Award winning short,

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:40.790
Curfew into a feature.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.300
Like the short, Before I Disappear,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.050
tells the story of a man at rock
bottom who has his suicide interrupted

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.350
by his estranged sister who tasks him with
taking care of his niece for the evening.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.000
It's a slightly darker version of You
can Count on Me, with lots of wit and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.180
bard to their banter.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.620
Early reviews have both praised and
criticized for

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.610
relying heavily on the success
of a short and not much more.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.440
But, because that short has a Oscar I
think it's safe to call that a victory.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.847
Especially, considering how last year's,

00:01:06.847 --> 00:01:09.508
short to feature South by
Southwest premiere did.

00:01:09.508 --> 00:01:12.550
&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Next up, Faults.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.550
A largely contained psychological drama,
Faults follows a down on his luck cult

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.160
deprogramming expert as he attempts
to strip away the brainwashing of

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.270
a young woman who he has locked
himself in a hotel room with.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.740
Mary Elizabeth Winstead
stars as the girl Claire,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.920
while her husband Riley Stearns helms
his first feature as writer director.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.920
He's had previous experience directing,
though.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.010
Such as with Sundance selected
short The Cub, pictured here.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.920
And the script made last year's Blacklist,

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.850
an annual film industry list of the most
exciting but unproduced material.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.610
So it's no surprise that Faults
is something to look out for.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.820
The film finds a strange and unique tone.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.850
Toeing the line between black comedy and
serious drama.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.290
But ratchets up the tension
towards a gripping final act.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.982
&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]

00:01:55.982 --> 00:02:01.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Fort Tilden is so
awesome in that post apocalyptic way.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: At number three,
Fort Tilden.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.650
This grand jury prize winner chronicles
two girls exhausting journey to the beach

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.070
to meet up with some boys
they met the night before.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.880
On the way they encounter a number of
obstacles and talk a lot about nothing.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.170
And although the characters are entitled,
aimless and seemingly shallow,

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.810
they're never uninteresting or unlikable.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.910
I know it doesn't sound like much but
trust us,

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.620
it's a fun journey that any
audience will be glad to follow.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.550
It's exciting to see two first time
feature directors find success

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.020
In such a big way and we think that
this one will be worth looking out for

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.828
when it inevitably finds its
way on to screen near you.

00:02:34.828 --> 00:02:37.010
&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Delta Psi
has the upper hand.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Next up is Neighbors.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.830
Easily the highest profile film of South
by Southwest, right up there with Chef and

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.830
Veronica Mars.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.710
Seth Rogen and
Rose Byrn face off against Zac Efron and

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.780
Dave Franco in all out war between new
parents and their next door fraternity.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.180
The plot is okay,
the idea is nothing new and

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.270
only occasionally tackles deeper
character and fanatic moments.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.310
But, what is has going for,
is that it's [SOUND] hilarious.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.140
And look out fore Rose Byrn to
completely steal the spotlight.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.290
Surrounded by some of the funniest
actors in comedy, but

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.690
she shines brighter than them all.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: You ever felt this sort
of connection with anyone before?

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Finally at number one,
The Heart Machine.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.020
When a man begins to suspect his long
distance girlfriend of not actually being

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.450
so long distance, he goes on increasingly
invasive search for answers.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.500
More of the character piece than
an outright mystery, John Gallagher, Jr.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.810
is back at it again for another
excellent entry into South By Southwest.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.060
And if Short Term 12 is any indication,
The Heart Machine should be a big success.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.810
And Kaitlin Sheil whom you might recognize
from the newest season of House of Cards

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.360
puts in a performance to match.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.960
These two actors exemplify the kind of
genuine emotional performances we love to

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.520
see out of festivals like South By.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.540
And The Heart Machine looks to be
the exact right kind of film to carry

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.080
the torch for Short Term 12,

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.750
which is why we think it's the most
exciting film of South By Southwest.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.650
So what do you think?

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.362
Were there any great films at
South By Southwest that we left out?

00:04:03.362 --> 00:04:10.779
Did any any of these not live
up to your expectations?
