00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.840 
so be very careful and the packaging
isn't<00:03:08.910> that<00:03:09.000> cheap<00:03:09.270> with<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.510> little<00:03:09.780> pomp<00:03:10.020> and

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
and the lid clicks on properly so it's

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.310

get a little sponge tip applicator which

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.730 
get a little sponge tip applicator which
I<00:04:52.620> personally<00:04:53.100> wouldn't<00:04:53.520> use<00:04:53.700> I'd<00:04:53.880> throw<00:04:54.120> away

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
I personally wouldn't use I'd throw away

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.610 
I personally wouldn't use I'd throw away
but<00:04:55.740> I<00:04:55.770> just<00:04:56.040> wanted<00:04:56.340> a<00:04:56.610> palette<00:04:57.030> that<00:04:57.240> was<00:04:57.620> all

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
but I just wanted a palette that was all

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.450 
but I just wanted a palette that was all
mats<00:04:58.950> I<00:05:00.140> in<00:05:01.140> person<00:05:01.590> I<00:05:01.680> feel<00:05:01.860> that<00:05:01.980> these<00:05:02.160> are

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
mats I in person I feel that these are

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.040 
mats I in person I feel that these are
all<00:05:02.580> to<00:05:02.760> a<00:05:02.790> little<00:05:03.120> too<00:05:03.270> similar<00:05:03.540> and<00:05:03.810> i<00:05:03.840> don't

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
all to a little too similar and i don't

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.320 
all to a little too similar and i don't
think<00:05:04.229> i<00:05:04.350> would<00:05:04.410> use<00:05:04.710> this<00:05:05.400> end<00:05:05.700> as<00:05:05.970> much

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
think i would use this end as much

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330 
think i would use this end as much
because<00:05:06.570> they're<00:05:06.900> just<00:05:07.020> too<00:05:07.140> similar<00:05:07.650> but<00:05:08.280> i

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
because they're just too similar but i

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.740 
because they're just too similar but i
really<00:05:08.610> do<00:05:08.700> quite<00:05:08.940> like<00:05:08.970> some<00:05:09.330> of<00:05:09.419> those<00:05:09.510> at

really do quite like some of those at

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.320 
really do quite like some of those at
the<00:05:09.780> end<00:05:09.930> i<00:05:10.200> have<00:05:10.380> too<00:05:10.530> many<00:05:10.680> shimmery<00:05:11.610> kind<00:05:12.090> of

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
the end i have too many shimmery kind of

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.909 
the end i have too many shimmery kind of
shadows<00:05:12.660> and<00:05:12.690> things<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:13.290> I<00:05:13.350> like<00:05:13.590> it<00:05:13.889> that

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919
