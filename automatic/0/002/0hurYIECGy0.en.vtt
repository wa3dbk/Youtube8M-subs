so<00:05:15.180> it's<00:05:15.330> less<00:05:15.540> risky

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.680 

hmm<00:05:20.170> but<00:05:21.170> if<00:05:21.260> i<00:05:21.380> were<00:05:21.530> there<00:05:22.390> is<00:05:23.390> it<00:05:23.510> go<00:05:23.600> on

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
hmm but if i were there is it go on

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180 
be very careful with this positioning

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.240 
be very careful with this positioning
look<00:06:41.480> quite<00:06:42.320> an<00:06:42.470> angle<00:06:42.740> there<00:06:42.970> as<00:06:43.970> you<00:06:44.090> can<00:06:44.180> see

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.250 
look quite an angle there as you can see

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.100 
look quite an angle there as you can see
so<00:06:46.250> what's<00:06:46.400> he<00:06:46.490> going<00:06:46.610> to<00:06:46.670> do<00:06:46.900> just<00:06:47.900> going<00:06:48.020> to

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
so what's he going to do just going to

00:06:48.110 --> 00:07:01.450 
so what's he going to do just going to
float<00:06:48.410> it<00:06:48.590> and<00:06:48.710> try<00:06:48.920> to<00:06:48.950> hold<00:06:49.160> the<00:06:49.280> white<00:07:00.460> love
