00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.310
 somehow nicer to look at all this 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.360
 By the way this you know 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.149
 you want to car that impression 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.850

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.390
 brighter 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.600
 it's like 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:22.710

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:51.840

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.400

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:15.780
 patience is not enough and your I hear yours 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:20.070
 steps are no match if something is pinned 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:25.470
 the United States noticed at least or not I do not know 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:29.720
 even where it is, I wish I had brains 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.720
 it is now we know not wound up 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:43.440
 and what's the point threw a pancake 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:45.450
 sonar here we see you look will be 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.310
 just burn let's show one place 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.370
 so you are afraid of her kirky 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.910
 stopping obviously not releasing a fighter and generally 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:57.480
 homeland to the helicopter battle its worthy 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:01.770
 shoot blink day I wanted to show you 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:05.490
 come here the world is specially gone see 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:08.930
 now come here see see become 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:13.230
 straight behind me and start jumping 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.990
 sushi yes you have it to a fairy tale males do not 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.170
 perverts gentlemen here in principle you 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.470
 Losyash that's what your head stuck out and 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:24.960
 you shoot your own 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.420
 do you understand it so much you got out or 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.070
 things well i mean to you 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.850
 only the head already understand that too 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.590
 you can visually look at 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.470
 in short, I'm standing on a void at all 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.690
 single handle but not yet 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.800
 ok it's cool it adds 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.130
 some special game 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.360
 overall I left another call to the gong you 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.360
 give all fight again 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.550
 how do i hear 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.050
 everything is as it is left to listen to me and I 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.750
 already know I feel really know 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.860
 like a blind kitten 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:19.080
 I, too, just decree on the account you understand 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.900
 how to become this in general is a bed game 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.500
 1 daughter this match no not played tall 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.500
 Chernobyl half-life played in short those who 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.169
 played like this match will surely see 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.050
 the analogy is something you all are any level of it 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.820
 then here's the level with the bunker where constantly 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:41.430
 meat one well south all one another 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:44.900
 blow up and I feel bleeding 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:50.840
 did you sleep how do you know a 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.840
 the second day is a joke for candle 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.740
 by the way really 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:06:00.570
 By the way, yes, here's a thought, why would developers 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:03.210
 don't add a bunker card where they add 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.830
 map factory there will be even worse that is 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.310
 there will be meat there too 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.770
 closed space 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:12.880
 yes no no no no you know the essence of the bins 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.540
 it means there is no memory from the bunker in it 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.720
 button 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:19.540
 result of its turns activates shorter 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.120
 saying a timer and dropping a nuclear bomb for 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.450
 time you once alarm alarm 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.000
 SOS 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.920
 screaming before the siren all players must in this 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.500
 bunker hide otherwise we'll all perish 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.390
 and now imagine that when this siren 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.790
 It should all sound and that seems to itself 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.890
 and should try this bunker 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.260
 hide too paddock itself was cool 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:40.380
 that's specifically there well, at least 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.360
 it would be cool 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.810
 it will be necessary to find a password and find more on 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.410
 map to play on different maps 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.320
 principle can now 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:54.010
 if i have an idea let's go on 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.960
 the guns are clean not there not there well 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.770
 ok no problem i agree with you on 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:02.610
 all 100 percent 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:02.610
 come on guns come on 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:10.260
 damn me again clicks contact and us already 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:13.070
 and the subsequent part of the night gatherings you 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.070
 I understand and to
