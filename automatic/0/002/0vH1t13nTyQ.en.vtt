you<00:02:27.280> want<00:02:27.459> to<00:02:27.580> hone<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.970> blade<00:02:28.000> basically

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
you want to hone the blade basically

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.830 
you want to hone the blade basically
that's<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:29.890> rate

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.770 

for

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.140 

five<00:02:36.440> now<00:02:36.770> I<00:02:36.830> basically<00:02:37.100> do<00:02:37.520> around<00:02:37.880> five

five now I basically do around five

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.020 
five now I basically do around five
passes<00:02:38.690> do<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:38.990> on<00:02:39.709> each<00:02:39.980> side<00:02:40.250> so<00:02:40.730> what<00:02:40.910> I'll

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
passes do it on each side so what I'll

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.900 
passes do it on each side so what I'll
do<00:02:41.209> is<00:02:41.330> I'll<00:02:41.480> flip<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.840> knife<00:02:42.050> over<00:02:42.730> make<00:02:43.730> sure

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
do is I'll flip the knife over make sure

the blade you just want to keep the
angle<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.320> most<00:03:30.500> important<00:03:30.920> thing<00:03:31.040> is<00:03:31.130> to

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
angle the most important thing is to

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.040 
angle the most important thing is to
keep<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.550> angle<00:03:31.850> of<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.030> blade<00:03:32.770> like<00:03:33.770> that

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
keep the angle of the blade like that

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.100 
keep the angle of the blade like that
like<00:03:36.050> that<00:03:36.290> flip<00:03:36.830> it<00:03:37.010> over<00:03:37.660> same<00:03:38.660> thing<00:03:38.930> on<00:03:39.020> the

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
like that flip it over same thing on the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
blade and this is basically like a

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.680 
blade and this is basically like a
polishing<00:03:57.960> stone<00:03:58.410> what<00:03:58.650> we<00:03:58.770> have<00:03:58.950> here<00:03:59.340> so<00:03:59.690> wet

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
polishing stone what we have here so wet

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.580 
polishing stone what we have here so wet
that<00:04:00.900> as<00:04:01.080> well

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
that as well

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.500 
that as well
this<00:04:02.310> kind<00:04:02.520> of<00:04:02.580> polishes<00:04:03.030> up<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.270> blade<00:04:03.480> a

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
this kind of polishes up to blade a

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.260 
this kind of polishes up to blade a
little<00:04:03.840> bit<00:04:03.960> fine-tunes<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:04.710> little<00:04:04.860> bit

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
little bit fine-tunes it a little bit

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.510 
little bit fine-tunes it a little bit

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
same thing flip it over kind of polishes

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.890 
same thing flip it over kind of polishes
up<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:24.879> blade<00:04:25.120> a<00:04:25.150> little<00:04:25.509> bit<00:04:25.659> and<00:04:27.900> that's

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
up the blade a little bit and that's

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.480 
up the blade a little bit and that's
basically<00:04:29.470> it<00:04:31.500> this<00:04:32.500> is<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.680> nice<00:04:32.919> little<00:04:33.159> piece
