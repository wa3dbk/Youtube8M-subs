3x3<00:00:03.720> walkthrough<00:00:04.140> Souls<00:00:09.889> so<00:00:10.889> let's<00:00:11.070> get

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
3x3 walkthrough Souls so let's get

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.820 
3x3 walkthrough Souls so let's get
started<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.790> solve<00:00:12.269> on<00:00:12.540> white<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.230> yellow<00:00:13.380> and

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
started I solve on white and yellow and

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.740 
started I solve on white and yellow and
I'm<00:00:14.370> gonna<00:00:14.490> scramble<00:00:14.820> with<00:00:15.059> green<00:00:15.360> on<00:00:15.480> front

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
I'm gonna scramble with green on front

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.779 
I'm gonna scramble with green on front
and<00:00:15.839> wait<00:00:15.900> on<00:00:16.049> top<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.740> yeah<00:00:17.460> let's<00:00:17.670> get

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
and wait on top so yeah let's get

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.920 
and wait on top so yeah let's get
started

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:33.650 

okay<00:00:25.400> so<00:00:30.890> it<00:00:31.890> looks<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.700> I'm<00:00:32.940> gonna<00:00:33.120> solve<00:00:33.450> on

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
okay so it looks like I'm gonna solve on

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.740 
okay so it looks like I'm gonna solve on
yellow<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.340> see<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.880> piece<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.420> piece

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
yellow so I see this piece of this piece

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.750 
yellow so I see this piece of this piece
this<00:00:37.620> piece<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.969> piece<00:00:39.920> so<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.460> think

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
this piece and this piece so I think

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.869 
this piece and this piece so I think
we're<00:00:41.910> gonna<00:00:42.000> go<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.809> first<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.879> then

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
we're gonna go like that first and then

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.549 
we're gonna go like that first and then
put<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:45.780> green<00:00:46.110> piece<00:00:46.350> up<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:48.140> do<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.170> D<00:00:49.530> to

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
put this green piece up and do it D to

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.069 
put this green piece up and do it D to
our<00:00:50.520> prime<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.539> put<00:00:51.719> these<00:00:51.840> three

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
our prime so that we put these three

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.250 
our prime so that we put these three
pieces<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.699> then<00:00:53.699> rotate<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.510> then<00:00:54.840> put<00:00:55.140> this

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
pieces in then rotate and then put this

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.959 
pieces in then rotate and then put this
last<00:00:55.469> piece<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:57.410> I<00:00:58.410> think<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.550> would<00:00:59.789> see

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
last piece in I think I you would see

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.549 
last piece in I think I you would see
this<00:01:00.090> pair<00:01:00.329> first<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.899> would<00:01:01.140> take<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.440> out

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
this pair first so I would take it out

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.219 
this pair first so I would take it out
and<00:01:02.719> then<00:01:03.719> put<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.630> would<00:01:06.630> see<00:01:06.840> probably

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
and then put it in I would see probably

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.940 
and then put it in I would see probably
this<00:01:07.439> pair<00:01:07.680> next<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:08.909> insert<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.950> then

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
this pair next and just insert it then

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:23.030 
this pair next and just insert it then
this<00:01:14.720> and<00:01:16.130> then<00:01:17.130> rotate<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:18.210> last<00:01:18.479> pair<00:01:22.040> then

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
this and then rotate this last pair then

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:39.550 
this and then rotate this last pair then
oh<00:01:23.280> hello<00:01:25.070> jeepers<00:01:29.600> alright<00:01:30.600> next<00:01:30.750> couple

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:48.219 

okay<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:44.659> this<00:01:45.659> looks<00:01:45.720> like<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> good<00:01:46.320> way<00:01:46.500> cross

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
okay so this looks like a good way cross

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.260 
okay so this looks like a good way cross
so<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.619> see<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:49.950> piece<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.640> piece<00:01:50.700> this

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
so I see this piece this piece this

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.649 
so I see this piece this piece this
piece<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.780> piece<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:53.520> would<00:01:54.270> go<00:01:54.420> like

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
piece in this piece and I would go like

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.539 
piece in this piece and I would go like
that<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:56.549> insert<00:01:56.880> these<00:01:57.090> two<00:01:57.500> then<00:01:58.500> do<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.009> d2

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
that to insert these two then do a d2

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.810 
that to insert these two then do a d2
and<00:01:59.990> then<00:02:01.009> because<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.130> want<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.310> preserve<00:02:02.549> this

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
and then because I want to preserve this

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.510 
and then because I want to preserve this
parried<00:02:03.180> here<00:02:03.479> mm-hmm<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.409> want<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.009> do<00:02:05.159> instead

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
parried here mm-hmm I want to do instead

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.850 
parried here mm-hmm I want to do instead
of<00:02:05.610> going<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.509> would<00:02:07.439> insert<00:02:07.740> it

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
of going like that I would insert it

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.050 
of going like that I would insert it
from<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.129> side<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:08.789> that

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
from this side like that

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.890 
from this side like that
and<00:02:09.300> then<00:02:10.020> rotate<00:02:10.470> insert<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.520> pair<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.720> then

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
and then rotate insert the pair and then

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.710 
and then rotate insert the pair and then
see

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
see

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.850 
see
-<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.780> I'm<00:02:16.930> gonna<00:02:17.050> do<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.260> little<00:02:17.410> bit<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.680> end

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
- and I'm gonna do a little bit of end

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.100 
- and I'm gonna do a little bit of end
control<00:02:18.280> here<00:02:18.550> instead<00:02:19.210> of<00:02:19.270> more<00:02:19.510> like<00:02:19.630> that<00:02:19.810> I

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
control here instead of more like that I

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.540 
control here instead of more like that I
know<00:02:20.320> I'm<00:02:20.470> gonna<00:02:20.560> get<00:02:20.740> a<00:02:20.800> battle<00:02:21.160> out<00:02:21.340> like

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
know I'm gonna get a battle out like

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.340 
know I'm gonna get a battle out like
that<00:02:21.730> because<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.360> can<00:02:22.510> just<00:02:22.690> see<00:02:22.960> it<00:02:22.990> there's

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
that because I can just see it there's

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.230 
that because I can just see it there's
only<00:02:23.440> one<00:02:23.740> edge<00:02:23.920> or<00:02:24.190> itould<00:02:24.760> right<00:02:24.910> now<00:02:25.030> and

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
only one edge or itould right now and

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.630 
only one edge or itould right now and
that<00:02:25.330> can<00:02:25.450> possibly<00:02:25.630> be<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:26.050> dot<00:02:26.770> case<00:02:27.040> so<00:02:27.310> just

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
that can possibly be a dot case so just

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.230 
that can possibly be a dot case so just
in<00:02:27.760> case<00:02:27.940> I'm<00:02:28.210> gonna<00:02:28.390> do<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.080> sledgehammer<00:02:30.240> so

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
in case I'm gonna do a sledgehammer so

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.850 
in case I'm gonna do a sledgehammer so
and<00:02:31.360> then<00:02:31.480> rotate<00:02:32.040> then<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.100> see<00:02:33.310> this<00:02:33.460> pair<00:02:34.860> and

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
and then rotate then I see this pair and

00:02:35.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
and then rotate then I see this pair and
then<00:02:36.820> this<00:02:37.090> pair<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.700> then<00:02:57.660> so<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:05.610> think<00:03:06.610> we're

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
then this pair and then so I think we're

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.810 
then this pair and then so I think we're
gonna<00:03:06.970> go<00:03:07.150> for<00:03:07.360> white<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:08.920> see<00:03:09.280> this<00:03:09.459> this

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
gonna go for white so I see this this

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.550 
gonna go for white so I see this this
this<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.720> this<00:03:11.590> so<00:03:12.780> I'm<00:03:13.780> gonna<00:03:13.930> insert<00:03:14.410> this

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
this and this so I'm gonna insert this

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.490 
this and this so I'm gonna insert this
red<00:03:14.770> piece<00:03:14.950> here<00:03:15.420> then<00:03:16.420> do<00:03:16.690> a<00:03:16.720> D<00:03:16.959> Prime<00:03:17.260> and

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
red piece here then do a D Prime and

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.740 
red piece here then do a D Prime and
then<00:03:17.950> put<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:18.340> piece<00:03:18.580> here's<00:03:18.820> another<00:03:19.150> there

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
then put this piece here's another there

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.840 
then put this piece here's another there
are<00:03:19.840> now<00:03:19.989> opposites<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.769> then<00:03:20.920> this<00:03:21.550> green

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
are now opposites and then this green

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.960 
are now opposites and then this green
usually<00:03:22.510> goes<00:03:22.660> like<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:23.160> then<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:24.190> D<00:03:24.430> -<00:03:24.459> and

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
usually goes like that then a D - and

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.580 
usually goes like that then a D - and
obviously<00:03:25.690> first<00:03:26.019> thing<00:03:26.170> I<00:03:26.230> see<00:03:26.410> is<00:03:26.500> this<00:03:26.650> pair

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
obviously first thing I see is this pair

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:38.970 
obviously first thing I see is this pair
and<00:03:29.590> then<00:03:30.160> this<00:03:30.610> pair<00:03:33.570> then<00:03:34.570> this<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:37.980> then

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
and then this pair then this and then

00:03:38.980 --> 00:04:05.399 
and then this pair then this and then
this<00:03:39.040> pair<00:03:43.530> now<00:03:44.530> although<00:03:46.860> t<00:03:47.860> from

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.009 

okay<00:04:06.409> so<00:04:06.469> I<00:04:07.219> would<00:04:08.030> go<00:04:08.150> for<00:04:08.299> white<00:04:08.540> but<00:04:08.780> I<00:04:08.840> would

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
okay so I would go for white but I would

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.449 
okay so I would go for white but I would
put<00:04:09.109> the<00:04:09.290> white<00:04:09.439> Center<00:04:09.739> on<00:04:09.829> top<00:04:10.040> because<00:04:10.220> I'm

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
put the white Center on top because I'm

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.349 
put the white Center on top because I'm
gonna<00:04:10.549> do<00:04:10.760> an<00:04:10.849> m2<00:04:11.379> so<00:04:12.379> I<00:04:12.769> see<00:04:13.129> this<00:04:13.400> this<00:04:13.760> this

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
gonna do an m2 so I see this this this

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:19.270 
gonna do an m2 so I see this this this
and<00:04:14.629> this<00:04:15.109> so<00:04:15.409> I<00:04:16.280> do<00:04:16.459> our<00:04:17.180> prime<00:04:17.780> F<00:04:18.440> Prime<00:04:18.859> and

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
and this so I do our prime F Prime and

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.600 
and this so I do our prime F Prime and
then<00:04:19.880> I<00:04:19.910> do<00:04:20.030> an<00:04:20.180> m2<00:04:20.859> because<00:04:21.859> these<00:04:22.160> two<00:04:22.430> pieces

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
then I do an m2 because these two pieces

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.210 
then I do an m2 because these two pieces
are<00:04:23.440> so<00:04:24.440> that<00:04:24.560> I<00:04:24.590> can<00:04:24.770> put<00:04:24.919> these<00:04:25.039> two<00:04:25.190> pieces

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
are so that I can put these two pieces

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.930 
are so that I can put these two pieces
together<00:04:25.599> then<00:04:26.599> I<00:04:26.720> do<00:04:26.900> it<00:04:27.020> you<00:04:27.199> and<00:04:27.639> then<00:04:28.639> I<00:04:28.789> see

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
together then I do it you and then I see

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.499 
together then I do it you and then I see
this<00:04:29.120> pair<00:04:29.389> and<00:04:29.630> I<00:04:29.660> also<00:04:29.810> I<00:04:29.960> saw<00:04:30.139> that<00:04:30.320> pair<00:04:30.620> so

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
this pair and I also I saw that pair so

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.700 
this pair and I also I saw that pair so
insert<00:04:32.509> that<00:04:32.720> and<00:04:33.020> I'm<00:04:33.080> gonna<00:04:33.229> go<00:04:33.349> for<00:04:33.560> this

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
insert that and I'm gonna go for this

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:41.010 
insert that and I'm gonna go for this
pair<00:04:33.889> first<00:04:34.160> so<00:04:36.849> and<00:04:37.849> then<00:04:38.030> I<00:04:38.120> do<00:04:38.180> this<00:04:38.360> pair

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.029 

and<00:04:42.020> rotate<00:04:42.680> this<00:04:43.190> pair<00:04:44.470> and<00:04:45.470> then<00:04:45.620> finally

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
and rotate this pair and then finally

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:57.399 
and rotate this pair and then finally
this<00:04:46.430> pair<00:04:49.030> then<00:04:50.030> Olo<00:04:51.160> and<00:04:52.780> you<00:04:53.780> perm<00:04:56.409> last

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:57.409 
this pair then Olo and you perm last

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:10.450 
this pair then Olo and you perm last
scramble<00:05:04.449> okay<00:05:05.449> so<00:05:08.590> this<00:05:09.590> isn't<00:05:09.949> too<00:05:10.039> bad

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
scramble okay so this isn't too bad

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.879 
scramble okay so this isn't too bad
I'm<00:05:10.940> gonna<00:05:11.060> go<00:05:11.180> for<00:05:11.360> yellow<00:05:11.539> so<00:05:11.990> I<00:05:12.289> see<00:05:12.710> this

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
I'm gonna go for yellow so I see this

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.189 
I'm gonna go for yellow so I see this
this<00:05:13.220> this<00:05:13.610> and<00:05:13.669> this<00:05:14.150> this<00:05:14.449> is<00:05:14.900> already<00:05:15.050> in

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
this this and this this is already in

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.990 
this this and this this is already in
place<00:05:15.380> and<00:05:15.770> this<00:05:16.280> is<00:05:16.430> one<00:05:16.639> move<00:05:16.820> away<00:05:16.940> from

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
place and this is one move away from

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.270 
place and this is one move away from
being<00:05:17.360> in<00:05:17.449> place<00:05:17.710> so<00:05:18.710> I'm<00:05:18.830> gonna<00:05:19.010> go<00:05:19.130> like<00:05:19.250> that

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
being in place so I'm gonna go like that

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.820 
being in place so I'm gonna go like that
and<00:05:19.699> then<00:05:19.940> I<00:05:20.510> see<00:05:20.720> this<00:05:20.840> pair<00:05:21.110> so<00:05:21.440> I'm<00:05:21.680> gonna

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
and then I see this pair so I'm gonna

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.629 
and then I see this pair so I'm gonna
move<00:05:22.010> it<00:05:22.130> that<00:05:22.280> way<00:05:22.840> down<00:05:24.039> put<00:05:25.039> that<00:05:25.070> piece<00:05:25.430> in

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
move it that way down put that piece in

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.790 
move it that way down put that piece in
and<00:05:25.880> something<00:05:26.479> like<00:05:26.659> that<00:05:26.900> and<00:05:27.169> then<00:05:27.560> going

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
and something like that and then going

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.680 
and something like that and then going
to<00:05:27.830> that<00:05:28.010> that's<00:05:28.190> gonna<00:05:28.310> ruin<00:05:28.460> the<00:05:28.610> pair<00:05:28.820> so

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
to that that's gonna ruin the pair so

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.760 
to that that's gonna ruin the pair so
I'm<00:05:29.870> gonna<00:05:30.080> go<00:05:30.260> you<00:05:30.949> our<00:05:31.580> prime<00:05:31.880> D<00:05:32.210> prime<00:05:32.479> and

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
I'm gonna go you our prime D prime and

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.060 
I'm gonna go you our prime D prime and
then<00:05:33.789> you<00:05:34.789> actually<00:05:35.690> know<00:05:35.960> I<00:05:36.199> would<00:05:36.919> do<00:05:37.039> a

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
then you actually know I would do a

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.760 
then you actually know I would do a
sledgehammer<00:05:37.400> because<00:05:38.210> I<00:05:38.479> see<00:05:38.750> that<00:05:38.930> there's

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
sledgehammer because I see that there's

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.620 
sledgehammer because I see that there's
no<00:05:39.979> edges<00:05:40.310> oriented<00:05:40.820> here<00:05:41.000> so<00:05:41.270> I<00:05:41.300> just<00:05:41.360> do<00:05:41.599> a

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
no edges oriented here so I just do a

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.420 
no edges oriented here so I just do a
sledge<00:05:41.900> just<00:05:42.470> to<00:05:42.560> orient<00:05:42.710> this<00:05:42.889> edge<00:05:45.010> so<00:05:46.010> I'm

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
sledge just to orient this edge so I'm

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:52.060 
sledge just to orient this edge so I'm
gonna<00:05:46.639> insert<00:05:47.300> this<00:05:48.490> and<00:05:50.080> then<00:05:51.080> probably<00:05:51.620> this

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
gonna insert this and then probably this

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:59.050 
gonna insert this and then probably this
pair<00:05:55.120> in<00:05:56.120> this<00:05:56.300> last<00:05:56.570> pair

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:06.980 

and<00:06:00.230> hello<00:06:02.420> sleep<00:06:03.420> them<00:06:05.450> alright<00:06:06.450> guys<00:06:06.630> thanks
