now<00:00:00.539> we<00:00:00.659> have<00:00:00.780> the<00:00:00.900> basic<00:00:01.260> shape<00:00:01.439> of<00:00:01.560> our

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
now we have the basic shape of our

spider-man's mask are not open despite

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.859 
spider-man's mask are not open despite
the<00:00:16.109> fact<00:00:16.289> we've<00:00:16.470> actually<00:00:17.420> captured<00:00:18.420> these

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
the fact we've actually captured these

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.710 
the fact we've actually captured these
with<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.260> lines<00:00:19.880> drawing<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.180> superhero<00:00:21.630> it

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
with the lines drawing a superhero it

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.840 
with the lines drawing a superhero it
was<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.840> lot<00:00:21.960> more<00:00:21.990> than<00:00:22.170> just<00:00:22.760> replicating<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
was a lot more than just replicating the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.500 
was a lot more than just replicating the
lines<00:00:24.560> it's<00:00:25.560> also<00:00:25.769> drawing<00:00:26.220> things<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:26.910> this

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
lines it's also drawing things in this

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.689 
lines it's also drawing things in this
isn't<00:00:27.840> about<00:00:27.990> as<00:00:28.080> much<00:00:28.289> about<00:00:28.500> color<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.160> about

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
isn't about as much about color is about

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.759 
isn't about as much about color is about
shape<00:00:30.060> see<00:00:30.869> actually<00:00:31.170> once<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.439> draw<00:00:31.619> these

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
shape see actually once you draw these

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.709 
shape see actually once you draw these
in<00:00:31.830> battles<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.669> lot<00:00:32.820> more<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.210> spider-man's

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
in battles a lot more like spider-man's

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.270 
in battles a lot more like spider-man's
mask<00:00:33.840> now<00:00:34.649> there's<00:00:34.800> going<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.950> be<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.070> whole

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
mask now there's going to be a whole

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.770 
mask now there's going to be a whole
bunch<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.550> additional<00:00:35.910> like<00:00:36.030> shading<00:00:36.570> and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
bunch of additional like shading and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.180 
bunch of additional like shading and
contrast<00:00:37.290> we're<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.620> start<00:00:37.800> adding<00:00:37.920> in

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
contrast we're going to start adding in

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.549 
contrast we're going to start adding in
here<00:00:38.629> areas<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.690> basically<00:00:39.930> show<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
here areas to basically show that the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.750 
here areas to basically show that the
spider-man<00:00:41.070> here<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.430> know<00:00:41.520> kind<00:00:41.730> of

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
spider-man here is you know kind of

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.420 
spider-man here is you know kind of
backlit<00:00:42.300> around<00:00:42.570> his<00:00:42.719> head<00:00:43.250> there's<00:00:44.250> also

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
backlit around his head there's also

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.069 
backlit around his head there's also
going<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.670> be<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:45.030> shading<00:00:45.450> down<00:00:45.600> here<00:00:45.870> along

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
going to be like shading down here along

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.740 
going to be like shading down here along
the<00:00:46.230> arms<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.980> basically<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.910> way<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.030> can

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the arms and basically the way you can

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.650 
the arms and basically the way you can
create<00:00:48.899> shading<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.969> by<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.000> mean<00:00:51.180> simply<00:00:51.539> kind

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
create shading is by I mean simply kind

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.090 
create shading is by I mean simply kind
of<00:00:51.780> dragging<00:00:52.079> your<00:00:52.170> pencil<00:00:52.530> along<00:00:52.590> there<00:00:52.890> kind

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
of scruffing it back and forth a little

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.060 
of scruffing it back and forth a little
bit<00:00:55.879> and<00:00:57.230> then<00:00:58.230> basically<00:00:58.559> then<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:58.920> and

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
bit and then basically then up and

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.319 
bit and then basically then up and
around<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.340> side<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.730> arms<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.059> mean<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> lot

around the side of the arms I mean a lot

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.910 
around the side of the arms I mean a lot
of<00:01:00.359> times<00:01:00.510> like<00:01:00.660> around<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.020> around<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.530> side

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
of times like around the around the side

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.500 
of times like around the around the side
of<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.100> arms<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> legs<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.270> gonna<00:01:03.359> be

of the arms and the legs it's gonna be
like<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> primary<00:01:04.049> area<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.439> shading<00:01:04.830> is

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
like the primary area of shading is

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.859 
like the primary area of shading is
things<00:01:05.159> come<00:01:05.339> out<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:06.420> you're<00:01:06.540> also<00:01:06.659> going<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.999 
please look at the legs those look
pretty<00:01:44.579> blank<00:01:45.380> but<00:01:46.380> by<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.590> time<00:01:46.829> we're

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
pretty blank but by the time we're

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.039 
pretty blank but by the time we're
actually<00:01:47.159> done<00:01:47.490> with<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.700> shading<00:01:48.049> they're

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
actually done with the shading they're

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.060 
actually done with the shading they're
gonna<00:01:49.140> look<00:01:49.439> much<00:01:49.979> more<00:01:50.340> interesting<00:01:51.829> as<00:01:52.829> we

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
gonna look much more interesting as we

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.010 
gonna look much more interesting as we
get<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> kneecap<00:01:53.939> features<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.630> here

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
get like the kneecap features in here

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.969 
get like the kneecap features in here
the<00:01:55.590> top<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.159> calf<00:01:56.399> muscles<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:58.560> outside

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
the top of the calf muscles the outside

the top of the calf muscles the outside
of<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.219> shin<00:01:59.579> and<00:02:00.320> don't<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.560> think<00:02:01.710> these

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
of the shin and don't just think these

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.709 
of the shin and don't just think these
things<00:02:01.979> are<00:02:02.130> going<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.310> stop<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.820> like<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.479> terms

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
things are going to stop I like in terms

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.270 
things are going to stop I like in terms
like<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.020> blank<00:02:04.229> area<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.590> costume<00:02:05.070> know

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
like the blank area of the costume know

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.560 
like the blank area of the costume know
these<00:02:05.490> are<00:02:05.610> all<00:02:05.729> these<00:02:05.969> are<00:02:06.060> going<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.240> go<00:02:06.360> over

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
these are all these are going to go over

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.080 
these are all these are going to go over
all<00:02:06.869> pieces<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.409> costume<00:02:07.920> for<00:02:08.580> example

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
all pieces of the costume for example

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.270 
all pieces of the costume for example
back<00:02:09.300> up<00:02:09.479> here<00:02:09.660> near<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.899> spider<00:02:10.229> we're<00:02:11.160> gonna

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
back up here near the spider we're gonna

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.000 
back up here near the spider we're gonna
have<00:02:11.489> like<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.819> other

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
have like the other

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.820 

main<00:02:15.010> breast<00:02:15.370> muscles<00:02:16.110> come<00:02:17.110> up<00:02:17.260> here<00:02:17.650> and

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
main breast muscles come up here and

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.900 
main breast muscles come up here and
shading<00:02:18.760> here<00:02:19.890> on<00:02:20.890> both<00:02:21.400> sides<00:02:21.700> of<00:02:21.850> the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
shading here on both sides of the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.790 
shading here on both sides of the
costume<00:02:22.360> there's<00:02:23.020> also<00:02:23.170> going<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.410> be<00:02:23.560> some

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
costume there's also going to be some

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.440 
costume there's also going to be some
shading<00:02:24.100> we'll<00:02:24.310> put<00:02:24.490> in<00:02:24.580> here<00:02:24.940> because

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
shading we'll put in here because

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.290 
shading we'll put in here because
spider-man's<00:02:26.170> head<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:27.550> right<00:02:27.820> over<00:02:28.000> here<00:02:28.270> I

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
spider-man's head is right over here I

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.520 
spider-man's head is right over here I
mean<00:02:28.480> it's<00:02:28.600> important<00:02:29.020> to<00:02:29.080> really<00:02:29.230> think<00:02:29.470> of

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
mean it's important to really think of

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.750 
mean it's important to really think of
where<00:02:29.650> your<00:02:29.770> light<00:02:29.980> source<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.400> coming<00:02:30.580> from

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
where your light source is coming from

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.170 
where your light source is coming from
in<00:02:31.330> this<00:02:32.170> case<00:02:32.470> our<00:02:32.800> light<00:02:33.550> source<00:02:33.790> is<00:02:33.910> kind<00:02:34.120> of

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
in this case our light source is kind of

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.110 
in this case our light source is kind of
right<00:02:34.360> about<00:02:34.480> here<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.230> shining<00:02:36.070> out<00:02:36.280> onto

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
right about here and shining out onto

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.520 
right about here and shining out onto
the<00:02:37.240> drawing<00:02:37.630> which<00:02:37.780> means<00:02:38.020> his<00:02:38.290> head's

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
the drawing which means his head's

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.020 
the drawing which means his head's
closer<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.160> us<00:02:39.310> which<00:02:39.460> means<00:02:39.670> there<00:02:39.790> should<00:02:39.940> be

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
closer to us which means there should be

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.600 
closer to us which means there should be
a<00:02:40.060> shadow<00:02:40.390> cast<00:02:40.750> from<00:02:41.140> it<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:42.340> we're<00:02:42.460> going<00:02:42.550> to

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
a shadow cast from it so we're going to

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.460 
a shadow cast from it so we're going to
continue<00:02:42.880> with<00:02:43.090> these<00:02:43.240> shading<00:02:43.720> effects

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
continue with these shading effects

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.760 
continue with these shading effects
until<00:02:44.770> spider-man's<00:02:45.730> all<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.150> way<00:02:46.240> shaded

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
until spider-man's all the way shaded

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.200 
until spider-man's all the way shaded
and<00:02:47.770> we<00:02:47.890> have<00:02:48.040> all<00:02:48.250> of<00:02:48.280> our<00:02:48.520> lighting<00:02:48.910> effects

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
and we have all of our lighting effects

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.980 
and we have all of our lighting effects
in<00:02:49.450> here<00:02:51.840> before<00:02:52.840> moving<00:02:53.230> on<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.590> inking
