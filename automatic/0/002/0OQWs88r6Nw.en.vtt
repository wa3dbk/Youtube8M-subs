00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
analyst here we go PS United stronger

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.650 
analyst here we go PS United stronger
team<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:55.949> gonna<00:00:56.129> be<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.340> tougher<00:00:56.640> team<00:00:57.000> but

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
team this is gonna be a tougher team but

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.420 
team this is gonna be a tougher team but
he's<00:00:57.750> only<00:00:57.899> got<00:00:58.079> 80<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:58.649> chemistry<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.309> we

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
he's only got 80 for chemistry so we

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.830 
he's only got 80 for chemistry so we
could<00:00:59.640> take<00:00:59.789> advantage<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.270> if<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.600> want<00:01:00.780> to

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
could take advantage that if we want to

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.299 
could take advantage that if we want to
but<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.410> think<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:01.649> will<00:01:01.770> take<00:01:01.980> advantage<00:01:02.250> of

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
but I think we will take advantage of

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.860 
but I think we will take advantage of
that<00:01:02.370> one<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.640> talk<00:01:02.789> about<00:01:02.910> what's<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:03.600> can<00:01:03.719> do
