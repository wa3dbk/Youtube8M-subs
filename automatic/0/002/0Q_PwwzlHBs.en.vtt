00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:09.420
 opa 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:11.870
 How are you? I'm zebra if you 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.350
 now it's on my channel 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.350
 welcome 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.099
 is this what I'll show 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.689
 you here is now the basic principle with 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.869
 the installation of a washing machine 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.270
 dishwasher independent of the model and 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.820
 basic principle for all if it's you 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.820
 Who's going to install your machine comes with me? 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:45.030
 In this video I'll try to show you 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.500
 is how to install a machine 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.720
 dishwasher 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.640
 you first have to buy one 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.520
 faucet having two outlets 721 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.160
 register is to open the water of the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.440
 faucet and another record that is this 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.210
 And she said she's going to take water. 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.070
 for the washing machine 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.799
 you can not install the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.970
 machine without a faucet with two 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.990
 records 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.050
 there are other options where registration 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.570
 the tap is under the sink 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.260
 mine stays on top but he does not run away 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.530
 much to this model 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.810
 the only thing is that the faucet will come off 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.780
 of the sink faucet will come out of a hole 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.650
 here in the sink that comes in a barrel 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.970
 sink and also there has an exit record 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.640
 to the faucet 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:45.869
 ok another important thing for 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:50.490
 to observe is that here under the sink came out 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:53.000
 some sewage flowing down to the box 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.000
 ground 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:02.159
 so this piece here it has two outputs 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.840
 and was usually an exit're only 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.459
 it was for the sewer that was in the pipe 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.730
 that this was done the installation of 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.280
 washing machines in the kitchen ok because 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:20.340
 if it can be noticed that it has two outputs 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:23.159
 looks like a y né and where coupled to the exit 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.060
 dirty water from the washing machine that 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:29.860
 this gray pipe 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.890
 it is certain that it enters the pipe and 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.090
 installation in the washing machine is a 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.500
 very simple thing behind the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.730
 Washing machine 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.040
 We already have the outlet 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.560
 water that is installed at the factory 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.150
 so here you are there at the exit of the 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.360
 sewage on the wall 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.830
 is a well-ful population where 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:01.390
 you will not find it difficult 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:03.130
 no star since I needed 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.310
 buy a larger hose 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.680
 the idea of water to see how much it was 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.170
 it's only you in a house 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.170
 specialized company where it sells 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.049
 products and washing machines and asked for a 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:21.700
 bigger this one that if I am not mistaken she has 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:24.940
 approximately four meters that today 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.410
 connected to the faucet on the outlet 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.360
 Water 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.079
 you can also notice that this 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:35.109
 model elieés 19 x da electrolux 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:39.280
 it comes with the regulation system of 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:43.870
 height that makes it easy to put under 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.090
 the sink it can go down or up 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.620
 depending on the height of your sink and this 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.230
 made it much easier for me not to 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.019
 I needed to make a furniture to fit there 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.420
 or disassemble and get my sink 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.760
 place already walked very important that 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.900
 you notice that the maximum height and 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.150
 minimum of washing machine 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.620
 fit under the sink since this model 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.290
 You can not put it on top it 's too much. 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.000
 large and is very high and appears as 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.290
 a mini fridge 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.019
 I'm going to show you the machine, no. 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.090
 I'll show you yours now it 's mine. 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.650
 washing machine where she stayed 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.650
 she stood a position 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.210
 has built-in under the sink was like me 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.130
 I told you, does she have these? 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.979
 adjustable feet 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.729
 then it was well yields here in my 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:43.960
 daughter is okay, no problem 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:45.580
 there installation of her I did not want to do 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.569
 adaptation but you may be doing 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:54.630
 adaptation by sticking to the 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:05:00.699
 that if this pipe is not apparent 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:02.020
 you can leave right away in the 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:06.699
 fia right 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.870
 instead of ascending to leave all back 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.509
 up the sink 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.409
 He can come down here, you can. 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:17.560
 drill a hole down here 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:21.039
 the adaptation did not want to think it was not 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:25.620
 necessary for me so she got very 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.620
 well said 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:34.840
