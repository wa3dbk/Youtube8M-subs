so<00:02:39.360> take<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.540> look<00:02:39.629> at<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.780> motherboard

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
so take a look at the motherboard

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.869 
so take a look at the motherboard
there's<00:02:40.319> your<00:02:40.470> graphics<00:02:40.830> card<00:02:40.860> there<00:02:41.190> the

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
there's your graphics card there the

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.229 
there's your graphics card there the
core<00:02:42.090> i7<00:02:42.780> 870<00:02:43.379> with<00:02:43.620> specting<00:02:44.069> at<00:02:44.190> 2.9<00:02:44.760> three

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
imagine i added on a macbook with a core

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.289 
imagine i added on a macbook with a core
two<00:02:51.209> duo<00:02:51.420> 2.4<00:02:51.989> gigahertz<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.340> i7<00:02:54.000> with<00:02:54.209> the

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
and here as you can see there's the RAM

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.720 
and here as you can see there's the RAM
you<00:02:58.530> still<00:02:58.709> got<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.890> same<00:02:59.040> hard<00:02:59.280> drive<00:02:59.459> same

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
you still got the same hard drive same

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.860 
you still got the same hard drive same
burner<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.269> you<00:03:00.510> actually<00:03:00.599> have<00:03:00.810> an

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
burner and you actually have an

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.020 
burner and you actually have an
aftermarket<00:03:01.230> cpu<00:03:01.739> cooler<00:03:02.010> which<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.790> going<00:03:02.940> to

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
aftermarket cpu cooler which is going to

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.250 
aftermarket cpu cooler which is going to
keep<00:03:03.150> your<00:03:03.239> machine<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.540> lot<00:03:03.810> cooler<00:03:04.019> if<00:03:04.110> you

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
keep your machine a lot cooler if you

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.839 
keep your machine a lot cooler if you
are<00:03:04.500> running<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.890> i7<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:05.519> that's<00:03:05.670> going<00:03:05.760> to

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
are running the i7 so that's going to

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.430 
are running the i7 so that's going to
get<00:03:05.910> pretty<00:03:06.090> hot<00:03:06.269> and<00:03:06.599> especially<00:03:07.140> if<00:03:07.379> you

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
get pretty hot and especially if you

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.619 
get pretty hot and especially if you
decide<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.860> overclock<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.549> you<00:03:09.329> have<00:03:09.480> the

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
decide to overclock and you have the

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.660 
decide to overclock and you have the
cool<00:03:09.870> master<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.500> ATX<00:03:10.920> case<00:03:11.190> which<00:03:11.430> is<00:03:11.549> an

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
cool master to ATX case which is an

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.210 
cool master to ATX case which is an
awesome<00:03:12.150> case<00:03:12.470> completely<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.829> list<00:03:14.069> so<00:03:14.190> you

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
awesome case completely to list so you

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.710 
awesome case completely to list so you
can<00:03:14.549> actually<00:03:14.760> just<00:03:15.060> install<00:03:15.360> hard<00:03:15.540> drives

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
can actually just install hard drives

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.750 
can actually just install hard drives
and<00:03:15.840> all<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:15.989> stuff<00:03:16.110> no<00:03:17.040> need<00:03:17.250> for<00:03:17.430> any<00:03:17.579> types

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
and all that stuff no need for any types

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.370 
and all that stuff no need for any types
of<00:03:17.850> tools<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.329> then<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:18.810> have<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:18.959> corsair

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
of tools and then you have the corsair

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.229 
of tools and then you have the corsair
power<00:03:19.920> supply<00:03:20.220> which<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.489> nice<00:03:20.639> and<00:03:20.790> reliable

ridiculous with 1200 dollars from Mac
you<00:04:01.410> could<00:04:01.530> probably<00:04:01.680> get<00:04:01.859> a<00:04:01.889> mac<00:04:02.099> mini<00:04:02.130> or

you could probably get a mac mini or

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.099 
you could probably get a mac mini or
something<00:04:02.819> around<00:04:02.880> that<00:04:03.090> range<00:04:03.389> and<00:04:03.989> with

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
something around that range and with

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.870 
something around that range and with
that<00:04:04.260> you're<00:04:04.470> not<00:04:04.590> even<00:04:04.769> going<00:04:04.919> to<00:04:04.980> get<00:04:05.220> half

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
that you're not even going to get half

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.099 
that you're not even going to get half
the<00:04:05.910> power<00:04:06.269> that<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:06.599> get<00:04:06.840> out<00:04:06.959> of<00:04:06.989> this

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
the power that you get out of this

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.039 
the power that you get out of this
machine<00:04:07.500> so<00:04:08.400> definitely<00:04:09.209> definitely<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:09.780> very

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
machine so definitely definitely a very

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.379 
machine so definitely definitely a very
attractive<00:04:10.500> price<00:04:11.099> range<00:04:11.400> but<00:04:11.609> let's<00:04:12.180> go<00:04:12.239> and

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
attractive price range but let's go and

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:13.879 
attractive price range but let's go and
take<00:04:12.450> a<00:04:12.510> look<00:04:12.720> there's<00:04:13.440> your<00:04:13.590> graphics<00:04:13.859> card

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
take a look there's your graphics card

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.969 
take a look there's your graphics card
there<00:04:14.190> same<00:04:14.579> CPU<00:04:15.150> as<00:04:15.359> the<00:04:15.540> previous<00:04:15.810> build<00:04:16.229> so

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
there same CPU as the previous build so

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.050 
there same CPU as the previous build so
with<00:04:17.130> this<00:04:17.250> build<00:04:17.489> you're<00:04:17.579> going<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:17.760> get<00:04:17.849> more

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
with this build you're going to get more

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.969 
with this build you're going to get more
ram<00:04:18.269> better<00:04:18.930> graphics<00:04:19.440> card<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:19.859> you're

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
ram better graphics card and you're

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.529 
ram better graphics card and you're
actually<00:04:20.070> going<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:20.340> get<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.489> new<00:04:20.909> case<00:04:21.209> which

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
actually going to get a new case which

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.209
