00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.500
 hi how are all here louis with a 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.240
 new video 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.900
 and well this video I did it because 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.119
 Many people have asked me for good 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.390
 asked how the vinegar is taken from 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.690
 Apple cider on how it is prepared in 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.550
 reality is very simple 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.220
 but because of the fact that many people 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.620
 have the same question then I decided 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.000
 make this video to be able to answer them 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.510
 to all 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.230
 almost two years ago I posted a video about 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:43.630
 the organic apple cider vinegar 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.420
 the video that I went up was about stones 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:49.200
 in the kidneys and like this product 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:53.340
 organic 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.940
 helps them undo the two stones 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.920
 in the kidneys 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.899
 received received many 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.090

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.189
 product and many people find it in 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.750
 many stores many different brands 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.119
 only that I ask you is that please 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.020
 make sure it's organic as well 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.659
 it says here 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.820
 there are many brands that 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.979
 I recommend is the first video I wanted 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.320
 click here so you can see this 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.350
 video that brand is brain this brand 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.100
 It's sprout is also very good as 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.100
 can see here 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.390
 the liquid the product is not very 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.310
 transparent 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:43.590
 they sell one in many stores that is like 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.149
 like a vinegar but it's more transparent 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.310
 I did not buy it and that's already like 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:54.270
 processed this is more natural is this way 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:56.740
 like cloudy medium and that's the good ok 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.720
 and good at that time too 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.610
 I was selling this product for 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.530
 internet a lot of people bought me the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.689
 product and many thanks to the 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.750
 thank you and maybe start doing it from 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.160
 new to assist them because I know they do not 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.069
 all people have access to this 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.010
 product or not maybe there are no stores 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.510
 in your city or in your town where where 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.500
 sell it and that puts them send by the 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.269
 mail 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.420
 unfortunately I can only do it 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.930
 in the USA because it's liquid and they do not let me 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.329
 transfer liquid 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.599
 and by mail and well the first thing that I 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.109
 I do in fact is I put the vinegar in the 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.819
 glass 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.519
 I 'm already used to measuring 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.049
 amount but for you 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.159
 I recommend that they start with a spoon 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:44.299
 two tablespoons because two tablespoons of 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.299
 very simple product 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.829
 from now if I let you know that the 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.980
 product has a medium flavor we can 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:00.290
 say a little bitter but nothing 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.879
 exaggerated if the first time they take of 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.920
 products I recommend that you start with 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.989
 a spoon of nothing else with a 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.200
 spoonful of vinegar nothing more and alison 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.379
 in water 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.090
 so they can look at the glass approximately 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:16.590
 like half 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.590
 or three quarters of the satin 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.680
 stir 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:28.560
 and you can take this what can 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.110
 do first thing when waking up it 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.030
 they take this 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.340
 this mixture 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.920
 vinegar with water they take it 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.920
 they will feel this with more energy 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.290
 I do not know how they will be able to concentrate 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.519
 There are many benefits it better 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.220
 which are I going to leave here in the 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.379
 screen so they can see me 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.780
 I've spent years taking this product I have been 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.610
 helped a lot 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.430
 and many people take it for the pain of 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.800
 throat throat infection 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.920
 for the stones the kidneys for 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.319
 reach the body 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.300
 and well, maybe you have 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.700
 doubts about this product is something 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.349
 totally normal and what I give them 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.510
 I recommend that they do their 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.970
 own search by internet that you 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.489
 they look around and you are going to find 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.310
 Well, that network offers so many 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.770
 benefits and know what 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.080
 this is better than buying for example a 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.030
 doctor medicines know why because 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.880
 that medicine will only be able to 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.250
 use for one thing and nothing else this 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.260
 product is used to bore for 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.240

 in combat in the pressure alter tighten 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.030

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.510
 high cholesterol helps them to lower 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.370

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.530

 Water 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.200
