hello<00:00:01.170> everyone<00:00:01.589> this<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:01.920> fan<00:00:02.429> from<00:00:02.879> tidal

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
hello everyone this is fan from tidal

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.930 
hello everyone this is fan from tidal
Gardens<00:00:03.540> calm<00:00:04.170> and<00:00:04.529> today<00:00:05.400> we're<00:00:05.609> going<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.819> be

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
Gardens calm and today we're going to be

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.280 
Gardens calm and today we're going to be
doing<00:00:06.180> some<00:00:06.390> SPS<00:00:07.080> propagation<00:00:07.890> with<00:00:08.250> Bivona

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
doing some SPS propagation with Bivona

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.870 
doing some SPS propagation with Bivona
so<00:00:10.290> showing<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.830> lot<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.010> these<00:00:11.130> propagation

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
so showing a lot of these propagation

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.669 
so showing a lot of these propagation
techniques<00:00:12.240> on<00:00:12.450> Pavone<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.960> little<00:00:13.500> bit

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
techniques on Pavone is a little bit

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.310 
techniques on Pavone is a little bit
curious<00:00:14.240> because<00:00:15.240> not<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.570> lot<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.900> people<00:00:16.109> have

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
curious because not a lot of people have

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.849 
curious because not a lot of people have
Pavone<00:00:16.710> or<00:00:16.859> even<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.279> serious<00:00:17.670> SPS<00:00:18.270> folks

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
Pavone or even the serious SPS folks

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.859 
Pavone or even the serious SPS folks
tend<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.010> not<00:00:20.220> really<00:00:20.760> focus<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.420> coral

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
tend to not really focus on this coral

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.500 
tend to not really focus on this coral
but<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.800> good<00:00:22.980> thing<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.939> same<00:00:24.210> sort<00:00:24.449> of

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
but the good thing is the same sort of

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.970 
but the good thing is the same sort of
techniques<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.140> can<00:00:25.260> use<00:00:25.320> on<00:00:25.650> Pavano

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
techniques that you can use on Pavano

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.620 
techniques that you can use on Pavano
can<00:00:26.099> be<00:00:26.310> used<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.609> other<00:00:26.820> corals<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.449> have

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
can be used on other corals that have

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.509 
can be used on other corals that have
this<00:00:27.750> plating<00:00:28.529> type<00:00:28.830> structure<00:00:29.340> like

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
this plating type structure like

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.590 
this plating type structure like
montipora<00:00:33.770> so<00:00:34.770> as<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.160> see<00:00:35.219> here<00:00:35.850> cutting

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
montipora so as you can see here cutting

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.540 
montipora so as you can see here cutting
into<00:00:36.930> Pomona<00:00:37.290> isn't<00:00:37.739> exactly<00:00:38.100> rocket<00:00:38.309> science

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
into Pomona isn't exactly rocket science

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.850 
into Pomona isn't exactly rocket science
as<00:00:39.030> soon<00:00:39.270> as<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.600> start<00:00:39.930> making<00:00:40.140> your<00:00:40.260> cut<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
as soon as you start making your cut the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.860 
as soon as you start making your cut the
thing<00:00:41.100> pretty<00:00:41.399> much<00:00:41.579> shatters<00:00:43.700> as<00:00:44.700> I'm<00:00:45.539> making

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
thing pretty much shatters as I'm making

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.869 
thing pretty much shatters as I'm making
these<00:00:45.989> cuts<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.590> see<00:00:46.890> some<00:00:47.100> really<00:00:47.520> small

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
these cuts you can see some really small

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.690 
these cuts you can see some really small
pieces<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.829> coral<00:00:49.829> fragments<00:00:50.039> down<00:00:50.520> at<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
pieces of coral fragments down at the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.819 
pieces of coral fragments down at the
bottom<00:00:50.879> there<00:00:51.289> every<00:00:52.289> single<00:00:52.559> one<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.710> those

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
bottom there every single one of those

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.950 
bottom there every single one of those
will<00:00:53.280> grow<00:00:53.520> into<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.820> healthy<00:00:53.969> coral<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.780> just

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
will grow into a healthy coral it just

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.119 
will grow into a healthy coral it just
takes<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.230> lot<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.379> time<00:00:57.620> if<00:00:58.620> you've<00:00:58.829> watched

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
takes a lot of time if you've watched

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.069 
takes a lot of time if you've watched
some<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.520> our<00:00:59.640> other<00:00:59.760> propagation<00:01:00.510> videos<00:01:00.870> you

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
some of our other propagation videos you

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.110 
some of our other propagation videos you
probably<00:01:01.469> notice<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.160> glue<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> lot<00:01:03.000> of

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
probably notice that we glue a lot of

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.759 
probably notice that we glue a lot of
our<00:01:03.210> frags<00:01:03.480> down<00:01:03.809> onto<00:01:04.229> these<00:01:04.350> aragonite

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
our frags down onto these aragonite

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.060 
our frags down onto these aragonite
plugs<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> reason<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.200> because

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
plugs and the reason for that is because

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.480 
plugs and the reason for that is because
these<00:01:08.220> frags<00:01:08.580> need<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> place<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.960> grow<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
these frags need a place to grow and the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.730 
these frags need a place to grow and the
number<00:01:11.760> one<00:01:11.909> way<00:01:12.150> we<00:01:12.450> lose<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> lot<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.200> coral<00:01:13.530> is

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
number one way we lose a lot of coral is

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.120 
number one way we lose a lot of coral is
they<00:01:14.729> fall<00:01:15.479> over<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:15.960> something<00:01:16.500> or<00:01:16.799> they<00:01:17.100> just

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
they fall over on something or they just

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.999 
they fall over on something or they just
get<00:01:17.430> lost<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.270> having<00:01:18.869> them<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.259> some<00:01:19.500> concrete

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
get lost so having them on some concrete

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.240 
get lost so having them on some concrete
plugs<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.700> very<00:01:20.909> very<00:01:21.150> helpful<00:01:21.890> there<00:01:22.890> are<00:01:23.040> two

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
plugs is very very helpful there are two

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.039 
plugs is very very helpful there are two
schools<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.759> thought<00:01:23.820> as<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.509> how<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.720> go<00:01:24.960> about

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
schools of thought as to how to go about

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.539 
schools of thought as to how to go about
gluing<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.650> frags<00:01:25.920> down<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:28.259> first<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:29.040> to

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
gluing the frags down the first is to

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.910 
gluing the frags down the first is to
glue<00:01:29.790> where<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> coral<00:01:30.390> was<00:01:30.509> cut<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.680> kind

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
glue where the coral was cut in a kind

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.710 
glue where the coral was cut in a kind
of<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.070> vertical<00:01:32.369> orientations<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.390> frag

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
of a vertical orientations of the frag

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.590 
of a vertical orientations of the frag
sticks<00:01:34.049> up<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:35.400> second<00:01:35.880> method<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.360> this

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
sticks up the second method is this

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.510 
sticks up the second method is this
horizontal<00:01:36.990> orientation<00:01:37.500> which<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.310> prefer

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
horizontal orientation which I prefer

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.840 
horizontal orientation which I prefer
the<00:01:39.450> reason<00:01:39.840> being<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.590> cut<00:01:40.799> area<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.369> exposed

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
the reason being the cut area is exposed

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.480 
the reason being the cut area is exposed
to<00:01:42.000> water<00:01:42.270> flow<00:01:42.570> which<00:01:42.780> helps<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.170> heal<00:01:43.490> either

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
to water flow which helps it heal either

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.470 
to water flow which helps it heal either
way<00:01:44.640> works<00:01:44.880> really

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.450 

and<00:01:49.480> now<00:01:50.200> these<00:01:50.410> frags<00:01:50.800> are<00:01:50.980> ready<00:01:51.190> to<00:01:51.340> get

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
and now these frags are ready to get

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.670 
and now these frags are ready to get
back<00:01:51.640> in<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:51.880> water<00:01:52.080> thank<00:01:53.080> you<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:53.380> much<00:01:53.530> for

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
back in the water thank you so much for

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.010 
back in the water thank you so much for
watching<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.370> if<00:01:55.030> you<00:01:55.270> want<00:01:55.480> some<00:01:55.630> more<00:01:55.720> info

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
watching and if you want some more info

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.060 
watching and if you want some more info
