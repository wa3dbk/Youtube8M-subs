00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.620
 hi youtube people on this occasion 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.970
 I bring a video I had made 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.000
 previously but it went wrong first 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:18.150
 well the most important thing is that I do not know 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.359
 I listened to the sound well 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.890
 now I did it with a sound more more 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.410
 strong no 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.560
 and first of all I want to ask you a 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.680
 sorry for my voice 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.610
 andy andy or something hoarse and with pain 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.310
 throat 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.290
 and well excuse me if it sounded uglier than 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.390
 the normal 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:45.790
 good answering some questions 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:51.550
 from the previous video this month as it does 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:54.280
 laugh the girl well I'm not a woman so 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.690
 and keep asking us that and because 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.300
 I chose an avatar of a good girl 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.820
 I have an explanation but basically 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.490
 because I felt like it, I do not feel like it 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.890
 choose a girl I want to play 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.280
 with a girl and I think that should not them 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.190
 import a lot 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.430
 good going back to the subject and excuse me if 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.610
 He offended them something 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.090
 then I'm going to make the subject laugh 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.510
 to the girl as you see I am already in town 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.550
 I'm already here with the girl and she has 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.770
 made laugh once but I will 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.280

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.300

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.150
 a black 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.370
 let's put the code in hexadecimal 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:07.020
 here well and we select in the other 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.240
 side and we get the black color come

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.590
 we select a color for example black 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.420
 it will look good with white good 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.710

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.710
 efe efe 00 00 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.880
 by the way if they want some color 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.760
 specific and do not know what code is 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.530
 You can click here to help and help 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.740
 a window will come out and they will 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.440
 show the codes of the other colors 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.620
 where I made a background tapestry well there what 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:53.330
 which is basically is to select these 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:56.360
 little things like these things as you can see 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.470
 several there are ones that say only hub only 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.520
 hub I guess it's just Japanese no 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.530
 we can select the one we want 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.560
 for example centers because I want the 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.880
 pokemon center 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.400
 right now it says icons the icons are 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.630
 these little things the little drawings that are 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:23.690
 here those that are missing or for example I 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:26.440
 I want the circle pollution pollution 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.440
 motogp 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:35.360
 as you see here is how it is here 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.400
 so he will not show them in the game 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.460
 and we give it to you when you have selected 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.599
 everything that we have put all 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.599
 generate secret words 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:53.719
 well here gives us what is coming from 

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:56.930
 the phrase for example here says tell this 

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:59.029
 secret word to the old man and here 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:03.199
 let's say this word only works if 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:05.629
 your interest number 178 4 use only 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.059
 works with the indec I have that 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:10.460

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:14.920

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:20.700
 poetry is another thing we go to the game 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.700

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:29.230
