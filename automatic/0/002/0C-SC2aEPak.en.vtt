do tap on the planks like that and
here's<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> recipe<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.470> stick<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:14.640> can

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
here's the recipe for a stick so we can

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.120 
here's the recipe for a stick so we can
scale<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:14.969> a<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.420> here's<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.750> stick<00:01:15.840> there<00:01:16.350> so

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
scale it a and here's a stick there so

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.679 
scale it a and here's a stick there so
we<00:01:17.280> gotta<00:01:17.430> stick<00:01:17.700> that's<00:01:18.119> pretty<00:01:18.270> cool<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.630> we

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
we gotta stick that's pretty cool so we

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.480 
we gotta stick that's pretty cool so we
can<00:01:18.840> make<00:01:18.960> some<00:01:19.229> weapons<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.310> let's

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
can make some weapons of that so let's

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.899 
can make some weapons of that so let's
go<00:01:20.729> make<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:22.259> sword<00:01:22.710> will<00:01:22.890> make<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.039> sword<00:01:23.399> so

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
go make a a sword will make a sword so

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.599 
go make a a sword will make a sword so
go<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.479> get<00:01:25.259> some<00:01:25.530> diamonds<00:01:26.039> like<00:01:26.430> that

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:26.609 
go like that get some diamonds like that

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:28.940 
go like that get some diamonds like that
and<00:01:26.789> we<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.299> now<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.869> diamond<00:01:28.469> sword<00:01:28.649> so<00:01:28.890> you

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
and we have now a diamond sword so you

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.670 
and we have now a diamond sword so you
can<00:01:29.070> craft<00:01:29.310> some<00:01:29.780> some<00:01:30.780> armor<00:01:31.170> as<00:01:31.289> well<00:01:31.500> so

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
can craft some some armor as well so

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.490 
can craft some some armor as well so
let's<00:01:31.829> test<00:01:32.399> out<00:01:32.609> that<00:01:32.759> as<00:01:32.909> well<00:01:33.140> so<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.350> go

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
let's test out that as well so we can go

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.429 
let's test out that as well so we can go
like<00:01:34.649> this<00:01:34.859> like<00:01:35.659> that<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.960> here's<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
like this like that and here's a

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.260 
like this like that and here's a
chestplate<00:01:37.740> there<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.219> we<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.430> go<00:01:38.729> where<00:01:39.030> that

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
chestplate there so we can go where that

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.240 
chestplate there so we can go where that
so<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.109> is<00:01:40.259> pretty<00:01:40.469> cool<00:01:40.679> that's<00:01:40.859> basically

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
so that is pretty cool that's basically

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.859 
so that is pretty cool that's basically
it<00:01:41.399> for<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.789> month<00:01:41.969> so<00:01:42.149> you<00:01:42.240> can<00:01:42.359> just<00:01:42.390> craft

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
it for the month so you can just craft

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.260 
it for the month so you can just craft
some<00:01:43.079> awesome<00:01:43.469> stuff<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.250> different<00:01:44.820> way

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
some awesome stuff in a different way

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.090 
some awesome stuff in a different way
which<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.750> cool<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.289> can<00:01:46.409> make<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> furnace

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
which is cool so we can make a furnace

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.039 
which is cool so we can make a furnace
like<00:01:47.609> that<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:49.189> place<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.219> down<00:01:50.840> so<00:01:51.840> that's

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
like that and place it down so that's

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.940 
like that and place it down so that's
cool<00:01:52.259> what<00:01:53.070> else<00:01:53.219> can<00:01:53.399> we<00:01:53.460> do<00:01:53.609> um<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.899> let's<00:01:55.619> say

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
cool what else can we do um so let's say

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.510 
cool what else can we do um so let's say
we<00:01:56.369> can<00:01:56.969> make<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> shovel<00:01:57.899> as<00:01:58.049> well<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.520> diamond

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
we can make a shovel as well a diamond

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.539 
we can make a shovel as well a diamond
shovel<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.090> we<00:02:00.149> can<00:02:00.299> go<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.770> for

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
shovel so we can go like that and for

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.310 
shovel so we can go like that and for
some<00:02:02.700> reason<00:02:02.729> can<00:02:03.090> actually<00:02:03.359> tap<00:02:03.539> that<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.960> is

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
some reason can actually tap that it is

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.080 
some reason can actually tap that it is
a<00:02:04.350> bit<00:02:04.590> buggy<00:02:04.829> for<00:02:05.219> some<00:02:05.399> reason<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:05.820> let<00:02:05.999> me

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
a bit buggy for some reason so let me

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.880 
a bit buggy for some reason so let me
just<00:02:06.240> back<00:02:06.359> out<00:02:06.569> that<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.109> delete<00:02:07.439> dub<00:02:07.619> world

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
just back out that and delete dub world

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.210 
just back out that and delete dub world
because<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:09.030> very<00:02:09.270> buggy<00:02:09.869> kind<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.470> so

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
because it is very buggy kind of so

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.920 
because it is very buggy kind of so
let's<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.610> go<00:02:11.700> into<00:02:11.910> here<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.390> place<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
let's just go into here and place the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.830 
let's just go into here and place the
crafting<00:02:13.290> table<00:02:13.350> again<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:15.090> let's<00:02:15.390> go<00:02:15.630> into

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
crafting table again and let's go into

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.800 
crafting table again and let's go into
survival<00:02:16.170> get<00:02:16.740> some<00:02:17.190> ores<00:02:17.520> out<00:02:17.880> some<00:02:18.480> ores

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
survival get some ores out some ores

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
so let's go like that and hopefully this

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.149 
so let's go like that and hopefully this
works<00:02:25.819> now<00:02:26.049> so<00:02:27.049> defecate<00:02:27.560> alright<00:02:27.890> so<00:02:28.010> let's

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
works now so defecate alright so let's

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.119 
works now so defecate alright so let's
get<00:02:28.370> some<00:02:28.579> sticks<00:02:28.909> and<00:02:29.650> now<00:02:30.650> we<00:02:30.709> can<00:02:30.950> make<00:02:31.099> that
