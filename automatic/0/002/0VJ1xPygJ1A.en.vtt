00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello girls today I'm going to 

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:06.540
 tell them about the mini album in the 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.510
 that I will be working this year that 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.309
 is this is a project that is 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.639
 performing channel Crafts 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.160
 laura for this 2014 where every 15 days 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.110
 they went up for a proposal with a series 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.330
 of requirements in which we will go 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.539
 basing to go making the pages of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.150
 this minimum structure was as best 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.340
 it seems to us whether we used a 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.220
 filing cabinet or do it ourselves 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.680
 same I have chosen to do it and I have 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.590
 designed a mini with style and 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.710
 concept of a is greater 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.350
 the first proposal is already made and 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.920
 this is to make the cover a 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.500
 pocket and a peace 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.410
 the requirements that the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.740
 cover are 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:00.350
 one flower one button 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:03.800
 an operational sticker 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:07.640
 a title that I have chosen is that of 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.240
 2014 challenges of the three suggested by the 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:16.009
 rest of my decoration is an owl perched 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.630
 on a branch as well as an arrow 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.630
 which I made with decorated paper and 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.909
 textured cardboard each of these 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.420
 I have defined them with a false 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.750
 cooked and both the game and the arrow 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:35.479
 I've pasted them in 3-d adorns with a frame 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:38.000
 Die cut and base use the set 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.630
 where apply the technique of threading in 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.420
 each of them 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.150
 the base just wanted it for the part of 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.520
 in the middle so that it had volume like this 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.440
 also decorate my cover with this 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.030
 brotherhood of hearts that unites with a 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.130
 false cooked 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.790
 in the pocket 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.550
 I did it with 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.770
 This paper decorated by its design 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.709
 denim and sewing fabric 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:13.330
 on the banks I thought it was perfect 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:16.060
 for the occasion that includes a tag that 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.810
 is made with textured cardboard in 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.080
 black color and decorate with pearls your 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.560
 main element 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.670
 Y 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.700
 for the first page of this mini the 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.940
 requirement was to have an element 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.580
 main my element is this image that 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:41.170
 print that is originally a 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:47.620
 acrylic paint titled a screen is 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:53.400
 necessary where after a little the edges 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:59.890
 and I pasted it with pieces of decorated paper 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:03.940
 substituting the white in the middle of one 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.950
 folder cat as this happens 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.770
 project may define a type of 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.410
 wooded for now I will use a 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:15.850
 clipboard to arrive carrying my 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:20.380
 pages the back cover I have put 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:23.319
 also the challenge title 2014 but 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.959
 This is read upside down 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.389
 and good girls, this would be all for 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.489
