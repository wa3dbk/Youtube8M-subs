00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:10.349
 practical accessory for a smart tv 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.200
 bluetooth remote control with keyboard 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.990

 It does not work is not scheduled 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.010
 however, the use of the keyboard works 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.830
 as a mouse 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.150

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.550
 we put in the usb socket 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.290

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.350
 with written new device connected 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.450
 on the TV mouse that the board with 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.750
 television remote control press the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:54.840
 ok button the eventually drops me off 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:57.840
 the language and at this point the mouse 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.809
 wireless is connected to mine to mine 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.309

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.320
 internet access using 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.470
 clearly in the remote control of 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.470
 television 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.689
 I choose for example youtube opens me i 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.130
 content 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:29.070
 I turn on my turn on my keyboard 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:32.159
 I turn on the wireless here is this point 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.810
 turned on and I don't know if you can make a 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.520
 fire but we have the pointer that yes 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.689
 moves freely 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:47.280
 now for example I have come up point 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.560
 this function the selection and it appears to me 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.150
 already the search button without having 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.030
 without 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.630
 without having to use the remote control 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.410
 yen on television are in the function 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:05.070
 let's see you see my pointer again 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:09.240
 it's quietly makes me go down to 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:13.530
 example with the TV remote control 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.680
 I should have let go by pressing more 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:22.850
 times the cursor back and forth with 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:30.750

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:36.810
 just point me on the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:39.780
 letter that interests me without without 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.520
 having to go crazy to press the 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.250
 TV remote 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.260

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.160

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.290
 filmed all comfortably with a 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.460
 pointer that is very very practical 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:38.090
