special guest commentary for LHC this is
going<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.150> be<00:00:06.270> C<00:00:06.509> apone<00:00:06.870> versus<00:00:07.290> Rob<00:00:07.500> Van<00:00:07.710> Dam

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
going to be C apone versus Rob Van Dam

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.570 
going to be C apone versus Rob Van Dam
and<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.340> special<00:00:09.090> table<00:00:09.389> match<00:00:09.780> on<00:00:10.309> doe<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.370> read

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
and a special table match on doe to read

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
and a special table match on doe to read
and<00:00:11.820> write

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.660 

LHC<00:00:17.600> is<00:00:18.050> really<00:00:18.440> smart<00:00:18.830> he<00:00:19.070> figured<00:00:19.400> out<00:00:19.430> how

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
LHC is really smart he figured out how

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.480 
LHC is really smart he figured out how
to<00:00:19.700> do<00:00:20.230> redo<00:00:21.230> the<00:00:21.410> textures<00:00:21.920> on<00:00:22.070> this<00:00:22.220> game<00:00:22.460> so

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
to do redo the textures on this game so

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.269 
to do redo the textures on this game so
he<00:00:22.850> textured<00:00:23.860> Rob<00:00:24.860> and<00:00:25.130> Dan<00:00:25.400> and<00:00:25.730> his<00:00:26.920> CM<00:00:27.920> Punk

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
he textured Rob and Dan and his CM Punk

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.409 
he textured Rob and Dan and his CM Punk
CW<00:00:29.119> create<00:00:29.960> a<00:00:29.990> wrestler<00:00:30.699> yeah<00:00:31.699> he<00:00:31.880> retexture

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
CW create a wrestler yeah he retexture

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:33.850 
CW create a wrestler yeah he retexture
me<00:00:32.570> these<00:00:32.989> guys<00:00:33.199> and<00:00:33.410> they're<00:00:33.500> looking<00:00:33.739> really

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
me these guys and they're looking really

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.869 
me these guys and they're looking really
good<00:00:35.590> he<00:00:36.590> looks<00:00:36.770> like<00:00:36.860> CM<00:00:37.160> Punk<00:00:37.340> was<00:00:37.460> made<00:00:37.670> for

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
good he looks like CM Punk was made for

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.060 
good he looks like CM Punk was made for
the<00:00:37.970> game<00:00:38.710> whoa<00:00:39.710> were<00:00:39.920> those<00:00:40.100> glass<00:00:40.400> tables

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
the game whoa were those glass tables

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.110 
the game whoa were those glass tables
well<00:00:43.070> that's<00:00:43.250> what<00:00:43.430> he<00:00:43.519> meant<00:00:43.699> by<00:00:43.820> special

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
well that's what he meant by special

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.799 
well that's what he meant by special
table<00:00:44.690> match<00:00:44.900> that's<00:00:45.440> insane

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
table match that's insane

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.360 
table match that's insane
he<00:00:47.809> told<00:00:48.050> me<00:00:48.140> about<00:00:48.229> the<00:00:48.470> textures<00:00:48.949> he<00:00:49.070> did<00:00:49.250> he

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
he told me about the textures he did he

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.820 
he told me about the textures he did he
didn't<00:00:49.519> tell<00:00:49.640> me<00:00:49.670> about<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:50.000> glass<00:00:50.180> tables

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
didn't tell me about the glass tables

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.750 
didn't tell me about the glass tables
that's<00:00:51.830> surprising

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
that's surprising

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.009 
that's surprising
I<00:00:52.820> wonder<00:00:53.659> how<00:00:53.750> it<00:00:53.870> looks<00:00:54.019> when<00:00:54.140> they<00:00:54.199> shatter

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
I wonder how it looks when they shatter

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.590 
I wonder how it looks when they shatter
anyway<00:00:57.019> back<00:00:57.170> to<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:57.440> textures<00:00:58.220> he<00:00:58.600> figured

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
anyway back to the textures he figured

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.210 
anyway back to the textures he figured
out<00:00:59.629> how<00:00:59.780> to<00:00:59.809> do<00:01:00.019> the<00:01:00.170> textures<00:01:00.620> on<00:01:00.769> these<00:01:00.890> guys

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
out how to do the textures on these guys

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.750 
out how to do the textures on these guys
and<00:01:01.820> they<00:01:02.449> look<00:01:02.600> really<00:01:03.019> cool<00:01:03.699> did<00:01:04.699> a

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
and they look really cool did a

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.640 
and they look really cool did a
fantastic<00:01:04.940> job<00:01:05.420> but<00:01:05.990> it<00:01:06.110> looks<00:01:06.260> like<00:01:06.409> CM

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
fantastic job but it looks like CM

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.710 
fantastic job but it looks like CM
Punk's<00:01:06.890> actually<00:01:07.190> on<00:01:07.310> this<00:01:07.460> game<00:01:07.640> and<00:01:08.030> you

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
Punk's actually on this game and you

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.330 
Punk's actually on this game and you
can't<00:01:08.900> even<00:01:09.080> tell<00:01:09.140> it<00:01:09.500> Rob<00:01:09.770> Van<00:01:09.950> Dam's<00:01:10.190> the

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
can't even tell it Rob Van Dam's the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.560 
can't even tell it Rob Van Dam's the
texture<00:01:10.760> unless<00:01:10.940> you<00:01:11.119> know<00:01:11.240> what<00:01:11.330> he<00:01:11.420> looked

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
texture unless you know what he looked

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.270 
texture unless you know what he looked
like<00:01:11.630> before

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.290 

so<00:01:15.850> he<00:01:16.060> says<00:01:16.360> press<00:01:16.750> from<00:01:16.930> navien<00:01:17.410> in<00:01:18.300> its

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
so he says press from navien in its

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.969 
so he says press from navien in its
final<00:01:19.720> leg<00:01:19.900> drop<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.200> see<00:01:20.500> him<00:01:20.620> pump<00:01:22.979> letters

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
final leg drop to see him pump letters

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.370 
final leg drop to see him pump letters
hit<00:01:24.160> to<00:01:24.370> real<00:01:24.580> law<00:01:24.880> sign<00:01:25.780> out<00:01:25.990> there<00:01:26.170> in<00:01:26.260> the

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
hit to real law sign out there in the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.000 
hit to real law sign out there in the
audience

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
or is that my imagination I think it was

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.149 
or is that my imagination I think it was

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
a small package that was cool

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.319 
a small package that was cool
there's<00:01:47.079> no<00:01:47.200> pins<00:01:47.500> in<00:01:47.649> this<00:01:47.770> match<00:01:48.039> though

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.539

that's<00:02:11.760> cool

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
that's cool

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.290 
that's cool
I've<00:02:13.680> never<00:02:13.920> seen<00:02:14.160> anybody<00:02:14.460> mod<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.180> game

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
I've never seen anybody mod this game

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.410 
I've never seen anybody mod this game
before<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:15.810> think<00:02:15.990> LHC<00:02:16.680> might<00:02:16.920> be<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.250> first<00:02:17.520> at

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
before I think LHC might be the first at

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.510 
before I think LHC might be the first at
least<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.750> first<00:02:18.990> on<00:02:19.140> YouTube

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.450 

shut<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:23.210> glass<00:02:23.600> table<00:02:24.110> now<00:02:24.260> I've<00:02:25.190> always

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
shut that glass table now I've always

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.370 
shut that glass table now I've always
seen<00:02:25.640> glass<00:02:25.850> tables<00:02:26.300> used<00:02:26.540> warrants<00:02:27.080> in<00:02:27.200> that

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
seen glass tables used warrants in that

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.580 
seen glass tables used warrants in that
city<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.180> I've<00:02:29.180> seen<00:02:29.450> panes<00:02:29.780> of<00:02:29.960> glass<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.470> use

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
city and I've seen panes of glass to use
