hitting<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.870> switch<00:00:46.140> opens<00:00:46.530> up<00:00:46.680> that

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
hitting that switch opens up that

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.240 
hitting that switch opens up that
stairway<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.090> forget<00:00:48.420> how<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.719> open<00:00:49.250> the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.410 

teleporting<00:01:21.680> that<00:01:22.600> gotta<00:01:24.850> grab<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:25.970> stuff

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.530 

next<00:01:29.420> room<00:01:29.659> I<00:01:29.750> want<00:01:29.990> is<00:01:31.210> definitely<00:01:32.210> not<00:01:32.390> in

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
next room I want is definitely not in

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.780 
next room I want is definitely not in
the<00:01:32.600> helmets<00:01:33.049> this<00:01:33.979> room<00:01:34.189> is<00:01:34.369> pretty<00:01:34.520> good

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
the helmets this room is pretty good

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.350 
the helmets this room is pretty good
it's<00:01:35.659> got<00:01:35.750> a<00:01:35.810> bunch<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.080> caffeine<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:37.180> to<00:01:38.180> deal

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
it's got a bunch of caffeine so to deal

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:56.790 
it's got a bunch of caffeine so to deal
with

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:05.370 

check<00:01:57.800> out<00:01:57.950> a<00:01:57.979> few<00:02:00.400> menus<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.610> deal<00:02:03.070> right<00:02:04.070> there

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
check out a few menus a deal right there

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.740 
check out a few menus a deal right there
I<00:02:06.380> think<00:02:07.310> that's<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.760> switch<00:02:08.000> that<00:02:08.030> opens<00:02:08.330> up

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
I think that's the switch that opens up

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.590 
I think that's the switch that opens up
that<00:02:09.160> mole<00:02:10.160> back<00:02:10.429> there<00:02:10.700> so<00:02:11.120> let's<00:02:11.420> go<00:02:11.510> check

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
that mole back there so let's go check

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.070 
that mole back there so let's go check
it<00:02:11.870> out

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.750 

so<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:15.170> head<00:02:15.320> back<00:02:15.350> here<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:16.240> this<00:02:17.240> is<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.390> trap

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
so you head back here and this is a trap

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.280 
so you head back here and this is a trap
because<00:02:19.760> those<00:02:20.270> walls<00:02:20.510> are<00:02:20.630> gonna<00:02:20.750> open<00:02:21.020> up

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
because those walls are gonna open up

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.720 
because those walls are gonna open up
and<00:02:21.590> there's<00:02:21.770> gonna<00:02:21.890> be<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.070> bunch<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.400> demons

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
and there's gonna be a bunch of demons

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:40.870 
and there's gonna be a bunch of demons
as<00:02:23.060> soon<00:02:23.240> as<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.480> grab<00:02:23.690> this<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:39.790> there's<00:02:40.790> a

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
as soon as you grab this and there's a

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.750 
as soon as you grab this and there's a
secret<00:02:41.360> that<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:42.320> can<00:02:42.500> use<00:02:42.739> now<00:02:43.340> I<00:02:43.400> ran<00:02:43.730> over

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
secret that you can use now I ran over

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.640 
secret that you can use now I ran over
there<00:02:44.120> because<00:02:44.420> there's<00:02:44.840> weapon<00:02:45.260> right<00:02:45.380> there

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
there because there's weapon right there

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.190 
there because there's weapon right there
but<00:02:45.800> you<00:02:45.830> have<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.070> hit<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.280> switch<00:02:46.550> for<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.200> so

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
but you have to hit a switch for it so

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.290 
but you have to hit a switch for it so
first<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:48.920> collect<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.370> five<00:02:49.580> backpacks<00:02:50.120> of

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
first you collect to five backpacks of

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.800 
first you collect to five backpacks of
ammo

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
ammo

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.559 
ammo
a<00:02:51.640> nifty<00:02:52.640> at<00:02:52.880> this<00:02:53.060> point

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.690 

so<00:02:56.140> runback<00:02:56.969> guns<00:02:57.969> still<00:02:58.780> not<00:02:58.989> there<00:02:59.200> yet<00:02:59.700> so

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
so runback guns still not there yet so

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.009 
so runback guns still not there yet so
what<00:03:01.060> you<00:03:01.209> have<00:03:01.299> to<00:03:01.390> do<00:03:01.480> is<00:03:01.599> you<00:03:01.689> have<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.870> go

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.770 
back here and you have to hit the switch
that<00:03:04.769> instantly<00:03:05.769> turns<00:03:06.040> off<00:03:06.280> run<00:03:06.969> back<00:03:07.269> and

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780
