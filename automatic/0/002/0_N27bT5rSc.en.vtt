these<00:00:35.370> bins<00:00:35.670> have<00:00:35.940> like<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.149> holder<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> white

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
these bins have like a holder a white

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.260 
these bins have like a holder a white
holder<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.280> could<00:00:38.520> pull<00:00:38.730> out<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:39.090> and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
holder that I could pull out of and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.910 
holder that I could pull out of and
stuff<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.690> could<00:00:39.899> pull<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.140> bins<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.500> organize

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
and basically the holder snapped in half

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.770 
and basically the holder snapped in half
because<00:00:44.250> there's<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:44.969> much<00:00:45.120> weight<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.660> the
