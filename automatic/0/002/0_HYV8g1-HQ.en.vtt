00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
using it well right away I noticed that

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.590 
using it well right away I noticed that
the<00:01:27.590> fixture<00:01:28.009> is<00:01:28.130> not<00:01:28.340> black<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:29.060> now<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.240> box

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
the fixture is not black and now the box

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.359 
the fixture is not black and now the box
as<00:01:30.079> well<00:01:30.350> as<00:01:30.530> a<00:01:30.560> lot<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:30.770> pictures<00:01:31.159> on<00:01:31.280> the

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
as well as a lot of pictures on the

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.880 
as well as a lot of pictures on the
internet<00:01:31.750> make<00:01:32.750> it<00:01:32.899> appear<00:01:33.290> as<00:01:33.500> if<00:01:33.560> the

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
internet make it appear as if the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.359 
internet make it appear as if the
fixture<00:01:34.250> is<00:01:34.369> black<00:01:34.810> but<00:01:35.810> it's<00:01:35.990> not<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:37.159> see

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
fixture is black but it's not you see

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.410 
fixture is black but it's not you see
that<00:01:37.610> it's<00:01:37.759> a<00:01:38.290> raw<00:01:39.290> aluminum<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:40.970> this<00:01:41.119> isn't

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
that it's a raw aluminum so this isn't

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.319 
that it's a raw aluminum so this isn't
plastic<00:01:41.600> this<00:01:41.990> whole<00:01:42.229> housing<00:01:42.890> is<00:01:43.329> aluminum

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
plastic this whole housing is aluminum

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.510 
plastic this whole housing is aluminum
which<00:01:44.659> serves<00:01:45.049> as<00:01:45.290> a<00:01:45.320> heat<00:01:45.649> sink<00:01:45.920> for<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.340> heli

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
which serves as a heat sink for the heli

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.410 
which serves as a heat sink for the heli
Dees<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:47.860> you<00:01:48.860> see<00:01:49.040> that<00:01:49.189> the<00:01:49.310> fixture<00:01:49.670> has

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
Dees and you see that the fixture has

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.260 
Dees and you see that the fixture has
all<00:01:50.689> these<00:01:50.869> fins<00:01:51.320> for<00:01:51.799> hair<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:52.340> pass<00:01:52.579> through

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
all these fins for hair to pass through

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.870 
all these fins for hair to pass through
the<00:01:53.420> fixture<00:01:53.810> from<00:01:53.960> underneath<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:55.340> top<00:01:55.579> and

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
the fixture from underneath the top and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.850 
the fixture from underneath the top and
from<00:01:56.000> top<00:01:56.180> to<00:01:56.240> bottom

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
from top to bottom

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.310 
from top to bottom
keeping<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:57.950> fixture<00:01:58.340> extremely<00:01:58.820> cool<00:01:59.320> but

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
keeping the fixture extremely cool but

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.889 
keeping the fixture extremely cool but
it<00:02:00.409> also<00:02:00.560> comes<00:02:00.950> with<00:02:01.130> a<00:02:01.250> cooling<00:02:01.640> fan<00:02:01.780> so<00:02:02.780> in

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
it also comes with a cooling fan so in

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.319 
it also comes with a cooling fan so in
the<00:02:02.990> event<00:02:03.350> that<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:04.189> LEDs<00:02:04.579> did<00:02:04.909> start<00:02:05.240> to

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
the event that the LEDs did start to

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.980 
the event that the LEDs did start to
become<00:02:05.450> warm<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.829> fan<00:02:07.070> would<00:02:07.280> turn<00:02:07.520> on<00:02:07.960> but<00:02:08.960> a

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
become warm the fan would turn on but a

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
down to the next set point and what that

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.870 
down to the next set point and what that
means<00:03:26.500> is<00:03:26.740> this<00:03:26.890> going<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.100> be<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.220> gradual

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
means is this going to be a gradual

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.510

version<00:04:13.540> into<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.620> video<00:04:14.890> right<00:04:15.730> now

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.730 

you

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.140 

oh<00:04:28.770> well<00:04:29.770> guys<00:04:29.919> you<00:04:30.160> can<00:04:30.310> see<00:04:30.520> that<00:04:30.789> the<00:04:30.910> power

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
oh well guys you can see that the power

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.779 
oh well guys you can see that the power
ratings<00:04:31.600> for<00:04:32.050> both<00:04:32.319> fixtures<00:04:32.860> are<00:04:33.220> more<00:04:33.610> than

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
ratings for both fixtures are more than

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.570 
ratings for both fixtures are more than
enough<00:04:33.910> to<00:04:34.330> grow<00:04:35.110> any<00:04:35.710> type<00:04:35.979> of<00:04:36.009> oil<00:04:36.340> that<00:04:36.400> you

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
enough to grow any type of oil that you

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.790 
enough to grow any type of oil that you
choose<00:04:36.849> and<00:04:37.660> for<00:04:38.110> those<00:04:38.229> of<00:04:38.410> you<00:04:38.530> that<00:04:38.650> don't

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
choose and for those of you that don't

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.980 
choose and for those of you that don't
know<00:04:38.919> what<00:04:39.039> par<00:04:39.430> is<00:04:39.759> par<00:04:40.300> stands<00:04:40.690> for

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
know what par is par stands for

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.460 
know what par is par stands for
photosynthetic<00:04:41.880> active<00:04:42.880> radiation<00:04:43.509> and

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
photosynthetic active radiation and

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.089 
photosynthetic active radiation and
basically<00:04:45.009> that's<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:46.199> the<00:04:47.199> energy<00:04:47.620> required

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
basically that's the the energy required

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.330 
basically that's the the energy required
to<00:04:48.370> draw<00:04:48.580> up<00:04:48.639> photosynthesis<00:04:50.069> I'm<00:04:51.069> not<00:04:51.190> going

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
to draw up photosynthesis I'm not going

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.249 
to draw up photosynthesis I'm not going
to<00:04:51.400> get<00:04:51.580> into<00:04:51.699> all<00:04:51.849> that<00:04:52.020> technology<00:04:53.020> or

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
to get into all that technology or

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.409 
to get into all that technology or
technical<00:04:54.220> terms<00:04:54.400> right<00:04:54.639> now<00:04:54.699> but<00:04:55.090> just<00:04:55.270> know

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
technical terms right now but just know

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:56.999 
technical terms right now but just know
that<00:04:55.449> this<00:04:55.810> light<00:04:56.020> is<00:04:56.199> more<00:04:56.440> than<00:04:56.650> powerful

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
that this light is more than powerful

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.730 
that this light is more than powerful
enough<00:04:57.509> to<00:04:58.509> grow<00:04:58.720> any<00:04:58.960> kind<00:04:59.199> of<00:04:59.289> crawls<00:04:59.530> that

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
enough to grow any kind of crawls that

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:07.020 
enough to grow any kind of crawls that
you<00:04:59.830> choose<00:05:01.440> well<00:05:04.229> this<00:05:05.460> 16,000<00:05:06.460> K<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:06.910> we'll

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.580 
fish and corals alright guys I want to
show<00:06:14.680> you<00:06:14.740> one<00:06:14.979> thing<00:06:15.190> also<00:06:15.639> about<00:06:16.349> the<00:06:17.349> power

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
show you one thing also about the power

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.550 
show you one thing also about the power
supply<00:06:17.710> this<00:06:18.490> this<00:06:19.449> comes<00:06:19.690> with<00:06:19.870> a<00:06:19.900> power

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560
