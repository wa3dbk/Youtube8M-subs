know<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:48.959> just<00:01:49.110> not<00:01:49.259> easy<00:01:49.289> I<00:01:49.590> don't<00:01:49.740> care<00:01:49.830> how

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
know it's just not easy I don't care how

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.529 
know it's just not easy I don't care how
you<00:01:50.069> do<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:50.580> very<00:01:50.789> difficult<00:01:51.060> and

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
you do it it's very difficult and

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.300 
you do it it's very difficult and
there's<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.289> lot<00:01:52.410> of<00:01:52.470> pain<00:01:52.739> and<00:01:52.920> suffering<00:01:53.280> that

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
there's a lot of pain and suffering that

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.509 
there's a lot of pain and suffering that
goes<00:01:53.429> into<00:01:53.789> your<00:01:54.269> weight<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.399> worrying<00:01:56.399> about

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:56.519 
goes into your weight and worrying about

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:58.820 
goes into your weight and worrying about
it<00:01:56.819> and<00:01:56.970> I<00:01:57.030> think<00:01:57.300> this<00:01:57.629> if<00:01:57.959> any<00:01:58.259> we<00:01:58.590> can<00:01:58.709> make

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
it and I think this if any we can make

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.940 
it and I think this if any we can make
it<00:01:58.920> easier<00:01:59.250> anyway<00:01:59.610> we<00:02:00.239> should<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.950> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
it easier anyway we should and the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.259 
it easier anyway we should and the
trouble<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.310> as<00:02:02.459> we<00:02:02.580> get<00:02:02.729> older<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:03.119> know<00:02:03.209> it

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:03.269 
trouble is as we get older you know it

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:05.540 
trouble is as we get older you know it
gets<00:02:03.420> tougher<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.810> lose<00:02:03.959> weight<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.500> that's<00:02:05.459> a

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
gets tougher to lose weight and that's a

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.520 
gets tougher to lose weight and that's a
problem<00:02:05.580> so<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.390> better<00:02:06.629> to<00:02:06.780> start<00:02:07.080> now<00:02:07.289> than

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
problem so it's better to start now than

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.710 
problem so it's better to start now than
to<00:02:07.619> wait<00:02:07.769> until<00:02:07.979> you're<00:02:08.340> older<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.629> know

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
to wait until you're older and you know

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.089 
to wait until you're older and you know
the<00:02:09.840> struggle<00:02:10.229> might<00:02:10.349> not<00:02:10.530> be<00:02:10.709> our<00:02:10.860> fault

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
the struggle might not be our fault

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.430 
the struggle might not be our fault
because<00:02:11.370> there's<00:02:12.209> some<00:02:12.390> things<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.840> make<00:02:13.290> it

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
because there's some things that make it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.680 
because there's some things that make it
tougher<00:02:13.739> for<00:02:13.769> us<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.610> lose<00:02:14.760> weight<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.569> know

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
tougher for us to lose weight you know

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.839 
tougher for us to lose weight you know
we<00:02:15.840> don't<00:02:16.019> need<00:02:16.379> another<00:02:16.680> diet<00:02:17.459> there's<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.700> lot

of diets out there to choose from what
we<00:02:19.319> need<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.709> solution<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:21.209> know<00:02:21.330> diet<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:22.080> a

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
individualize it and so I've learned

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.839 
individualize it and so I've learned
I've<00:02:31.769> been<00:02:31.950> working<00:02:32.250> with<00:02:32.280> patients<00:02:32.519> that's

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
what I've learned and taken away is that

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.039 
what I've learned and taken away is that
people<00:02:43.769> are<00:02:43.980> different<00:02:44.599> they<00:02:45.599> really<00:02:45.870> are

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
people are different they really are

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.360 
people are different they really are
different<00:02:46.500> than<00:02:46.620> they<00:02:46.769> need<00:02:47.040> different

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
different than they need different

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.670 
different than they need different
approaches<00:02:47.849> it's<00:02:48.209> not<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.420> one<00:02:48.720> size<00:02:48.750> fits<00:02:49.049> all

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
approaches it's not a one size fits all

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.210 
approaches it's not a one size fits all
situation<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:51.590> knowing<00:02:52.590> how<00:02:52.860> we're

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
situation and knowing how we're

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.059 
situation and knowing how we're
different<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:54.810> most<00:02:55.050> important<00:02:55.620> thing<00:02:55.860> in

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
different is the most important thing in

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.460 
different is the most important thing in
choosing<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:57.030> right<00:02:57.420> approach<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:58.290> eating

solution<00:03:02.530> really<00:03:03.070> explains<00:03:03.520> that<00:03:03.820> there<00:03:04.180> are

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
solution really explains that there are

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.140 
solution really explains that there are
two<00:03:05.050> types<00:03:05.320> of<00:03:05.500> people<00:03:05.560> with<00:03:06.520> two<00:03:06.760> different

one night at eleven o'clock and nothing
was<00:04:21.459> open<00:04:21.580> so<00:04:21.850> I<00:04:21.880> ordered<00:04:22.090> on<00:04:22.330> amazon<00:04:22.360> I<00:04:22.960> mean

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
was open so I ordered on amazon I mean

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.150 
was open so I ordered on amazon I mean
that's<00:04:23.650> what<00:04:23.860> you<00:04:23.919> can<00:04:24.100> do<00:04:24.280> now<00:04:25.169> and<00:04:26.169> you<00:04:27.040> know

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
that's what you can do now and you know

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.100 
that's what you can do now and you know
to<00:04:27.729> lose<00:04:27.940> weight<00:04:28.210> it's<00:04:28.360> tough<00:04:28.630> because<00:04:28.810> you've

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
to lose weight it's tough because you've

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.530 
to lose weight it's tough because you've
got<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.500> overcome<00:04:30.220> some<00:04:30.580> of<00:04:30.610> these<00:04:30.820> natural

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
got to overcome some of these natural

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.990 
got to overcome some of these natural
barriers<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.710> survival<00:04:33.280> mechanisms<00:04:33.850> that

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
barriers the survival mechanisms that

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.510 
barriers the survival mechanisms that
mother<00:04:34.240> nature<00:04:34.330> is<00:04:34.720> put<00:04:34.930> in<00:04:35.050> place<00:04:35.290> to<00:04:36.070> keep<00:04:36.250> us

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
mother nature is put in place to keep us

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.540 
mother nature is put in place to keep us
from<00:04:36.790> having<00:04:37.229> starvation<00:04:38.229> but<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.250> problem

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
from having starvation but the problem

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.159 
from having starvation but the problem
is<00:04:39.640> when<00:04:39.760> we<00:04:39.910> live<00:04:40.090> in<00:04:40.210> abundance<00:04:40.450> that's

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
is when we live in abundance that's

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.100 
is when we live in abundance that's
harder<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:41.650> overcome<00:04:42.360> so<00:04:43.360> that<00:04:43.570> takes<00:04:43.840> some

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
harder to overcome so that takes some

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.409 
harder to overcome so that takes some
special<00:04:44.710> efforts<00:04:45.220> and<00:04:45.760> I<00:04:46.210> think

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
special efforts and I think

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.760 
special efforts and I think
unfortunately<00:04:46.720> most<00:04:47.080> people<00:04:47.229> are<00:04:47.530> sort<00:04:47.710> of

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
unfortunately most people are sort of

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.610 
unfortunately most people are sort of
misguided<00:04:48.490> in<00:04:48.640> their<00:04:48.880> ideas<00:04:49.720> about<00:04:50.080> what<00:04:50.530> it

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
misguided in their ideas about what it

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.469 
misguided in their ideas about what it
takes<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:51.100> lose<00:04:51.280> weight<00:04:51.520> and<00:04:51.729> what<00:04:52.300> they

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
takes to lose weight and what they

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.230 
takes to lose weight and what they
should<00:04:52.720> do<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.160> a<00:04:54.160> lot<00:04:54.250> of<00:04:54.460> people<00:04:54.790> really<00:04:54.850> are

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
should do and a lot of people really are

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.450 
should do and a lot of people really are
doing<00:04:55.540> the<00:04:55.720> trial<00:04:56.020> and<00:04:56.200> error<00:04:56.350> method<00:04:56.590> I'll

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
doing the trial and error method I'll

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.130 
doing the trial and error method I'll
try<00:04:57.729> this<00:04:57.850> for<00:04:58.180> two<00:04:58.360> weeks<00:04:58.390> and<00:04:58.780> see<00:04:58.960> what

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
try this for two weeks and see what

try this for two weeks and see what
happens<00:04:59.560> if<00:04:59.800> it<00:05:00.400> works<00:05:00.610> maybe<00:05:00.850> I'll<00:05:01.060> give<00:05:01.210> it

happens if it works maybe I'll give it

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.060 
happens if it works maybe I'll give it
another<00:05:01.570> two<00:05:01.810> weeks<00:05:01.990> or<00:05:02.229> I'll<00:05:02.410> try<00:05:02.650> something

another two weeks or I'll try something
