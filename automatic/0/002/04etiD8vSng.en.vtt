00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
well made it feels really solid but it's

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.000

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
super thin and super light because it's

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.340 
super thin and super light because it's

as thin and light as it is it can be a

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
little bit hard to hold sometimes it

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.420 
little bit hard to hold sometimes it
doesn't<00:00:51.780> have<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> very<00:00:52.680> thick<00:00:52.890> bezel<00:00:53.070> on<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
doesn't have a very thick bezel on the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.369 
doesn't have a very thick bezel on the
sides<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.750> little<00:00:55.050> bit<00:00:55.230> awkward

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
sides so it's a little bit awkward

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.080 
sides so it's a little bit awkward
holding<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.980> with<00:00:56.070> one<00:00:56.129> hand<00:00:56.550> with<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:56.850> thumb

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
extremely wide for a single hand to hold

extremely wide for a single hand to hold
in<00:01:02.370> fact<00:01:02.699> most<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> time<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.989> use<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.470> Smart

in fact most of the time I use the Smart

Cover that Apple makes for it because it

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
hand the screen itself looks really nice

the<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.650> display<00:01:13.950> looks<00:01:14.159> very<00:01:14.460> close<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.909> the

the the display looks very close to the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
levels and colors are really rich I will

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.560 
levels and colors are really rich I will
say<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.220> after<00:01:20.549> using<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.880> for<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.090> while<00:01:21.299> and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
say that after using it for a while and

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.940 
say that after using it for a while and
reading<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.290> do<00:01:22.439> start<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.770> notice

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
reading on it you do start to notice

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.980 
reading on it you do start to notice
that<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.490> pixel<00:01:23.939> density<00:01:24.030> here<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.659> lower

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
that the pixel density here is lower

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.560 
that the pixel density here is lower
than<00:01:25.590> competing<00:01:25.979> devices<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.540> a

than competing devices it is not a

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.359 
than competing devices it is not a
deal-breaker<00:01:27.900> but<00:01:28.590> some<00:01:28.950> people<00:01:29.220> who<00:01:29.310> are

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
deal-breaker but some people who are

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.219 
deal-breaker but some people who are
very<00:01:29.520> sensitive<00:01:29.790> about<00:01:30.119> how<00:01:30.780> many<00:01:30.990> pixels

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
very sensitive about how many pixels

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.620 
very sensitive about how many pixels
they<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.770> screen<00:01:31.920> may<00:01:32.729> be<00:01:32.790> distracted<00:01:33.600> by

they see on screen may be distracted by

they see on screen may be distracted by
it<00:01:33.840> as<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.500> mentioned<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.310> bezel<00:01:35.850> along<00:01:36.119> the

it as I mentioned the bezel along the
sides<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.780> smaller<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.650> apparently<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
software on the iPad Mini does a better

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.440 
software on the iPad Mini does a better
job<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.409> rejecting<00:01:41.130> unwanted<00:01:41.850> touches<00:01:42.299> I

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
job of rejecting unwanted touches I

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.330 
job of rejecting unwanted touches I
think<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.930> worked<00:01:43.140> fine<00:01:43.619> most<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.130> time

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
think it worked fine most of the time

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.480 
think it worked fine most of the time
though<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.549> did<00:01:44.880> feel<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.240> some<00:01:45.509> app<00:01:45.720> may<00:01:46.049> have

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
though I did feel like some app may have

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.380 
though I did feel like some app may have
experienced<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.579> little<00:01:47.820> bit<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.090> miss

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
experienced a little bit of miss

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.289 
experienced a little bit of miss
touching<00:01:48.750> otherwise<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.159> software<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.880> as

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
touching otherwise the software is as

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.830 
touching otherwise the software is as
you<00:01:51.930> would<00:01:52.049> expect<00:01:52.110> exactly<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.729> an<00:01:53.970> iPad

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
you would expect exactly like an iPad

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.660 
you would expect exactly like an iPad
there's<00:01:55.590> nothing<00:01:55.979> really<00:01:56.130> different<00:01:56.310> about

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
there's nothing really different about

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.459 
there's nothing really different about
the<00:01:56.850> software<00:01:57.240> at<00:01:57.329> all<00:01:57.420> here<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:58.140> running

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
the software at all here it's running

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.859 
the software at all here it's running
iOS<00:01:58.649> 6<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.700> one<00:01:59.880> thing<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.180> will<00:02:00.329> notice<00:02:00.509> is

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
iOS 6 the one thing you will notice is

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:01.999 
iOS 6 the one thing you will notice is
that<00:02:00.899> because<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.469> screen<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.770> smaller

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
that because the screen is smaller

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.160 
that because the screen is smaller
things<00:02:02.549> are<00:02:02.909> smaller<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.810> but<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.049> does

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
things are smaller on it but it does

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.660 
things are smaller on it but it does
take<00:02:04.320> some<00:02:04.350> getting<00:02:04.710> used<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.250> keyboard

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
take some getting used to the keyboard

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.219 
take some getting used to the keyboard
feels<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.030> bit<00:02:06.180> smaller<00:02:06.479> for<00:02:06.630> instance<00:02:07.079> in

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
feels a bit smaller for instance in

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.660 
feels a bit smaller for instance in
portrait<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.890> seems<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.369> should<00:02:08.520> be<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
portrait it seems like it should be a

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.639 
portrait it seems like it should be a
little<00:02:08.819> bit<00:02:09.000> taller<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:10.080> landscape<00:02:10.530> it's

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
little bit taller in landscape it's

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.290 
little bit taller in landscape it's
actually<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.920> bit<00:02:11.069> easier<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.520> use<00:02:11.879> because<00:02:12.150> of

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
actually a bit easier to use because of

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.800 
actually a bit easier to use because of
the<00:02:12.480> way<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.660> can<00:02:12.870> grip<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.110> tab

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
the way you can grip the tab

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.830 
the way you can grip the tab
of<00:02:14.170> course<00:02:14.439> because<00:02:14.739> it<00:02:15.099> is<00:02:15.129> just<00:02:15.999> an<00:02:16.120> iPad<00:02:16.540> it

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
of course because it is just an iPad it

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.739 
of course because it is just an iPad it
runs<00:02:17.079> all<00:02:17.469> of<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.739> iPad<00:02:18.040> software<00:02:18.579> and<00:02:18.819> I

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:19.749 
runs all of the iPad software and I

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.720 
runs all of the iPad software and I
would<00:02:20.049> say<00:02:20.170> that's<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:20.709> biggest<00:02:20.920> strength<00:02:21.549> of

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
would say that's the biggest strength of

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.339 
would say that's the biggest strength of
this<00:02:21.819> device<00:02:22.150> in<00:02:22.389> comparison<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:22.930> anything

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
this device in comparison to anything

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.080 
this device in comparison to anything
else<00:02:23.469> on<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.769> market<00:02:24.129> there's<00:02:24.700> just<00:02:24.939> an

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
else on the market there's just an

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.509 
else on the market there's just an
enormous<00:02:25.359> selection<00:02:26.049> of<00:02:26.109> apps<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:26.620> they<00:02:27.040> run

enormous selection of apps and they run

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.190 
enormous selection of apps and they run
really<00:02:27.730> well<00:02:27.879> on<00:02:28.209> it<00:02:28.389> inside<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.930> device

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
really well on it inside the device

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.490 
really well on it inside the device
there<00:02:29.680> is<00:02:29.709> an<00:02:30.159> a5<00:02:30.549> CPU<00:02:31.269> which<00:02:31.569> is<00:02:31.750> actually<00:02:32.319> an

there is an a5 CPU which is actually an

there is an a5 CPU which is actually an
older<00:02:32.920> generation<00:02:33.099> processor<00:02:33.969> but

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
older generation processor but

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.599 
older generation processor but
performance<00:02:34.930> seemed<00:02:35.200> pretty<00:02:35.469> decent<00:02:35.920> games

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
performance seemed pretty decent games

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.970 
performance seemed pretty decent games
worked<00:02:37.000> well<00:02:37.299> and<00:02:37.799> almost<00:02:38.799> everything

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
worked well and almost everything

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.789 
worked well and almost everything
started<00:02:39.400> up<00:02:39.489> quickly<00:02:39.760> there<00:02:40.299> were<00:02:40.389> a<00:02:40.450> few

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
started up quickly there were a few

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.839 
started up quickly there were a few
graphically<00:02:41.799> intensive<00:02:42.219> games<00:02:42.489> that<00:02:42.760> were

graphically intensive games that were

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.670 
graphically intensive games that were
larger<00:02:43.389> that<00:02:43.569> took<00:02:43.719> a<00:02:43.810> little<00:02:44.109> bit<00:02:44.230> longer<00:02:44.439> to

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
larger that took a little bit longer to

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.860 
larger that took a little bit longer to
start<00:02:44.889> up<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.219> I<00:02:45.280> would<00:02:45.760> have<00:02:45.849> liked<00:02:46.090> but<00:02:46.299> in

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
start up and I would have liked but in

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.330 
start up and I would have liked but in
comparison<00:02:47.109> to<00:02:47.409> an<00:02:47.500> iPad<00:02:47.799> 2<00:02:48.040> they<00:02:48.280> were

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
comparison to an iPad 2 they were

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.270 
comparison to an iPad 2 they were
certainly<00:02:48.730> on<00:02:49.000> par<00:02:49.719> the<00:02:50.290> device<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:50.680> tested<00:02:51.069> had

certainly on par the device I tested had

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.339 
certainly on par the device I tested had
Wi-Fi<00:02:51.790> but<00:02:52.090> Apple's<00:02:52.389> going<00:02:52.569> to<00:02:52.629> be<00:02:52.689> making<00:02:52.870> LTE

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349

Wi-Fi but Apple's going to be making LTE
versions<00:02:53.799> as<00:02:53.919> well<00:02:53.949> and<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.909> course<00:02:55.120> like

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
versions as well and of course like

versions as well and of course like
every<00:02:55.840> other<00:02:55.930> iPad<00:02:56.319> there's<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.560> variety<00:02:56.739> of

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
every other iPad there's a variety of

every other iPad there's a variety of

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
storage sizes you can get 16 all the way

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.839 
storage sizes you can get 16 all the way
up<00:03:00.189> to<00:03:00.370> 64<00:03:00.939> gigs<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.780> iPad<00:03:02.319> Mini<00:03:02.650> starts<00:03:03.250> at<00:03:03.430> a

up to 64 gigs the iPad Mini starts at a

up to 64 gigs the iPad Mini starts at a
not<00:03:04.150> super<00:03:04.659> cheap<00:03:05.219> $329<00:03:06.219> and<00:03:06.459> you<00:03:06.639> can<00:03:06.849> get<00:03:07.419> it

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
not super cheap $329 and you can get it

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.110 
not super cheap $329 and you can get it
Specht<00:03:08.139> up<00:03:08.379> all<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.829> way<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.040> six<00:03:09.819> hundred<00:03:09.849> and

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
Specht up all the way to six hundred and

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.879 
Specht up all the way to six hundred and
fifty<00:03:10.359> nine<00:03:10.540> dollars<00:03:10.569> that's<00:03:11.139> a<00:03:11.199> 64<00:03:11.709> gig

version<00:03:12.280> with<00:03:12.459> LTE<00:03:12.819> I<00:03:13.209> think<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.139> price<00:03:14.530> is

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
version with LTE I think the price is

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.500 
version with LTE I think the price is
actually<00:03:14.889> really<00:03:15.219> telling<00:03:15.609> about<00:03:15.730> how<00:03:16.090> Apple

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
actually really telling about how Apple

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.229 
actually really telling about how Apple
thinks<00:03:17.319> about<00:03:17.560> this<00:03:17.829> kind<00:03:18.099> of<00:03:18.189> tablet<00:03:18.669> I<00:03:18.819> don't

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
thinks about this kind of tablet I don't

that Apple thinks is cheap they just

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.580 
that Apple thinks is cheap they just
wanted<00:03:36.669> to<00:03:36.790> offer<00:03:37.060> an<00:03:37.239> alternative<00:03:37.590> version

wanted to offer an alternative version

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.309 
wanted to offer an alternative version
of<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.769> iPad<00:03:39.159> the<00:03:39.579> Nexus<00:03:39.909> 7<00:03:40.030> retails<00:03:40.540> for<00:03:40.599> $200

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
of the iPad the Nexus 7 retails for $200

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.339 
of the iPad the Nexus 7 retails for $200
at<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.500> low<00:03:41.709> end<00:03:41.949> and<00:03:42.220> for<00:03:42.819> most<00:03:42.970> consumers

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
at the low end and for most consumers

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.080 
at the low end and for most consumers
$129<00:03:44.349> gap<00:03:44.680> is<00:03:44.949> actually<00:03:45.129> a<00:03:45.370> pretty<00:03:45.549> big<00:03:45.639> golf

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
$129 gap is actually a pretty big golf

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.599 
$129 gap is actually a pretty big golf
so<00:03:46.569> I<00:03:46.599> think<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:47.049> question<00:03:47.169> when<00:03:48.040> considering

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
so I think the question when considering

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.490 
so I think the question when considering
the<00:03:48.699> iPad<00:03:49.000> Mini<00:03:49.269> isn't<00:03:49.689> do<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:49.930> want<00:03:50.079> the<00:03:50.169> iPad

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
the iPad Mini isn't do you want the iPad

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.319 
the iPad Mini isn't do you want the iPad
Mini<00:03:50.739> or<00:03:50.829> the<00:03:51.129> Nexus<00:03:51.489> 7<00:03:51.639> or<00:03:51.939> some<00:03:52.150> other

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
Mini or the Nexus 7 or some other

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.719 
Mini or the Nexus 7 or some other
cheaper<00:03:52.780> tablet<00:03:52.959> it's<00:03:53.590> do<00:03:54.069> you<00:03:54.159> want<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.430> iPad

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:54.729 
cheaper tablet it's do you want the iPad

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:58.049 
cheaper tablet it's do you want the iPad
Mini<00:03:54.970> or<00:03:55.239> a<00:03:55.299> bigger<00:03:55.840> iPad
