cord<00:00:41.449> through<00:00:41.809> so<00:00:42.050> we<00:00:42.290> had<00:00:42.410> to<00:00:42.530> be<00:00:42.620> able<00:00:42.739> to<00:00:43.010> do

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
cord through so we had to be able to do

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.870 
cord through so we had to be able to do
that<00:00:44.469> this<00:00:45.469> is<00:00:45.620> what<00:00:45.770> we<00:00:45.890> came<00:00:45.920> up<00:00:46.160> with<00:00:46.520> for

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
that this is what we came up with for

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.090 
that this is what we came up with for
them<00:00:48.160> uses<00:00:49.629> snakeweed<00:00:50.680> which<00:00:51.680> is<00:00:51.860> very

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
them uses snakeweed which is very

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:02.100 
them uses snakeweed which is very
flexible<00:00:52.809> uses<00:00:53.809> a<00:00:53.840> lot<00:00:54.050> of<00:00:54.110> cord<00:00:58.570> on<00:00:59.570> this<00:00:59.840> end

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
flexible uses a lot of cord on this end

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.730 
flexible uses a lot of cord on this end
normally<00:01:03.110> a<00:01:03.140> snake<00:01:04.009> lead<00:01:04.250> has<00:01:04.489> two<00:01:05.500> loose<00:01:06.500> ends

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
normally a snake lead has two loose ends

normally a snake lead has two loose ends
coming<00:01:07.130> out<00:01:07.280> what<00:01:07.700> we<00:01:07.820> did<00:01:07.850> was<00:01:08.180> we<00:01:08.330> loop<00:01:08.509> them

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
coming out what we did was we loop them

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.680 
coming out what we did was we loop them
back<00:01:08.899> through<00:01:09.289> and<00:01:09.700> then<00:01:10.700> interwove<00:01:11.420> them

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
back through and then interwove them

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.380 
back through and then interwove them
inside<00:01:12.229> so<00:01:12.680> that<00:01:12.890> as<00:01:13.100> there's<00:01:13.520> tension<00:01:13.820> put<00:01:14.240> on

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
inside so that as there's tension put on

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.359 
inside so that as there's tension put on
this<00:01:14.570> loop<00:01:15.189> it<00:01:16.189> tightens<00:01:16.700> them<00:01:16.939> up<00:01:17.799> so<00:01:18.799> this

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
this loop it tightens them up so this

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.640 
this loop it tightens them up so this
retention<00:01:20.060> area<00:01:20.540> right<00:01:20.720> here<00:01:20.750> is<00:01:21.049> very<00:01:21.409> very

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
retention area right here is very very

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.460 
retention area right here is very very
strong<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:22.369> as<00:01:23.119> more<00:01:23.510> tension<00:01:23.780> gets<00:01:24.049> put<00:01:24.350> on

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
strong and as more tension gets put on

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.530 
strong and as more tension gets put on
it<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:24.979> tighter<00:01:25.310> it's<00:01:26.060> held<00:01:26.270> on<00:01:26.450> to<00:01:28.150> and<00:01:29.150> we're

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
it the tighter it's held on to and we're

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.620 
it the tighter it's held on to and we're
using<00:01:29.869> an<00:01:30.110> eyelet<00:01:30.530> from<00:01:31.400> that<00:01:31.549> corn<00:01:31.970> for<00:01:32.509> the

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
using an eyelet from that corn for the

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
we'll be producing these for them and

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.230 
we'll be producing these for them and
this<00:03:08.240> design<00:03:08.620> will<00:03:09.620> be<00:03:09.740> unique<00:03:10.070> to<00:03:10.100> them<00:03:10.460> so<00:03:10.820> if

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
this design will be unique to them so if

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.000 
this design will be unique to them so if
