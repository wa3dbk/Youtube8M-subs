00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.440
 Hello everyone 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.089
 It is the end of the world rubber market 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:15.540
 This time 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:20.300
 We will do it in terms of raising the defensive range of the Cutman . 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:26.619
 I can not judge the course that will come even if I look at the opponent's racket 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.619
 I was asked the question how can I pick it up on a wide course 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:35.780
 That say broaden the reach to take to cut man-important top of the foundation of the cut man 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.300
 It can be said that it is a part 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:44.800
 As play from the middle team by this person becomes the main 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:47.920
 It is necessary to keep moving much larger than the attack type 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.020
 In other words, how much cut you cut 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:59.100
 Even if there is a technique called knuckle or 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:01:03.989
 If there is no movement or judgment that can pick up an attack, it will be meaningless 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:08.250
 Because the cutman must move more than attack type after all 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.330
 I think that I do I need to practice also move many times of attack 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:17.000
 Not not you going to do to be just blindly in 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:20.000
 Effectively upgrade the level by firmly holding the points to be explained from now 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.600
 I think I can 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.799
 The first point is 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:30.020
 Course taking to limit the course of the opponent's batting ball 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:36.140
 Is important 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:38.270
 For example, if you have been tumbling or cutting green , your opponent will drive or smash to wide angle 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:44.350
 Than likely the attack say 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.350
 In fact, your feet will stop and it will be difficult to pick up a long distance 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:56.009
 So, for example, it is hard to cut the side strictly to the forehead or cut 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:59.789
 By practicing firmly, you say the fore and the other party jumps while breaking the posture 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:03.840
 If it is, there will be no quick attack on the straight 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.720
 Most of the time cross cross direction 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.520
 Cross 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.140
 I think it will come to say 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:15.760
 Even if the other party is somewhat strict by doing 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:20.470
 If you know the course even if you hit the course twice 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:23.850
 It will be easy to move to there easy to cut 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:31.100
 'S even in order to increase their prediction in 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:31.100
 Please be aware of the course type that can firmly limit the course that the other player strikes 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:41.800
 The second point is 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:48.970
 The course will be determined from the angle and body orientation of the opponent's racket 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:51.190
 In fact , the course is judged by the angle of the body or the angle of the racket when the opponent strikes, for example, a drive. 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.670
 will do so 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.670
 For example 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.020
 The other party is 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.880
 When you want to hit straight 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:05.850
 I want out in straight because when the fore the body is facing here is facing the 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.830
 I can't hit it straight because this is absolutely 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:13.050
 So when you want to say straight to your opponent you say that the body is a little more than when hitting the cross 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:18.660
 I'm facing here 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:20.330
 I open the angle of the racket to slightly shoot the moment I drive 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.360
 The wind Tteyuu 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:27.850
 There are points to beat in order to always confide course 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:32.980
 Even at the time of back swing 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.430
 It can not be called unless I step on it, but at that time I turned to see where the other party is looking 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.210
 Is there 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.990
 By going to focus on the place Tteyuu 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:44.970
 Determine your opponent's course 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:50.790
 If you predict, you will be able to move smoothly 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:55.920
 Well this is the first point from the course Well taken course to limit the fixed ball course 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.360
 Of the Ya racket of the angle of the second point the other party say 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:03.130
 Body 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:08.530
 Or a place called to determine the course from the direction view the other party doing what they 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:14.180
 It's about how to make predictions to move 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:17.370
 The say it is the third point last point of the Following is 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:22.800
 Now it has become a way of movement 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:28.110
 Specifically, we are actually preparing this way and it is Kitatama in the foreground 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.979
 For example, if one step moves only this much , the body is more inclined to say that the soul farther than that 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.900
 End up 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:34.300
 Not Deki firmly won what 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.350
 So, for example, 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:41.950
 To the fore 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:45.520
 Go back and cut stretched mountain a firm foot the body to straddle the Ru large 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:51.000
 It is the same here too You can cut it back with tension 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:56.529
 For example, in some cases it may not be a step 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.569
 Pattern that say moving the here who Tteyuu moving to footwork 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:02.910
 I think that there are various cases, but the distance that can move 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:06.060
 To make 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:10.249
 Is important 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:14.840
 Three points to increase this Catman's defensive range 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:19.529
 Course dolly to limit the course of hitting balls 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:26.310
 Determine the course from the angle of the opponent's racket 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:32.100
 These three points to spread the range that you can move firmly 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.310
 What kind of effect does the practice that you are actually doing now that Fran is conscious of in practice? 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.950
 Or 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:42.060
 Once the contents of the practice is darker by to be aware that say 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.810
 Level up firmly to each other by such awareness 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:50.080
 Can be great 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:52.440
 So if you are not conscious of this kind of thing, I think we can do it from tomorrow, so do it by all means 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.440
 Please try
