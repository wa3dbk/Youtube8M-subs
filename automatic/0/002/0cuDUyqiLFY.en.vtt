um so that would be nice to carry some

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.819 
um so that would be nice to carry some
little<00:01:36.689> floss<00:01:36.930> picks<00:01:37.200> around<00:01:37.560> with<00:01:37.650> me<00:01:37.799> I

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
little floss picks around with me I

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.960 
little floss picks around with me I
guess<00:01:38.150> next<00:01:39.150> thing<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.750> see<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.229> here<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.650> a

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.639 

sample<00:01:44.970> size<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.350> some<00:01:46.350> dove<00:01:47.180> body<00:01:48.180> wash<00:01:48.479> um<00:01:48.869> I

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
sample size of some dove body wash um I

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.260 
sample size of some dove body wash um I
thought<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.100> was<00:01:50.159> shampoo<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> second<00:01:51.119> but

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
thought it was shampoo for a second but

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.960 
thought it was shampoo for a second but
body<00:01:51.420> wash<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.810> probably<00:01:52.170> better<00:01:52.680> cuz<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.579> says

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
body wash is probably better cuz it says

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.010 
body wash is probably better cuz it says
it's<00:01:54.180> deep<00:01:54.420> moisture<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.649> um<00:01:56.630> yeah<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.810> guess

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
it's deep moisture so um yeah I guess

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.490 
it's deep moisture so um yeah I guess
that'll<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.350> good<00:01:58.469> for<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.460> wintertime<00:02:00.500> it

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
that'll be good for the wintertime it

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.139 
that'll be good for the wintertime it
smells<00:02:01.770> pretty<00:02:01.890> good<00:02:02.040> too<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.549> don't<00:02:03.030> really

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
smells pretty good too I don't really

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.690 
smells pretty good too I don't really
used<00:02:03.479> up<00:02:03.719> products<00:02:04.079> very<00:02:04.290> often<00:02:04.619> but<00:02:04.860> um<00:02:05.430> I'll

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.620 
products smell pretty good but yeah just
kind<00:06:18.620> of<00:06:18.770> not<00:06:19.550> really<00:06:19.580> anything<00:06:20.030> new<00:06:20.210> for<00:06:20.570> me

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
kind of not really anything new for me

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.560 
kind of not really anything new for me
um<00:06:20.930> and<00:06:21.740> so<00:06:22.280> basically<00:06:22.520> that<00:06:22.850> is<00:06:23.120> it<00:06:23.300> for<00:06:23.330> the

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
um and so basically that is it for the

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.390 
um and so basically that is it for the
box<00:06:23.750> not<00:06:24.110> really<00:06:24.290> super<00:06:24.590> exciting<00:06:24.950> I<00:06:25.100> guess<00:06:25.250> it

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400
