00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:08.189
 hello dear friends with you 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:13.400
 today I will show you 3 of the most interesting 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.400
 facts minecraft I do not switch 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.670
 I think many people know about the end of the world in 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.610
 minecraft 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.510
 where itâ€™s really normal 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.690
 phenomenon 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.730
 but unfortunately to my disappointment 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.660
 almost no one knows about another 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.270
 normal zone 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.489
 well and in order to get there you 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.770
 you need either 6 to go to your own 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.380
 distant lands of minecraft or just 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.350
 just teleport and in this zone 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.379
 all blocks behave very strangely 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.170
 which having the property of crumbling 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:57.769
 for some reason in this zone they behave 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.140
 but like any other solid block but we 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.870
 go to viewing the second factor you 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.540
 want to enchant the sword so that no one 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.420
 knew what charmed besides you but to 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.330
 Unfortunately, you do not know how to do it 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.450
 problem you just need to enter in 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.550
 command block here this command then 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.210
 specify and text that will cover 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:23.200
 el-chan ayti gancha well and of course 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.509
 caught and something then activate it 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.880
 the sword is in our inventory well 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:33.110
 if of course there is a place for him 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:36.170
 Why is the demon said pieces I advise 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.380
 you listen but we do not view 3 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.229
 fact and the third fact will be useful to know 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.729
 gardeners decorators and start than 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.820
 minecraft florist 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.670
 after all, it turns out she was waiting for meters carcass 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.090
 now lets on plowed land 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.960

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:00.020
