here but metal gear solid is a great

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.130 
here but metal gear solid is a great
story<00:00:41.879> it's<00:00:42.149> something<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.629> couldn't<00:00:43.050> be

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
story it's something that couldn't be

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.319 
story it's something that couldn't be
told<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:43.860> 1<00:00:43.980> movie<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.640> either<00:00:44.789> you're

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
told in just 1 movie so either you're

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.490 
told in just 1 movie so either you're
going<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.870> have<00:00:46.020> some<00:00:46.230> sort<00:00:46.350> of

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
going to have to have some sort of

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.220 
going to have to have some sort of
origin<00:00:47.010> story<00:00:47.340> or<00:00:47.700> one<00:00:48.180> movie<00:00:48.600> that's<00:00:48.809> telling

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
origin story or one movie that's telling

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.439 
origin story or one movie that's telling
the<00:00:49.379> part<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.160> story<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.700> one<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.149> games

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
the part of a story of one of the games

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.200 
the part of a story of one of the games
or<00:00:51.719> something<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.320> or<00:00:53.210> multiple

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
or something like that or multiple

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.330 
or something like that or multiple
movies<00:00:54.600> I'd<00:00:54.809> love<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.199> see<00:00:55.350> multiple<00:00:55.890> really

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
movies I'd love to see multiple really

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.160 
movies I'd love to see multiple really
great<00:00:56.579> movies<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.270> think<00:00:57.629> that's<00:00:57.899> more<00:00:58.109> of

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
great movies but I think that's more of

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.790 
great movies but I think that's more of
a<00:00:58.940> far-fetched<00:00:59.940> dream<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.750> my<00:01:00.870> opinion<00:01:01.230> but

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
a far-fetched dream in my opinion but

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.709 
a far-fetched dream in my opinion but
looking<00:01:02.250> at<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.550> article<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.180> they've

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.300 
could really mean anything personally I
haven't<00:01:18.810> seen<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.049> movie<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:20.070> don't

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
haven't seen that movie so I don't

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.580 
haven't seen that movie so I don't
really<00:01:20.369> know<00:01:20.640> if<00:01:20.670> it's<00:01:20.850> any<00:01:21.060> good<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.330> not<00:01:21.450> but

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
really know if it's any good or not but

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.230 
really know if it's any good or not but
just<00:01:22.590> because<00:01:23.280> they're<00:01:23.729> looking<00:01:24.060> for<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
just because they're looking for a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.940 
just because they're looking for a
director<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.110> means<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.770> they

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
director of this it means that they

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.070 
director of this it means that they
probably<00:01:26.250> already<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> script<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.930> so

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
probably already have a script to it so

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.330 
probably already have a script to it so
if<00:01:28.140> they've<00:01:28.290> got<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.530> script<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.250> they
