 of a length and quality rather 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.230
 poor 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.719
 we also find a record 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.179
 of use which is very good 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.640
 detailed and which is proposed in French 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:08.640
 but also in English with its weight of 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.250
 34 g and its thickness of all sold 20 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.710
 mm this connected watch is done 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.590
 easily forget is rather nice to 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.230
 wear on the wrist on the front of the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.640
 shows a screen of 1.54 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.230
 inches with a resolution of 240 by 240 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.480
 on the right side we find you the 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:32.370
 micro usb connector and the button 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.980
 back to the lake the i on the side 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.500
 left we find the microphone and on the 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.480
 top we find the speakers the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.100
 watch is compatible with ios and 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.140
 android but unfortunately 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.520
 the pitch in application available 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.590
 only on android 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.890
 so if you are a user at ios 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.080
 you will not have access to notifications 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.790
 email from social networks and sending out 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.470
 posts 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.240
 pairing the watch with the 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.070
 smartphone is very simple there you 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.020
 just activate the bluetooth on your 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.990
 smartphone and wait for the 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.240
 smartphone is detected the watch in order to 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.310
 the select the sale allows access 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.710
 to different functions for example 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.970
 send or receive text messages but 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.860
 only on android 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.420
 you can have access to his diary 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.570
 calls or his contacts 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.550
 we can also control the 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.520
 music from his smartphone and put it 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.890
 on his watch connected so we can 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.380
 have access to a pedometer a calendar 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.430
 at an alarm a stopwatch a 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.200
 voice recorder 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.750
 we can also have access to these 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.400
 notifications so also filiation of 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.110
 social network mails etc 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.240
 but unfortunately it's only 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.880
 on android and one can also 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.090
 dial a number or use so 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.340
 syria if you have a compatible iphone 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.230
 we will conclude this video with my opinion 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.340
 on this watch connected so I the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.739
 find really very friendly 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.450
 thanks to its features and 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.780
 to its design but I find it a pity 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.459
 that it does not have application on ios and 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.680
 as well as some features like 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.530
 sending and receiving messages or 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.360
 receiving notification directly 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.450
 on the watch connect either 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.769

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.170

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.830
