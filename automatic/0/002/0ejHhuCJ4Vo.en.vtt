00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
for back here to go along the before the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.590 
for back here to go along the before the
cabinet<00:02:00.240> meet<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.720> fiberglass<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:02.479> yeah<00:02:03.479> it

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
cabinet meet the fiberglass and yeah it

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.999 
cabinet meet the fiberglass and yeah it
should<00:02:03.810> be<00:02:03.930> pretty<00:02:04.080> much<00:02:04.200> done<00:02:04.350> as<00:02:04.740> far<00:02:04.979> as

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
should be pretty much done as far as

should be pretty much done as far as
that<00:02:05.280> goes

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
that goes

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.789

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
started the generator for about a month

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.780 
started the generator for about a month
I<00:02:59.010> don't<00:02:59.940> use<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.120> much<00:03:04.310> well<00:03:05.310> we<00:03:05.340> discovered

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
I don't use it much well we discovered

I don't use it much well we discovered
something<00:03:06.090> he's<00:03:06.540> wondering<00:03:06.900> why<00:03:07.079> it<00:03:07.140> was<00:03:07.380> kind

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
something he's wondering why it was kind

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.990 
something he's wondering why it was kind
of<00:03:07.680> running<00:03:07.890> weird<00:03:08.310> sometimes

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
of running weird sometimes

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.030 
of running weird sometimes
it<00:03:09.480> was<00:03:09.690> still<00:03:09.870> running<00:03:09.989> okay<00:03:10.440> but<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.769> wasn't

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
it was still running okay but it wasn't

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.170 
it was still running okay but it wasn't
running<00:03:11.130> properly<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:12.230> then<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:14.150> opened<00:03:15.150> up

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
running properly and then I opened up

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.830 
running properly and then I opened up
the<00:03:15.299> generator<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:15.989> I<00:03:16.680> found<00:03:16.920> this

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
the generator and I found this

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.180 
the generator and I found this
disconnected<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:19.799> know<00:03:19.890> what<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.160> is

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
disconnected you know what that is

ladies and gentlemen that's the choke

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.660 
ladies and gentlemen that's the choke
generator<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:27.410> unfortunately<00:03:28.410> this<00:03:29.370> piece

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
generator so unfortunately this piece

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.900 
generator so unfortunately this piece
was<00:03:29.850> there<00:03:30.030> too<00:03:30.209> unfortunately<00:03:31.640> you<00:03:32.640> can't

was there too unfortunately you can't

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.460 
was there too unfortunately you can't
exactly<00:03:33.120> service<00:03:33.870> these<00:03:34.049> things<00:03:34.290> without

exactly service these things without

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.289 
exactly service these things without
taking<00:03:35.010> them<00:03:35.160> out<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.370> it's<00:03:35.850> bolted<00:03:36.120> right

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.569 
through the floor and you have to
disconnect<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.390> vehicle<00:03:39.750> fuel<00:03:39.989> line<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:41.280> even

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
disconnect the vehicle fuel line to even

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.309 
disconnect the vehicle fuel line to even
think<00:03:41.910> about<00:03:41.970> taking<00:03:42.569> a<00:03:42.750> generator<00:03:43.109> out

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
think about taking a generator out

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.439 
think about taking a generator out
before<00:03:43.829> you<00:03:43.920> come<00:03:44.040> Paulton<00:03:44.430> so<00:03:45.030> it's<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.269> real

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:45.449 
before you come Paulton so it's a real

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:47.059 
before you come Paulton so it's a real
pain<00:03:45.720> in<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.840> butt

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
pain in the butt

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.520 
pain in the butt
but<00:03:48.120> here's<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.239> thing<00:03:49.270> I<00:03:49.660> don't<00:03:50.140> use<00:03:50.260> it<00:03:50.290> much

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
but here's the thing I don't use it much

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.250 
but here's the thing I don't use it much
I<00:03:52.680> use<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.830> generator<00:03:54.660> well<00:03:55.660> I've<00:03:55.780> used<00:03:55.810> it

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
I use the generator well I've used it

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.440 
I use the generator well I've used it
maybe<00:03:56.620> about<00:03:56.920> 20<00:03:57.790> times<00:03:59.880> there<00:04:00.880> was<00:04:01.060> a<00:04:01.120> time

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
maybe about 20 times there was a time

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.050 
maybe about 20 times there was a time
when<00:04:01.660> my<00:04:01.840> my<00:04:02.739> old<00:04:02.950> cheap<00:04:03.310> inverter<00:04:03.670> wasn't

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
when my my old cheap inverter wasn't

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.520 
when my my old cheap inverter wasn't
working<00:04:04.300> so<00:04:04.330> I<00:04:04.540> was<00:04:04.690> using<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:04.989> generator<00:04:05.349> to

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
working so I was using the generator to

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.610 
working so I was using the generator to
charge<00:04:05.560> my<00:04:05.860> laptop<00:04:05.890> up<00:04:06.400> every<00:04:06.670> couple<00:04:06.910> of<00:04:06.970> days

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
charge my laptop up every couple of days

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.650 
charge my laptop up every couple of days
now<00:04:08.620> I<00:04:08.650> got<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:08.950> new<00:04:09.099> inverter<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:09.760> laptop

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
now I got a new inverter and laptop

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.000 
now I got a new inverter and laptop
chargers<00:04:11.050> just<00:04:11.230> flying<00:04:11.380> off<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.560> batteries

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
chargers just flying off the batteries

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.740 
chargers just flying off the batteries
and<00:04:12.220> I<00:04:12.280> can't<00:04:12.580> kill<00:04:12.790> these<00:04:12.970> batteries<00:04:13.390> I<00:04:13.540> can't

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
and I can't kill these batteries I can't

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.870 
and I can't kill these batteries I can't
even<00:04:13.840> bring<00:04:14.110> him<00:04:14.200> down<00:04:14.380> down<00:04:15.130> to<00:04:15.280> 50<00:04:15.550> percent

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
even bring him down down to 50 percent

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.830 
even bring him down down to 50 percent
even<00:04:16.150> with<00:04:16.269> all<00:04:16.480> my<00:04:16.680> LED<00:04:17.680> lights<00:04:17.919> on<00:04:18.190> my<00:04:18.840> stereo

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
even with all my LED lights on my stereo

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.040 
even with all my LED lights on my stereo
on<00:04:20.139> all<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:20.440> time<00:04:20.620> so<00:04:20.889> I<00:04:21.570> don't<00:04:22.570> think<00:04:22.900> I<00:04:22.990> need

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
on all the time so I don't think I need

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.510 
on all the time so I don't think I need
the<00:04:23.229> generator<00:04:23.650> and<00:04:23.800> I've<00:04:24.100> been<00:04:24.280> thinking

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
the generator and I've been thinking

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.680 
the generator and I've been thinking
about<00:04:24.610> this<00:04:24.790> a<00:04:24.850> long<00:04:25.060> time<00:04:25.120> and<00:04:25.419> I've

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
about this a long time and I've

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.570 
about this a long time and I've
mentioned<00:04:26.500> this<00:04:26.560> before<00:04:26.710> on<00:04:26.979> my<00:04:27.010> channel

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580

solar and batteries and forget the

solar and batteries and forget the
generator<00:04:43.389> the<00:04:43.990> only<00:04:44.470> time<00:04:45.250> that<00:04:45.280> I<00:04:45.490> really

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
generator the only time that I really

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.760 
generator the only time that I really
needed<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.450> generator<00:04:46.870> forget<00:04:47.260> that<00:04:47.410> when<00:04:47.500> my

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
needed the generator forget that when my

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.920 
needed the generator forget that when my
inverter<00:04:48.010> was<00:04:48.280> was<00:04:48.880> broken<00:04:49.450> and<00:04:49.540> I<00:04:49.630> was<00:04:49.780> using

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
inverter was was broken and I was using

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.600 
inverter was was broken and I was using
it<00:04:50.110> just<00:04:50.139> to<00:04:50.350> charge<00:04:50.590> my<00:04:50.770> laptop<00:04:50.800> because<00:04:51.490> I

don't have a 12 volt adapter for my
laptop<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:54.190> only<00:04:54.430> other<00:04:54.580> time<00:04:54.760> I<00:04:54.820> use<00:04:55.090> it<00:04:55.120> was

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
laptop the only other time I use it was

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.390 
laptop the only other time I use it was
once<00:04:55.600> back<00:04:55.900> in<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:56.110> summer<00:04:56.410> when<00:04:56.620> it<00:04:56.710> was<00:04:56.860> over

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
once back in the summer when it was over

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.490 
once back in the summer when it was over
40<00:04:57.700> degrees<00:04:57.820> it<00:04:58.240> was<00:04:58.300> sweltering<00:04:58.960> hot<00:04:59.140> and<00:04:59.410> I

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
40 degrees it was sweltering hot and I

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.810 
40 degrees it was sweltering hot and I
was<00:04:59.620> waiting<00:04:59.800> in<00:05:00.010> line<00:05:00.190> at<00:05:00.340> a<00:05:00.400> music<00:05:00.669> festival

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
was waiting in line at a music festival

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.180 
was waiting in line at a music festival
and<00:05:01.479> started<00:05:02.260> up<00:05:02.320> the<00:05:02.440> generator<00:05:02.740> for<00:05:03.010> about

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
and started up the generator for about

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.670 
and started up the generator for about
an<00:05:03.400> hour<00:05:03.700> and<00:05:04.000> let<00:05:04.180> everyone<00:05:04.960> come<00:05:05.229> inside<00:05:05.380> to

an hour and let everyone come inside to

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.560 
an hour and let everyone come inside to

keep cool for my art my air conditioning
never<00:05:10.570> really<00:05:10.840> use<00:05:10.960> it<00:05:11.080> otherwise<00:05:11.320> I<00:05:11.530> just

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
never really use it otherwise I just

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.320 
never really use it otherwise I just

shade<00:05:20.760> the<00:05:21.760> only<00:05:22.000> other<00:05:22.150> thing<00:05:22.330> is<00:05:22.419> the

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
shade the only other thing is the

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.810 
shade the only other thing is the
microwave<00:05:22.810> which<00:05:23.740> again<00:05:24.039> I<00:05:24.310> think<00:05:24.669> I've<00:05:24.789> used

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
microwave which again I think I've used

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.290 
microwave which again I think I've used
four<00:05:25.210> times<00:05:25.470> in<00:05:26.470> a<00:05:26.590> year<00:05:26.620> in<00:05:27.550> over<00:05:27.700> a<00:05:27.850> year

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
four times in a year in over a year

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.610 
four times in a year in over a year
so<00:05:29.250> not<00:05:30.250> necessary<00:05:30.729> and<00:05:30.970> I<00:05:31.900> would<00:05:32.229> be<00:05:32.320> just<00:05:32.500> as

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
so not necessary and I would be just as

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.730 
so not necessary and I would be just as
happy<00:05:32.680> to<00:05:32.919> get<00:05:33.100> rid<00:05:33.250> of<00:05:33.280> both<00:05:33.460> of<00:05:33.639> those<00:05:33.729> and

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
happy to get rid of both of those and

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.230 
happy to get rid of both of those and
maybe<00:05:35.740> leave<00:05:35.919> it<00:05:36.070> maybe<00:05:36.400> leave<00:05:36.639> it<00:05:36.789> and<00:05:36.940> you

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
maybe leave it maybe leave it and you

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.969 
maybe leave it maybe leave it and you
can<00:05:37.479> run<00:05:37.750> the<00:05:37.900> AC<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.350> the<00:05:38.410> microwave<00:05:38.800> off

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
can run the AC and the microwave off

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.370 
can run the AC and the microwave off
enough<00:05:39.280> batteries<00:05:39.729> if<00:05:39.970> you<00:05:40.150> want<00:05:40.539> but<00:05:40.840> again

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
enough batteries if you want but again

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.600 
enough batteries if you want but again
it's<00:05:41.530> something<00:05:41.650> that<00:05:41.800> I<00:05:41.950> barely<00:05:42.130> ever<00:05:42.250> used

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
it's something that I barely ever used

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.710 
it's something that I barely ever used
so<00:05:42.850> I'm<00:05:43.060> just<00:05:43.180> it's<00:05:43.419> just<00:05:43.600> wasting<00:05:43.900> space<00:05:44.070> but

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
so I'm just it's just wasting space but

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.779

110<00:06:12.070> amp<00:06:12.250> our<00:06:12.400> batteries<00:06:13.440> so<00:06:14.440> I<00:06:14.470> could<00:06:14.830> add<00:06:14.950> one

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
110 amp our batteries so I could add one

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.010 
110 amp our batteries so I could add one
or<00:06:15.280> two<00:06:15.370> more<00:06:15.580> back<00:06:15.760> they're<00:06:16.090> given<00:06:16.840> there's

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
or two more back they're given there's

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.860 
or two more back they're given there's
the<00:06:17.200> space<00:06:17.440> and<00:06:18.060> hook<00:06:19.060> him<00:06:19.150> up<00:06:19.210> to<00:06:19.330> my<00:06:19.510> three

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
the space and hook him up to my three

the space and hook him up to my three
solar<00:06:20.080> panels<00:06:20.470> possibly<00:06:21.310> add<00:06:21.430> more<00:06:21.700> and<00:06:22.000> I

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
solar panels possibly add more and I

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.510 
solar panels possibly add more and I
think<00:06:22.870> I'd<00:06:22.990> be<00:06:23.110> just<00:06:23.290> fine<00:06:23.500> with<00:06:23.680> that<00:06:23.710> so<00:06:24.040> I'm

really thinking that you know I might be
putting<00:06:27.310> my<00:06:27.460> generator<00:06:27.790> up<00:06:27.940> for<00:06:28.120> sale<00:06:28.270> if

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390 
putting my generator up for sale if

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.150

have to go into a shop and get them to
take<00:06:32.500> that<00:06:32.530> generator<00:06:33.040> out<00:06:33.250> and<00:06:33.400> have<00:06:33.550> my

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700 
take that generator out and have my

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.670 
take that generator out and have my
vehicle<00:06:34.060> for<00:06:34.180> a<00:06:34.210> few<00:06:34.390> days<00:06:34.540> just<00:06:34.570> to<00:06:35.020> replace
