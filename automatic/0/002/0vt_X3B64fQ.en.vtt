then bottom to your course but here's

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.390 
then bottom to your course but here's
the<00:01:26.130> second<00:01:26.549> one<00:01:27.770> that<00:01:28.770> was<00:01:28.950> actually<00:01:29.130> really

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
the second one that was actually really

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.590 
the second one that was actually really
easy<00:01:29.520> because<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:29.970> had<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.180> better<00:01:30.299> tags

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
easy because we had the better tags

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.520 
easy because we had the better tags
they're<00:01:31.320> all<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.590> sexy<00:01:31.890> again<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:33.530> think

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
they're all of a sexy again and I think

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.170 
they're all of a sexy again and I think
I'm<00:01:34.619> gonna<00:01:34.710> actually<00:01:34.890> switch<00:01:35.250> them<00:01:35.369> out<00:01:35.430> just

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
I'm gonna actually switch them out just

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.219 
I'm gonna actually switch them out just
because<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.570> other<00:01:36.689> two<00:01:36.869> are<00:01:36.900> gonna<00:01:37.049> be

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
because the other two are gonna be

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.219 
because the other two are gonna be
faster<00:01:37.710> um<00:01:38.540> one<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.659> middle<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:39.990> same

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
faster um one of the middle is the same

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.859 
faster um one of the middle is the same
speed<00:01:40.500> as<00:01:40.619> me<00:01:40.740> but<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.400> higher<00:01:42.240> level<00:01:42.659> so

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
speed as me but it's a higher level so

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.849

with<00:01:57.020> one<00:01:57.229> with<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.469> less<00:01:57.679> HP<00:01:57.950> so<00:01:58.549> we<00:01:58.880> have<00:01:59.000> a

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
with one with the less HP so we have a

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.779 
with one with the less HP so we have a
chance<00:01:59.270> of<00:01:59.420> actually<00:01:59.539> taking<00:01:59.840> it<00:02:00.109> down<00:02:00.289> and<00:02:01.100> we

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
chance of actually taking it down and we

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.809 
chance of actually taking it down and we
only<00:02:01.939> hit<00:02:02.119> for<00:02:02.179> 30<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:02.600> 100<00:02:03.409> and<00:02:04.100> he<00:02:04.549> survives

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
only hit for 30 to 100 and he survives

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.770 
only hit for 30 to 100 and he survives
with<00:02:05.259> 460<00:02:06.259> HP<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:07.459> that<00:02:07.609> kind<00:02:07.759> of<00:02:07.789> sucks<00:02:08.030> I<00:02:08.269> was

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
with 460 HP so that kind of sucks I was

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.359 
with 460 HP so that kind of sucks I was
hoping<00:02:08.869> hitting<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.530> lower<00:02:09.709> level<00:02:10.009> one<00:02:10.160> would

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
hoping hitting the lower level one would

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.759 
hoping hitting the lower level one would
help<00:02:10.580> me<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:10.729> lot<00:02:11.030> more<00:02:11.090> but<00:02:12.019> he<00:02:13.540> acted<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.769> like

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
help me a lot more but he acted and like

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.830 
help me a lot more but he acted and like
it<00:02:15.890> almost<00:02:16.040> did<00:02:16.599> 460<00:02:17.599> I<00:02:17.870> mean<00:02:19.360> either<00:02:20.360> if<00:02:20.660> my

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
it almost did 460 I mean either if my

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.740 
it almost did 460 I mean either if my
evil<00:02:21.110> was<00:02:21.230> one<00:02:21.410> more<00:02:21.560> higher<00:02:21.769> or<00:02:22.220> if<00:02:22.849> my<00:02:23.540> tag

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
evil was one more higher or if my tag

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.100 
evil was one more higher or if my tag
was<00:02:24.019> a<00:02:24.319> little<00:02:25.099> bit<00:02:25.220> stronger<00:02:25.400> but<00:02:26.110> we're

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
was a little bit stronger but we're

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.140 
was a little bit stronger but we're
still<00:02:27.349> gonna<00:02:27.410> be<00:02:27.590> able<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.980> win<00:02:28.640> this<00:02:28.790> one<00:02:29.000> as

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
still gonna be able to win this one as

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.000 
still gonna be able to win this one as
well<00:02:29.180> just<00:02:30.049> because<00:02:30.230> like<00:02:30.349> they're<00:02:30.560> so<00:02:30.769> weak

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
well just because like they're so weak

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.800 
well just because like they're so weak
and<00:02:31.220> we<00:02:31.700> still<00:02:31.910> have<00:02:32.030> full<00:02:32.180> health<00:02:32.360> on<00:02:32.540> two<00:02:32.690> of

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
and we still have full health on two of

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.990 
and we still have full health on two of
our<00:02:32.900> characters<00:02:33.519> so<00:02:34.519> they're<00:02:34.670> not<00:02:34.760> gonna<00:02:34.879> be

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
our characters so they're not gonna be

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.100 
our characters so they're not gonna be
able<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.299> do<00:02:35.450> anything<00:02:35.720> but<00:02:37.629> so<00:02:38.629> yeah<00:02:38.900> I<00:02:38.930> was

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
able to do anything but so yeah I was

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.479 
able to do anything but so yeah I was
actually<00:02:39.260> really<00:02:39.410> quick<00:02:39.799> we<00:02:40.129> made<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.459> past

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
actually really quick we made it past

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.039 
actually really quick we made it past
these<00:02:40.849> two<00:02:41.030> faster<00:02:41.510> than<00:02:41.660> we<00:02:41.750> made<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.019> past

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
these two faster than we made it past

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.460 
these two faster than we made it past
the<00:02:42.379> other<00:02:42.590> ones<00:02:42.860> which<00:02:43.780> is<00:02:44.780> mean<00:02:45.049> because<00:02:45.349> of

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
the other ones which is mean because of

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.009 
the other ones which is mean because of
the<00:02:45.590> tag<00:02:45.829> it<00:02:46.640> really<00:02:47.299> depends<00:02:47.599> on<00:02:47.660> your<00:02:47.720> tag

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
the tag it really depends on your tag

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.629 
the tag it really depends on your tag
and<00:02:48.410> we<00:02:48.680> are<00:02:48.829> trying<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.160> make<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.519> end

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:49.639

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
experiments um the one in the middle is

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.949 
experiments um the one in the middle is
kind<00:03:07.609> of<00:03:07.760> bugging<00:03:07.970> me<00:03:08.090> as<00:03:08.389> well<00:03:08.599> as<00:03:08.810> the
