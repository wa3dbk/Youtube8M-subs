00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
five or six down the mesh one of your

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.999 
five or six down the mesh one of your
first<00:00:12.690> problems<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.200> can<00:00:13.320> see<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.710> if<00:00:13.920> you

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
first problems you can see is if you

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.890 
first problems you can see is if you
string<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.370> weave<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.880> it's<00:00:15.360> going<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.570> be<00:00:15.690> very

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
string a weave is it's going to be very

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.200 
string a weave is it's going to be very
shifty<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:16.980> see<00:00:17.130> how<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.580> can<00:00:17.730> shift<00:00:17.970> all

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
shifty so you see how it can shift all

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.240 
shifty so you see how it can shift all
the<00:00:18.240> way<00:00:18.359> from<00:00:18.539> down<00:00:18.750> here<00:00:19.140> all<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.410> way<00:00:20.100> up

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
the way from down here all the way up

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.460 
the way from down here all the way up
here<00:00:20.279> it's<00:00:21.119> not<00:00:21.449> gonna<00:00:21.810> make<00:00:22.020> for<00:00:22.230> as

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
here it's not gonna make for as

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.500 
here it's not gonna make for as
consistent<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.430> throw<00:00:23.699> as<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.119> might<00:00:24.300> like

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
consistent of a throw as you might like

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.849 
consistent of a throw as you might like
it

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
it

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.609 
it
it's<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.490> they<00:00:27.240> just<00:00:27.570> don't<00:00:27.810> weave<00:00:28.410> through

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
it's just they just don't weave through

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.320 
it's just they just don't weave through
enough<00:00:28.800> diamonds<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.670> really<00:00:30.090> just

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
enough diamonds and it really just

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.910 
enough diamonds and it really just
doesn't<00:00:30.539> hold<00:00:30.750> down<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.289> walk<00:00:31.439> down<00:00:31.619> hard

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
doesn't hold down and walk down hard

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.040 
doesn't hold down and walk down hard
enough<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.309> another<00:00:33.270> way<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.780> string

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
enough so another way you can string

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.110 
enough so another way you can string
shooters<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.770> rule<00:00:34.980> your<00:00:35.100> shooters<00:00:35.520> but

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
shooters is to rule your shooters but

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.600 
shooters is to rule your shooters but
enrolling<00:00:37.110> shooters<00:00:37.530> goes<00:00:37.710> through<00:00:38.070> two<00:00:38.430> rows

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
enrolling shooters goes through two rows

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.479 
enrolling shooters goes through two rows
so<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.879> would<00:00:39.030> go<00:00:39.180> from<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.870> five<00:00:40.079> diamond<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
so it would go from the five diamond the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.680 
so it would go from the five diamond the
five<00:00:41.700> diamond<00:00:42.000> down<00:00:42.120> here<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.510> four

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
five diamond down here to the four

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.080 
five diamond down here to the four
diamond<00:00:42.989> up<00:00:43.110> here<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:44.399> will<00:00:44.610> keep<00:00:44.940> your

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
diamond up here and that will keep your

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.639 
diamond up here and that will keep your
shooters<00:00:45.360> locked<00:00:45.629> down<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.230> will<00:00:46.350> keep<00:00:46.500> them

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
shooters locked down and will keep them

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.139 
shooters locked down and will keep them
from<00:00:46.800> moving<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:47.489> there's<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.760> problem<00:00:48.000> with

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.340 
between the five down on the four
diamond<00:01:39.479> row<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:39.750> we're<00:01:39.840> going<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.990> go<00:01:40.079> down<00:01:40.229> to

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
diamond row so we're going to go down to

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.609 
diamond row so we're going to go down to
the<00:01:40.439> four<00:01:40.619> down<00:01:40.740> row<00:01:42.049> like<00:01:43.049> such<00:01:43.290> we're<00:01:43.500> gonna

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the four down row like such we're gonna

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.840 
the four down row like such we're gonna
wrap<00:01:43.770> down<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.130> then<00:01:44.220> we're<00:01:44.310> gonna<00:01:44.430> wrap<00:01:44.640> back

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
wrap down and then we're gonna wrap back

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.370 
wrap down and then we're gonna wrap back
up<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.390> see<00:01:45.540> how<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:45.659> went<00:01:45.930> from<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.170> five

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
up so you see how we went from the five

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.190 
up so you see how we went from the five
down<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.950> four<00:01:47.159> down<00:01:47.340> dexif<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.060> vomit<00:01:48.479> so

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
down to the four down dexif I vomit so

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.389 
down to the four down dexif I vomit so
we're<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.560> gonna<00:01:49.799> wrap<00:01:50.009> all<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.970> way<00:01:52.399> so

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
we're just gonna wrap all the way so

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.920 
we're just gonna wrap all the way so
other<00:01:53.579> side<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:53.970> stick<00:01:56.329> back<00:01:57.329> five

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
other side of the stick back five

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.340 
other side of the stick back five
dominant

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:10.280 

down<00:02:02.350> to<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.590> four<00:02:02.830> done<00:02:02.979> and<00:02:04.890> five<00:02:07.020> for<00:02:08.610> five

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
down to the four done and five for five

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.809 
down to the four done and five for five
pull<00:02:11.290> out<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:11.470> little<00:02:11.650> bit<00:02:11.860> tight<00:02:12.040> okay<00:02:12.370> so<00:02:12.700> now

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
pull out a little bit tight okay so now

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.760 
pull out a little bit tight okay so now
what<00:02:12.970> we<00:02:13.120> do<00:02:13.270> it's<00:02:13.870> going<00:02:13.990> to<00:02:14.050> take<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.590> piece

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
what we do it's going to take the piece

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.890 
what we do it's going to take the piece
that's<00:02:14.920> on<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.220> back<00:02:15.370> of<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.610> stick<00:02:15.900> we're

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
that's on the back of the stick we're

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.420 
that's on the back of the stick we're
gonna<00:02:17.020> go<00:02:17.110> back<00:02:17.350> through<00:02:17.380> that<00:02:17.590> first<00:02:18.010> five

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
gonna go back through that first five

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.960 
gonna go back through that first five
diamond<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:21.010> what<00:02:21.430> we're<00:02:21.520> going<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.670> do<00:02:21.760> is

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
diamond so what we're going to do is

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.790 
diamond so what we're going to do is
then<00:02:22.150> we're<00:02:22.239> going<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.390> roll<00:02:22.690> in<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.350> opposite

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
then we're going to roll in the opposite

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.740 
then we're going to roll in the opposite
direction<00:02:23.920> down<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.850> that<00:02:25.000> same<00:02:25.270> four<00:02:25.600> time

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
direction down to that same four time

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.720 
direction down to that same four time
that<00:02:25.959> we<00:02:26.050> start<00:02:26.290> with<00:02:26.500> on<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:27.190> other<00:02:27.340> half<00:02:27.580> the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
that we start with on the other half the

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.290 
that we start with on the other half the
string<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.140> see<00:02:29.350> how<00:02:29.470> there's<00:02:29.680> mesh<00:02:30.550> here

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
string so you see how there's mesh here

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.060 
string so you see how there's mesh here
here<00:02:31.569> here<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:31.900> here<00:02:31.959> so<00:02:32.290> we're<00:02:32.769> going<00:02:32.890> to<00:02:32.950> do

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
here here and here so we're going to do

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.310 
here here and here so we're going to do
is<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.400> goal<00:02:33.580> is<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.790> cover<00:02:34.090> up<00:02:34.269> that<00:02:34.450> mesh<00:02:34.870> so

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
is the goal is to cover up that mesh so

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.720 
is the goal is to cover up that mesh so
we're<00:02:35.440> going<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.590> wrap<00:02:36.220> in<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.519> other

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
we're going to wrap in the other

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.449 
we're going to wrap in the other
direction<00:02:37.500> back<00:02:38.500> up<00:02:38.739> to<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.950> five<00:02:39.130> diamond

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
direction back up to the five diamond

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.699 
direction back up to the five diamond
and<00:02:39.550> that<00:02:39.580> will<00:02:39.790> cover<00:02:40.030> up<00:02:40.239> that<00:02:40.840> visible<00:02:41.800> mesh

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
and that will cover up that visible mesh

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.840 
and that will cover up that visible mesh
so<00:02:44.709> we're<00:02:44.800> just<00:02:44.830> going<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.069> continue<00:02:45.220> that<00:02:45.580> all

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
so we're just going to continue that all

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:53.840 
so we're just going to continue that all
the<00:02:45.880> way<00:02:46.000> through<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:52.120> roll<00:02:52.569> it<00:02:52.780> on<00:02:52.900> through

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
the way through just roll it on through

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.210 
the way through just roll it on through
so<00:02:54.850> we've<00:02:55.840> rolled<00:02:56.319> all<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.650> way<00:02:56.769> around<00:02:57.010> so

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
so we've rolled all the way around so

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.250 
so we've rolled all the way around so
you<00:02:57.489> see<00:02:57.819> how<00:02:57.910> it's<00:02:58.180> gonna<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.870> first<00:02:59.080> one<00:02:59.200> we

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
you see how it's gonna the first one we

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.300 
you see how it's gonna the first one we
wrapped<00:02:59.410> one<00:02:59.590> way<00:02:59.739> and<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.920> second<00:03:00.160> we're<00:03:00.250> out

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
wrapped one way and the second we're out

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.890 
wrapped one way and the second we're out
of<00:03:00.340> it<00:03:00.700> now<00:03:01.030> when<00:03:01.209> you<00:03:01.300> tighten<00:03:01.510> this<00:03:01.720> it's

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
of it now when you tighten this it's

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.540 
of it now when you tighten this it's
very<00:03:02.080> important<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.560> pull<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.040> first<00:03:03.250> one

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
very important to pull the first one

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.580 
very important to pull the first one
tight<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.940> inner<00:03:04.150> one<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.570> then<00:03:05.200> tighten<00:03:05.500> the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
tight the inner one and then tighten the

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.170 
tight the inner one and then tighten the
outer<00:03:05.739> one<00:03:06.010> because<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.340> pull<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:06.670> outer<00:03:06.880> one

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
outer one because you pull the outer one

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.960 
outer one because you pull the outer one
first<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:08.350> will<00:03:08.650> cause<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.459> inner<00:03:09.700> one<00:03:09.850> to

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
first it will cause the inner one to

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.640 
first it will cause the inner one to
bunch<00:03:10.209> when<00:03:10.390> you<00:03:10.480> go<00:03:10.570> to<00:03:10.630> pull<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:10.900> up<00:03:10.959> tight<00:03:11.200> so

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
bunch when you go to pull it up tight so

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.130 
bunch when you go to pull it up tight so
then<00:03:11.769> we're<00:03:11.890> going<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.040> tie<00:03:12.160> that<00:03:12.340> off<00:03:16.140> in

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
then we're going to tie that off in

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.940 
then we're going to tie that off in
there<00:03:18.130> we<00:03:18.489> have<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:19.200> barrel<00:03:20.200> shooting<00:03:20.560> string

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
there we have a barrel shooting string

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.160 
there we have a barrel shooting string
so<00:03:21.519> now<00:03:21.820> what<00:03:22.000> this<00:03:22.120> is<00:03:22.269> going<00:03:22.420> to<00:03:22.480> do<00:03:22.630> this<00:03:23.019> is

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
so now what this is going to do this is

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.720 
so now what this is going to do this is
going<00:03:23.380> to<00:03:23.440> lock<00:03:23.650> down<00:03:23.829> tight<00:03:24.100> in<00:03:24.310> that<00:03:24.370> five

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
going to lock down tight in that five

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.069 
going to lock down tight in that five
and<00:03:24.760> six<00:03:25.060> on<00:03:25.209> this<00:03:25.420> show<00:03:25.600> it's<00:03:25.750> not<00:03:25.870> going<00:03:26.019> to

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
and six on this show it's not going to

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:26.970 
and six on this show it's not going to
move<00:03:26.140> anywhere<00:03:26.260> it's<00:03:26.560> not<00:03:26.680> going<00:03:26.799> to<00:03:26.860> shift

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
move anywhere it's not going to shift

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.090 
move anywhere it's not going to shift
like<00:03:27.190> are<00:03:27.310> we<00:03:27.430> use<00:03:27.549> also<00:03:28.500> it's<00:03:29.500> got<00:03:29.709> a<00:03:29.739> raised

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
like are we use also it's got a raised

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
like are we use also it's got a raised
area<00:03:31.680> unlike<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.859> rolled<00:03:33.130> so<00:03:33.430> when<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.940> ball

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
area unlike the rolled so when the ball
