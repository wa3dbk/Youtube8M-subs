00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.390
 Phew 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.340
 re 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.520
 Hi everyone I am a clarinet player Arima 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.010
 Say Rie 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:35.000
 How did you like the clarinet ? 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.989
 Falcon 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.420
 I think that there are various people, but like this dvd In good example of bad example 1 point 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:51.860
 Since we are talking about our easy-to-understand 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:53.420
 If you are a beginner, solid foundations and someone who has played to some extent at this opportunity 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.990
 Please review 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.040
 Please help improve 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:01.710
 Yes 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.910
 Please enjoy this dvd according to your reference clarinet 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.740
 Step 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:13.360
 Let's extend this to shoulder width and support the whole body well 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:17.800
 Right hand thumb left hand thumb when holding the instrument 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.030
 Let's be conscious of 3 points of embouchure firmly and stabilize it 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:25.280
 For example 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:31.220
 Don't seem to move like this when the class is sold 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:33.250
 Even if not much Shimawa also moved as was shaken the class firmly Kamima a steam t 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:38.950
 Mr. 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.950
 Pan 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.630
 In this way, put the tanging at the timing of back beat 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.070
 Oh dear 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.450
 Oh dear 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:00.509
 Ok 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.509
 Yamagata is Nagamiya 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.200
 Yamaba min 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:16.099
 ana 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:20.830
 Let's be careful not to be at an angle that hangs up the jaw and hangs on the instrument 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.830
 When I try to do the tongue in my stomach 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.450
 Oh dear 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.450
 Pan 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.530
 W 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.530
 Really 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.620
 Check point of this exercise Oh 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.040
 Here 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.040
 Ah ah ah N 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.790
 rar 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.790
 I maybe 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.870
 Gradually put in from the same people of Rokumeikan clarinet 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.410
 Next is a female clarinet 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:14.270
 Alto clarinet bass clarinet 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:18.710
 Mu will fit sweetly in this order 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:25.600
 Next I would like to talk about how to combine benefits 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:25.600
 First of all, let's try to play the same melody in all the subparts 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.519
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.560
 me 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.560
 ni 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.560
 ale 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:49.920
 Like this , even if the same score does not make you feel different if the benefits you feel are different 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:54.650
 When you practice the same melody you will get a messy impression. 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.650
 Try to practice careful to pitch 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.050
 goo 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.069
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.879
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.879
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.430
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.430
 goo 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:19.630
 By practicing with a little slow slur 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:21.130
 The tone pitches will match Hmmm 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.569
 me 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.569
 2 

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:25.569
 ni 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.680

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:33.129
