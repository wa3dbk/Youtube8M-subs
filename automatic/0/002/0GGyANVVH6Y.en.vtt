00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.989
 no no 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.360
 hello friends we are well talavera very 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.360
 happy to run the grand prize of 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.310
 Spain the spectacular weather a public 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.369
 incredible in the circuit have made some 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.169
 much more technical improvements yes that have 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.390
 made some positive improvements in this 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.380
 circuit gives congratulations on motorcycle club 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.480
 has worked the ground very well 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.370
 perfect and nothing I have used the sleeve 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.000
 qualifying 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:38.240
 I've been in the top 10 and it has 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.280
 carried the whole sleeve and the 11 then it 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.260
 fell lamb I've been 10 all the 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.450
 manga and bad luck missing two 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.060
 laps I have broken the first right 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.280
 of the bike in the fall of a jump and I have 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.640
 finished I almost fell down thanks I did not 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.380
 nothing has happened but I have finished the 14th 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.530
 the last round I could not stop with 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.790
 the rear brake or support the leg 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.320
 but well it does not matter much either because 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.830
 this circuit can go well from 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.350
 outside and nothing tomorrow the objective then yes 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.120
 I finish in the top 10 we will be 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.310
 very happy thanks to all the public 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.770
 to all the fans thanks for everything from 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.170
 true hello hello zemeckis friends in 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.510
 a place I am here in talavera today 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.750
 Saturday in a day has been a bit 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.130
 complicated in the qualifying sleeve 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.840
 more or less has a good output what 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.510
 what happens the second curve has fallen 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.310
 one in front and I fell of I stayed the 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.130
 latest 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.860
 but well I've seen more or less 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.750
 rolling well so in this in this 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.939
 circuit is not very important the square 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.680
 so I think with the 19th position 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.140
 I can make a good start tomorrow 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.810
 try to make 22 good sleeves what 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.100
 well that this counts so nothing 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.280
 tomorrow morning more 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.540
 hello friends of mx1 good and I finish the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.540
 sat every round of 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.640
 trainings and first hand and we went 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.759
 very well in workouts you can 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.270
 make a second position and choose a very 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.990
 good go for the first sleeve and good 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.020
 in the first sleeve I came out first 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.510
 I kept fighting around first 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.459
 with the teammate who came very 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.069
 strong and good takes a little faster 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.230
 and I happened and well I stayed second 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.480
 quite difficult the truth not the 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.060
 circuit was very bumpy but I did 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.209
 the best possible and good looking already for 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.239
 tomorrow to see if I can make a first 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.700
 put and take the victory a greeting 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.440
 good friends of mx1 board good we have already 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.870
 finished Saturday here in talavera and 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.580
 we have done quite well I am very 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.280
 happy with the result and well then 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.560
 It has been a pretty tough manga because 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.700
 It was very complicated to pass the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.650
 exit has not been the best either 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.420
 because well they have worked a lot 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.400
 first section the first meters and it has 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.310
 side out a little bit and left me 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.330
 Well, I left around 13 on 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.830
 first step by goal I think I 've 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.360
 done 10 and well then after 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.940
 could go back a little and I've 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.560
 finished the sixth one that is very well and 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.150
 Well I am disappointed more 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.220
 because a small group and looked forward to 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.950
 that we were catching is not very little to 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.530
 little and good as tomorrow will try to do 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.209
 a little nun better exit and 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.490
 and nothing will try to give it all the rhythm 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.750
 it's there good because that's going to be the 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.360
 key thank you for following us 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.450
 Well, the day of the 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.090
 saturday in talavera the trainings 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.270
 marked the eighth best lap of my 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.330
 my group I have found comfortable but not 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.250
 I have finished finding there those 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.760
 tenths I could go down and good 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.500
 finally eighth near the head and 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.660
 then we had a very big break 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.690
 from 8 in the morning until 5 in 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.610
 the afternoon the truth that we have 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.160
 faced all the pilots and we were 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.550
 has made it difficult to leave to be able to give 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.100
 100% on the way out has not helped me 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.030
 he clarified to me much later that they praised in 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:00.239
 the exit in the sand and gone little by little 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:04.080
 going up but I think I have more 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.300
 potential tomorrow I hope to catch a bit a 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.630
 little more than rhythm at the end like ground 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:13.790
 do in the national and see if yes 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.790
 tomorrow we can improve the result 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.579
 waters 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.570
 waters
