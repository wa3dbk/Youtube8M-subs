side we're going to be smoking at about
225<00:00:42.010> degrees<00:00:42.610> using<00:00:43.000> Applewood<00:00:43.870> today<00:00:44.260> and<00:00:44.980> I

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
225 degrees using Applewood today and I

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.600 
225 degrees using Applewood today and I
expect<00:00:45.730> these<00:00:46.030> to<00:00:46.090> take<00:00:46.570> nowhere<00:00:47.250> more<00:00:48.250> than

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
expect these to take nowhere more than

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.250 
expect these to take nowhere more than
maybe<00:00:49.300> an<00:00:49.420> hour<00:00:49.539> and<00:00:49.660> a<00:00:49.719> half<00:00:49.899> to<00:00:50.079> two<00:00:50.230> hours

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
maybe an hour and a half to two hours

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.810 
maybe an hour and a half to two hours
max<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:52.180> can<00:00:52.360> see<00:00:52.600> I<00:00:53.379> didn't<00:00:54.160> weigh<00:00:54.340> them<00:00:54.579> but

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
max you can see I didn't weigh them but

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.380 
max you can see I didn't weigh them but
I<00:00:54.850> would<00:00:55.210> say<00:00:55.930> that<00:00:55.960> it's<00:00:56.260> best<00:00:57.270> probably<00:00:58.270> a

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
I would say that it's best probably a

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.279 
I would say that it's best probably a
little<00:00:58.510> bit<00:00:58.660> less<00:00:58.870> than<00:00:59.050> a<00:00:59.140> half<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.350> pound<00:00:59.710> each

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
little bit less than a half a pound each

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.160 
little bit less than a half a pound each
so<00:01:02.289> anyway<00:01:02.559> this<00:01:02.680> is<00:01:02.739> quite<00:01:03.309> simple<00:01:03.730> and<00:01:04.210> we're

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
so anyway this is quite simple and we're

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.900 
so anyway this is quite simple and we're
ready<00:01:05.350> to<00:01:05.410> put<00:01:05.590> these<00:01:05.740> in<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.010> smoker<00:01:06.310> all
