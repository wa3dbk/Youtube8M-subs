00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
energy is so much bigger and I think it

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.040 
energy is so much bigger and I think it
is<00:03:05.580> with<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.880> concentration<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.690> tents

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
is with the concentration of the tents

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.510 
is with the concentration of the tents
here<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.260> mean<00:03:07.530> when<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.770> go<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:07.950> Paris<00:03:08.310> other

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
here I mean when you go to Paris other

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.520 
here I mean when you go to Paris other
places<00:03:08.970> they<00:03:09.090> don't<00:03:09.120> have<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.660> centralized

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
places they don't have it centralized

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.020 
places they don't have it centralized
like<00:03:10.830> that<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.340> think<00:03:11.460> that<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.790> really

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
like that so I think that that really

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.270 
like that so I think that that really
adds<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.110> excitement<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.770> it<00:03:13.860> all<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.220> you
