00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
one of the older LEGO sets so so I would

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.820 
one of the older LEGO sets so so I would
suggest<00:02:15.239> using<00:02:16.709> one<00:02:17.709> of<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:17.950> modern-day

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
suggest using one of the modern-day

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.270 
suggest using one of the modern-day
astronauts<00:02:20.830> sets<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.730> painting<00:02:22.209> it<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:23.280> bluish

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
astronauts sets and painting it a bluish

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.699 
astronauts sets and painting it a bluish
color<00:02:24.330> this<00:02:25.330> is<00:02:25.480> gonna<00:02:25.660> be<00:02:25.840> like<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.260> hardest

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
color this is gonna be like the hardest

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.930 
color this is gonna be like the hardest
piece<00:02:27.099> to<00:02:27.760> find<00:02:27.970> out<00:02:28.239> of<00:02:28.390> anything<00:02:29.080> we've<00:02:29.940> ever

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
piece to find out of anything we've ever

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.210 
piece to find out of anything we've ever
had<00:02:31.510> even<00:02:31.900> harder<00:02:32.440> than<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.590> brick<00:02:32.890> arms

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
had even harder than the brick arms

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.380 
had even harder than the brick arms
trust<00:02:33.700> me<00:02:33.849> on<00:02:33.970> that

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
trust me on that

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.260 
trust me on that
and<00:02:35.290> this<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:36.099> gonna<00:02:36.220> be<00:02:36.430> pretty<00:02:36.610> hard<00:02:36.849> to<00:02:37.030> find

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
and this is gonna be pretty hard to find

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.130 
and this is gonna be pretty hard to find
-<00:02:37.510> it's<00:02:38.319> one<00:02:38.830> of<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.040> golden<00:02:39.760> space<00:02:40.209> space

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
- it's one of the golden space space

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.640 
- it's one of the golden space space
visors<00:02:41.739> but<00:02:42.420> they're<00:02:43.420> easier<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:44.019> find<00:02:44.260> than

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
visors but they're easier to find than

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.589 
visors but they're easier to find than
that

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
that

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.320 
that
okay<00:02:46.599> to<00:02:47.140> begin<00:02:47.260> with<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:48.550> want<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.790> take<00:02:49.000> your

quality of the legs open and now this is
a<00:03:25.459> kind<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.519> annoying<00:03:26.849> mistake<00:03:27.390> if<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:28.470> look

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
a kind of annoying mistake if you look

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:36.110 
a kind of annoying mistake if you look
really<00:03:30.540> closely<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:32.480> this<00:03:33.590> it<00:03:34.590> if<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.489> well

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
really closely and this it if you well

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.309 
really closely and this it if you well
you<00:03:36.209> have<00:03:36.360> to<00:03:36.510> look<00:03:36.660> really<00:03:36.720> closely<00:03:37.140> you

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
you have to look really closely you

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.589 
you have to look really closely you
can't<00:03:37.500> really<00:03:37.680> see<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:37.950> through<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.340> camera

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
can't really see it through the camera

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.900 
can't really see it through the camera
but<00:03:39.599> it<00:03:39.840> has<00:03:39.989> this<00:03:40.140> little<00:03:40.349> bumpy<00:03:40.860> line<00:03:41.190> make

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
but it has this little bumpy line make

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.910 
but it has this little bumpy line make
sure<00:03:41.940> that's<00:03:42.269> on<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.569> top<00:03:42.780> for<00:03:43.739> better

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
sure that's on the top for better

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:53.880 
sure that's on the top for better
quality<00:03:44.129> so<00:03:44.879> here<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.390> have

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:01.060 

okay<00:03:54.890> here<00:03:56.800> as<00:03:57.800> you<00:03:58.040> just<00:03:58.220> saw<00:03:58.460> was<00:03:58.850> cat<00:03:59.150> and<00:04:00.070> we

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
okay here as you just saw was cat and we

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.150 
okay here as you just saw was cat and we
all<00:04:01.400> know<00:04:01.730> that<00:04:01.970> cats<00:04:02.270> from<00:04:02.570> Halo<00:04:03.020> Reach<00:04:03.160> if

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
all know that cats from Halo Reach if

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.850 
all know that cats from Halo Reach if
you<00:04:04.280> like<00:04:04.490> halo<00:04:05.230> which<00:04:06.230> is<00:04:06.380> obvious<00:04:06.800> because

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
you like halo which is obvious because

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.020 
you like halo which is obvious because
you're<00:04:07.070> watching<00:04:07.190> this<00:04:07.460> video<00:04:07.820> but<00:04:08.570> um<00:04:09.220> cat<00:04:10.220> is

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.320 
you're watching this video but um cat is
pretty<00:04:11.450> easy<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.990> make<00:04:12.140> I<00:04:12.350> think<00:04:12.380> but<00:04:13.250> it<00:04:13.880> does

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
pretty easy to make I think but it does

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.479 
pretty easy to make I think but it does
take<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.570> little<00:04:14.780> coloring<00:04:15.350> so<00:04:15.680> if<00:04:15.980> you<00:04:16.310> don't

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
take a little coloring so if you don't

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.880 
take a little coloring so if you don't
really<00:04:16.730> like<00:04:16.910> to<00:04:17.540> color<00:04:17.780> our<00:04:18.140> paint<00:04:18.560> thing

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.950 
tried a lot of markers and they haven't
worked<00:04:58.160> but<00:04:58.430> Sharpie<00:04:59.030> seems<00:04:59.360> to<00:04:59.510> be<00:04:59.630> the<00:04:59.780> best

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
worked but Sharpie seems to be the best

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.230 
worked but Sharpie seems to be the best
working<00:05:01.660> so<00:05:02.660> next<00:05:03.350> you<00:05:03.500> need<00:05:03.680> here's<00:05:04.550> a<00:05:04.610> brick

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
working so next you need here's a brick

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.510 
working so next you need here's a brick

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.270 

really<00:05:16.190> cool<00:05:17.140> we<00:05:18.140> don't<00:05:18.170> we<00:05:18.920> don't<00:05:19.040> really

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
really cool we don't we don't really

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.340 
really cool we don't we don't really
have<00:05:19.550> any<00:05:19.730> magnums<00:05:20.330> and<00:05:20.630> this<00:05:20.720> is<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:21.020> closest

carries around a magnum owner here next

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.790 
carries around a magnum owner here next
here<00:05:30.050> use<00:05:30.410> though<00:05:30.680> use<00:05:31.490> the<00:05:31.730> clone<00:05:32.030> trooper

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800
