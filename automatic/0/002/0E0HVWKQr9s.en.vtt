seen
even<00:00:35.940> by<00:00:36.170> 1990<00:00:37.170> standards<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.829> is

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
even by 1990 standards this is

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.889 
even by 1990 standards this is

like the fact you can't progress in the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.770 
like the fact you can't progress in the
game<00:00:46.980> even<00:00:47.640> if<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.879> know<00:00:48.000> what<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.329> do

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
game even if you know what to do

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.010 
game even if you know what to do
you<00:00:49.320> need<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.710> talk<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:49.980> every<00:00:50.969> single<00:00:51.020> person

even if their information is completely

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.650 
even if their information is completely
useless<00:00:55.460> then<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.610> designers<00:00:57.120> come<00:00:57.390> up<00:00:57.510> with

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
useless then the designers come up with

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.080 
useless then the designers come up with
puzzles<00:00:58.109> with<00:00:58.559> no<00:00:58.829> clues<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.399> their<00:00:59.520> solution

the graphics and the caves are actually
quite<00:01:37.590> good<00:01:37.909> why<00:01:38.909> didn't<00:01:39.210> they<00:01:39.299> make<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
quite good why didn't they make the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.230 
quite good why didn't they make the
whole<00:01:39.840> game<00:01:40.229> look<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.939> the<00:01:41.939> caves

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
whole game look like this the caves

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.569 
whole game look like this the caves
start<00:01:42.630> becoming<00:01:43.079> really<00:01:43.380> repetitive<00:01:43.770> with

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
start becoming really repetitive with

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.179 
start becoming really repetitive with
very<00:01:44.880> little<00:01:45.090> innovation<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:46.560> programmers

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
very little innovation the programmers

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.039 
very little innovation the programmers
must<00:01:47.460> really<00:01:47.729> love<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.030> footstep<00:01:48.689> puzzle

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
must really love that footstep puzzle

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.139 
must really love that footstep puzzle
because<00:01:49.500> they<00:01:49.829> are<00:01:50.040> everywhere

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
because they are everywhere
