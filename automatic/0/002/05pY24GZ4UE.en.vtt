log in every time it messes up or
something<00:00:52.739> like<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.219> if<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.579> messes

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
something like that because if it messes

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.389 
something like that because if it messes
up<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> random<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.930> logs<00:00:55.110> out<00:00:55.410> it'll<00:00:56.160> log

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
up on a random and logs out it'll log

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.310 
up on a random and logs out it'll log
back<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.000> try<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.539> most<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.809> time<00:00:58.050> it'll

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
back in and try and most the time it'll

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.740 
back in and try and most the time it'll
get<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.620> right<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.180> once<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.359> done<00:01:00.510> logging

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
