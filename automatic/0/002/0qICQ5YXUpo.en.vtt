00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.010 
but Ryback is kind of like the I guess
the<00:01:16.250> 2012<00:01:17.250> Goldberg<00:01:17.880> because<00:01:18.659> he<00:01:18.900> was

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the 2012 Goldberg because he was

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.140 
the 2012 Goldberg because he was
undefeated<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.070> Goldberg<00:01:20.520> was<00:01:20.759> and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
undefeated just like Goldberg was and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.410 
undefeated just like Goldberg was and
then<00:01:21.570> at<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.869> end<00:01:21.900> when<00:01:22.350> he<00:01:22.470> went<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.740> get<00:01:22.890> some

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
then at the end when he went to get some

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.450 
then at the end when he went to get some
when<00:01:24.420> Goulburn<00:01:24.869> would<00:01:25.049> always<00:01:25.770> go<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.280> one

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
when Goulburn would always go for it one

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.789 
when Goulburn would always go for it one
match<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.880> think<00:01:26.939> he<00:01:27.180> was<00:01:27.360> against<00:01:27.900> Bret<00:01:28.229> Hart<00:01:28.530> I
