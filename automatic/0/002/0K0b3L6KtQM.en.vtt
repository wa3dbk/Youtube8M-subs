choke so what we're going to do is not

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.970 
choke so what we're going to do is not
we're<00:00:24.060> not<00:00:24.150> cheat<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.660> both<00:00:24.900> because<00:00:25.259> they're

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
we're not cheat in both because they're

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.089 
we're not cheat in both because they're
like<00:00:26.220> super<00:00:26.909> size<00:00:27.300> cocktail<00:00:27.720> ones<00:00:28.230> we're

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
like super size cocktail ones we're

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.499 
like super size cocktail ones we're
going<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.339> pull<00:00:29.579> them<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.820> half<00:00:29.999> when<00:00:30.239> we<00:00:30.359> put

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
going to pull them in half when we put

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.630 
going to pull them in half when we put
them<00:00:30.659> in<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.749> row<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.919> suppose<00:00:32.250> with<00:00:32.489> this

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
them in a row so I suppose with this

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.590 
them in a row so I suppose with this
corner<00:00:32.970> let's<00:00:33.630> start<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.200> see<00:00:34.500> who<00:00:35.280> wins<00:00:38.600> okay

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
corner let's start and see who wins okay

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.290 
corner let's start and see who wins okay
so<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:40.560> is<00:00:40.800> like<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.190> original<00:00:41.640> size<00:00:41.880> it<00:00:42.180> um

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
so this is like the original size it um

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.630 
so this is like the original size it um
okay<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.600> they're<00:00:42.930> absolutely<00:00:43.350> huge<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.460> we

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
okay so they're absolutely huge so we

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.280 
okay so they're absolutely huge so we
broke<00:00:44.910> him<00:00:45.150> in<00:00:45.210> half<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.900> they're<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.230> a

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
broke him in half so they're like a

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.850 
broke him in half so they're like a
reasonable<00:00:46.830> size<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.930> don't<00:00:49.140> chalk<00:00:49.410> that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
reasonable size so we don't chalk that

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.460 
reasonable size so we don't chalk that
