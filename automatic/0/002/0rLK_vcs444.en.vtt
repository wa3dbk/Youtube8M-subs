00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
as being a quarterback with the Giants

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.429 
as being a quarterback with the Giants
and<00:01:51.460> Bill<00:01:52.240> Parcells<00:01:52.869> wouldn't<00:01:53.170> have<00:01:53.260> done

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
and Bill Parcells wouldn't have done

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.170 
and Bill Parcells wouldn't have done
this<00:01:53.619> and<00:01:53.830> that<00:01:53.890> so<00:01:54.520> you<00:01:54.580> know<00:01:54.790> what<00:01:54.970> you

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
this and that so you know what you

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.090 
this and that so you know what you
really<00:01:55.600> can't<00:01:55.900> come<00:01:56.350> out<00:01:56.500> and<00:01:56.619> make<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:56.740> comment

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.469 
really can't come out and make a comment
like<00:01:57.280> this<00:01:57.549> because<00:01:57.850> it's<00:01:58.000> a<00:01:58.090> complete

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
like this because it's a complete

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.539 
like this because it's a complete
contradiction<00:01:58.990> to<00:01:59.770> everything<00:02:00.250> that<00:02:00.280> you

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
contradiction to everything that you

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.760 
contradiction to everything that you

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
right now and that's what's really

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.030 
right now and that's what's really
bothering<00:02:04.299> me<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.810> most<00:02:04.960> about<00:02:05.170> all<00:02:05.320> this<00:02:05.650> if

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
bothering me the most about all this if

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.009
