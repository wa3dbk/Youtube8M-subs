00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello everyone today i'm doing a video review 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.540
 on such a tool as wipes for 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.090
 nail polish removers such napkins i 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.790
 I saw a company flyuil bought them 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.759
 try showing them in one of 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.800
 my shopping videos and some for me 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.420
 wrote that these napkins are bad but 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.609
 I still decided that I do not need 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.029
 try since I bought it I know 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.439
 was surprised by a very good result 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.460
 I initially started shooting with them 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.140
 light varnish that passed with little or no 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.030
 bitch without a hitch he took everything perfectly 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.600
 literally one napkin was enough for me 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.140
 on both hands if at first 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.700
 a little alarmed by the fact that napkins 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.820
 were very very wet that is they 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.620
 could literally dig from the fingers when 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.840
 you wipe but what do i end up with 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.170
 Liked it that these napkins 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.000
 contains butter I don't know which one is not here 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.379
 it is written they obviously contain oil and 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.809
 flavoring because they are very 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.180
 smell good no smell of alcohol 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.850
 either here these 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.210
 unpleasant odors nail polish remover 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.000
 for nails as usual and clearly contained 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.189
 oil because nails are absolutely not 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.799
 dry after you shoot this 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.680
 varnish they are very moisturized they are very 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.509
 look good and it even seems to be 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.299
 no need to wear the customer well not 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.420
 looks after you remove varnish 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.939
 with these napkins I will think well 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.130
 bright varnish you shot great 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.369
 Well done, but how about 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.500
 some bright varnish for example am 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.810
 red you such as this varnish from 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:42.960
 chanel napkins took it off well 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.780
 there is red but the same red 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.790
 how does it stay after taking pictures 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.590
 any red lacquer by any means for 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.710
 make-up removers there are red lags they 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.110
 tend to leave a little bit the consequences 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.689
 after ourselves let's say so on the cuticle on 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.579
 skin around the nail when you take off 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.920
 paws smeared a little and 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.439
 it all remains while you are there a few 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.240
 not just wash your hands well with soap and water, these 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.420
 napkins are exactly the same that is 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.330
 at the level of all other means us not 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.430
 7 nail polish and coped with red 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.560
 varnish but they were waiting for another test 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.560
 because i love very much 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.270
 especially on New Year's Eve 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.100
 dye and nail polish with sequins 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.900
 such as this one dance 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.750
 legend is a lot of sparkles and not 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.080
 very small and they literally bite 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.400
 in the run they are very difficult to scrub I already 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.430
 I know simply because I use 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.230
 These varnishes are not the first year and I thought 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.900
 that if these napkins pass 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:46.340
 tests then I accurately deliver 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.950
 the top five and I took them into the story myself 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.549
 my trip and I took this varnish I 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.190
 endured there the first days and then I 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.790
 washed and you know I erased it altogether 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.000
 no problem I needed of course 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.830
 maybe four or five napkins but 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.380
 no less they did a great job 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.010
 despite the fact that over time they 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:14.140
 a little dry up ie now these 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:17.329
 napkins are not so juicy such 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.340
 full of moisture like when i just them 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.500
 opened but nonetheless they anyway 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.390
 doing their job makes it very 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.940
 good to me they are still very 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.769
 I like very much what 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.630
 the effect remains after them i mean i 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.630
 no problem can take me to work 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:36.140
 precisely because firstly they will not 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:39.440
 stink and thus give me away and 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.690
 the fact that after them he will not be creepy 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.410
 dry fingers and nails here this here 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.950
 the area around the nails I will have 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.680
 Absolutely well-groomed hands, even if I 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.049
 I will not make up my nails instantly empty as 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.100
 I am the wall of the previous one therefore this 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.500
 I give the product 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.450
 the absolute five I advise him to everyone I 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.069
 I will buy it even when I 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.940
 end they by the way enough 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.500
 durable and that is to me here 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.209
 about 2 months ago I bought them back 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.160
 still enough amount that is 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.280
 about a little less than half 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.989
 and I do not agree with those to whom they are not 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.900
 liked it seems to me very much 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.850
 good product and I am very pleased with it 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.780
 here is such 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.910
 We review I hope it was useful to you and 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.470
 if you have your opinion suggest 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.270
 leave it down in the comments 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.220
 let's discuss this and 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.820
 Thank you very much for your attention until the following 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.820
 meetings yet
