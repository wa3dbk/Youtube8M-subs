with<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.310> spare<00:04:39.320> those<00:04:40.320> piece<00:04:40.680> so<00:04:41.100> if<00:04:41.430> you<00:04:41.580> lose

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790

yours<00:04:42.090> or<00:04:42.330> you<00:04:43.110> rip<00:04:43.350> it<00:04:43.520> which<00:04:44.520> seems<00:04:44.790> pretty

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
yours or you rip it which seems pretty

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.730 
yours or you rip it which seems pretty
easy<00:04:45.120> since<00:04:45.510> its<00:04:45.690> rubber<00:04:46.100> you<00:04:47.100> get<00:04:47.280> an<00:04:47.340> extra

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
easy since its rubber you get an extra

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.730 
easy since its rubber you get an extra
one<00:04:49.740> so<00:04:50.720> that<00:04:51.720> pretty<00:04:51.930> much<00:04:52.080> wraps<00:04:52.350> up<00:04:52.560> my

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740
