00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
reason I picked him up was because I saw

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.860

this<00:00:56.070> Hawkeye<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.850> had<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.239> comic<00:00:57.600> Thor

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870

this Hawkeye and I had the comic Thor
and<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.440> thought<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> comic<00:00:59.160> um<00:00:59.750> Captain

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
and I thought the comic um Captain

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.029 
and I thought the comic um Captain
America<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.379> would<00:01:01.530> be<00:01:01.620> kind<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.859> cool<00:01:01.980> to

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
America that would be kind of cool to

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.979 
America that would be kind of cool to
have<00:01:02.190> all<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.489> different<00:01:03.149> kind<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.690> comic

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
have all the different kind of comic

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.840 
have all the different kind of comic
versions<00:01:04.350> together<00:01:04.580> because<00:01:05.580> they're<00:01:05.729> all

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
versions together because they're all

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.130 
versions together because they're all
the<00:01:06.000> common<00:01:06.270> versions<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.750> characters

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
the common versions of the characters

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.510 
the common versions of the characters
they're<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.770> different<00:01:08.100> from<00:01:08.280> how<00:01:08.460> you

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
of comic version here is more how the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.290 
of comic version here is more how the
comic<00:02:32.020> Hawkeye<00:02:32.440> looked<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:33.550> as<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.940> can<00:02:34.090> see

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
comic Hawkeye looked so as you can see

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.530 
comic Hawkeye looked so as you can see
quite<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.320> big<00:02:35.680> difference<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:36.850> yeah<00:02:37.120> so<00:02:37.360> it's

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
quite a big difference and yeah so it's

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.820 
quite a big difference and yeah so it's
pretty<00:02:37.660> much<00:02:37.810> just<00:02:37.930> like<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.350> same<00:02:38.560> thing<00:02:38.709> as

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
pretty much just like the same thing as

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.090 
pretty much just like the same thing as
Thor<00:02:39.070> like<00:02:39.790> this<00:02:40.090> Thor<00:02:40.390> this<00:02:41.020> Thor<00:02:41.410> is<00:02:41.650> not<00:02:41.860> the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
Thor like this Thor this Thor is not the

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.500 
Thor like this Thor this Thor is not the
movie<00:02:42.310> Thor<00:02:42.490> and<00:02:42.670> it's<00:02:42.790> not<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.030> comic<00:02:43.330> though

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
movie Thor and it's not the comic though

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.900 
movie Thor and it's not the comic though
it's<00:02:43.720> a<00:02:43.810> different<00:02:44.260> kind<00:02:44.470> of<00:02:44.650> Thor<00:02:44.890> it's<00:02:45.760> so

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
it's a different kind of Thor it's so

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.610 
it's a different kind of Thor it's so
from<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.209> comics<00:02:46.540> just<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.840> different<00:02:47.230> kind<00:02:47.440> of

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
from the comics just a different kind of

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.860 
from the comics just a different kind of
line<00:02:47.830> of<00:02:48.190> uh<00:02:48.220> it's<00:02:48.820> like<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.060> ultimate<00:02:49.209> Thor<00:02:49.720> I

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
line of uh it's like the ultimate Thor I

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.479 
line of uh it's like the ultimate Thor I
think<00:02:50.110> so<00:02:50.590> that's<00:02:50.800> kind<00:02:51.010> of<00:02:51.040> what<00:02:51.190> this<00:02:51.340> guy

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
think so that's kind of what this guy

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.400 
think so that's kind of what this guy
kind<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.880> is<00:02:52.030> it's<00:02:52.330> it's<00:02:52.720> not<00:02:52.840> quite<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.230> comic

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
kind of is it's it's not quite the comic

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.380 
kind of is it's it's not quite the comic
version<00:02:53.560> it's<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.430> different<00:02:54.730> type<00:02:54.940> of<00:02:54.970> common

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
version it's a different type of common

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.240 
version it's a different type of common
version<00:02:55.720> so<00:02:56.140> that's<00:02:56.350> one<00:02:56.560> of<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.739> big<00:02:56.920> reasons

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
version so that's one of the big reasons

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.560 
version so that's one of the big reasons
why<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.370> wanted<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.760> get<00:02:57.940> it<00:02:58.060> because<00:02:58.360> I<00:02:58.390> think

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
why I wanted to get it because I think

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.890 
why I wanted to get it because I think
that<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.560> odd<00:03:00.550> comic<00:03:01.270> versions<00:03:01.660> would

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
that the odd comic versions would

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.360 
that the odd comic versions would
actually<00:03:02.230> look<00:03:02.350> kind<00:03:02.530> of<00:03:02.620> cool<00:03:02.770> together<00:03:02.950> as

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
actually look kind of cool together as

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.940 
actually look kind of cool together as
an<00:03:03.760> as<00:03:04.330> a<00:03:04.360> set<00:03:04.750> there's<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.470> ones<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.739> I<00:03:05.800> have

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
an as a set there's the ones that I have

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.340 
an as a set there's the ones that I have
so<00:03:06.100> far<00:03:06.310> so<00:03:06.550> I<00:03:06.760> think<00:03:07.150> once<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:07.600> get<00:03:07.780> some<00:03:08.140> more

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
so far so I think once I get some more

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.660 
so far so I think once I get some more
if<00:03:08.500> they<00:03:08.620> come<00:03:08.800> out<00:03:08.890> with<00:03:09.040> more<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.550> would

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
if they come out with more that would

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.479 
if they come out with more that would
