00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.550
 Reviews that's someone of salvation 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.679

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.420

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.489

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.750

 Ludovic latch not there I will give my 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.100
 I watched the videos not 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:54.120
 especially the video comes alive series to 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:58.530
 very very methodical well explain all 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.120
 both due on a fair one 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.059
 thing the serious pilot what is it that makes 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.899
 he stretches and fires the muscles that's 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.549
 all 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.990
 so when you make the move that 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:13.020
 and shoot vopak that and shoot worth your back 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.610
 your ceyrat us when you when you 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.140
 the want you do a good exists 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.320
 since then the perfect run 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.409
 salim 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.450
 he really has 100% just a tiny 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.100
 little basin down but he did well 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.210
 explained so I can I want nothing 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:35.900
 add to that but it works on the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:38.430
 pack and back but just stretching ok 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.619
 it's a stretching exercises I know 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.360
 that armandie life says it increases 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.759
 the rib cage blah blah blah blah blah 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.990
 yes began their idyll I believe 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.060
 that I did a video on wise had 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.420
 well explained that it's a genetics the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.040
 rib cage yes and no and look 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.740
 the video what I said 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.509
 but if you look at it and you do it 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.399
 it's a stretching exercise if you 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.920
 you stretch your muscles you're going to have 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.500
 even better muscles draw well 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.790
 one is super good in chief this is the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.610
 answer to your question so this is a 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.289
 stretching exercises challenges doing it 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.209
 do not do it with the 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.450
 do it better with your back 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.750
 than to do it with the tac it's all 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.549
 a support exercises to do 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.609
 nothing to add so that's my opinion 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.799
 a business stretching exercises 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:29.430
 works the father and back for 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.700
 stretching that's all it was going to him 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.700
 like a glove
