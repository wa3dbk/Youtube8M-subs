TV that I'm in love with and it's um

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:13.180 
TV that I'm in love with and it's um
it's<00:05:11.960> on<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:12.139> wall<00:05:12.289> I<00:05:12.320> just<00:05:12.530> did<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:12.949> like<00:05:13.009> a

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
it's on the wall I just did that like a

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.189 
it's on the wall I just did that like a
couple<00:05:13.520> months<00:05:13.610> ago<00:05:13.820> and<00:05:13.940> it<00:05:14.690> gives<00:05:14.870> a<00:05:14.990> lot

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
couple months ago and it gives a lot

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.510 
couple months ago and it gives a lot
more<00:05:15.440> room<00:05:15.620> if<00:05:15.740> your<00:05:15.860> room's<00:05:16.009> really<00:05:16.160> small

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
more room if your room's really small

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.360 
more room if your room's really small
recommend<00:05:16.970> doing<00:05:17.090> that<00:05:17.180> because<00:05:17.300> it<00:05:17.630> works<00:05:17.780> so
