00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.119 
zealots on the left the planetary people
help<00:00:51.510> out<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.660> lot<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.949> think

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
help out a lot with that but I think

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.400 
help out a lot with that but I think
what's<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.699> barracks<00:00:53.969> reinforce<00:00:54.449> here<00:00:54.690> Mari

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
what's the barracks reinforce here Mari

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.810 
what's the barracks reinforce here Mari
should<00:00:55.680> be<00:00:55.770> able<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.949> stabilize<00:00:56.160> well

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
should be able to stabilize well

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.950 
should be able to stabilize well
actually<00:00:57.030> that's<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.360> lot<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.510> charge<00:00:57.750> watts

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
actually that's a lot of charge watts

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.869 
actually that's a lot of charge watts
and<00:00:58.500> we<00:00:58.890> have<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.039> doctrine<00:00:59.430> actually<00:00:59.730> about

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
and we have the doctrine actually about

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.130 
and we have the doctrine actually about
to<00:01:00.000> finish<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.449> could<00:01:00.629> really<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:01.109> been

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
to finish that could really have been

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.930 
to finish that could really have been
weakening<00:01:01.649> even<00:01:01.920> while<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> economy<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.640> mero

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
weakening even while the economy of mero

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.119 
weakening even while the economy of mero
here<00:01:03.239> here<00:01:03.840> oh<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:04.049> feel<00:01:04.229> recovers<00:01:04.710> -<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.010> is

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
here here oh we feel recovers - this is

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.710 
here here oh we feel recovers - this is
gonna<00:01:05.280> lose<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> lots<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.030> not<00:01:06.210> really<00:01:06.420> achieve

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
gonna lose a lots and not really achieve

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.550 
gonna lose a lots and not really achieve
that<00:01:06.750> much<00:01:07.110> here

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
that much here

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.289 
that much here
yeah<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:07.920> stifling<00:01:08.430> overextending<00:01:09.090> at<00:01:09.180> this

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
yeah it's stifling overextending at this

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.690 
yeah it's stifling overextending at this
point<00:01:09.570> we'll<00:01:10.560> be<00:01:10.590> able<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.920> stop<00:01:11.159> wailing<00:01:11.580> on

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
point we'll be able to stop wailing on

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.670 
point we'll be able to stop wailing on
