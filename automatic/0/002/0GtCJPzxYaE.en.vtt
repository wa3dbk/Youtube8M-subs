a<00:01:24.659> little<00:01:24.930> frustrating<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.759> places<00:01:26.759> like

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
a little frustrating that places like

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.380 
a little frustrating that places like
Del<00:01:27.540> Mar<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.409> over<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.610> Dubai

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
Del Mar and and over and and Dubai

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.359 
Del Mar and and over and and Dubai
they're<00:01:30.900> going<00:01:31.170> away<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.500> synthetic<00:01:31.680> having<00:01:32.340> a

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
they're going away of synthetic having a

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.649 
they're going away of synthetic having a
horse<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.729> well<00:01:33.210> clearly<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.570> would

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
horse like this well clearly I would

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.080 
horse like this well clearly I would
rather<00:01:33.960> they<00:01:34.409> stayed<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.740> synthetic<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.880> you

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
rather they stayed on synthetic but you
