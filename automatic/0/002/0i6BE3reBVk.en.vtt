need to wipe anything to do this should

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.500 
need to wipe anything to do this should
be<00:03:45.870> very<00:03:46.079> simple<00:03:46.290> so<00:03:46.680> we're<00:03:46.890> gonna<00:03:46.980> go<00:03:47.220> to

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
be very simple so we're gonna go to

be very simple so we're gonna go to
install<00:03:48.829> I'm<00:03:49.829> gonna<00:03:50.010> go<00:03:50.100> up<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.340> level<00:03:50.489> and

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
install I'm gonna go up a level and

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.610 
install I'm gonna go up a level and
there<00:03:52.200> it<00:03:52.290> is<00:03:52.380> exposed<00:03:52.950> arm<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:54.030> date<00:03:54.269> be<00:03:54.959> dot

across<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:59.100> flash<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.609> should<00:04:00.329> flash<00:04:00.600> for<00:04:00.870> very

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
across to flash it should flash for very

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.840 
across to flash it should flash for very
very<00:04:01.290> quickly<00:04:01.560> there<00:04:02.370> we<00:04:02.489> go

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
very quickly there we go

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.680 
very quickly there we go
reboot<00:04:03.720> system<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:05.880> should<00:04:06.180> be<00:04:06.359> it<00:04:06.510> we

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
reboot system and that should be it we

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.750 
reboot system and that should be it we
should<00:04:06.989> be<00:04:07.200> good<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.590> go<00:04:07.709> we<00:04:08.370> should<00:04:08.579> be<00:04:08.700> able

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
should be good to go we should be able

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.180 
should be good to go we should be able
to<00:04:08.880> have<00:04:09.090> exposed<00:04:09.720> functioning<00:04:10.470> let's<00:04:11.010> go

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
to have exposed functioning let's go

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.610 
to have exposed functioning let's go
ahead<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.700> make<00:04:12.060> sure<00:04:12.450> that<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:13.079> is<00:04:13.200> once<00:04:13.500> this

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
ahead and make sure that it is once this

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.020 
ahead and make sure that it is once this
boots<00:04:13.859> up<00:04:14.480> Android<00:04:15.859> it's<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:17.100> beautiful<00:04:17.669> thing

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
boots up Android it's a beautiful thing

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.729 
boots up Android it's a beautiful thing
now<00:04:18.539> it<00:04:18.750> does<00:04:18.930> look<00:04:18.989> like<00:04:19.200> it's<00:04:19.350> going<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.590> go

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
now it does look like it's going to go

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.319 
now it does look like it's going to go
through<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.100> Android<00:04:20.579> is<00:04:20.700> updating<00:04:21.180> process

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
through the Android is updating process

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.200 
through the Android is updating process
and<00:04:21.840> I<00:04:22.349> think<00:04:22.380> this<00:04:22.710> is<00:04:22.890> because<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.669> probably

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
and I think this is because it probably

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.470 
and I think this is because it probably
wiped<00:04:24.390> cache<00:04:24.780> by<00:04:25.200> using<00:04:25.650> that<00:04:26.070> install<00:04:26.940> script

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
wiped cache by using that install script

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.470 
wiped cache by using that install script
that<00:04:27.750> install<00:04:28.260> file<00:04:29.070> for<00:04:29.370> exposed<00:04:29.820> so<00:04:30.360> we'll

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
that install file for exposed so we'll

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.280 
that install file for exposed so we'll
let<00:04:30.570> this<00:04:30.750> finish

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
let this finish

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.530 
let this finish
all<00:04:31.890> right<00:04:32.130> we're<00:04:32.310> finally<00:04:32.760> starting<00:04:33.300> here

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
all right we're finally starting here

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.600 
all right we're finally starting here
the<00:04:33.570> upgrade<00:04:34.110> process<00:04:34.320> has<00:04:34.740> finished<00:04:34.770> it<00:04:35.370> took

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
the upgrade process has finished it took

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.970 
the upgrade process has finished it took
quite<00:04:36.360> a<00:04:36.420> bit<00:04:36.690> here<00:04:36.930> all<00:04:37.560> right<00:04:37.650> let's<00:04:37.860> go

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
quite a bit here all right let's go

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.750 
quite a bit here all right let's go
ahead<00:04:38.070> and<00:04:38.340> open<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.910> device<00:04:39.180> up<00:04:39.480> and<00:04:40.490> so<00:04:41.490> we

ahead and open the device up and so we

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.340 
ahead and open the device up and so we
should<00:04:41.970> have<00:04:42.180> exposed<00:04:42.570> installed<00:04:43.020> let's<00:04:43.230> go

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
should have exposed installed let's go

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.890 
should have exposed installed let's go
check<00:04:43.530> this<00:04:43.710> out<00:04:44.090> should<00:04:45.090> be<00:04:45.120> officially
