it's<00:01:54.440> about<00:01:54.649> five<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.100> ten<00:01:55.280> minutes<00:01:55.550> drive<00:01:55.759> so

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
it's about five to ten minutes drive so

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.780 
it's about five to ten minutes drive so
here<00:01:57.229> we<00:01:57.319> go

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
here we go

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.910 
here we go
so<00:01:59.390> when<00:01:59.540> I<00:01:59.630> was<00:01:59.780> a<00:01:59.810> kid<00:02:00.050> I<00:02:00.080> liked<00:02:00.350> math<00:02:00.530> and

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
so when I was a kid I liked math and

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.410 
so when I was a kid I liked math and
when<00:02:01.280> I<00:02:01.340> get<00:02:01.400> older<00:02:01.790> I<00:02:01.970> started<00:02:02.300> loving

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
when I get older I started loving

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.590 
when I get older I started loving
physics<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:03.350> it's<00:02:04.160> a<00:02:04.370> curiosity<00:02:04.820> thing<00:02:05.390> that

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
physics and it's a curiosity thing that

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.560 
physics and it's a curiosity thing that
I<00:02:05.630> really<00:02:06.110> want<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:07.010> know<00:02:07.190> how<00:02:07.550> things<00:02:07.760> work<00:02:08.060> so

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
I really want to know how things work so

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.810 
I really want to know how things work so
that's<00:02:08.690> how<00:02:08.930> I<00:02:08.960> start<00:02:09.830> having<00:02:10.220> interest<00:02:10.640> in

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
that's how I start having interest in

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.330 
that's how I start having interest in
aviation<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:12.350> first<00:02:12.620> option<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.070> I<00:02:13.190> can

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
aviation the first option that I can

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.850 
aviation the first option that I can
think<00:02:13.490> of<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:13.760> Cathay<00:02:14.060> Pacific<00:02:14.510> it's<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.380> good

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
think of is Cathay Pacific it's a good

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.010 
think of is Cathay Pacific it's a good
airline<00:02:16.250> it's<00:02:16.700> with<00:02:17.060> good<00:02:17.240> people's<00:02:17.660> and

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
airline it's with good people's and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:25.450 
airline it's with good people's and
that's<00:02:18.710> how<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:18.860> started

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.040 

right<00:02:26.460> now<00:02:26.610> we're<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.850> location<00:02:27.390> call<00:02:27.600> em<00:02:27.780> Bay

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
right now we're the location call em Bay

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.470 
right now we're the location call em Bay
right<00:02:29.040> outside<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.460> hangar<00:02:29.850> where<00:02:30.060> we're<00:02:30.270> going

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
right outside a hangar where we're going

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.840 
right outside a hangar where we're going
to<00:02:30.540> go<00:02:30.630> in<00:02:30.840> later<00:02:31.110> on<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.920> as<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.460> can<00:02:32.550> see<00:02:32.730> on

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
to go in later on and as you can see on

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.280 
to go in later on and as you can see on
the<00:02:32.940> right<00:02:33.090> hand<00:02:33.240> side<00:02:33.390> left<00:02:33.690> hand<00:02:33.750> side<00:02:34.080> there

the right hand side left hand side there

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.200 
the right hand side left hand side there
are<00:02:34.380> some<00:02:34.560> aircraft<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:35.040> maintenance<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.790> Cathay

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
are some aircraft a maintenance a Cathay

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.300 
are some aircraft a maintenance a Cathay
Pacific<00:02:36.720> has<00:02:36.810> such<00:02:36.990> a<00:02:37.020> big<00:02:37.290> fleet<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.100> aircraft

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
Pacific has such a big fleet of aircraft

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.400 
Pacific has such a big fleet of aircraft
so<00:02:39.120> some<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.630> aircraft<00:02:40.200> will<00:02:40.380> be

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
so some of the aircraft will be

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.470 
so some of the aircraft will be
maintenance<00:02:41.100> outside<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.580> hangar<00:02:41.940> but

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
maintenance outside the hangar but

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.660 
maintenance outside the hangar but
particularly<00:02:42.870> TAS<00:02:43.260> for<00:02:43.680> example<00:02:44.160> painting

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
particularly TAS for example painting

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.540 
particularly TAS for example painting
and<00:02:44.970> some<00:02:45.630> of<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.780> retrofit<00:02:46.320> program<00:02:47.040> that

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
and some of the retrofit program that

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.670 
and some of the retrofit program that
had<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.820> be<00:02:47.940> done<00:02:48.090> inside<00:02:48.600> enclosed<00:02:49.020> area<00:02:51.680> so

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
had to be done inside enclosed area so

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.070 
had to be done inside enclosed area so
we<00:02:52.770> hear<00:02:53.010> noise<00:02:53.340> around<00:02:53.550> us<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.690> right<00:02:54.870> now<00:02:55.020> we

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
we hear noise around us so right now we

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.690 
we hear noise around us so right now we
are<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.470> hangar<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:56.280> as<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.520> can<00:02:56.640> hear

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
are the hangar so as you can hear

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.030 
are the hangar so as you can hear
there's<00:02:57.540> some<00:02:57.660> engine<00:02:58.200> testing<00:02:58.680> right<00:02:58.800> there

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
there's some engine testing right there

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.100 
there's some engine testing right there
currently<00:02:59.760> in<00:02:59.910> this<00:03:00.060> aircraft<00:03:00.300> we're<00:03:00.780> doing

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
currently in this aircraft we're doing

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.930 
currently in this aircraft we're doing
some<00:03:01.290> retrofitting<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:02.550> also<00:03:02.910> a

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
some retrofitting this is also a

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.150 
some retrofitting this is also a
responsibility<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:04.470> we<00:03:04.620> have<00:03:04.830> furniture

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
responsibility so we have furniture

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.280 
responsibility so we have furniture
taking<00:03:05.730> in<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.150> taking<00:03:06.720> out<00:03:06.810> at<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.080> same

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
taking in and taking out at the same

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.620 
taking in and taking out at the same
time<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.890> we<00:03:08.310> have<00:03:08.430> some<00:03:08.670> remodeling<00:03:09.270> of<00:03:09.480> the

repaying<00:03:38.910> every<00:03:39.180> six<00:03:39.450> years<00:03:39.810> so<00:03:40.260> we<00:03:40.470> plan<00:03:40.740> it

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
repaying every six years so we plan it

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.770 
repaying every six years so we plan it
ahead<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.190> time<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:42.150> make<00:03:42.270> sure<00:03:42.330> the<00:03:42.450> aircraft

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
ahead of time to make sure the aircraft

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.900 
ahead of time to make sure the aircraft
will<00:03:43.230> be<00:03:43.320> coming<00:03:43.650> in<00:03:43.740> then<00:03:44.010> we<00:03:44.250> have<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.459> hangar

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
will be coming in then we have a hangar

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.330 
will be coming in then we have a hangar
space<00:03:45.030> arrange<00:03:45.780> for<00:03:46.050> it<00:03:46.080> so<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.770> can<00:03:46.920> come<00:03:47.130> here

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
space arrange for it so it can come here

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.640 
space arrange for it so it can come here
and<00:03:47.580> do<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.820> repaint<00:03:48.209> job<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.690> this<00:03:49.470> is<00:03:49.620> a
