00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.099
 Hi everyone, how are you? I'm fine. 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.549
 for you a hint kind of sensor 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.160
 parking is fine as well and we will 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.350
 make to bore the bumper and the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.289
 people who attended did not obey the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.420
 goalkeeping is what happens to me 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.519
 ask a lot of respect with the other goes 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.800
 do to mark it for shock because 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.380
 there or I made the markup here 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.079
 the brain of the bumper you see me 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.059
 c put 31 kilometers but entered the 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.410
 car is has to put 31 centimeters 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.480
 not every car has its particularity 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.879
 in the case here the Koxa for me after the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.430
 scratch the right manual then hand- to- hand 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.860
 with which we seek the means of 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.680
 government stops shock for the World Cup I 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.460
 I'll take it and do the following 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.100
 either in the procedural b 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.649
 the distance of 20 centimeters 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.470
 so you can do this is in this car 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.140
 here the manual recommends 20 centimeters 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.530
 of his first bumper processed b 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.970
 and teacher ceases and here is promised 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.850
 Put here is the success of the avenue 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.049
 macapÃ¡ where 600 and 500 won even for 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.110
 shock so far 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.490
 certain is that at the right time then another 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.920
 thing you have to take a lot 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.860
 care is the following that of the cars that 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.220
 in that opening and in the bumper some 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.350
 they all come down here, so it's neither 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.829
 always possible to dial 20 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.280
 jobs is much worse if it is the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.799
 fox case only has one leg here then 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.220
 does not have functional earth structure gives 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.270
 to follow the manual or here to 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:55.859
 you will see 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:58.049
 it's good this is the right bumper here 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:01.619
 without talking the following has to 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.799
 The tip that I give you is the knee 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.319
 ground or you stand supported places the 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.289
 here the arm is supported in the 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.239
 and holding the drill correctly. 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.879
 For you to have dominion over I told 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:19.220
 It can not go too far here. 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:24.200
 no need to put the force was not only 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.200
 no need to put fire in it will even 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.860
 the client looks only 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.590
 therefore the importance of doubling the 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.750
 people to do with the drill 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.260
 to-shock you do not hit with it here 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.970
 and to win then it 's good you slope the 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.530
 arm here to shock safety 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.290
 financial management to have full control over 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.640
 they're saving slow and one more friend from 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.560
 parking sensor 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.390
