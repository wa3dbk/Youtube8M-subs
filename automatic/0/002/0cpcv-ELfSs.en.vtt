00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
taking quick scoping out that was pretty

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.530 
taking quick scoping out that was pretty
crappy<00:03:11.050> because<00:03:11.560> there's<00:03:12.190> a<00:03:12.610> lot<00:03:12.880> of<00:03:13.150> people

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
crappy because there's a lot of people

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.940 
crappy because there's a lot of people
that<00:03:13.660> like<00:03:13.810> quickscoping<00:03:14.410> in<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:14.710> game

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
that like quickscoping in this game

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.900 
that like quickscoping in this game
which<00:03:15.880> I've<00:03:16.120> not<00:03:16.330> even<00:03:16.480> unlocked<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.790> gets

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
which I've not even unlocked and it gets

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.780 
which I've not even unlocked and it gets
numbers<00:03:19.390> yet<00:03:20.130> i'm<00:03:21.130> guessing<00:03:21.490> the<00:03:21.520> third

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
numbers yet i'm guessing the third

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.940 
numbers yet i'm guessing the third
sniper<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:22.330> unlock<00:03:22.660> is<00:03:22.930> supposed<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.680> be<00:03:23.800> the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
sniper you unlock is supposed to be the

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.380 
sniper you unlock is supposed to be the
best<00:03:24.130> i'm<00:03:24.550> hearing<00:03:26.640> but<00:03:27.640> i<00:03:27.700> guess<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.150> know<00:03:28.240> we

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
best i'm hearing but i guess you know we

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.449 
best i'm hearing but i guess you know we
can<00:03:28.540> do<00:03:29.140> some<00:03:29.320> no<00:03:29.470> scope<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:29.950> there's<00:03:30.130> steady

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
can do some no scope and there's steady

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.920 
can do some no scope and there's steady
aim<00:03:30.730> but<00:03:31.000> i<00:03:31.060> will<00:03:31.240> probably<00:03:31.660> still<00:03:31.870> use<00:03:32.050> ninja

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
aim but i will probably still use ninja

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.449 
aim but i will probably still use ninja
but<00:03:34.930> those<00:03:35.410> security<00:03:35.950> cameras<00:03:36.280> out<00:03:36.430> there

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
but those security cameras out there

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.940 
but those security cameras out there
that's<00:03:36.850> a<00:03:37.030> pretty<00:03:37.600> good<00:03:38.080> effect<00:03:38.709> in<00:03:38.950> this<00:03:39.160> game

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
that's a pretty good effect in this game

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.470 
that's a pretty good effect in this game
especially<00:03:41.950> when<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.310> get<00:03:42.400> on<00:03:42.520> level<00:03:42.790> 13<00:03:43.300> and

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
especially when you get on level 13 and

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.290 
especially when you get on level 13 and
unlike<00:03:43.750> Search<00:03:44.170> and<00:03:44.410> Destroy<00:03:45.060> have<00:03:46.060> them

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300
