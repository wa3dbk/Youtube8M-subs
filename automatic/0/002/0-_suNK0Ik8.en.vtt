00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
bold color that I had in my collection

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.810 
bold color that I had in my collection
it's<00:02:18.720> called<00:02:18.990> full<00:02:19.410> fuchsia<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.610> looks

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
it's called full fuchsia and it looks

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.780 
it's called full fuchsia and it looks
like<00:02:20.910> this<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:22.410> see<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.800> really<00:02:23.130> blends<00:02:23.580> in

like this you see it really blends in

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.240 
like this you see it really blends in
with<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.060> jacket<00:02:24.450> color<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.770> think<00:02:26.130> it

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
with the jacket color and I think it

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.600 
with the jacket color and I think it
pulls<00:02:27.030> out<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.540> cheek<00:02:27.840> color<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.890> didn't<00:02:29.370> want

pulls out the cheek color I didn't want

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.360 
pulls out the cheek color I didn't want
to<00:02:29.700> have<00:02:30.480> my<00:02:30.720> face<00:02:31.080> washing<00:02:31.710> away<00:02:31.830> with<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
to have my face washing away with the

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.370 
to have my face washing away with the
brightness<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:32.970> jacket<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:33.960> I<00:02:33.990> thought

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
brightness of the jacket so I thought

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.840 
brightness of the jacket so I thought
this<00:02:34.620> color<00:02:34.950> would<00:02:35.160> be<00:02:35.220> really<00:02:35.610> good<00:02:35.940> for

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
this color would be really good for

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.730 
this color would be really good for
accentuating<00:02:38.850> my<00:02:39.000> features<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.780> being<00:02:40.590> in

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
accentuating my features and being in

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.220 
accentuating my features and being in
harmony<00:02:41.040> with<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.580> color<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:41.910> my<00:02:42.270> jacket<00:02:42.750> so

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
harmony with the color of my jacket so

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.800 
harmony with the color of my jacket so
