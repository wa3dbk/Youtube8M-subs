00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.820
 was coming is not like we were going to 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.440
 put now and the truth that with 16 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.680
 subscribers a career without contact is 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.250
 the best you can do because what 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.089
 Busting better is touching the wheel 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.089
 to the car behind 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.100
 I do not put it right where the 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.010
 croquette looks at how the 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.270
 rib let's go now we're here 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:26.210
 all stuck gala guasa I had 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.540
 singing a song okay let's go a little 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.810
 little run aground 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:35.690
 God is worth here as perfect as 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.840
 down and just a tree uncle do it 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.490
 there one crosses you like robocop because 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:47.030
 it does not work now 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.009
 my mother out there I think it would be what 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.100
 Better to take over if what 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.640
 I was trying to do and what I did not 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.250
 impossible here we go guayaba exploding 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.460
 the vehicles we go let's go that you can 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:07.340
 go to the military so crazy and in advance 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.890
 10 Beetle 20 enjoyed around here 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.750
 we go fourth rule of the before do not give me 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.420
 before but this car to catch by 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.060
 here the good thing would be the 2 so good 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.890
 anybody I think would go better with the 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.450
 Bera bike man but with the bike that 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.959
 imagine to get everything done 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.930
 tight a car because yes because otherwise 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.569
 because istanbul ocotillo is worth it here 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.690
 but put on that I think you already post 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.680
 right to have that does not improve is that 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.680
 we have to go up now 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.709
 then you have to turn around you 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.440
 imagine this with good contact to whom 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:53.150
 they go up and the data is worth here now 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:57.120
 the return we will give the huertecilla 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.480

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.630
 has is a car that forces but 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.329
 I also overturn very lightly what has 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.730
 the monster truck endorse that but things 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.170

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.190

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.250
