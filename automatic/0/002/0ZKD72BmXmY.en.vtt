00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.270 
it on Sephora calm it was 48 dollars
plus<00:01:00.840> tax<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.590> blinding<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.070> I'm<00:01:02.129> going

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
plus tax this is blinding so I'm going

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.410 
plus tax this is blinding so I'm going
to<00:01:02.340> put<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.609> down<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.930> get<00:01:04.939> 12<00:01:05.939> shadows

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420

for<00:01:06.600> $48<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.350> do<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:07.650> think<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.100> a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
for $48 I do not think that is a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.740 
for $48 I do not think that is a
particularly<00:01:08.580> good<00:01:09.000> value<00:01:09.299> for<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.540> money

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
particularly good value for the money

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.570 
particularly good value for the money
not<00:01:10.530> when<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.280> can<00:01:11.460> get<00:01:13.040> similar<00:01:14.040> palettes

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
not when you can get similar palettes

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.480 
not when you can get similar palettes
for<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.330> same<00:01:15.540> or<00:01:15.750> less<00:01:15.900> money<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.490> our

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
for the same or less money that our

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.039 
for the same or less money that our
better<00:01:17.939> quality<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.570> guess<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.869> know<00:01:18.900> where

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
better quality so I guess you know where

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.410 
better quality so I guess you know where
I'm<00:01:19.140> going<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.920> am<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.700> huge<00:01:21.119> Steeler

by<00:02:28.989> any<00:02:29.170> stretch<00:02:29.470> of<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.739> imagination<00:02:29.830> um

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
by any stretch of the imagination um

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.250 
by any stretch of the imagination um
when<00:02:33.099> I<00:02:33.130> applied<00:02:33.910> them<00:02:34.650> they<00:02:35.849> are<00:02:37.019> not<00:02:38.019> as

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
when I applied them they are not as

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.400 
when I applied them they are not as
pigmented<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:39.400> not<00:02:40.030> as<00:02:40.180> creamy<00:02:40.540> as<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:41.080> steel

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
pigmented and not as creamy as the steel

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.970 
pigmented and not as creamy as the steel
ones<00:02:41.910> however<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.720> plus<00:02:44.019> on<00:02:44.230> that<00:02:44.410> is<00:02:44.680> that

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
ones however the plus on that is that

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.979 
ones however the plus on that is that
there<00:02:45.250> is<00:02:45.400> less<00:02:45.580> fallout<00:02:46.150> because<00:02:46.450> of<00:02:46.840> that

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
there is less fallout because of that

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.650 
there is less fallout because of that
however<00:02:47.970> because<00:02:48.970> I<00:02:49.000> had<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.269> keep<00:02:49.420> reapplying

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
however because I had to keep reapplying

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.220 
however because I had to keep reapplying
to<00:02:50.170> get<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.590> depth<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:51.160> I<00:02:51.190> wanted<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.870> took

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
to get the depth that I wanted it took

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.229 
to get the depth that I wanted it took
longer<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.739> get<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:53.950> look<00:02:54.130> that<00:02:54.340> I<00:02:54.459> wanted<00:02:55.120> to

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
longer to get the look that I wanted to

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.860 
longer to get the look that I wanted to
achieve<00:02:55.330> this<00:02:55.870> is<00:02:56.019> a<00:02:56.049> first<00:02:56.380> for<00:02:56.530> Stila

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
achieve this is a first for Stila

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.710 
achieve this is a first for Stila
but<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.260> shadows<00:03:00.040> didn't<00:03:00.430> really<00:03:00.670> swear<00:03:01.420> as

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
but the shadows didn't really swear as

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.589 
but the shadows didn't really swear as
long<00:03:02.290> as<00:03:02.769> their<00:03:03.370> other<00:03:03.549> shades<00:03:03.910> normally<00:03:04.299> do

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
long as their other shades normally do

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:10.020 
long as their other shades normally do
so<00:03:06.209> in<00:03:07.209> a<00:03:07.330> nutshell<00:03:07.540> I<00:03:08.049> have<00:03:08.920> my<00:03:09.069> receipt<00:03:09.489> I<00:03:09.849> am

comes to mind is the Too Faced chocolate
bar<00:03:36.970> palette<00:03:37.209> which<00:03:38.200> is<00:03:38.350> I<00:03:38.440> think<00:03:38.470> only<00:03:38.739> $38

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
bar palette which is I think only $38
