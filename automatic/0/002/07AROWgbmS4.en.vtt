sorceress action figure everything I'm
gonna<00:02:45.650> tell<00:02:45.860> you<00:02:45.950> here<00:02:46.130> is<00:02:46.190> not<00:02:46.280> gonna<00:02:46.460> be

gonna tell you here is not gonna be

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.220 
gonna tell you here is not gonna be
anything<00:02:46.820> new<00:02:47.060> you<00:02:47.420> already<00:02:47.840> know<00:02:47.960> what<00:02:48.110> to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
anything new you already know what to

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.960 
anything new you already know what to
expect<00:02:48.650> because<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:49.040> figure<00:02:49.280> is<00:02:49.340> exactly<00:02:49.760> the

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
expect because the figure is exactly the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.910 
expect because the figure is exactly the
same<00:02:50.180> which<00:02:50.660> means<00:02:50.930> she<00:02:51.110> has<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.470> exact<00:02:51.830> same

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
same which means she has the exact same

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.000 
same which means she has the exact same
wing<00:02:52.640> art<00:02:53.060> action<00:02:53.630> feature<00:02:53.840> on<00:02:54.110> there<00:02:54.350> so<00:02:54.890> the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
wing art action feature on there so the

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.680 
wing art action feature on there so the
way<00:02:55.130> it<00:02:55.250> works<00:02:55.490> is<00:02:55.700> she's<00:02:55.880> got<00:02:56.060> these<00:02:56.180> very

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
way it works is she's got these very

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.630 
way it works is she's got these very
large<00:02:56.930> spools<00:02:57.410> sticking<00:02:57.980> off<00:02:58.130> of<00:02:58.160> her<00:02:58.400> back

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
large spools sticking off of her back

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.280 
large spools sticking off of her back
they<00:02:58.880> are<00:02:58.910> attached<00:02:59.420> in<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.780> back<00:02:59.960> of<00:03:00.140> her

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
they are attached in the back of her

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.500 
they are attached in the back of her
shoulder<00:03:00.320> I<00:03:00.890> talked<00:03:01.700> about<00:03:01.790> this<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.090> lot<00:03:02.270> in<00:03:02.330> my

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
shoulder I talked about this a lot in my

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.250 
shoulder I talked about this a lot in my
first<00:03:02.870> sources<00:03:03.290> review<00:03:03.830> how<00:03:04.810> it's<00:03:05.810> just<00:03:06.080> not

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
first sources review how it's just not

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.140 
first sources review how it's just not
very<00:03:06.530> appealing<00:03:06.920> it<00:03:07.220> doesn't<00:03:07.490> look<00:03:07.670> too<00:03:07.940> great

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
very appealing it doesn't look too great

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.150 
very appealing it doesn't look too great
and<00:03:08.480> unfortunately<00:03:09.320> since<00:03:09.500> those<00:03:09.710> wings<00:03:09.980> are

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
and unfortunately since those wings are

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.220 
and unfortunately since those wings are
stuck<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:10.670> her<00:03:10.760> back<00:03:11.000> that<00:03:11.240> means<00:03:11.510> when<00:03:12.140> you

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
stuck to her back that means when you

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.960 
stuck to her back that means when you
move<00:03:12.440> her<00:03:12.560> arms<00:03:12.890> forward<00:03:13.430> or<00:03:13.580> anything<00:03:13.610> like

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
move her arms forward or anything like

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.490 
move her arms forward or anything like
that<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.420> wings<00:03:14.600> are<00:03:14.750> gonna<00:03:14.810> come<00:03:15.110> forward

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
that the wings are gonna come forward

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.950 
that the wings are gonna come forward
with<00:03:15.710> her<00:03:15.890> arms<00:03:16.250> so<00:03:16.610> again<00:03:17.270> like<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:17.570> said<00:03:17.630> you

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
that's a downfall of this figure now one

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.260 
that's a downfall of this figure now one
of<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.100> things<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:22.430> will<00:03:22.490> say<00:03:22.640> is<00:03:22.880> pretty<00:03:23.060> neat

up<00:03:27.170> with<00:03:27.350> her<00:03:27.500> arms<00:03:27.860> so<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:28.430> get<00:03:28.580> that<00:03:28.730> really

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
up with her arms so you get that really

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.900 
up with her arms so you get that really
cool<00:03:29.240> wing<00:03:29.510> spreading<00:03:30.080> pose<00:03:30.410> so<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.580> still

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
cool wing spreading pose so that still

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.550 
cool wing spreading pose so that still
works<00:03:32.090> very<00:03:32.360> nice<00:03:32.600> on<00:03:32.840> this<00:03:32.990> figure<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:33.410> then

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
works very nice on this figure and then

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.620 
works very nice on this figure and then
it<00:03:33.650> is<00:03:33.770> a<00:03:33.800> pretty<00:03:34.100> impressive<00:03:34.580> little<00:03:35.090> action

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
it is a pretty impressive little action

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.890 
it is a pretty impressive little action
feature<00:03:35.900> for<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.320> figure<00:03:36.620> but<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:38.510> problem

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
feature for the figure but the problem

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.200 
feature for the figure but the problem
is<00:03:39.020> we're<00:03:39.350> stuck<00:03:39.680> with<00:03:39.920> those<00:03:40.700> really<00:03:41.060> big

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
is we're stuck with those really big

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.910 
is we're stuck with those really big
drums<00:03:41.630> on<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:41.960> back<00:03:42.110> of<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.380> shoulder<00:03:42.770> it

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
drums on the back of the shoulder it

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.100 
drums on the back of the shoulder it
really<00:03:43.490> limits<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:44.000> poses<00:03:44.570> you<00:03:44.600> can<00:03:44.840> put<00:03:45.020> her

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
really limits the poses you can put her

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.320 
really limits the poses you can put her
in<00:03:45.260> because<00:03:45.410> of<00:03:45.800> the<00:03:46.430> way<00:03:46.610> it<00:03:46.790> kind<00:03:47.000> of<00:03:47.060> blocks

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
in because of the way it kind of blocks

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.440 
in because of the way it kind of blocks
her<00:03:47.570> articulation<00:03:48.380> so<00:03:49.340> otherwise<00:03:49.910> her<00:03:50.210> head

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
her articulation so otherwise her head

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.300 
her articulation so otherwise her head
is<00:03:50.660> there<00:03:51.080> we'll<00:03:51.200> turn<00:03:51.320> left<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:51.770> right<00:03:51.860> but

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
is there we'll turn left and right but

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.130 
is there we'll turn left and right but
the<00:03:52.430> feathers<00:03:52.820> coming<00:03:53.180> down<00:03:53.360> from<00:03:53.630> her<00:03:53.870> cowl

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
the feathers coming down from her cowl

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.020 
the feathers coming down from her cowl
do<00:03:54.770> sort<00:03:55.070> of<00:03:55.160> get<00:03:55.370> in<00:03:55.460> the<00:03:55.520> way<00:03:55.640> just<00:03:55.670> a<00:03:56.000> little

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
do sort of get in the way just a little

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.460 
do sort of get in the way just a little
bit<00:03:56.300> but<00:03:56.720> you<00:03:56.840> can<00:03:56.960> see<00:03:57.050> you<00:03:57.140> could<00:03:57.230> still

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
bit but you can see you could still

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.080 
bit but you can see you could still
rotates<00:03:57.830> around<00:03:57.980> she's<00:03:58.670> got<00:03:58.820> the<00:03:58.940> ball
