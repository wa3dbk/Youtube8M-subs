00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
programs and things like that before I

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.069 
programs and things like that before I
get<00:01:54.999> into<00:01:55.090> that<00:01:55.179> what<00:01:55.479> I<00:01:55.509> want<00:01:55.689> to<00:01:55.749> talk<00:01:55.869> to<00:01:56.020> you

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
these lights well go look to see how

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.050 
these lights well go look to see how
sturdy<00:02:02.409> these<00:02:02.649> things<00:02:02.920> are<00:02:03.159> these<00:02:03.729> things<00:02:03.909> are

out<00:02:20.790> all<00:02:21.790> of<00:02:21.850> your<00:02:22.090> programming<00:02:22.630> is<00:02:22.870> right

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
out all of your programming is right

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.970 
out all of your programming is right
here<00:02:23.230> your<00:02:23.410> microphone

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
here your microphone

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.960 
here your microphone
right<00:02:24.159> here<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:26.519> going<00:02:27.519> through<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.760> menu

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
right here and going through the menu

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.390 
right here and going through the menu
our<00:02:28.959> menu<00:02:29.349> options<00:02:29.379> are<00:02:30.010> gonna<00:02:30.099> break<00:02:30.340> down

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
our menu options are gonna break down

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.640 
our menu options are gonna break down
like<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:30.970> color<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:32.200> right<00:02:32.349> now<00:02:32.470> it's<00:02:32.590> on

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
like this color so right now it's on

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.699 
like this color so right now it's on
color<00:02:32.890> six<00:02:33.250> color<00:02:33.790> five<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:35.200> there<00:02:35.349> is<00:02:35.470> white

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
color six color five so there is white

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.839 
color six color five so there is white
the<00:02:36.310> amber<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:37.480> blue<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:38.200> green<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.799> red<00:02:38.980> as

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
the amber the blue the green the red as

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.640 
the amber the blue the green the red as
you<00:02:39.970> can<00:02:40.060> see<00:02:40.180> there<00:02:40.330> are<00:02:40.390> 63<00:02:40.900> colors<00:02:41.319> that<00:02:41.530> are

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
you can see there are 63 colors that are

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.009 
you can see there are 63 colors that are
built<00:02:41.920> into<00:02:42.280> this<00:02:42.400> system<00:02:42.569> so<00:02:43.569> going<00:02:43.780> into<00:02:43.930> the

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
built into this system so going into the

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.320 
built into this system so going into the
menu<00:02:44.349> that's<00:02:44.560> your<00:02:44.709> color<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.190> C<00:02:45.430> these<00:02:46.150> are

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
menu that's your color is C these are

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.729 
menu that's your color is C these are
your<00:02:46.420> programs<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:47.080> are<00:02:47.200> built<00:02:47.410> into<00:02:47.620> the

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
your programs that are built into the

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.259 
your programs that are built into the
unit<00:02:48.269> this<00:02:49.269> is<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.629> speed<00:02:50.579> this<00:02:51.579> is<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.910> sound

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
unit this is the speed this is the sound

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.229 
unit this is the speed this is the sound
active<00:02:52.690> through<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.019> microphone<00:02:54.180> this<00:02:55.180> is

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
active through the microphone this is

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.990 
active through the microphone this is
the<00:02:55.510> sensor<00:02:56.019> on<00:02:56.280> how<00:02:57.280> sensitive<00:02:57.610> that

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
the sensor on how sensitive that

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.350 
the sensor on how sensitive that
microphone<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.650> now<00:02:59.650> this<00:02:59.860> is<00:03:00.069> you<00:03:00.340> such<00:03:00.970> as<00:03:01.120> UV

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
microphone is now this is you such as UV

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.250 
microphone is now this is you such as UV
so<00:03:02.230> if<00:03:02.319> I<00:03:02.379> want<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.590> change<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:02.980> value<00:03:03.310> in<00:03:03.459> that

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
so if I want to change the value in that

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.640 
so if I want to change the value in that
that's<00:03:05.260> dimmer<00:03:06.959> okay<00:03:07.959> so<00:03:08.019> I<00:03:08.140> can<00:03:08.290> also<00:03:08.410> run

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
that's dimmer okay so I can also run

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.130 
that's dimmer okay so I can also run
this<00:03:08.799> in<00:03:09.010> DMX<00:03:09.459> which<00:03:09.700> is<00:03:09.849> six<00:03:10.060> channel<00:03:10.390> mode<00:03:10.540> K

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
this in DMX which is six channel mode K

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.349 
this in DMX which is six channel mode K
channel<00:03:11.470> mode<00:03:11.650> or<00:03:12.040> twelve<00:03:12.250> channel<00:03:12.579> mode<00:03:12.730> so

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
channel mode or twelve channel mode so

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.960 
channel mode or twelve channel mode so
you<00:03:13.450> get<00:03:13.599> three<00:03:13.780> different<00:03:13.870> channels<00:03:14.200> there

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
you get three different channels there

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.729 
you get three different channels there
and<00:03:15.970> then<00:03:16.209> call<00:03:16.690> our<00:03:16.840> program<00:03:17.079> so<00:03:17.440> on<00:03:17.500> its<00:03:17.620> own

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
and then call our program so on its own

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.190 
and then call our program so on its own
again<00:03:17.829> so<00:03:18.519> again<00:03:18.700> a<00:03:19.239> lot<00:03:19.690> of<00:03:19.810> great<00:03:19.989> things

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
again so again a lot of great things

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.140 
again so again a lot of great things
about<00:03:20.349> this<00:03:20.709> fixture<00:03:21.040> it's<00:03:21.640> a<00:03:21.730> nice<00:03:21.879> sturdy

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
about this fixture it's a nice sturdy

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.619 
about this fixture it's a nice sturdy
fixture<00:03:22.569> I<00:03:22.780> love<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.410> fact<00:03:23.680> that<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:24.790> the

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
fixture I love the fact that the the

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.180 
fixture I love the fact that the the
diodes<00:03:26.049> actually<00:03:26.410> have<00:03:26.560> a<00:03:26.590> nice<00:03:26.859> hard<00:03:27.099> plastic

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
diodes actually have a nice hard plastic

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.729 
diodes actually have a nice hard plastic
over<00:03:27.879> the<00:03:27.970> top<00:03:28.150> of<00:03:28.180> them<00:03:28.450> as<00:03:29.049> you<00:03:29.200> can<00:03:29.290> see<00:03:29.410> here

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
over the top of them as you can see here

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.860 
over the top of them as you can see here
and<00:03:29.919> then<00:03:30.370> it's<00:03:30.669> got<00:03:30.819> the<00:03:30.970> three<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:31.840> three

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
and then it's got the three the three

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.780 
and then it's got the three the three
diodes<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:32.620> they're<00:03:33.010> very<00:03:33.250> bright<00:03:33.549> they're

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
diodes and they're very bright they're

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.920 
diodes and they're very bright they're
actually<00:03:34.060> very<00:03:34.090> uh<00:03:34.680> pretty<00:03:35.680> intense<00:03:36.690> but<00:03:37.690> all

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
actually very uh pretty intense but all

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.690 
actually very uh pretty intense but all
of<00:03:38.139> the<00:03:38.260> color<00:03:38.560> mixing<00:03:39.010> happens<00:03:39.340> right<00:03:39.519> here

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
of the color mixing happens right here

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.129 
of the color mixing happens right here
at<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.880> fixtures<00:03:40.269> so<00:03:40.480> when<00:03:40.599> it's<00:03:40.720> actually<00:03:41.019> up

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
at the fixtures so when it's actually up

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:42.990 
at the fixtures so when it's actually up
