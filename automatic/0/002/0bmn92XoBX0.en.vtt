do a systematic quantitative lit review
now<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.080> method<00:00:10.320> that<00:00:10.530> we've

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
now this is a method that we've

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.249 
now this is a method that we've
developed<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.309> griffith<00:00:11.610> university<00:00:11.960> that<00:00:12.960> we

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
developed a griffith university that we

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.620 
developed a griffith university that we
as<00:00:13.530> academics<00:00:14.040> but<00:00:14.610> most<00:00:14.880> importantly<00:00:15.480> our

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
as academics but most importantly our

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.689 
as academics but most importantly our
students<00:00:16.109> are<00:00:16.199> found<00:00:16.379> incredibly<00:00:16.980> useful<00:00:17.250> as

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
students are found incredibly useful as

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.790 
students are found incredibly useful as
a<00:00:18.000> way<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.270> actually<00:00:18.750> getting<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:19.080> organize

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
a way of actually getting to organize

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.470 
a way of actually getting to organize
their<00:00:20.039> material<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.699> produce<00:00:21.060> their

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
their material and produce their

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.720 
their material and produce their
literature<00:00:21.930> review<00:00:22.310> so<00:00:23.310> what<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.460> want<00:00:23.640> to

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
literature review so what I want to

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.060 
literature review so what I want to
start<00:00:23.970> off<00:00:24.150> with<00:00:24.210> today<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.529> first<00:00:25.830> one

we've written about how to use this

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.630 
we've written about how to use this
method<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.809> there<00:00:46.289> are<00:00:46.350> also<00:00:46.440> three<00:00:46.950> examples

method and there are also three examples

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.400 
method and there are also three examples
of<00:00:47.879> papers<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.750> our<00:00:48.809> students<00:00:49.320> have

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
of papers that our students have

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.680 
of papers that our students have
actually<00:00:49.770> already<00:00:50.010> produced<00:00:50.700> using<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.390> and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
actually already produced using this and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.380 
actually already produced using this and

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
is a diagram here showing you that the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.219 
is a diagram here showing you that the
systematic<00:01:05.640> review<00:01:06.180> method<00:01:06.540> what's<00:01:06.930> really

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
systematic review method what's really

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.570 
systematic review method what's really
good<00:01:07.380> about<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.130> step-by-step

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
good about it is it's a step-by-step

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.510 
good about it is it's a step-by-step
process<00:01:09.140> we've<00:01:10.140> broken<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.619> down<00:01:10.770> into<00:01:10.830> 15

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
process we've broken it down into 15

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.090 
process we've broken it down into 15
steps<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.299> basic<00:01:12.869> three<00:01:13.170> parts<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.830> doing

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
steps and basic three parts of doing

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.550 
steps and basic three parts of doing
that<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.729> first<00:01:15.000> part<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.570> being<00:01:15.840> systematic

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
that the first part is being systematic

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.010 
that the first part is being systematic
it's<00:01:16.770> gaining<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.369> information<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.630> second

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
it's gaining the information the second

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.510 
it's gaining the information the second
part<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.350> entering<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.860> into<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> personal

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
part is entering that into a personal

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.760 
part is entering that into a personal
database<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.360> then<00:01:21.780> third<00:01:22.020> part<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.439> turning

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
database and then third part is turning

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.429 
database and then third part is turning
that<00:01:22.860> database<00:01:23.299> into<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.600> series<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.229> tables

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
that database into a series of tables

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.320 
that database into a series of tables
and<00:01:25.799> then<00:01:26.009> from<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.490> into<00:01:26.850> your<00:01:26.939> literature

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
and then from that into your literature

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.270 
and then from that into your literature
review<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.869> into<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.799> actual<00:01:29.159> paper<00:01:29.990> so

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
review and into the actual paper so

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.719 
review and into the actual paper so
you're<00:01:32.280> thinking<00:01:32.750> why<00:01:33.750> try<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.079> method<00:01:34.729> what

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
you're thinking why try this method what

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.450 
you're thinking why try this method what
am<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.909> going<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.240> do<00:01:36.360> why<00:01:36.570> do<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:37.020> well<00:01:37.530> it's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
am I going to do why do this well it's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.830 
am I going to do why do this well it's
really<00:01:38.610> interesting<00:01:39.150> about<00:01:39.270> this

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
really interesting about this

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.200 
really interesting about this
everyone<00:01:40.770> does<00:01:41.009> literature<00:01:41.610> reviews<00:01:41.970> it's

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
everyone does literature reviews it's

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.760 
everyone does literature reviews it's
basically<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> most<00:01:42.960> one<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> most

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
basically the most one of the most

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.069 
basically the most one of the most
common<00:01:44.280> activities<00:01:44.759> we<00:01:44.909> do<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.450> all<00:01:45.600> theses

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
common activities we do and all theses

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.050 
common activities we do and all theses
start<00:01:46.380> with<00:01:46.530> literature<00:01:46.920> reviews<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.520> often

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
start with literature reviews and often

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.880 
start with literature reviews and often
when<00:01:48.210> you're<00:01:48.360> new<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> field<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.680> first

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
when you're new to a field is the first

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.319 
when you're new to a field is the first
thing<00:01:50.040> you've<00:01:50.189> got<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.399> do<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.790> go<00:01:50.939> learn<00:01:51.149> all

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
thing you've got to do is go learn all

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.350 
thing you've got to do is go learn all
that<00:01:51.479> literature<00:01:51.799> so<00:01:52.799> we<00:01:53.610> need<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.909> be<00:01:54.030> really

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
that literature so we need to be really

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.330 
that literature so we need to be really
efficient<00:01:54.960> about<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.200> way<00:01:55.350> we<00:01:55.649> do<00:01:55.829> something

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
efficient about the way we do something

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.850 
efficient about the way we do something
and<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.180> way<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.600> doing<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.560> better

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
and this is a way of doing it better

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.459 
and this is a way of doing it better
than<00:01:59.189> some<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> more<00:01:59.700> traditional<00:02:00.469> so

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
than some of the more traditional so

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.649 
than some of the more traditional so
what<00:02:02.189> we've<00:02:02.340> done<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.210> can<00:02:03.360> use<00:02:03.509> this

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
what we've done is you can use this

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.010 
what we've done is you can use this
method<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.049> produce<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.649> structured

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
method to produce a structured

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.869 
method to produce a structured
quantitative<00:02:07.020> summary<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.649> field<00:02:07.920> you

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
quantitative summary of the field you

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.390 
quantitative summary of the field you
can<00:02:08.910> use<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.810> update<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.619> reuse<00:02:11.039> during

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
can use it to update and reuse during

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.790 
can use it to update and reuse during
your<00:02:11.520> PhD<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.209> once<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.540> set<00:02:12.750> up<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.020> data

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
your PhD so once you set up this data

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.490 
your PhD so once you set up this data
as<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.310> go<00:02:14.459> through<00:02:14.569> doing<00:02:15.569> your<00:02:15.690> PhD<00:02:15.959> or

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
as you go through doing your PhD or

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.590 
as you go through doing your PhD or
working<00:02:17.010> in<00:02:17.069> that<00:02:17.220> field<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.760> might<00:02:17.940> be<00:02:18.150> as<00:02:18.360> an

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
working in that field it might be as an

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.170 
working in that field it might be as an
academic<00:02:19.140> for<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.190> next<00:02:20.370> 20<00:02:20.640> years<00:02:20.670> who<00:02:21.150> knows

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
academic for the next 20 years who knows

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.870 
academic for the next 20 years who knows
you<00:02:22.110> can<00:02:22.290> just<00:02:22.470> add<00:02:22.680> papers<00:02:23.310> as<00:02:23.490> they<00:02:23.640> come<00:02:23.850> out

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
you can just add papers as they come out

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.880 
you can just add papers as they come out
to<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:24.330> database<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:25.080> it's<00:02:25.230> always<00:02:25.440> fresh

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
to that database so it's always fresh

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.800 
to that database so it's always fresh
it's<00:02:26.190> always<00:02:26.580> got<00:02:26.819> all<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.480> literature

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
it's always got all of the literature

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.190 
it's always got all of the literature
there<00:02:28.440> ready<00:02:28.680> for<00:02:28.800> you<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.100> easily<00:02:29.280> access<00:02:30.200> you

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
there ready for you to easily access you

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.020 
there ready for you to easily access you
can<00:02:31.230> use<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.770> if<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.220> wanted<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.580> do<00:02:32.700> then<00:02:32.850> go

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
can use it if you wanted to do then go

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.970 
can use it if you wanted to do then go
do<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.390> traditional<00:02:33.720> narrative<00:02:34.470> method<00:02:34.800> and

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
do a traditional narrative method and

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.770 
do a traditional narrative method and
I'll<00:02:35.130> talk<00:02:35.310> about<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.790> what<00:02:36.360> traditional

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
I'll talk about that what traditional

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.360 
I'll talk about that what traditional
narrative<00:02:37.110> methods<00:02:37.410> are<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.890> bit<00:02:37.920> more<00:02:38.250> in<00:02:38.310> a

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
narrative methods are a bit more in a

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.750 
narrative methods are a bit more in a
moment

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
moment

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.660 
moment
you<00:02:39.390> can<00:02:39.569> use<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.959> if<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.230> wanted<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.709> use<00:02:40.920> one

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
you can use it if you wanted to use one

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.250 
you can use it if you wanted to use one
of<00:02:41.700> these<00:02:41.850> meta-analysis<00:02:42.660> methods<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.140> are

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
of these meta-analysis methods that are

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.750 
of these meta-analysis methods that are
sometimes<00:02:43.440> used<00:02:43.739> particularly<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.489> the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
sometimes used particularly in the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.020 
sometimes used particularly in the
health<00:02:45.090> fields<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:45.959> I'll<00:02:46.050> talk<00:02:46.230> about<00:02:46.260> those

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
health fields and I'll talk about those

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.520 
health fields and I'll talk about those
you<00:02:48.030> can<00:02:48.209> use<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.510> for<00:02:48.690> what<00:02:48.810> we<00:02:49.080> use<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.500> for

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
you can use it for what we use it for

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.220 
you can use it for what we use it for
which<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.550> quantitative<00:02:51.300> literature

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
which is a quantitative literature

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.150 
which is a quantitative literature
review<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.090> then<00:02:54.110> you<00:02:55.110> can<00:02:55.290> actually<00:02:55.530> use<00:02:55.920> it

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
review and then you can actually use it

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.710 
review and then you can actually use it
for<00:02:56.190> your<00:02:56.340> lit<00:02:56.489> review<00:02:56.820> update<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.540> when<00:02:57.600> you

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
for your lit review update it when you

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.690 
for your lit review update it when you
produce<00:02:57.870> your<00:02:58.140> final<00:02:58.470> thesis<00:02:58.620> but<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.519> can

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
produce your final thesis but you can

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.970 
produce your final thesis but you can
also<00:02:59.970> produce<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.720> as<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.870> published<00:03:01.260> paper<00:03:01.500> and

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
also produce it as a published paper and

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.009 
also produce it as a published paper and
so<00:03:02.370> it's<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.910> method<00:03:03.150> that's<00:03:03.450> got<00:03:03.630> lots<00:03:03.810> of

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
so it's a method that's got lots of

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.990 
so it's a method that's got lots of
these<00:03:04.200> pots<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.130> uses<00:03:06.590> now<00:03:08.000> traditionally

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
these pots of uses now traditionally

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.520 
these pots of uses now traditionally
literature<00:03:09.720> reviews<00:03:10.019> are<00:03:10.200> done<00:03:10.350> as<00:03:10.500> a

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
literature reviews are done as a

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.229 
literature reviews are done as a
narrative<00:03:10.920> style<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.580> this<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:11.850> where<00:03:12.030> you

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
narrative style and this is where you

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.720 
narrative style and this is where you
often<00:03:13.110> don't<00:03:13.620> use<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:13.830> very<00:03:14.069> systematic<00:03:14.550> way<00:03:14.580> to

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
often don't use a very systematic way to

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.250 
often don't use a very systematic way to
get<00:03:15.000> all<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.209> literature<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:15.750> go<00:03:15.870> find

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
get all the literature you go find

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.259 
get all the literature you go find
literature<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.130> hopefully<00:03:17.579> you<00:03:17.700> found<00:03:18.030> all

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
literature and hopefully you found all

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.150 
literature and hopefully you found all
that<00:03:18.390> there<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.079> then<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.769> put<00:03:20.070> it

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
that there is and then you put it

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.130 
that there is and then you put it
together<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.670> evaluate<00:03:21.269> in<00:03:21.420> your<00:03:21.570> head<00:03:21.840> and

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
together and evaluate in your head and

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.140 
together and evaluate in your head and
work<00:03:22.320> out<00:03:22.560> some<00:03:22.890> sort<00:03:23.100> of<00:03:23.160> criteria<00:03:23.970> and

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
work out some sort of criteria and

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.090 
work out some sort of criteria and
structure<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.810> then<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.350> write<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.739> narrative

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
structure and then you write a narrative

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.340 
structure and then you write a narrative
form<00:03:26.640> of<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:26.880> where<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.120> give<00:03:27.600> descriptions

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
form of it where you give descriptions

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.069 
form of it where you give descriptions
or<00:03:28.500> summaries<00:03:29.010> now<00:03:29.760> if<00:03:30.209> you're<00:03:30.420> an<00:03:30.540> expert<00:03:30.840> in

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
or summaries now if you're an expert in

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.870 
or summaries now if you're an expert in
the<00:03:31.170> discipline<00:03:31.620> that's<00:03:32.250> actually<00:03:32.610> really

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
the discipline that's actually really

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.430 
the discipline that's actually really
really<00:03:33.000> easy<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.660> do<00:03:33.840> because<00:03:34.170> it's<00:03:34.290> already

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
really easy to do because it's already

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.170 
really easy to do because it's already
in<00:03:34.709> your<00:03:34.829> head<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.370> already<00:03:35.610> know<00:03:35.910> the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
in your head you already know the

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.640 
in your head you already know the
literature<00:03:36.660> you<00:03:36.780> know<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:37.140> background<00:03:37.320> of

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
literature you know the background of

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.160 
literature you know the background of
the<00:03:37.739> field<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.130> know<00:03:38.370> what's<00:03:38.640> going<00:03:39.030> on<00:03:39.180> but

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
the field you know what's going on but

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.890 
the field you know what's going on but
that's<00:03:40.709> not<00:03:40.980> where<00:03:41.160> most<00:03:41.370> of<00:03:41.610> us<00:03:41.880> all<00:03:42.299> start<00:03:42.690> we

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
that's not where most of us all start we

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.800 
that's not where most of us all start we
start<00:03:43.230> as<00:03:43.410> novices<00:03:43.890> we<00:03:44.820> don't<00:03:45.120> know<00:03:45.329> the<00:03:45.510> field

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
start as novices we don't know the field

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.259 
start as novices we don't know the field
and<00:03:46.109> so<00:03:46.590> doing<00:03:46.890> that's<00:03:47.250> really<00:03:47.609> really<00:03:48.000> hard

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
and so doing that's really really hard

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.560 
and so doing that's really really hard
and<00:03:48.720> it's<00:03:49.170> also<00:03:49.440> it's<00:03:49.980> hard<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.430> know<00:03:50.609> what

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
and it's also it's hard to know what

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.300 
and it's also it's hard to know what
criteria<00:03:51.780> I<00:03:52.200> should<00:03:52.440> use<00:03:52.620> it's<00:03:52.859> hard<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.190> know

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
criteria I should use it's hard to know

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.250 
criteria I should use it's hard to know
I've<00:03:53.459> got<00:03:53.730> all<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.030> literature<00:03:54.510> it's<00:03:55.019> very

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
I've got all the literature it's very

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.530 
I've got all the literature it's very
hard<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.620> work<00:03:55.829> out<00:03:56.010> a<00:03:56.040> structure<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:56.970> use<00:03:57.390> in

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
hard to work out a structure to use in

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.870 
hard to work out a structure to use in
that<00:03:57.600> type<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:57.930> format<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.680> then<00:03:59.459> if<00:03:59.609> you<00:03:59.700> try

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
that type of format and then if you try

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.550 
that type of format and then if you try
to<00:03:59.970> publish<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.600> you<00:04:00.690> have<00:04:00.840> this<00:04:00.959> difficulty

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
to publish it you have this difficulty

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.099 
to publish it you have this difficulty
that<00:04:01.590> you're<00:04:02.010> not<00:04:02.280> an<00:04:02.489> expert<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.239> generally

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
that you're not an expert and generally

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.810 
that you're not an expert and generally
narrative<00:04:04.560> reviews<00:04:04.950> get<00:04:05.280> published<00:04:05.640> by

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
narrative reviews get published by

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.390 
narrative reviews get published by
experts<00:04:06.420> because<00:04:06.900> part<00:04:07.260> of<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.680> standing<00:04:08.280> of

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
experts because part of the standing of

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.740 
experts because part of the standing of
somebody<00:04:08.700> reviewing<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.269> is<00:04:09.390> knowing<00:04:09.600> that

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
somebody reviewing it is knowing that

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.099 
somebody reviewing it is knowing that
this<00:04:09.989> person<00:04:10.320> knows<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.530> field<00:04:11.359> so<00:04:12.359> that's

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
this person knows the field so that's

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.199 
this person knows the field so that's
why<00:04:13.380> lots<00:04:14.100> of<00:04:14.220> people<00:04:14.519> do<00:04:14.640> them<00:04:14.790> and<00:04:15.000> you<00:04:15.060> can

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
why lots of people do them and you can

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.060 
why lots of people do them and you can
use<00:04:15.239> this<00:04:15.540> as<00:04:15.810> method<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.350> get<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.680> data<00:04:16.890> for

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
use this as method to get the data for

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.620 
use this as method to get the data for
your<00:04:17.160> narrative<00:04:17.489> review<00:04:17.789> but<00:04:18.209> it's<00:04:18.329> why<00:04:18.479> we

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
your narrative review but it's why we

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.969 
your narrative review but it's why we
find<00:04:18.930> that<00:04:19.079> they're<00:04:19.229> often<00:04:19.380> troubles<00:04:19.859> with

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
talking about the systematic how you

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.790 
talking about the systematic how you
collect<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.270> data<00:05:21.380> quantitative<00:05:22.380> how<00:05:22.740> you

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
collect the data quantitative how you

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.010 
collect the data quantitative how you
evaluate<00:05:23.160> the<00:05:23.640> data<00:05:23.850> and<00:05:24.210> a<00:05:24.660> literature

experience what it felt like to do it
but<00:06:20.100> what<00:06:20.250> we<00:06:20.370> want<00:06:20.550> to<00:06:20.640> show<00:06:20.850> is<00:06:21.120> that<00:06:21.180> we

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
but what we want to show is that we

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.870 
but what we want to show is that we
haven't<00:06:22.440> done<00:06:22.860> these<00:06:23.040> videos<00:06:23.430> we<00:06:23.580> haven't

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
haven't done these videos we haven't

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.220 
haven't done these videos we haven't
talked<00:06:24.060> to<00:06:24.090> you<00:06:24.240> about<00:06:24.330> this<00:06:24.570> -<00:06:24.780> we<00:06:24.930> knew<00:06:25.110> it

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.230 
talked to you about this - we knew it

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.700 
talked to you about this - we knew it
worked

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
worked

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.710 
worked
and<00:06:25.800> we<00:06:26.310> worked<00:06:26.580> the<00:06:26.910> level<00:06:27.270> that<00:06:27.510> the

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
and we worked the level that the

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.420 
and we worked the level that the
students<00:06:28.080> were<00:06:28.200> able<00:06:28.260> to<00:06:28.500> publish<00:06:28.950> so<00:06:29.400> a

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
students were able to publish so a

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.970 
students were able to publish so a
third-year<00:06:29.760> student<00:06:30.360> got<00:06:30.900> a<00:06:30.960> paper<00:06:31.290> out<00:06:31.560> in<00:06:31.830> an

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:31.980 
third-year student got a paper out in an

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.220 
third-year student got a paper out in an
International<00:06:32.700> Journal<00:06:32.730> in<00:06:33.270> her<00:06:33.660> honors<00:06:33.960> here

International Journal in her honors here

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.660 
International Journal in her honors here
using<00:06:34.830> this<00:06:34.950> method<00:06:35.630> so<00:06:37.280> next<00:06:38.280> year<00:06:38.370> I<00:06:38.460> want<00:06:38.580> to

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:38.670 
using this method so next year I want to

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.510 
using this method so next year I want to
know<00:06:38.790> what<00:06:39.000> to<00:06:39.150> actually<00:06:39.360> do<00:06:39.720> so

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
know what to actually do so

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.830 
know what to actually do so
you<00:06:40.879> need<00:06:41.060> to<00:06:41.120> go<00:06:41.180> watch<00:06:41.330> the<00:06:41.389> next<00:06:41.690> video

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
you need to go watch the next video

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.659 
you need to go watch the next video
that's<00:06:42.319> going<00:06:42.650> to<00:06:42.800> be<00:06:42.889> about<00:06:43.099> being

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:43.669 
that's going to be about being

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:46.419 
that's going to be about being
systematic
