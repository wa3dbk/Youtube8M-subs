where i'm using the tactical insertion

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.310 
where i'm using the tactical insertion
so<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.920> saw<00:01:17.070> me<00:01:17.220> planted<00:01:17.610> earlier<00:01:18.049> just<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.200> in

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
so you saw me planted earlier just so in

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.810 
so you saw me planted earlier just so in
case<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.619> die<00:01:19.680> I'm<00:01:20.040> right<00:01:20.280> back<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> action

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
case I die I'm right back in the action

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.580 
case I die I'm right back in the action
right<00:01:21.390> away<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.869> don't<00:01:22.049> have<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.200> waste

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
right away and I don't have to waste

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.859 
right away and I don't have to waste
crucial<00:01:23.040> time<00:01:23.390> spawning<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.479> getting<00:01:24.750> all

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
crucial time spawning and getting all

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.450 
crucial time spawning and getting all
the<00:01:24.990> way<00:01:25.080> back<00:01:25.259> especially<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> big<00:01:26.310> map

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the way back especially on a big map

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.490 
the way back especially on a big map
like<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.720> right<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:27.900> that's<00:01:28.049> probably<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
like this right so that's probably the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.200 
like this right so that's probably the
takeaway<00:01:28.860> point<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.549> you've<00:01:30.060> now

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
takeaway point is that you've now

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.760 
takeaway point is that you've now
spawned<00:01:30.540> right<00:01:30.659> near<00:01:30.990> your<00:01:31.170> target<00:01:31.590> that

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
spawned right near your target that

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.319 
spawned right near your target that
you've<00:01:31.860> already<00:01:31.979> planted<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:33.090> guy<00:01:33.270> who

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
you've already planted on the guy who

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.179 
you've already planted on the guy who
killed<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.900> potentially<00:01:34.590> could<00:01:34.680> run<00:01:34.860> up<00:01:34.890> to

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
killed you potentially could run up to

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.270 
killed you potentially could run up to
defuse<00:01:36.119> but<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.960> get<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.259> kill<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.100> bomb

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
defuse but you get the kill and the bomb

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.249 
defuse but you get the kill and the bomb
goes<00:01:38.490> off<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.090> that's<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.900> know<00:01:39.930> that's<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
goes off so that's you know that's a

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.929 
goes off so that's you know that's a
successful<00:01:40.799> plant<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.310> good<00:01:41.460> use<00:01:41.610> attack

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939

kid<00:01:46.570> I<00:01:46.659> guess<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:46.869> steady<00:01:47.200> aim<00:01:47.350> instead<00:01:47.560> of

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
kid I guess a steady aim instead of

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.359 
kid I guess a steady aim instead of
ninja<00:01:48.070> on<00:01:48.369> any<00:01:48.909> reason<00:01:49.240> um<00:01:49.840> I<00:01:50.500> use<00:01:51.009> an<00:01:51.130> engine

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
ninja on any reason um I use an engine

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.330 
ninja on any reason um I use an engine
now<00:01:51.520> but<00:01:52.000> there<00:01:52.600> at<00:01:52.719> this<00:01:52.869> time<00:01:52.930> I<00:01:53.649> didn't<00:01:54.250> have

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
a headset when I was playing so I didn't

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.050 
a headset when I was playing so I didn't
think<00:01:56.020> ninja<00:01:56.380> was<00:01:56.500> as<00:01:56.619> crucial<00:01:56.860> but<00:01:57.789> now<00:01:57.939> that

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
think ninja was as crucial but now that

and get as many kills as i can write and
i<00:03:40.780> think<00:03:41.170> using<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.860> chopper<00:03:42.040> gunner<00:03:42.250> in

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
i think using the chopper gunner in

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
i think using the chopper gunner in
demolition<00:03:42.880> is<00:03:42.940> actually<00:03:43.180> quite<00:03:43.300> good

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
demolition is actually quite good

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.330 
demolition is actually quite good
because<00:03:43.780> you<00:03:44.110> can<00:03:44.140> actually<00:03:44.290> force<00:03:44.950> or

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
because you can actually force or

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.370 
because you can actually force or
hopefully<00:03:45.819> force<00:03:46.060> or<00:03:46.300> respawn<00:03:46.720> outside<00:03:47.230> of

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
hopefully force or respawn outside of

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.199 
hopefully force or respawn outside of
where<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.709> target<00:03:47.890> is<00:03:48.099> unfortunately<00:03:49.060> it's

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
where the target is unfortunately it's

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.690 
where the target is unfortunately it's
in<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.360> house<00:03:49.510> but<00:03:50.380> i<00:03:50.560> noticed<00:03:50.920> that<00:03:50.980> your

so I switched my kid right to start off

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.590 
so I switched my kid right to start off
the<00:04:44.740> round<00:04:45.039> it's<00:04:45.430> a<00:04:45.610> pretty<00:04:46.210> much<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.450> same

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
the round it's a pretty much the same

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.040 
the round it's a pretty much the same
the<00:04:47.110> same<00:04:47.140> perks<00:04:47.530> smoke<00:04:48.490> grenade<00:04:48.760> but<00:04:49.510> I<00:04:49.570> have

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
the same perks smoke grenade but I have

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.679 
the same perks smoke grenade but I have
a<00:04:50.080> sim<00:04:50.320> text<00:04:50.650> instead<00:04:50.950> of<00:04:51.010> tactical<00:04:51.490> insertion

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:52.689 
a sim text instead of tactical insertion

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:55.379 
a sim text instead of tactical insertion
because<00:04:53.289> on<00:04:53.679> defense<00:04:54.099> you<00:04:54.999> know<00:04:55.089> if<00:04:55.239> they're

because on defense you know if they're

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.209 
because on defense you know if they're
planting<00:04:55.899> and<00:04:56.169> I<00:04:56.229> can't<00:04:56.439> get<00:04:56.529> a<00:04:56.559> clear<00:04:56.799> shot<00:04:56.830> I

00:04:57.209 --> 00:04:57.219 
planting and I can't get a clear shot I

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:58.979 
planting and I can't get a clear shot I
want<00:04:57.399> to<00:04:57.459> be<00:04:57.549> able<00:04:57.639> just<00:04:57.819> to<00:04:57.939> lava<00:04:58.239> semtex<00:04:58.839> in

00:04:58.979 --> 00:04:58.989 
want to be able just to lava semtex in

00:04:58.989 --> 00:05:00.989 
want to be able just to lava semtex in
there<00:04:59.199> and<00:04:59.589> get<00:04:59.739> a<00:04:59.769> you<00:05:00.519> know<00:05:00.610> killed<00:05:00.879> the

00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:00.999 
there and get a you know killed the

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:03.600 
there and get a you know killed the
diffuser<00:05:01.769> right<00:05:02.769> instead<00:05:03.099> of<00:05:03.159> giving<00:05:03.279> up<00:05:03.489> your

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
diffuser right instead of giving up your

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.479 
diffuser right instead of giving up your
position<00:05:03.999> as<00:05:04.089> well<00:05:04.269> as<00:05:04.419> perhaps<00:05:05.069> so<00:05:06.069> point<00:05:06.339> out

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:06.489 
position as well as perhaps so point out

00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:07.799 
position as well as perhaps so point out
the<00:05:06.610> difference<00:05:06.999> between<00:05:07.089> sabotage<00:05:07.659> and

00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:07.809 
the difference between sabotage and

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:10.019 
the difference between sabotage and
demolition<00:05:08.349> and<00:05:08.529> why<00:05:09.189> you're<00:05:09.519> preferring<00:05:09.909> to

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:10.029 
demolition and why you're preferring to

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:11.879 
demolition and why you're preferring to
stay<00:05:10.209> in<00:05:10.299> the<00:05:10.360> house<00:05:10.479> at<00:05:10.629> the<00:05:10.659> moment<00:05:10.889> I'm

stay in the house at the moment I'm
staying<00:05:12.309> in<00:05:12.429> house<00:05:12.579> right<00:05:12.789> now<00:05:12.909> because<00:05:13.360> we

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
staying in house right now because we

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.989 
staying in house right now because we

00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:15.999 
only need one we only need one bomb site

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:17.489 
only need one we only need one bomb site
alive<00:05:16.239> at<00:05:16.389> the<00:05:16.479> end<00:05:16.509> their<00:05:16.719> match<00:05:16.869> to<00:05:17.079> win<00:05:17.229> and

alive at the end their match to win and

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:20.789 
alive at the end their match to win and
in<00:05:18.309> the<00:05:18.399> previous<00:05:18.669> round<00:05:18.839> be<00:05:19.839> was<00:05:20.169> we<00:05:20.499> got<00:05:20.649> be

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:20.799 
in the previous round be was we got be

00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:22.739 
in the previous round be was we got be
pretty<00:05:21.039> quickly<00:05:21.279> so<00:05:21.579> I<00:05:22.089> assumed<00:05:22.449> they<00:05:22.659> were

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:22.749 
pretty quickly so I assumed they were

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:24.719 
pretty quickly so I assumed they were
gonna<00:05:22.899> but<00:05:23.229> turned<00:05:23.559> out<00:05:23.619> their<00:05:23.799> team<00:05:24.009> wasn't<00:05:24.579> a

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
gonna but turned out their team wasn't a

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:25.859 
gonna but turned out their team wasn't a
skilled<00:05:24.999> Assessor<00:05:25.329> weren't<00:05:25.659> trying<00:05:25.839> to

00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:25.869 
skilled Assessor weren't trying to

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:27.839 
skilled Assessor weren't trying to
Tartars<00:05:26.199> us<00:05:26.319> because<00:05:26.619> they<00:05:27.339> don't<00:05:27.519> take<00:05:27.669> be

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
Tartars us because they don't take be

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.569 
Tartars us because they don't take be
but<00:05:28.089> if<00:05:28.329> they<00:05:29.079> had<00:05:29.259> taken<00:05:29.499> be<00:05:29.769> I<00:05:30.009> we<00:05:30.399> already

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:30.579 
but if they had taken be I we already

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:32.279 
but if they had taken be I we already
have<00:05:30.729> good<00:05:30.909> positions<00:05:31.329> that<00:05:31.389> up<00:05:31.509> at<00:05:31.629> a<00:05:31.659> and<00:05:32.050> we

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
have good positions that up at a and we

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:33.809 
have good positions that up at a and we
probably<00:05:32.469> be<00:05:32.709> able<00:05:32.800> to<00:05:32.919> protect<00:05:33.189> it<00:05:33.339> so<00:05:33.610> is

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:33.819 
probably be able to protect it so is

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:37.679 
probably be able to protect it so is
easy<00:05:34.809> to<00:05:34.959> defend<00:05:35.139> on<00:05:35.319> this<00:05:35.469> map<00:05:35.999> right<00:05:36.999> so

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:37.689 
easy to defend on this map right so

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:38.879 
easy to defend on this map right so
that's<00:05:37.839> probably<00:05:38.079> the<00:05:38.289> important<00:05:38.679> thing<00:05:38.769> is

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
that's probably the important thing is

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:40.469 
that's probably the important thing is
that<00:05:38.919> different<00:05:39.309> maps<00:05:39.489> have<00:05:39.729> bomb<00:05:39.969> sites<00:05:40.269> that

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
that different maps have bomb sites that

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.600 
that different maps have bomb sites that
you<00:05:40.569> probably<00:05:40.809> should<00:05:41.259> just<00:05:41.289> give<00:05:42.129> up<00:05:42.279> as<00:05:42.429> well

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
you probably should just give up as well

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.909 
you probably should just give up as well
while<00:05:43.449> the<00:05:43.659> rather<00:05:44.050> than<00:05:44.229> take<00:05:44.679> a<00:05:44.709> lot<00:05:44.889> of

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
while the rather than take a lot of

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.429 
while the rather than take a lot of
deaths<00:05:45.269> spawn<00:05:46.269> into<00:05:46.509> boo<00:05:46.719> because<00:05:46.899> imagine<00:05:47.199> if

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:47.439 
deaths spawn into boo because imagine if

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:49.319 
deaths spawn into boo because imagine if
he<00:05:47.589> everyone<00:05:48.099> tries<00:05:48.279> to<00:05:48.309> protect<00:05:48.610> a<00:05:48.729> mb<00:05:49.059> he

he everyone tries to protect a mb he

00:05:49.329 --> 00:05:51.029 
he everyone tries to protect a mb he
died<00:05:49.659> a<00:05:49.689> few<00:05:49.899> times<00:05:49.959> and<00:05:50.379> has<00:05:50.499> spawned<00:05:50.769> down

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
died a few times and has spawned down

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:52.589 
died a few times and has spawned down
the<00:05:51.399> very<00:05:51.579> bottom<00:05:51.789> where<00:05:52.029> the<00:05:52.059> Charlie<00:05:52.419> flag

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
the very bottom where the Charlie flag

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.269 
the very bottom where the Charlie flag
would<00:05:52.749> be<00:05:52.899> in<00:05:53.019> domination<00:05:53.349> and<00:05:53.589> usually<00:05:54.249> that

00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:54.279 
would be in domination and usually that

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:57.600 
would be in domination and usually that
then<00:05:54.939> you're<00:05:55.059> in<00:05:55.149> trouble<00:05:55.179> exactly<00:05:55.839> so<00:05:56.619> uh<00:05:56.649> no

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
then you're in trouble exactly so uh no

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.999 
then you're in trouble exactly so uh no
take<00:05:57.849> insertion<00:05:58.300> though<00:05:58.449> um<00:05:58.719> any<00:05:59.619> reason<00:05:59.709> why

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:00.009 
take insertion though um any reason why

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:02.129 
take insertion though um any reason why
not<00:06:00.159> um<00:06:00.969> well<00:06:01.300> I<00:06:01.329> don't<00:06:01.509> have<00:06:01.659> it<00:06:01.839> on<00:06:01.929> the

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:02.139 
not um well I don't have it on the

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.409 
not um well I don't have it on the
defensive<00:06:02.709> kit<00:06:02.979> if<00:06:03.219> I<00:06:03.399> work<00:06:03.669> if<00:06:03.849> I<00:06:03.939> did<00:06:03.999> have<00:06:04.239> it

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
defensive kit if I work if I did have it

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:06.239 
defensive kit if I work if I did have it
on<00:06:04.569> the<00:06:04.719> defensive<00:06:05.050> kit<00:06:05.289> you<00:06:05.619> know<00:06:05.739> I've<00:06:06.069> been

00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:06.249 
on the defensive kit you know I've been

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:08.219 
on the defensive kit you know I've been
considering<00:06:06.610> switching<00:06:07.509> out<00:06:07.749> the<00:06:07.779> San<00:06:08.019> tax

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229 
considering switching out the San tax

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:10.139 
considering switching out the San tax
for<00:06:08.379> the<00:06:08.409> tax<00:06:08.739> insertion<00:06:09.249> if<00:06:09.789> I<00:06:09.939> did<00:06:10.119> I

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:10.149 
for the tax insertion if I did I

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:11.369 
for the tax insertion if I did I
definitely<00:06:10.449> would<00:06:10.629> have<00:06:10.659> planted<00:06:10.989> one<00:06:11.169> there

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:11.379 
definitely would have planted one there

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:13.529 
definitely would have planted one there
but<00:06:12.369> I<00:06:12.399> got<00:06:12.729> lucky<00:06:12.909> and<00:06:13.089> spawned<00:06:13.329> pretty

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:13.539 
but I got lucky and spawned pretty

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.929 
but I got lucky and spawned pretty
closely<00:06:13.749> and<00:06:14.229> just<00:06:14.409> rush<00:06:14.829> hour<00:06:14.979> back<00:06:15.159> I<00:06:15.339> also<00:06:15.519> I

00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:15.939 
closely and just rush hour back I also I

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:17.489 
closely and just rush hour back I also I
kind<00:06:16.179> of<00:06:16.300> noticed<00:06:16.479> that<00:06:16.809> when<00:06:17.289> you're<00:06:17.379> playing

00:06:17.489 --> 00:06:17.499 
kind of noticed that when you're playing

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:20.309 
kind of noticed that when you're playing
defense<00:06:17.889> I<00:06:18.129> don't<00:06:18.969> know<00:06:19.059> if<00:06:19.539> this<00:06:20.259> is

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 
defense I don't know if this is

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:21.689 
defense I don't know if this is
completely<00:06:20.800> around<00:06:21.099> or<00:06:21.339> if<00:06:21.429> this<00:06:21.519> is<00:06:21.579> just

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:21.699 
completely around or if this is just

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:23.999 
completely around or if this is just
coincidence<00:06:22.269> but<00:06:22.360> I've<00:06:22.749> noticed<00:06:23.050> that<00:06:23.139> uh<00:06:23.229> you

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:24.009 
coincidence but I've noticed that uh you

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.429 
coincidence but I've noticed that uh you
spawn<00:06:24.279> a<00:06:24.309> little<00:06:24.610> closer<00:06:24.849> to<00:06:25.839> the<00:06:25.869> target<00:06:26.169> that

00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:26.439 
spawn a little closer to the target that
