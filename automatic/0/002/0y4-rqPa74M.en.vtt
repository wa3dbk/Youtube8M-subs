this one is called spin jumps in vanilla
minecraft<00:00:59.970> and<00:01:00.690> here's<00:01:01.140> how<00:01:01.290> it<00:01:01.380> works<00:01:01.610> before

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
minecraft and here's how it works before

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.400 
minecraft and here's how it works before
we<00:01:02.730> begin<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.600> with<00:01:03.900> this<00:01:03.930> thread<00:01:04.260> so

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
we begin I have with this thread so

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.220 
we begin I have with this thread so
dimension<00:01:04.860> into<00:01:05.100> two<00:01:05.400> sections<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
dimension into two sections this is the

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.590 
dimension into two sections this is the
test<00:01:07.440> for<00:01:07.560> mechanism<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.940> over<00:01:09.120> here<00:01:09.240> is

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
test for mechanism and this over here is

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.200 
test for mechanism and this over here is
the<00:01:10.050> mechanism<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:11.130> carries<00:01:11.700> out<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.910> spin

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the mechanism that carries out the spin

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.720 
the mechanism that carries out the spin
jump<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:13.290> before<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.680> begin<00:01:13.980> you<00:01:14.310> want<00:01:14.520> to

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
jump but before you begin you want to

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.420 
jump but before you begin you want to
have<00:01:14.940> to<00:01:15.420> scoreboard<00:01:16.050> objective<00:01:16.170> set<00:01:16.800> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
have to scoreboard objective set the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.120 
have to scoreboard objective set the
first<00:01:17.760> one<00:01:18.120> being<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:19.110> scoreboard<00:01:19.920> objective

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
first one being a scoreboard objective

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.160 
first one being a scoreboard objective
of<00:01:20.580> jump<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.300> don't<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.720> name<00:01:21.840> what<00:01:21.990> jump

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
of jump you don't have to name what jump

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.320 
of jump you don't have to name what jump
but<00:01:22.260> it's<00:01:22.380> easier<00:01:22.620> to<00:01:22.770> remember<00:01:23.000> but<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.120> have

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
but it's easier to remember but you have

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.800 
but it's easier to remember but you have
to<00:01:24.480> have<00:01:24.660> static<00:01:25.380> jump<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:26.700> second<00:01:27.030> one<00:01:27.300> will

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
to have static jump the second one will

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.410 
to have static jump the second one will
be<00:01:27.840> named<00:01:28.560> spin<00:01:29.310> again<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.940> don't<00:01:30.030> have<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.330> be

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
be named spin again you don't have to be

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.820 
be named spin again you don't have to be
naming<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.900> like<00:01:31.050> that<00:01:31.170> but<00:01:31.410> again<00:01:31.650> it's

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
naming it like that but again it's

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.859 
naming it like that but again it's
easier<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.160> remember<00:01:32.330> but<00:01:33.330> you<00:01:33.479> want<00:01:33.660> to<00:01:33.750> have

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
easier to remember but you want to have

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.770 
easier to remember but you want to have
that<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.470> dummy<00:01:35.390> after<00:01:36.390> you're<00:01:36.510> done<00:01:36.570> all<00:01:36.750> of

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
that as dummy after you're done all of

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.780 
that as dummy after you're done all of
that<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.590> time<00:01:37.830> to<00:01:37.890> get<00:01:38.160> into<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.550> command

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
that it is time to get into the command

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.750 
that it is time to get into the command
blocks<00:01:39.110> it<00:01:40.110> begins<00:01:40.500> right<00:01:40.710> over<00:01:41.010> here<00:01:41.460> with

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
blocks it begins right over here with

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.570 
blocks it begins right over here with
this<00:01:41.970> very<00:01:42.300> quick<00:01:42.570> redstone<00:01:43.050> clock<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:44.250> goes

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
this very quick redstone clock it goes

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.850 
this very quick redstone clock it goes
into<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.479> test<00:01:45.750> for<00:01:45.960> command<00:01:46.350> which<00:01:46.560> tests

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
into this test for command which tests

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.800 
into this test for command which tests
for<00:01:47.040> any<00:01:47.280> player<00:01:47.610> with<00:01:47.910> the<00:01:47.940> score<00:01:48.479> jump

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
for any player with the score jump

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.980 
for any player with the score jump
minimum<00:01:49.440> of<00:01:49.590> one<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.100> has<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.210> zero<00:01:51.450> slot<00:01:51.810> in

their inventory selected which holds a
Minecraft<00:01:54.180> nether<00:01:54.360> star<00:01:54.690> that<00:01:55.080> is<00:01:55.110> named<00:01:55.530> luma

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
Minecraft nether star that is named luma

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.210 
Minecraft nether star that is named luma
so<00:01:57.240> if<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.690> go<00:01:57.810> ahead<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.470> look<00:01:58.590> at<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.830> as<00:01:59.100> a

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
so if you go ahead and look at this as a

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.669 
so if you go ahead and look at this as a
luma<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.700> there's<00:02:00.119> another<00:02:00.330> star<00:02:00.690> so<00:02:01.440> if<00:02:01.590> I

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
luma and there's another star so if I

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.650 
luma and there's another star so if I
jump<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.399> my<00:02:02.490> hand<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:03.000> will<00:02:03.210> activate

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
jump to this in my hand it will activate

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.290 
jump to this in my hand it will activate
this<00:02:04.170> command<00:02:04.530> block<00:02:04.770> which<00:02:05.729> will<00:02:06.030> set

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
this command block which will set

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.410 
this command block which will set
anybody<00:02:06.869> score<00:02:07.470> of<00:02:07.770> spin<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.460> one<00:02:08.670> if<00:02:09.030> they

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
anybody score of spin to one if they

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.080 
anybody score of spin to one if they
have<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.600> score<00:02:10.020> jump<00:02:10.380> one<00:02:10.590> right<00:02:11.550> after<00:02:11.670> that

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
have a score jump one right after that

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.360 
have a score jump one right after that
it<00:02:12.420> will<00:02:12.660> go<00:02:12.810> ahead<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.410> delete<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.130> score

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
it will go ahead and delete the score

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.360 
it will go ahead and delete the score
jump<00:02:14.670> one<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.390> jump<00:02:15.750> zero<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.920> have<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.250> have

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
jump one to jump zero you have to have

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.830 
jump one to jump zero you have to have
this<00:02:17.520> command<00:02:17.850> block<00:02:18.030> underneath<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.600> one

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
this command block underneath this one

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.030 
this command block underneath this one
or<00:02:19.140> else<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.500> won't<00:02:19.710> work<00:02:20.480> over<00:02:21.480> here<00:02:21.569> I<00:02:22.050> have<00:02:22.560> a

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
or else it won't work over here I have a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.850 
or else it won't work over here I have a
backup<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:24.000> guess<00:02:24.150> could<00:02:24.390> say<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.900> safety<00:02:25.470> net<00:02:25.590> if

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
backup I guess could say a safety net if

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.670 
backup I guess could say a safety net if
you<00:02:26.010> want<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.760> call<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:26.940> actually<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:28.410> what<00:02:28.590> it

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
you want to call it actually so what it

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.590 
you want to call it actually so what it
does<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:29.130> test<00:02:29.460> for<00:02:29.610> any<00:02:29.790> player<00:02:30.060> with<00:02:30.390> this

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
does is a test for any player with this

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.990 
does is a test for any player with this
score<00:02:30.990> jump<00:02:31.290> minimum<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.770> one<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.280> just

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
score jump minimum of one and just

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.320 
score jump minimum of one and just
resets<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.770> so<00:02:34.770> if<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.490> go<00:02:35.640> went<00:02:35.880> ahead<00:02:36.030> and

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
resets it so if you go went ahead and

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.540 
resets it so if you go went ahead and
jumped<00:02:36.690> over<00:02:36.900> here<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.380> switch<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
jumped over here and you switch to the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.160 
jumped over here and you switch to the
nether<00:02:38.730> star<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.330> will<00:02:39.420> activate<00:02:39.780> this

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
nether star it will activate this
