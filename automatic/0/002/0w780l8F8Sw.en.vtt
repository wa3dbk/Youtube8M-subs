this jet it's it's called the super
super<00:01:32.939> jet<00:01:33.119> or<00:01:33.329> something<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.850> because

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
super jet or something like that because

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.160 
super jet or something like that because
half<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.540> has<00:01:36.990> these<00:01:37.200> extra<00:01:37.680> structures<00:01:38.189> here

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
half it has these extra structures here

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:47.889 
half it has these extra structures here
and<00:01:40.520> when<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.670> pull<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.270> thing<00:01:46.310> far<00:01:47.310> back

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
and when you pull this thing far back

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.130 
and when you pull this thing far back
you<00:01:48.899> can<00:01:48.960> see<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.380> missile

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.600 

this<00:01:53.140> was<00:01:53.350> going<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.710> place<00:01:54.130> your<00:01:54.340> thumb

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
called the super jet moon but it also

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.320 
called the super jet moon but it also
comes<00:02:02.380> in<00:02:02.560> another<00:02:02.860> jet<00:02:03.070> mode<00:02:03.280> you<00:02:03.640> by<00:02:04.060> taking

comes in another jet mode you by taking
off<00:02:05.140> here<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:07.750> extra<00:02:08.050> Craster's<00:02:08.470> let's<00:02:09.250> put

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
off here is extra Craster's let's put

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.630 
off here is extra Craster's let's put
back<00:02:09.729> here<00:02:10.230> this<00:02:11.230> missile<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:15.280> put<00:02:15.520> this

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
back here this missile and put this

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.810 
back here this missile and put this
aside<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:17.670> flip<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.820> wings<00:02:19.000> up<00:02:19.330> like<00:02:19.720> this

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
aside and flip the wings up like this

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.520 
aside and flip the wings up like this
and<00:02:21.820> there<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:22.120> have<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.690> normal<00:02:23.140> jet<00:02:23.320> mode

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
and there you have the normal jet mode

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.420 
and there you have the normal jet mode
here<00:02:23.920> all<00:02:24.640> painted<00:02:25.150> in<00:02:25.270> in<00:02:25.660> blue<00:02:25.959> with<00:02:26.650> the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
here all painted in in blue with the

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.810 
here all painted in in blue with the
Autobot<00:02:27.790> symbol<00:02:27.820> right<00:02:28.300> there<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:30.459> some

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
Autobot symbol right there and some

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:38.280 
Autobot symbol right there and some
legend<00:02:31.239> here<00:02:31.739> that<00:02:32.739> says<00:02:33.040> air<00:02:33.370> defense<00:02:37.290> so

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
legend here that says air defense so

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.350 
legend here that says air defense so
it's<00:02:38.860> not<00:02:38.980> much<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.489> it<00:02:39.520> basically<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.270> same

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
it's not much to it basically the same

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.930 
it's not much to it basically the same
the<00:02:40.750> only<00:02:41.020> difference<00:02:41.220> between<00:02:42.220> these<00:02:42.550> super

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
the only difference between these super

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.360 
the only difference between these super
jet<00:02:43.150> mode<00:02:43.330> is<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:44.320> extra<00:02:44.680> thrusters<00:02:45.160> but

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
jet mode is the extra thrusters but

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.270 
jet mode is the extra thrusters but
otherwise<00:02:45.820> that<00:02:46.120> is<00:02:46.330> it's<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.350> same<00:02:47.530> it's<00:02:48.250> not

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
otherwise that is it's the same it's not

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.400 
otherwise that is it's the same it's not
to<00:02:48.519> complicate<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.660> thing<00:02:49.840> is<00:02:49.989> that<00:02:50.140> you

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
to complicate and the thing is that you

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.020 
to complicate and the thing is that you
can<00:02:51.180> fold<00:02:52.180> out<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.780> wings<00:02:53.489> as<00:02:54.489> far<00:02:54.760> as<00:02:54.850> you

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
can fold out the wings as far as you

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.259 
can fold out the wings as far as you
want<00:02:55.470> probably<00:02:56.470> like<00:02:56.709> this<00:02:56.950> or<00:02:57.580> even<00:02:58.090> like

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
want probably like this or even like

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.009 
want probably like this or even like
this<00:02:59.190> so<00:03:00.190> you<00:03:00.760> can<00:03:00.790> have<00:03:01.150> here<00:03:01.600> as<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:01.930> is

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
this so you can have here as it is

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.000 
this so you can have here as it is
jetting<00:03:02.470> with<00:03:02.680> ace<00:03:02.920> extended<00:03:03.580> wings
