00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
mid-engine car so front back doesn't

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.300 
mid-engine car so front back doesn't
matter<00:02:13.379> what<00:02:13.530> lid<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:13.830> lift<00:02:14.010> you're<00:02:14.220> not

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
going to see any motor in this thing

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.449 
going to see any motor in this thing
until<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:16.019> go<00:02:16.170> under<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.920> getting<00:02:17.190> under<00:02:17.400> is

a<00:02:17.489> trick<00:02:17.790> because<00:02:18.239> this<00:02:18.390> guy<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.599> almost<00:02:18.840> an

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
a trick because this guy is almost an

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.960 
a trick because this guy is almost an
inch<00:02:19.170> lower<00:02:19.379> than<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.650> standard<00:02:20.220> came<00:02:20.489> in<00:02:20.670> which

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
inch lower than a standard came in which

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.630 
inch lower than a standard came in which
is<00:02:21.000> not<00:02:21.300> exactly<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.750> high<00:02:21.959> rider<00:02:22.290> oh<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.489> check

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
is not exactly a high rider oh and check

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.610 
is not exactly a high rider oh and check
this<00:02:23.670> out<00:02:24.030> not<00:02:24.569> often<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.959> see<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.140> car<00:02:25.440> where
