00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the goalkeeper was holding the ball you

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.860 
the goalkeeper was holding the ball you

the<00:00:33.960> line<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.739> would<00:00:34.860> be<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> goal<00:00:35.309> so

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the line and that would be a goal so

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.610 
the line and that would be a goal so
there<00:00:36.239> was<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> huge<00:00:36.630> benefit<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.170> having<00:00:37.530> a

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
there was a huge benefit in having a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.080 
there was a huge benefit in having a
huge<00:00:37.829> goalkeeper<00:00:38.460> because<00:00:38.640> it's<00:00:38.790> harder<00:00:39.059> to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
huge goalkeeper because it's harder to

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.479 
huge goalkeeper because it's harder to
drive<00:00:39.329> them<00:00:39.510> back<00:00:39.660> over<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.989> line<00:00:40.489> fifty

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
drive them back over the line fifty

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.720 
drive them back over the line fifty
pounds<00:00:41.969> was<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> huge<00:00:42.450> amount<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.809> money

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
pounds was a huge amount of money

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.250 
pounds was a huge amount of money
probably<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.910> equivalent<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.360> 36<00:00:46.020> million

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
probably the equivalent of 36 million

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
probably the equivalent of 36 million
pounds<00:00:46.739> now<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:48.570> Chelsea<00:00:48.870> man<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.620> sense<00:00:49.980> by

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
pounds now so Chelsea man in a sense by

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.450 
pounds now so Chelsea man in a sense by
paying<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.789> lot<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:50.969> money<00:00:51.090> for<00:00:51.570> fatty<00:00:51.780> figs

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
paying a lot of money for fatty figs

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.979 
paying a lot of money for fatty figs
potentially<00:00:53.570> influenced<00:00:54.570> his<00:00:54.690> reputation

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
potentially influenced his reputation

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.760 
potentially influenced his reputation
and<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.430> doing<00:00:57.530> people<00:00:58.530> probably

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
and in so doing people probably

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.139 
and in so doing people probably
perceived<00:00:59.250> him<00:00:59.430> as<00:00:59.520> bigger<00:00:59.730> than<00:00:59.940> he<00:01:00.030> actually

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
perceived him as bigger than he actually

around and they spread their arms and so
on<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.739> we<00:02:41.830> were<00:02:41.950> very<00:02:42.160> interested<00:02:42.580> in<00:02:42.640> this

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
on and we were very interested in this

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.320 
on and we were very interested in this
so<00:02:43.150> there's<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.280> an<00:02:45.280> illusion<00:02:45.880> known<00:02:46.060> as<00:02:46.209> the

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
so there's a an illusion known as the

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.440 
so there's a an illusion known as the
muller-lyer<00:02:46.570> illusion

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
muller-lyer illusion

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.850 
muller-lyer illusion
that's<00:02:49.450> a<00:02:49.570> motherly<00:02:49.989> illusion<00:02:50.470> which<00:02:50.620> line

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
that's a motherly illusion which line

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.290 
that's a motherly illusion which line
looks<00:02:51.190> longer<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.670> top<00:02:51.820> one<00:02:52.030> or<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.209> bottom

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
looks longer the top one or the bottom

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.699 
looks longer the top one or the bottom
one<00:02:52.570> you<00:02:54.030> have<00:02:55.030> wells<00:02:55.239> thank<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:56.260> very<00:02:56.410> much

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
one you have wells thank you very much

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.560 
one you have wells thank you very much
you're<00:02:57.310> quite<00:02:57.519> right<00:02:57.700> they're<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.060> same<00:02:58.239> but

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
you're quite right they're the same but

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.030 
you're quite right they're the same but
people<00:02:58.870> who<00:02:58.930> don't<00:02:59.140> know<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.650> illusion

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
people who don't know the illusion

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.009 
people who don't know the illusion
usually<00:03:00.760> would<00:03:00.910> say<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.239> top<00:03:01.420> one<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:01.810> if

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
usually would say the top one and if

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.540 
usually would say the top one and if
you're<00:03:02.170> actually<00:03:02.290> doing<00:03:02.530> work<00:03:02.920> like<00:03:02.950> this<00:03:03.400> you

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
you're actually doing work like this you

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.640 
you're actually doing work like this you
can<00:03:03.700> bypass<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.390> people<00:03:04.690> who<00:03:04.840> know<00:03:05.080> by

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
can bypass the people who know by

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.080 
can bypass the people who know by
actually<00:03:05.950> manipulating<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.700> length<00:03:06.850> of<00:03:07.030> the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
actually manipulating the length of the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.120 
actually manipulating the length of the
line<00:03:07.269> so<00:03:07.630> sometimes<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.320> lines<00:03:08.500> are<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:08.800> same

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
line so sometimes the lines are the same

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.660 
line so sometimes the lines are the same
sometimes<00:03:09.940> they're<00:03:10.209> not<00:03:10.830> so<00:03:11.830> people<00:03:12.190> who

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
sometimes they're not so people who

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.920 
sometimes they're not so people who
think<00:03:12.910> they're<00:03:13.030> smart<00:03:13.330> and<00:03:13.570> they<00:03:13.660> know<00:03:13.690> the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
think they're smart and they know the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.699 
think they're smart and they know the
illusion<00:03:14.400> get<00:03:15.400> caught<00:03:15.640> up<00:03:16.410> this<00:03:17.410> is<00:03:17.590> the

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
illusion get caught up this is the

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.729 
illusion get caught up this is the
amputated<00:03:18.340> muller-lyer<00:03:18.549> illusion<00:03:19.739> same

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
amputated muller-lyer illusion same

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.090 
amputated muller-lyer illusion same
effect<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.910> left<00:03:22.150> one<00:03:22.440> usually<00:03:23.440> is<00:03:23.620> perceived

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
effect the left one usually is perceived

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.160 
effect the left one usually is perceived
slightly<00:03:24.790> longer<00:03:25.030> than<00:03:25.180> than<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.780> right<00:03:25.930> one

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
slightly longer than than the right one

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.130 
slightly longer than than the right one
but<00:03:26.980> it's<00:03:27.160> not<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:29.590> on<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.280> goalkeeper<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.140> I

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
but it's not so on the goalkeeper and I

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.340 
but it's not so on the goalkeeper and I
stand<00:03:32.440> like<00:03:32.709> that<00:03:33.299> I've<00:03:34.299> just<00:03:34.480> created<00:03:34.750> an

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
stand like that I've just created an

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.160 
stand like that I've just created an
amputated<00:03:35.829> Miller<00:03:36.160> liar<00:03:36.400> illusion<00:03:36.940> if<00:03:37.420> I

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
amputated Miller liar illusion if I

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.289 
amputated Miller liar illusion if I
stand<00:03:38.410> like<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:38.680> I've<00:03:39.430> created<00:03:40.060> the

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
stand like that I've created the

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.930 
stand like that I've created the
opposite<00:03:40.690> effect<00:03:41.130> so<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.220> question<00:03:42.489> we<00:03:42.610> asked

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
opposite effect so the question we asked

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.509 
opposite effect so the question we asked
of<00:03:43.030> in<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.269> fest<00:03:43.480> study<00:03:43.780> was<00:03:44.500> by<00:03:45.070> standing

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
of in the fest study was by standing

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.850 
of in the fest study was by standing
like<00:03:45.670> that<00:03:45.870> do<00:03:46.870> we<00:03:47.019> actually<00:03:47.170> make<00:03:47.590> our

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
like that do we actually make our

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.759 
like that do we actually make our
science<00:03:48.340> Elms<00:03:48.700> get<00:03:49.269> misperceived<00:03:50.170> as<00:03:50.500> taller

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
science Elms get misperceived as taller

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.410 
science Elms get misperceived as taller
than<00:03:51.010> we<00:03:51.130> are<00:03:51.280> relative<00:03:51.820> to<00:03:51.970> standing<00:03:52.269> like

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
than we are relative to standing like

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.840 
than we are relative to standing like
that<00:03:52.860> it's<00:03:53.860> a<00:03:53.890> very<00:03:54.010> simple<00:03:54.250> study<00:03:54.610> that<00:03:54.730> we

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
that it's a very simple study that we

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.910 
that it's a very simple study that we
carried<00:03:55.150> out<00:03:55.329> this<00:03:56.049> is<00:03:56.230> out<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.530> first<00:03:56.739> author

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
carried out this is out the first author

carried out this is out the first author
john<00:03:57.280> van<00:03:57.519> de<00:03:57.700> Kamp<00:03:58.320> so<00:03:59.320> he<00:03:59.470> dressed<00:03:59.650> himself

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
john van de Kamp so he dressed himself

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.460 
john van de Kamp so he dressed himself
up<00:04:00.250> like<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:00.730> as<00:04:00.850> a<00:04:00.880> goalkeeper<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.720> we

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
up like that as a goalkeeper and we

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.979 
up like that as a goalkeeper and we
photoshopped<00:04:02.799> this<00:04:03.579> so<00:04:03.880> that<00:04:04.120> he's<00:04:04.239> exactly

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
photoshopped this so that he's exactly

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.630 
photoshopped this so that he's exactly
the<00:04:05.110> same<00:04:05.350> height<00:04:05.620> nor<00:04:05.890> four<00:04:06.130> of<00:04:06.250> these<00:04:06.340> and

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
the same height nor four of these and

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.550 
the same height nor four of these and
the<00:04:07.120> actual<00:04:07.390> fact<00:04:07.630> if<00:04:07.840> I<00:04:07.930> go<00:04:07.959> like<00:04:08.290> that<00:04:08.350> I

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
the actual fact if I go like that I

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.289 
the actual fact if I go like that I
stretch<00:04:08.950> my<00:04:08.980> exoskeleton<00:04:09.400> slightly<00:04:10.180> and

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
stretch my exoskeleton slightly and

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.210 
stretch my exoskeleton slightly and
become<00:04:10.570> slightly<00:04:11.019> taller<00:04:11.230> so<00:04:11.890> this<00:04:12.070> is

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
become slightly taller so this is

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.069 
become slightly taller so this is
shocked<00:04:12.519> so<00:04:12.790> that<00:04:12.940> he's<00:04:13.120> exactly<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.870> same

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
shocked so that he's exactly the same

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.529 
shocked so that he's exactly the same
height<00:04:14.320> and<00:04:14.530> then<00:04:15.310> we<00:04:15.430> simply<00:04:15.940> presented

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
height and then we simply presented

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.580 
height and then we simply presented
pictures<00:04:17.100> in<00:04:18.100> a<00:04:18.820> booklet<00:04:19.209> lots<00:04:20.169> of<00:04:20.320> pictures

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
pictures in a booklet lots of pictures

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.580 
pictures in a booklet lots of pictures
all<00:04:21.010> different<00:04:21.640> sizes<00:04:21.880> but<00:04:22.330> him<00:04:22.660> taking<00:04:23.470> up

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
all different sizes but him taking up

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.710 
all different sizes but him taking up
these<00:04:23.770> postures

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
these postures

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.810 
these postures
we<00:04:25.020> presented<00:04:25.320> that<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.620> people<00:04:25.920> we<00:04:26.640> asked

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
we presented that to people we asked

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.090 
we presented that to people we asked
them<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.090> look<00:04:27.300> at<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:27.540> booklet<00:04:27.960> and<00:04:28.170> simply

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
them to look at the booklet and simply

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.270 
them to look at the booklet and simply
to<00:04:29.730> mark<00:04:30.090> how<00:04:30.990> tall<00:04:31.350> he<00:04:31.530> was<00:04:31.650> in<00:04:31.860> each<00:04:31.980> picture

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
to mark how tall he was in each picture

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.820 
to mark how tall he was in each picture
the<00:04:32.970> exact<00:04:33.420> height<00:04:33.750> they<00:04:34.440> weren't<00:04:34.590> allowed<00:04:34.800> to

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
the exact height they weren't allowed to

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.440 
the exact height they weren't allowed to
line<00:04:35.130> it<00:04:35.160> up<00:04:35.400> or<00:04:35.610> anything<00:04:35.760> like<00:04:36.090> that<00:04:36.120> the

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
line it up or anything like that the

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.570 
line it up or anything like that the
booklets<00:04:36.810> were<00:04:36.930> separate<00:04:37.350> and<00:04:37.560> they<00:04:38.520> were

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
booklets were separate and they were

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.210 
booklets were separate and they were
inflated<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:39.000> use<00:04:39.090> a<00:04:39.120> ruler<00:04:39.510> either<00:04:40.070> so<00:04:41.070> it's<00:04:41.190> a

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
inflated to use a ruler either so it's a

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.960 
inflated to use a ruler either so it's a
very<00:04:41.370> simple<00:04:41.610> study<00:04:42.000> this<00:04:42.870> is<00:04:43.050> what<00:04:43.170> we<00:04:43.260> found

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
very simple study this is what we found

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.390 
very simple study this is what we found
people<00:04:44.970> overestimated<00:04:45.900> his<00:04:46.020> height

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
people overestimated his height

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.290 
people overestimated his height
significantly<00:04:47.400> when<00:04:47.610> he<00:04:47.670> stood<00:04:47.820> like<00:04:48.030> that

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
significantly when he stood like that

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.020 
significantly when he stood like that
and<00:04:49.040> they<00:04:50.040> underestimated<00:04:50.700> his<00:04:50.850> height

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
and they underestimated his height

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.430 
and they underestimated his height
significantly<00:04:51.690> when<00:04:51.810> he<00:04:51.870> stood<00:04:51.990> like<00:04:52.200> that

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
significantly when he stood like that

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.400 
significantly when he stood like that
and<00:04:52.620> like<00:04:52.740> that<00:04:53.570> so<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:54.690> illusion<00:04:54.900> had<00:04:55.290> an

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
and like that so the illusion had an

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.890 
and like that so the illusion had an
effect<00:04:55.770> on<00:04:55.950> people's<00:04:56.340> perceptions<00:04:57.060> of<00:04:57.180> the

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
effect on people's perceptions of the

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.360 
effect on people's perceptions of the
goalkeeper<00:04:58.650> when<00:04:58.770> he<00:04:58.890> took<00:04:59.010> up<00:04:59.190> these

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
goalkeeper when he took up these

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.820 
goalkeeper when he took up these
positions<00:04:59.910> and<00:05:00.810> in<00:05:01.050> actual<00:05:01.350> fact<00:05:01.380> if<00:05:01.740> you

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
positions and in actual fact if you

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.170 
positions and in actual fact if you
extrapolate<00:05:02.160> a<00:05:02.720> nine<00:05:03.720> centimeter<00:05:04.500> difference

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
extrapolate a nine centimeter difference

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.550 
extrapolate a nine centimeter difference
which<00:05:06.180> is<00:05:06.300> dramatic<00:05:07.200> what's<00:05:07.380> nine

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
which is dramatic what's nine

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.200 
which is dramatic what's nine
centimeters<00:05:08.130> was<00:05:08.280> that<00:05:08.430> nine<00:05:08.580> centimeters<00:05:09.060> so

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
centimeters was that nine centimeters so

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.270 
centimeters was that nine centimeters so
it's<00:05:09.330> quite<00:05:09.510> it's<00:05:09.630> quite<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:09.990> lot<00:05:10.260> Oh<00:05:10.500> a<00:05:10.890> big

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
it's quite it's quite a lot Oh a big

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.570 
it's quite it's quite a lot Oh a big
misperception<00:05:12.180> if<00:05:12.300> you<00:05:12.390> like<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:14.310> story

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
misperception if you like the story

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.440 
misperception if you like the story
doesn't<00:05:14.790> end<00:05:14.970> there

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
doesn't end there

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.030 
doesn't end there
in<00:05:15.600> study<00:05:16.350> two<00:05:17.510> we<00:05:18.510> ask<00:05:18.690> people<00:05:18.900> to<00:05:19.200> score

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
in study two we ask people to score

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.510 
in study two we ask people to score
goals<00:05:20.420> against<00:05:21.420> him<00:05:21.570> when<00:05:22.260> he<00:05:22.950> was<00:05:23.100> stood<00:05:23.340> with

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
goals against him when he was stood with

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.760 
goals against him when he was stood with
these<00:05:23.700> postures<00:05:24.210> and<00:05:24.740> something<00:05:25.740> very

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
these postures and something very

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.950 
these postures and something very
interesting<00:05:25.950> happened<00:05:26.670> when<00:05:27.300> he<00:05:27.480> stood<00:05:27.720> in<00:05:27.780> a

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
interesting happened when he stood in a

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.720 
interesting happened when he stood in a
posture<00:05:28.350> like<00:05:28.470> that<00:05:28.770> people<00:05:29.010> kicked<00:05:29.370> further

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
posture like that people kicked further

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.180 
posture like that people kicked further
away<00:05:29.940> from<00:05:30.150> him<00:05:30.300> so<00:05:30.540> being<00:05:31.230> big<00:05:31.560> caused<00:05:31.980> people

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
away from him so being big caused people

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.340 
away from him so being big caused people
to<00:05:32.310> kick<00:05:32.520> further<00:05:32.820> away<00:05:33.030> from<00:05:33.060> him<00:05:33.360> guess<00:05:34.170> what

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
to kick further away from him guess what

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.630 
to kick further away from him guess what
happened<00:05:34.620> when<00:05:34.710> he<00:05:34.830> stood<00:05:35.010> like<00:05:35.190> that<00:05:35.430> and

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
happened when he stood like that and

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.440 
happened when he stood like that and
made<00:05:36.420> himself<00:05:36.570> look<00:05:36.870> smaller<00:05:38.180> people<00:05:39.180> get

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
made himself look smaller people get

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.010 
made himself look smaller people get
closer<00:05:39.690> to<00:05:39.990> him<00:05:40.610> so<00:05:41.610> you<00:05:41.669> tell<00:05:41.970> me<00:05:42.000> should<00:05:42.960> a

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
closer to him so you tell me should a

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.380 
closer to him so you tell me should a
goalkeeper<00:05:43.230> look<00:05:43.650> big<00:05:43.890> or<00:05:44.330> should<00:05:45.330> a

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
goalkeeper look big or should a

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.150 
goalkeeper look big or should a
goalkeeper<00:05:45.570> look<00:05:45.960> small<00:05:47.360> I'd<00:05:48.360> say<00:05:48.600> small<00:05:49.160> easy

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
goalkeeper look small I'd say small easy

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.740 
goalkeeper look small I'd say small easy
to<00:05:50.400> make<00:05:50.550> a<00:05:50.580> save<00:05:50.880> if<00:05:51.090> someone<00:05:51.330> kicks<00:05:51.480> the<00:05:51.630> ball

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
to make a save if someone kicks the ball

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.620 
to make a save if someone kicks the ball
closer<00:05:52.020> to<00:05:52.320> me<00:05:52.470> so<00:05:53.480> simple<00:05:54.480> science<00:05:55.970> I'd<00:05:56.970> have

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
closer to me so simple science I'd have

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.950 
closer to me so simple science I'd have
no<00:05:57.840> idea<00:05:58.169> what<00:05:58.380> that<00:05:58.410> tells<00:05:58.770> you
