00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.709
 hi I am simonetta during the 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.629
 we are often walks in the countryside 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.480
 attracted by the beauty of the colors of the 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:21.390
 flowers we can preserve them through a 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.539
 drying method by building one 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.689
 simple press like I did 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.640
 cut to ten by 16 of the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.740
 compensated you can also ask at 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.519
 your do it yourself trust I also 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.519
 then personalized with a little decoration 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:41.239
 inside I prepared some cards 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:46.019
 always with the same measure using 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:50.339
 of simple cardboard packaging vi 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:52.460
 they then need newspaper papers or 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.350
 rather than blotting paper 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.000
 because this will absorb the humidity of the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.869
 your flower or your one 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.460
 put it inside 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:05.850
 put in my case a beautiful one 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.979
 right periwinkle 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:13.110
 pressed as you like put it 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.180
 the other part of newspaper or paper 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:23.670
 absorbent and cardboard alternate 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:27.360
 so even more layers in the wood I did 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.950
 drill holes corresponding to the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.950
 vertices in which I will pass the screw 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:38.840
 with a small butterfly that closes then 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.840
 perfectly our press 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.370
 in this way 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.900
 I always have it with me it is tiny and me 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:56.260
 accompanies all my excursions 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.260
 good garden
