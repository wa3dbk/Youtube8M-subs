00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
lasses so yeah I thought Newcastle were

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.020 
lasses so yeah I thought Newcastle were
pretty<00:01:49.409> poor<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.340> second<00:01:50.670> half<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.939> be

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
pretty poor in the second half to be

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.550 
pretty poor in the second half to be
faithful<00:01:51.180> there<00:01:51.509> okay<00:01:51.750> first<00:01:51.990> off<00:01:52.140> second

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
faithful there okay first off second

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.380 
faithful there okay first off second
half<00:01:52.649> they're<00:01:52.829> pretty<00:01:53.130> poor<00:01:53.460> they<00:01:54.060> didn't

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
half they're pretty poor they didn't

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.249 
half they're pretty poor they didn't
look<00:01:54.720> really<00:01:55.490> 22<00:01:56.490> up<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.689> certainly

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
look really 22 up for it and certainly

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.929 
look really 22 up for it and certainly
as<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> gold<00:01:58.829> started<00:01:59.159> rolling<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.549> their

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.979 
Moyes he got his tactics spot on to be
fair<00:03:13.209> Newcastle<00:03:14.209> just<00:03:14.330> weren't<00:03:14.540> in<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.810> game

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
fair Newcastle just weren't in the game

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.020 
fair Newcastle just weren't in the game
pod<00:03:15.320> you<00:03:15.560> still<00:03:16.400> banned<00:03:16.640> from<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.850> touchline

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
pod you still banned from the touchline

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.210 
pod you still banned from the touchline
so<00:03:17.750> you<00:03:17.810> know<00:03:18.200> at<00:03:18.650> least<00:03:18.709> nobody<00:03:19.040> got

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
so you know at least nobody got

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.150 
so you know at least nobody got
head-butted<00:03:19.520> today<00:03:20.000> which<00:03:20.150> was<00:03:20.300> good<00:03:20.890> but<00:03:21.890> it

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
head-butted today which was good but it

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.500 
head-butted today which was good but it
doesn't<00:03:22.550> really<00:03:22.670> mean<00:03:22.850> anything<00:03:22.880> just<00:03:23.180> means

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
doesn't really mean anything just means

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.180 
doesn't really mean anything just means
it<00:03:23.630> Newcastle<00:03:24.140> would<00:03:24.230> probably<00:03:24.890> you<00:03:25.160> know

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
it Newcastle would probably you know

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.770 
it Newcastle would probably you know
really<00:03:25.459> aren't<00:03:25.910> gonna<00:03:26.030> catch<00:03:26.300> us<00:03:26.510> in<00:03:26.690> the

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
really aren't gonna catch us in the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.910 
really aren't gonna catch us in the
league<00:03:26.930> now<00:03:27.140> so<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.380> lowest<00:03:27.650> weren't<00:03:27.830> gonna

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
league now so the lowest weren't gonna

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.979 
league now so the lowest weren't gonna
finish<00:03:28.160> as<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.370> probably<00:03:28.670> seven<00:03:29.090> but<00:03:29.750> will

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
finish as a probably seven but will

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.090 
finish as a probably seven but will
probably<00:03:30.170> finish<00:03:30.380> I<00:03:30.590> reckon<00:03:30.800> we're<00:03:30.920> going<00:03:31.040> to

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
probably finish I reckon we're going to

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.740 
probably finish I reckon we're going to
finish<00:03:31.220> about<00:03:31.489> fifth<00:03:31.910> with<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.209> strong<00:03:32.510> end<00:03:32.660> of

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
finish about fifth with a strong end of

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.270 
finish about fifth with a strong end of
the<00:03:32.810> season<00:03:33.200> you<00:03:33.290> know<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.560> momentum<00:03:34.040> gained

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
the season you know the momentum gained

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.330 
the season you know the momentum gained
from<00:03:34.520> the<00:03:34.610> pion<00:03:34.989> wind<00:03:35.989> draw<00:03:36.500> rather<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:37.160> the

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
from the pion wind draw rather and the

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.520 
from the pion wind draw rather and the
momentum<00:03:37.610> gained<00:03:37.970> from<00:03:38.120> this<00:03:38.270> win<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:38.900> if<00:03:39.410> we

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
momentum gained from this win and if we

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.080 
momentum gained from this win and if we
can<00:03:39.709> get<00:03:39.830> some<00:03:39.890> sort<00:03:40.310> of<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.489> result<00:03:40.820> against

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
can get some sort of a result against

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.780 
can get some sort of a result against
Bayern<00:03:41.390> Munich<00:03:41.720> midweek<00:03:42.530> then<00:03:43.070> anything<00:03:43.640> is

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
Bayern Munich midweek then anything is

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.920 
Bayern Munich midweek then anything is
possible<00:03:43.910> for<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.360> end<00:03:44.480> of<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.600> season<00:03:44.750> we

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
possible for the end of the season we

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.020 
possible for the end of the season we
could<00:03:45.140> go<00:03:45.260> on<00:03:45.290> all<00:03:45.410> on<00:03:45.560> beat<00:03:45.769> and<00:03:45.920> run<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:46.280> you

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
could go on all on beat and run and you

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.780 
could go on all on beat and run and you
know<00:03:47.150> get<00:03:47.390> up<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.660> 56<00:03:48.110> place<00:03:48.410> I<00:03:48.650> think<00:03:49.010> it's<00:03:49.130> a<00:03:49.310> I

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
know get up to 56 place I think it's a I

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:50.860 
know get up to 56 place I think it's a I
think<00:03:50.060> that's<00:03:50.180> we're<00:03:50.330> going<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.540> fish<00:03:50.630> I<00:03:50.720> think

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
think that's we're going to fish I think

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.300 
think that's we're going to fish I think
we're<00:03:50.959> going<00:03:51.080> to<00:03:51.170> finish<00:03:51.320> fifth<00:03:51.709> this<00:03:51.920> season

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
we're going to finish fifth this season

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.560 
we're going to finish fifth this season
I<00:03:52.370> think<00:03:52.489> we're<00:03:52.580> going<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.760> just<00:03:52.910> talk<00:03:53.360> more

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
I think we're going to just talk more

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.150 
I think we're going to just talk more
having<00:03:53.750> a<00:03:53.810> Daymare<00:03:54.290> to<00:03:54.650> be<00:03:54.769> bare<00:03:54.950> their

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
having a Daymare to be bare their

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.060 
having a Daymare to be bare their
marring<00:03:55.550> we<00:03:56.300> can<00:03:56.720> catch<00:03:56.900> them<00:03:57.019> up<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:57.440> we

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
marring we can catch them up and we

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.860 
marring we can catch them up and we
probably<00:03:58.310> went<00:03:58.550> me<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.730> catch<00:03:58.940> 45<00:03:59.750> i'll
