00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.050 

I<00:00:12.240> had<00:00:13.020> played<00:00:13.350> in<00:00:13.590> North<00:00:14.400> America<00:00:14.820> for<00:00:15.030> a

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:15.060 
I had played in North America for a

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.090 
I had played in North America for a
couple<00:00:15.360> years<00:00:15.390> and<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.350> I'd<00:00:16.530> really<00:00:16.860> enjoyed

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
couple years and and I'd really enjoyed

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.940 
couple years and and I'd really enjoyed
my<00:00:17.250> time<00:00:17.280> there<00:00:17.520> but<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.960> know<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.110> didn't<00:00:19.860> get

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
my time there but you know I didn't get

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.769 
my time there but you know I didn't get
called<00:00:20.189> up<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.610> I<00:00:20.670> was<00:00:20.760> kind<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.029> just<00:00:21.390> stuck

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
called up and I was kind of just stuck

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.660 
called up and I was kind of just stuck
in<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.529> same<00:00:22.770> league<00:00:23.040> and<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.520> was

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
in in the same league and so I was

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.580 
in in the same league and so I was
looking<00:00:23.849> for<00:00:24.240> for<00:00:24.630> just<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.900> new<00:00:25.020> experience

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
looking for for just a new experience

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.240 
looking for for just a new experience
and<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.210> the<00:00:27.210> idea<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.590> coming<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.710> Scotland

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
and so the idea of coming in Scotland

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.269 
and so the idea of coming in Scotland
and<00:00:30.110> not<00:00:31.110> having<00:00:31.350> to<00:00:31.440> deal<00:00:31.619> with<00:00:31.770> as<00:00:31.890> much<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.220> a

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
and not having to deal with as much of a

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.450 
and not having to deal with as much of a
language<00:00:32.610> barrier<00:00:32.820> i<00:00:33.030> guess<00:00:33.360> as<00:00:33.629> going<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.559> to

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
language barrier i guess as going to to

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.540 
language barrier i guess as going to to
some<00:00:35.670> other<00:00:35.760> places<00:00:36.090> i<00:00:37.160> was<00:00:38.160> just<00:00:38.340> really

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
as any of us would want to but in any

year you're going to have ups and downs

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.289 
year you're going to have ups and downs
and<00:03:42.269> it's<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:43.200> it's<00:03:43.739> frustrating<00:03:44.299> definitely

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
and it's and it's frustrating definitely

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.300 
and it's and it's frustrating definitely
I<00:03:45.329> mean<00:03:45.540> nobody<00:03:45.870> out<00:03:46.409> there<00:03:46.769> is<00:03:46.919> probably<00:03:47.220> more

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
I mean nobody out there is probably more

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.399 
I mean nobody out there is probably more
frustrated<00:03:47.970> with<00:03:48.120> our<00:03:48.479> results<00:03:48.900> of<00:03:49.019> late<00:03:49.169> than

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
frustrated with our results of late than

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.539 
frustrated with our results of late than
we<00:03:49.530> are<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:50.030> and<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.870> think<00:03:51.900> that<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.799> we've

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
we are and and I think that that we've

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.990 
we are and and I think that that we've
seen<00:03:54.650> how<00:03:55.650> we're<00:03:55.979> successful<00:03:56.340> in<00:03:56.699> the<00:03:56.790> games

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
seen how we're successful in the games

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.289 
seen how we're successful in the games
that<00:03:57.180> were<00:03:57.479> successful<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.440> I<00:03:59.430> think<00:03:59.699> that<00:04:00.209> we

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
that were successful and I think that we

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.759 
that were successful and I think that we
just<00:04:00.419> need<00:04:00.659> to<00:04:00.750> kind<00:04:00.870> of<00:04:01.019> look<00:04:01.199> back<00:04:01.260> at<00:04:01.620> those

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
just need to kind of look back at those

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.490 
just need to kind of look back at those
and<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:02.310> kind<00:04:02.849> of<00:04:02.909> take<00:04:03.209> from<00:04:03.479> those<00:04:03.690> what

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
and and kind of take from those what

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.610 
and and kind of take from those what
what<00:04:05.370> made<00:04:05.609> us<00:04:05.760> successful<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.750> just<00:04:07.349> be<00:04:07.470> more

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
what made us successful and just be more

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:20.560 
what made us successful and just be more
consistent<00:04:08.010> in<00:04:08.400> those<00:04:08.549> areas

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.040 

like<00:04:21.170> I<00:04:21.290> think<00:04:21.500> most<00:04:21.650> people<00:04:21.950> associate

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
like I think most people associate

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.480 
like I think most people associate
hockey<00:04:24.050> with<00:04:24.230> Canadians<00:04:24.830> but<00:04:25.100> being<00:04:25.340> from

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
hockey with Canadians but being from

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.110 
hockey with Canadians but being from
Minnesota<00:04:25.580> it's<00:04:26.480> huge<00:04:26.870> hockey<00:04:27.110> community<00:04:28.120> i'd

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
Minnesota it's huge hockey community i'd

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.460 
Minnesota it's huge hockey community i'd
say<00:04:29.510> probably<00:04:30.910> per<00:04:31.910> capita<00:04:32.390> as<00:04:32.720> far<00:04:32.930> as<00:04:33.050> NHL

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
say probably per capita as far as NHL

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.800 
say probably per capita as far as NHL
players<00:04:34.100> americans<00:04:35.030> go<00:04:35.210> i'd<00:04:35.360> say<00:04:35.540> the<00:04:35.660> most

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
players americans go i'd say the most

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.310 
players americans go i'd say the most

always<00:04:58.610> just<00:04:58.850> going<00:04:59.120> and<00:04:59.330> I<00:04:59.450> think<00:04:59.690> the<00:04:59.810> speed

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
always just going and I think the speed

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.710 
always just going and I think the speed
of<00:05:00.230> it<00:05:00.380> too<00:05:00.650> is<00:05:00.890> is<00:05:01.700> something<00:05:02.150> that<00:05:02.270> is<00:05:02.510> very

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
of it too is is something that is very

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.710 
of it too is is something that is very
rare<00:05:03.640> obviously<00:05:04.640> you<00:05:04.760> can<00:05:04.910> get<00:05:05.060> going<00:05:05.300> faster

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
rare obviously you can get going faster

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.620 
rare obviously you can get going faster
on<00:05:06.200> skates<00:05:06.740> and<00:05:07.010> then<00:05:07.820> you<00:05:07.940> can<00:05:08.120> running<00:05:08.480> and

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
on skates and then you can running and

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.990 
on skates and then you can running and
stuff<00:05:08.810> so<00:05:09.050> these<00:05:09.440> collisions<00:05:09.770> are<00:05:10.190> at<00:05:10.340> higher

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
stuff so these collisions are at higher

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.410 
stuff so these collisions are at higher
speed<00:05:11.480> and<00:05:11.840> the<00:05:12.320> impacts<00:05:12.740> greater<00:05:13.130> and<00:05:13.580> I<00:05:13.940> just

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
speed and the impacts greater and I just

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.110 
speed and the impacts greater and I just
like<00:05:14.570> the<00:05:14.750> speed<00:05:15.020> of<00:05:15.200> the<00:05:15.350> game<00:05:15.520> you<00:05:16.520> know<00:05:16.640> fans

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
like the speed of the game you know fans

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.330 
like the speed of the game you know fans
here<00:05:17.540> they<00:05:18.050> show<00:05:18.290> up<00:05:18.500> they're<00:05:18.770> loud<00:05:18.980> they're

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
excited and you know they're not they're

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.160 
excited and you know they're not they're
not<00:05:22.520> afraid<00:05:22.730> to<00:05:22.970> let<00:05:23.480> you<00:05:23.630> know<00:05:23.720> if<00:05:23.840> you<00:05:23.930> screw

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
up either which is good because it means

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.100 
up either which is good because it means

enjoyed it so far the school visits are

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.170 
enjoyed it so far the school visits are
fun<00:05:33.130> it's<00:05:34.130> cool<00:05:34.400> to<00:05:34.550> kind<00:05:34.700> of<00:05:34.730> get<00:05:34.850> out<00:05:35.000> there

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
fun it's cool to kind of get out there

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.910 
fun it's cool to kind of get out there
in<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.330> community<00:05:35.450> especially<00:05:35.960> not<00:05:36.680> being

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
in the community especially not being

in the community especially not being
from<00:05:37.130> here<00:05:37.340> kind<00:05:37.760> of<00:05:37.820> see<00:05:38.050> see<00:05:39.050> what<00:05:39.080> schools

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
from here kind of see see what schools

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.790 
from here kind of see see what schools
are<00:05:39.920> like<00:05:40.040> around<00:05:40.370> here<00:05:40.610> and<00:05:40.730> see<00:05:40.790> what<00:05:41.800> what

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
are like around here and see what what

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.380 
are like around here and see what what
like<00:05:42.950> kind<00:05:43.280> of<00:05:43.340> the<00:05:43.400> young<00:05:43.610> kids<00:05:43.850> around<00:05:44.060> here

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
like kind of the young kids around here

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.950 
like kind of the young kids around here
know<00:05:44.930> about<00:05:45.140> hockey<00:05:45.410> and<00:05:45.800> and<00:05:46.160> see<00:05:47.150> that

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
know about hockey and and see that

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.480 
know about hockey and and see that
they're<00:05:48.230> they're<00:05:48.560> always<00:05:48.710> excited<00:05:49.220> when<00:05:49.250> we

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
they're they're always excited when we

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.890 
they're they're always excited when we
get<00:05:49.640> there<00:05:49.850> and<00:05:49.880> what<00:05:50.090> not<00:05:50.300> and<00:05:50.510> so<00:05:50.720> I<00:05:50.750> think

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
get there and what not and so I think

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.600 
get there and what not and so I think
that's<00:05:51.170> the<00:05:51.320> best<00:05:51.530> part<00:05:51.740> is<00:05:52.010> that<00:05:52.040> they<00:05:52.370> want

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
that's the best part is that they want

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.280 
that's the best part is that they want
us<00:05:52.760> to<00:05:52.940> be<00:05:53.030> there<00:05:53.180> so<00:05:53.420> it<00:05:53.570> makes<00:05:53.720> being<00:05:53.990> there<00:05:54.260> a

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
us to be there so it makes being there a

00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:03.840 
us to be there so it makes being there a
lot<00:05:54.470> more<00:05:54.680> enjoyable

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
I I have no knowledge compared to like

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.409 
I I have no knowledge compared to like

much about it compared to compared to
those<00:06:16.639> guys<00:06:16.850> but<00:06:17.090> I<00:06:17.120> have<00:06:17.720> an<00:06:17.810> appreciation

like to have a good time we have a lot
of<00:06:45.949> same<00:06:46.250> interests<00:06:46.820> and<00:06:46.970> and<00:06:47.330> and<00:06:48.320> so<00:06:48.949> for<00:06:49.490> us

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
of same interests and and and so for us

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.219 
of same interests and and and so for us
it<00:06:49.849> just<00:06:49.880> kind<00:06:50.240> of<00:06:50.270> works<00:06:50.449> out<00:06:50.690> pretty<00:06:51.080> well

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:51.229 
it just kind of works out pretty well

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:53.260 
it just kind of works out pretty well
that<00:06:51.650> we<00:06:52.250> don't<00:06:52.400> want<00:06:52.580> to<00:06:52.639> rip<00:06:52.910> each<00:06:53.000> other's

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270 
that we don't want to rip each other's

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.080 
that we don't want to rip each other's
heads<00:06:53.449> off<00:06:53.630> too<00:06:53.810> much<00:06:53.930> which<00:06:54.590> i<00:06:54.740> think<00:06:54.770> is

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.090 
heads off too much which i think is

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.060 
heads off too much which i think is
pretty<00:06:56.090> much<00:06:56.300> a<00:06:56.360> good<00:06:56.599> sign<00:06:57.050> for<00:06:57.080> any<00:06:57.410> roommate

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.070 
pretty much a good sign for any roommate

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.999 
pretty much a good sign for any roommate
think<00:06:58.940> it's<00:06:59.150> it's<00:06:59.900> just<00:07:00.050> like<00:07:00.500> a<00:07:00.530> natural

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:01.009 
think it's it's just like a natural

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:02.680 
think it's it's just like a natural
thing<00:07:01.250> the<00:07:01.639> more<00:07:02.030> time<00:07:02.270> you<00:07:02.360> spend<00:07:02.389> with

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690 
thing the more time you spend with

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.480 
thing the more time you spend with
someone<00:07:03.110> you're<00:07:03.560> gonna<00:07:03.710> probably<00:07:04.070> be<00:07:04.280> on<00:07:04.400> the

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
someone you're gonna probably be on the

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.969 
someone you're gonna probably be on the
same<00:07:04.669> page<00:07:04.880> with<00:07:05.060> them<00:07:05.180> so<00:07:05.389> I<00:07:05.419> my<00:07:06.320> guess<00:07:06.500> is<00:07:06.710> all

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:06.979 
same page with them so I my guess is all

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:09.159 
same page with them so I my guess is all
the<00:07:07.130> guys<00:07:07.280> would<00:07:07.580> probably<00:07:07.909> say<00:07:08.120> that<00:07:08.930> if<00:07:09.050> they

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:09.169 
the guys would probably say that if they

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:10.719 
the guys would probably say that if they
were<00:07:09.199> to<00:07:09.349> play<00:07:09.620> with<00:07:09.889> their<00:07:10.280> roommate<00:07:10.580> they

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:10.729 
were to play with their roommate they

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:12.430 
were to play with their roommate they
would<00:07:10.849> probably<00:07:11.150> have<00:07:11.300> some<00:07:12.139> sort<00:07:12.380> of

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440 
would probably have some sort of

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.810 
would probably have some sort of
connection<00:07:12.650> just<00:07:12.979> because<00:07:13.070> that's<00:07:13.550> who

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:13.820 
connection just because that's who

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.670 
connection just because that's who
that's<00:07:14.210> who<00:07:14.360> they<00:07:14.479> spend<00:07:14.780> their<00:07:15.110> most<00:07:15.349> time

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 
that's who they spend their most time

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.219 
that's who they spend their most time
with<00:07:15.710> and<00:07:16.130> and<00:07:16.310> Fulton<00:07:17.000> i<00:07:17.030> played<00:07:17.300> together<00:07:17.960> a

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:18.229 
with and and Fulton i played together a

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:20.260 
with and and Fulton i played together a
little<00:07:18.560> bit<00:07:18.770> a<00:07:19.039> couple<00:07:19.580> years<00:07:19.789> ago<00:07:19.909> when<00:07:20.240> we

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.270 
little bit a couple years ago when we

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.270 
little bit a couple years ago when we
were<00:07:20.419> on<00:07:20.479> the<00:07:20.539> same<00:07:20.630> team<00:07:20.810> and<00:07:21.289> so<00:07:21.440> just<00:07:22.130> having

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:22.280 
were on the same team and so just having

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.070 
were on the same team and so just having
that<00:07:22.400> kind<00:07:22.639> of<00:07:22.760> past<00:07:23.060> experience<00:07:23.659> and<00:07:23.870> and

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 
that kind of past experience and and

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.189 
that kind of past experience and and
kind<00:07:24.889> of<00:07:24.949> having<00:07:25.039> it<00:07:25.310> that<00:07:25.460> idea<00:07:25.820> of<00:07:26.180> of<00:07:26.930> where

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 
kind of having it that idea of of where

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:29.320 
kind of having it that idea of of where
the<00:07:27.349> other<00:07:27.470> one's<00:07:27.680> going<00:07:27.830> to<00:07:27.889> be<00:07:28.099> when<00:07:28.940> when

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.330 
the other one's going to be when when

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.520 
the other one's going to be when when
you<00:07:29.419> have<00:07:29.570> the<00:07:29.659> puck<00:07:29.840> just<00:07:29.870> makes<00:07:30.320> everything

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:30.530 
you have the puck just makes everything

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.980 
you have the puck just makes everything
a<00:07:30.889> lot<00:07:30.979> easier<00:07:31.240> yeah<00:07:32.240> you<00:07:32.300> know<00:07:32.539> everyone

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:32.990 
a lot easier yeah you know everyone

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.920 
a lot easier yeah you know everyone
everyone<00:07:33.470> wants<00:07:33.740> to<00:07:33.860> contribute<00:07:34.190> I<00:07:34.520> think<00:07:34.930> and

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:35.930 
everyone wants to contribute I think and

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.670 
everyone wants to contribute I think and
so<00:07:36.320> if<00:07:36.620> I<00:07:36.740> could<00:07:37.509> be<00:07:38.509> more<00:07:38.720> consistent<00:07:39.199> on<00:07:39.560> the

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 
so if I could be more consistent on the

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.320 
so if I could be more consistent on the
scoresheet<00:07:39.919> night<00:07:40.520> in<00:07:40.669> and<00:07:40.820> night<00:07:40.970> out<00:07:41.000> I'd

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:41.330 
scoresheet night in and night out I'd

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.990 
scoresheet night in and night out I'd
like<00:07:41.479> to<00:07:41.630> see<00:07:41.810> that<00:07:41.990> um<00:07:42.229> but<00:07:43.070> you<00:07:43.130> know<00:07:43.159> the<00:07:43.669> the

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 
like to see that um but you know the the

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.930 
like to see that um but you know the the
biggest<00:07:44.180> thing<00:07:44.479> is<00:07:44.659> team<00:07:45.470> success<00:07:45.919> and<00:07:46.250> if<00:07:46.729> we

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:46.940 
biggest thing is team success and if we

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.510 
biggest thing is team success and if we
were<00:07:47.870> to<00:07:47.930> win<00:07:48.169> a<00:07:48.229> bunch<00:07:48.470> of<00:07:48.590> games<00:07:48.740> here<00:07:49.099> in<00:07:49.310> a

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 
were to win a bunch of games here in a

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.390 
were to win a bunch of games here in a
big<00:07:49.699> stretch<00:07:49.970> and<00:07:50.210> I<00:07:50.330> were<00:07:50.599> to<00:07:51.500> have<00:07:51.710> no<00:07:51.949> points

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 
big stretch and I were to have no points

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.950 
big stretch and I were to have no points
but<00:07:52.610> the<00:07:52.759> team's<00:07:52.970> winning<00:07:53.210> then<00:07:53.449> that's<00:07:53.630> the

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 
but the team's winning then that's the

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.830 
but the team's winning then that's the
most<00:07:54.110> important<00:07:54.590> thing<00:07:54.650> and<00:07:55.070> so<00:07:55.280> I<00:07:56.270> guess

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840 
most important thing and so I guess

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.909 
most important thing and so I guess
looking<00:07:57.560> forward<00:07:58.130> to<00:07:58.610> it<00:07:58.820> is<00:07:59.030> just<00:07:59.680> playing<00:08:00.680> a

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:00.919 
looking forward to it is just playing a

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:02.350 
looking forward to it is just playing a
more<00:08:01.099> consistent<00:08:01.430> game<00:08:01.729> in<00:08:01.759> a<00:08:02.000> game<00:08:02.030> that's

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:02.360 
more consistent game in a game that's

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.879 
more consistent game in a game that's
going<00:08:02.509> to<00:08:02.599> help<00:08:02.690> this<00:08:02.900> team<00:08:03.139> win<00:08:03.199> regardless

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:03.889 
going to help this team win regardless

00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:13.610 
going to help this team win regardless
of<00:08:04.520> productivity

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:13.620 

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.680 

you
