00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
bigger than negative 4 now how much is 1

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.340 
bigger than negative 4 now how much is 1
minus<00:00:56.360> 2

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
minus 2

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.550 
minus 2
one<00:01:00.160> means<00:01:00.820> that<00:01:00.940> we<00:01:01.150> start<00:01:01.510> our<00:01:01.750> journey<00:01:01.780> here

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.560 
one means that we start our journey here

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.430 
one means that we start our journey here
on<00:01:02.710> number<00:01:02.890> one<00:01:03.340> and<00:01:03.610> we<00:01:04.510> are<00:01:04.629> going<00:01:04.870> to<00:01:05.199> the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
on number one and we are going to the

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.190 
on number one and we are going to the
left<00:01:05.800> -<00:01:06.640> means<00:01:07.210> that<00:01:07.390> we<00:01:07.540> are<00:01:07.630> going<00:01:07.810> to<00:01:07.930> the

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
left - means that we are going to the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.220 
left - means that we are going to the
left<00:01:08.490> two<00:01:09.490> steps<00:01:10.020> one<00:01:11.020> two<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:13.690> answer<00:01:14.110> is

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
left two steps one two and the answer is

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.830 
left two steps one two and the answer is
negative<00:01:14.470> one

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.140 

because<00:01:18.840> 2<00:01:19.530> minus<00:01:20.070> 1<00:01:20.400> will<00:01:21.390> be<00:01:21.530> positive<00:01:22.530> 1<00:01:22.830> and

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
because 2 minus 1 will be positive 1 and

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.070 
because 2 minus 1 will be positive 1 and
1<00:01:24.150> minus<00:01:24.690> 2<00:01:24.900> will<00:01:25.050> be<00:01:25.260> negative<00:01:26.070> 1<00:01:26.780> now<00:01:27.780> how

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
1 minus 2 will be negative 1 now how

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.790 
1 minus 2 will be negative 1 now how
much<00:01:28.260> is<00:01:28.490> 2<00:01:29.960> minus<00:01:31.460> 4<00:01:32.810> 2<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.290> start<00:01:34.590> our

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
much is 2 minus 4 2 so we start our

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.100 
much is 2 minus 4 2 so we start our
journey<00:01:34.830> here<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:35.930> we<00:01:36.930> move<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.220> left<00:01:39.110> 4

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
journey here and we move to the left 4

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:52.890 
journey here and we move to the left 4
steps<00:01:40.850> 1<00:01:41.990> 2<00:01:42.990> 3<00:01:44.120> 4<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:46.290> answer<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.860> negative<00:01:47.100> 2

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.860 

4<00:01:53.700> minus<00:01:54.700> 2<00:01:55.030> equals<00:01:56.020> positive<00:01:56.710> 2<00:01:57.160> 2<00:01:58.120> minus<00:01:58.600> 4

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
4 minus 2 equals positive 2 2 minus 4

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.490 
4 minus 2 equals positive 2 2 minus 4
equals<00:01:59.320> negative<00:01:59.610> 2

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
equals negative 2

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:10.680 
equals negative 2
how<00:02:02.500> much<00:02:02.740> is<00:02:02.950> 3<00:02:04.290> -<00:02:05.790> 4<00:02:08.040> 3<00:02:09.040> minus<00:02:09.580> 4<00:02:09.880> we<00:02:10.060> started

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
how much is 3 - 4 3 minus 4 we started

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.200 
how much is 3 - 4 3 minus 4 we started
here<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.410> we<00:02:11.950> move<00:02:12.160> to<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.430> left<00:02:12.850> 4<00:02:13.780> steps<00:02:14.200> 1<00:02:15.210> 2

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
here and we move to the left 4 steps 1 2

here and we move to the left 4 steps 1 2
3<00:02:17.190> 4<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:19.420> answer<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.900> negative<00:02:20.140> 1

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.490 

because<00:02:24.890> 4<00:02:25.420> minus<00:02:26.420> 3<00:02:26.470> is<00:02:27.470> positive<00:02:28.190> 1<00:02:29.080> 3<00:02:30.080> minus

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
because 4 minus 3 is positive 1 3 minus

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.050 
because 4 minus 3 is positive 1 3 minus
4<00:02:30.830> is<00:02:31.070> negative<00:02:31.630> 1<00:02:33.130> ok<00:02:34.130> let's<00:02:34.340> consider<00:02:34.700> more

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
4 is negative 1 ok let's consider more

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.640 
4 is negative 1 ok let's consider more
example<00:02:35.630> but<00:02:35.870> without<00:02:36.650> using<00:02:37.250> number<00:02:38.000> lines

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
example but without using number lines

example but without using number lines
how<00:02:39.650> much<00:02:39.830> is<00:02:40.040> 5<00:02:41.500> minus<00:02:42.500> 10<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.980> answer<00:02:46.160> is

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
how much is 5 minus 10 the answer is

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:54.010 
how much is 5 minus 10 the answer is
negative<00:02:47.750> 5<00:02:49.660> because<00:02:50.660> 10<00:02:51.820> minus<00:02:52.820> 5<00:02:53.210> is

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
negative 5 because 10 minus 5 is

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.420 
negative 5 because 10 minus 5 is
positive<00:02:54.650> 5<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:56.260> 5<00:02:57.260> minus<00:02:57.800> 10<00:02:58.040> is<00:02:58.190> negative<00:02:58.550> 5

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
positive 5 and 5 minus 10 is negative 5

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.780 
positive 5 and 5 minus 10 is negative 5
how<00:03:01.430> much<00:03:01.640> is<00:03:02.020> 18<00:03:03.040> minus<00:03:04.150> 20<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:07.280> answer<00:03:07.310> is

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
how much is 18 minus 20 the answer is

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.830 
how much is 18 minus 20 the answer is
negative<00:03:08.060> 2<00:03:09.730> because<00:03:10.900> 20<00:03:11.900> minus<00:03:12.740> 18<00:03:13.840> equals

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
negative 2 because 20 minus 18 equals

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:23.550 
negative 2 because 20 minus 18 equals
positive<00:03:15.740> 2<00:03:16.600> so<00:03:17.600> 18<00:03:18.170> minus<00:03:18.200> 20<00:03:18.980> is<00:03:19.160> negative<00:03:19.970> 2

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.720 

and<00:03:23.650> how<00:03:24.400> much<00:03:24.670> is<00:03:27.300> 75-100

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
and how much is 75-100

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:37.280 
and how much is 75-100
the<00:03:30.730> answer<00:03:31.180> is<00:03:31.330> negative<00:03:32.430> 25<00:03:35.130> because<00:03:36.209> 100

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
the answer is negative 25 because 100

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.910 
the answer is negative 25 because 100
minus<00:03:38.290> 75<00:03:39.480> equals<00:03:40.480> positive<00:03:41.280> 25<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:43.510> 75<00:03:44.440> minus

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
minus 75 equals positive 25 so 75 minus

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.620 
minus 75 equals positive 25 so 75 minus
100<00:03:45.430> equals<00:03:45.690> negative<00:03:46.690> 25
