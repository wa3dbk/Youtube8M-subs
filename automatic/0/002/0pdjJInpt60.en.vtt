to<00:00:49.350> go<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.590> paint<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.489> was<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> little<00:00:50.879> difficult

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
to go in paint it was a little difficult

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.180 
to go in paint it was a little difficult
to<00:00:51.920> see<00:00:52.920> what<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.100> was<00:00:53.280> doing<00:00:53.480> because<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
to see what I was doing because the

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.439 
to see what I was doing because the
screen<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.430> little<00:00:56.489> hard<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.030> see<00:00:57.210> when

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
screen is a little hard to see when

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.110 
screen is a little hard to see when
you're<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.690> direct<00:00:57.870> sunlight<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.399> was<00:00:59.609> so

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
you're in direct sunlight like I was so

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.450 
you're in direct sunlight like I was so
I<00:01:00.359> was<00:01:01.199> kind<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.469> guessing<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> lot<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
I was kind of guessing on a lot of the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.160 
I was kind of guessing on a lot of the
colors<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.059> when<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.239> got<00:01:03.449> home<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.930> finally

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
colors and when I got home and I finally

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.600 
colors and when I got home and I finally
looked<00:01:04.409> at<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> painting<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.400> pretty

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
looked at the painting I was pretty

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.060 
looked at the painting I was pretty
surprised<00:01:06.060> at<00:01:06.390> how<00:01:07.110> accurate<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.680> got<00:01:07.890> it

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
surprised at how accurate I got it

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.370 
surprised at how accurate I got it
considering<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.750> couldn't<00:01:10.049> see<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.260> very

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
considering that I couldn't see it very

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.920 
considering that I couldn't see it very
well<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:10.920> if<00:01:11.520> you're<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> better<00:01:12.600> lighting

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
well but if you're in a better lighting

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.750 
well but if you're in a better lighting
situation<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.890> lot<00:01:14.010> easier<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.460> see<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
situation it's a lot easier to see the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.140 
situation it's a lot easier to see the
screen<00:01:15.119> here<00:01:15.990> I'm<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.320> kind<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:17.119> did<00:01:18.119> a

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
screen here I'm just kind of I did a

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.820 
screen here I'm just kind of I did a
little<00:01:18.330> sketch<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.049> I'm<00:01:19.200> going<00:01:19.530> through

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
little sketch and then I'm going through

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.370 
little sketch and then I'm going through
and<00:01:19.979> I'm<00:01:20.040> blocking<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.729> all<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.630> basic<00:01:21.990> areas

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
and I'm blocking in all the basic areas

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.929 
and I'm blocking in all the basic areas
and<00:01:22.740> then<00:01:22.860> adding<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.220> little<00:01:23.340> bit<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.549> texture

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
and then adding a little bit of texture

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.030 
and then adding a little bit of texture
here<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.360> there<00:01:24.509> I'm<00:01:25.110> going<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.619> sort<00:01:25.979> of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
here and there I'm going for a sort of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.240 
here and there I'm going for a sort of
impressionistic<00:01:26.820> style<00:01:27.439> because<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:29.130> this

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
impressionistic style because for this

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.590 
impressionistic style because for this
particular<00:01:29.729> day<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.909> didn't<00:01:30.180> want<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.420> spend

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
particular day I didn't want to spend

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.140 
particular day I didn't want to spend
too<00:01:31.380> many<00:01:31.500> hours<00:01:31.710> outside<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.759> ended<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.090> doing

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
too many hours outside I ended up doing

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.810 
too many hours outside I ended up doing
this<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.570> about<00:01:33.780> 30<00:01:34.079> minutes<00:01:34.409> or<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:35.759> a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
this in about 30 minutes or so so it's a

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.580 
this in about 30 minutes or so so it's a
pretty<00:01:35.939> quick<00:01:36.240> painting<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.930> don't<00:01:37.380> want<00:01:37.500> to

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
pretty quick painting I don't want to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.469 
pretty quick painting I don't want to
spend<00:01:37.829> forever<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.670> because<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.240> kind<00:01:39.360> of

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
spend forever on it because I kind of

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.710 
spend forever on it because I kind of
wanted<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.810> just<00:01:40.790> get<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> feel<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.479> and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
wanted to just get the feel of it and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.490 
wanted to just get the feel of it and
then<00:01:42.869> leave<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.799> at<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:45.110> so<00:01:46.110> I'm<00:01:46.229> kind<00:01:46.439> of

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
then leave it at that so I'm kind of

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.410 
then leave it at that so I'm kind of
blocking<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.220> dirt<00:01:47.430> on<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.820> island<00:01:48.210> there

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
blocking in the dirt on the island there

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.210 
blocking in the dirt on the island there
and<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:48.869> adding<00:01:49.229> layer<00:01:49.470> after<00:01:49.770> layer<00:01:50.009> after

about<00:01:56.850> using<00:01:57.210> layers<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.140> don't<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.439> to

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
about using layers is you don't have to

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.620 
about using layers is you don't have to
worry<00:01:58.770> about<00:01:58.890> ruined<00:01:59.399> ruining<00:01:59.909> anything<00:02:00.180> you

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
worry about ruined ruining anything you

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.170 
worry about ruined ruining anything you
can<00:02:00.869> always<00:02:01.469> delete<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.100> layer<00:02:02.340> if<00:02:02.729> you're<00:02:03.090> not

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
can always delete a layer if you're not

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.300 
can always delete a layer if you're not
happy<00:02:03.390> with<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.810> at<00:02:04.320> this<00:02:04.439> point<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.920> was<00:02:05.159> pretty

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
happy with it at this point I was pretty

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.039 
happy with it at this point I was pretty
happy<00:02:05.460> with<00:02:05.640> layers<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.299> flatten<00:02:06.689> them<00:02:06.930> all

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
happy with layers so I flatten them all

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.440 
happy with layers so I flatten them all
together<00:02:07.229> into<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.920> single<00:02:07.979> layer<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.729> now<00:02:09.360> I'm

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
together into a single layer and now I'm

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.450 
together into a single layer and now I'm
just<00:02:09.660> kind<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.869> blending<00:02:10.440> everything

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
just kind of blending everything

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.570 
just kind of blending everything
make<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.730> look<00:02:11.850> a<00:02:11.970> little<00:02:12.090> more<00:02:12.980> painterly<00:02:13.980> and

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
make it look a little more painterly and

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.140 
make it look a little more painterly and
a<00:02:14.760> little<00:02:15.030> nicer<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:17.190> I'm<00:02:17.400> kind<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.700> zoomed<00:02:17.940> in

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
a little nicer and I'm kind of zoomed in

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.630 
a little nicer and I'm kind of zoomed in
so<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.390> can<00:02:18.510> see<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:18.930> better<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.440> then<00:02:19.740> I'm

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
so I can see it better and then I'm

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.130 
so I can see it better and then I'm
going<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.820> add<00:02:20.880> some<00:02:21.210> more<00:02:21.360> details<00:02:21.810> some

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
going to add some more details some

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.380 
going to add some more details some
finer<00:02:22.410> details<00:02:22.920> everywhere<00:02:23.460> to<00:02:24.000> just<00:02:24.030> kind<00:02:24.360> of

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
finer details everywhere to just kind of

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.900 
finer details everywhere to just kind of
bring<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.660> piece<00:02:25.020> together<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.800> make<00:02:26.760> it

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
bring the piece together and make it

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.450 
bring the piece together and make it
look<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.180> little<00:02:27.330> more<00:02:27.480> finished<00:02:28.280> this<00:02:29.280> is

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
look a little more finished this is

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.130 
look a little more finished this is

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.980 
out and doing a lot more of these
demonstrations<00:02:43.910> that<00:02:44.910> are<00:02:45.060> probably<00:02:45.840> going

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
demonstrations that are probably going

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.450 
demonstrations that are probably going
to<00:02:46.080> be<00:02:46.140> more<00:02:46.320> in-depth<00:02:46.680> than<00:02:46.800> this<00:02:47.070> this<00:02:47.310> is

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
to be more in-depth than this this is

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.020 
to be more in-depth than this this is
kind<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.760> my<00:02:48.000> trial<00:02:48.990> run<00:02:49.320> here<00:02:49.800> for<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.190> but

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
kind of my trial run here for this but

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.970 
kind of my trial run here for this but
again<00:02:51.540> it's<00:02:51.720> really<00:02:52.020> fun<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.500> recommend<00:02:52.770> that

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
again it's really fun I recommend that

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.280 
again it's really fun I recommend that

really see the pen here but that's what
I'm<00:03:22.830> using<00:03:23.040> is<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.460> pressure-sensitive<00:03:24.210> stylus
