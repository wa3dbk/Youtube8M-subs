hey<00:00:00.269> guys<00:00:00.450> I<00:00:00.690> got<00:00:00.719> something<00:00:01.079> to<00:00:01.140> show<00:00:01.170> you

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
hey guys I got something to show you

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.980 
hey guys I got something to show you
this<00:00:02.179> it's<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.240> bunch<00:00:03.419> of<00:00:03.540> stuff<00:00:03.750> on<00:00:03.959> a

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
this it's a bunch of stuff on a

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.430 
this it's a bunch of stuff on a
breadboard<00:00:04.230> but<00:00:05.100> more<00:00:05.279> than<00:00:05.370> that<00:00:05.460> it's<00:00:05.910> a

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:06.440 
breadboard but more than that it's a

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.060 
breadboard but more than that it's a
lipo<00:00:07.440> cutoff<00:00:07.710> circuit<00:00:08.490> so<00:00:09.150> it's<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:10.200> moment<00:00:10.950> I

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
lipo cutoff circuit so it's a moment I

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.530 
lipo cutoff circuit so it's a moment I
know<00:00:11.130> there's<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.460> lot<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.670> stuff<00:00:11.910> on<00:00:12.090> here<00:00:12.330> I

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
know there's a lot of stuff on here I

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.299 
know there's a lot of stuff on here I
realize<00:00:12.960> that<00:00:13.200> I'll<00:00:13.380> draw<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.590> diagram<00:00:13.889> so<00:00:14.280> you

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
realize that I'll draw a diagram so you

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.910 
realize that I'll draw a diagram so you
can<00:00:14.460> see<00:00:14.700> one<00:00:15.269> also<00:00:15.389> demo<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.900> but<00:00:16.080> it's<00:00:16.650> a

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
can see one also demo it but it's a

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.130 
can see one also demo it but it's a
momentary<00:00:17.910> push-button<00:00:18.300> power<00:00:18.840> switch

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
momentary push-button power switch

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.720 
momentary push-button power switch
hooked<00:00:19.800> up<00:00:19.949> with<00:00:20.810> ATC<00:00:21.810> 54<00:00:22.470> voltage<00:00:23.340> detector

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
hooked up with ATC 54 voltage detector

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.730 
hooked up with ATC 54 voltage detector
by<00:00:24.060> microchip<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.010> 3.3<00:00:26.699> volt<00:00:27.740> voltage

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
by microchip and it's a 3.3 volt voltage

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.250 
by microchip and it's a 3.3 volt voltage
detector<00:00:29.369> chip<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.150> will<00:00:30.630> turn<00:00:30.810> off<00:00:30.869> the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
detector chip so it will turn off the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.650 
detector chip so it will turn off the
circuit<00:00:31.470> automatically<00:00:32.309> at<00:00:32.520> 3.3<00:00:33.180> volts<00:00:33.510> or

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
circuit automatically at 3.3 volts or

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.889 
circuit automatically at 3.3 volts or
below<00:00:34.730> so<00:00:35.730> let<00:00:35.880> me<00:00:35.940> show<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.149> how<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.450> works

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
below so let me show you how it works

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.799 
below so let me show you how it works
before<00:00:37.200> we<00:00:37.469> do<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:38.879> momentary<00:00:39.420> switch<00:00:39.660> I

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
before we do that the momentary switch I

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.979 
before we do that the momentary switch I
got<00:00:39.960> from<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.440> guy<00:00:40.620> called<00:00:40.860> Dave<00:00:41.040> Jones<00:00:41.989> his

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
got from a guy called Dave Jones his

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.290 
got from a guy called Dave Jones his
he's<00:00:43.410> got<00:00:43.590> video<00:00:43.920> I'll<00:00:44.370> put<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.760> up<00:00:44.850> here<00:00:45.059> so

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
he's got video I'll put it up here so

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.840 
he's got video I'll put it up here so
that<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.510> can<00:00:45.719> click<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:47.280> look<00:00:47.730> at

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
that you can click on it and and look at

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.340 
that you can click on it and and look at
that<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.090> more<00:00:48.239> detail<00:00:48.660> I'll<00:00:48.930> go<00:00:49.110> over<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
that in more detail I'll go over a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.220 
that in more detail I'll go over a
little<00:00:49.530> bit<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.070> but<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.340> was<00:00:50.460> his<00:00:50.579> idea<00:00:50.730> so

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
little bit of it but it was his idea so

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.319 
little bit of it but it was his idea so
props<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.410> him<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
props to him so this is this is the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.360 
props to him so this is this is the
circuit<00:00:54.750> mostly<00:00:55.350> Dave<00:00:55.680> Jones<00:00:55.920> his<00:00:56.160> work

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
circuit mostly Dave Jones his work

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.299 
circuit mostly Dave Jones his work
really<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.870> momentary<00:00:58.289> power<00:00:58.590> circuit

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
really the momentary power circuit

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.250 
really the momentary power circuit
that's<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.699> here<00:00:59.940> is<00:00:59.969> mostly<00:01:00.629> his<00:01:00.840> work<00:01:01.020> and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
that's in here is mostly his work and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.229 
that's in here is mostly his work and
then<00:01:01.440> we've<00:01:01.559> got<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> TC<00:01:02.309> 54<00:01:02.879> which<00:01:03.059> I've

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
then we've got the TC 54 which I've

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.149 
then we've got the TC 54 which I've
added<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.170> modification<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
added so it's a modification of the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.039 
added so it's a modification of the
circuit<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.640> he<00:01:05.820> produced<00:01:06.150> now<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.900> does

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
circuit that he produced now it does

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.480 
circuit that he produced now it does
look<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.439> there's<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.710> lot<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.920> parts<00:01:08.250> there

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
look like there's a lot of parts there

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.100 
look like there's a lot of parts there
and<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.790> suppose<00:01:09.000> there<00:01:09.210> are<00:01:09.360> quite<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> few<00:01:09.930> so

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
and I suppose there are quite a few so

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.670 
and I suppose there are quite a few so
you've<00:01:10.260> got<00:01:10.490> we've<00:01:11.490> got<00:01:11.840> four<00:01:12.840> NPN

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
you've got we've got four NPN

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.280 
you've got we've got four NPN
transistors<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.549> there<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.000> we've<00:01:15.210> got<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.630> P

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
transistors on there and we've got the P

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.200 
transistors on there and we've got the P
channel<00:01:16.500> MOSFET<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.670> bunch<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.970> resistors

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
channel MOSFET and a bunch of resistors

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.690 
channel MOSFET and a bunch of resistors
and<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.990> capacitor<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.710> we've<00:01:19.920> got<00:01:20.040> an<00:01:20.130> LED<00:01:20.280> -

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
and a capacitor and we've got an LED -

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.370 
and a capacitor and we've got an LED -
just<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.330> display<00:01:21.540> whether<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.140> or<00:01:22.259> not

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
just to display whether it's on or not

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.929 
just to display whether it's on or not
so<00:01:22.590> we<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:22.740> turn<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.189> now<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:23.759> with<00:01:23.880> a

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
so we can turn it on now just with a

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.380 
so we can turn it on now just with a
momentary<00:01:24.360> push<00:01:24.630> button<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:26.240> you'll<00:01:27.240> see

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
momentary push button and you'll see

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.069 
momentary push button and you'll see
it's<00:01:27.540> now<00:01:27.689> drawing<00:01:27.960> 16<00:01:28.890> milliamps<00:01:29.750> and<00:01:30.750> then<00:01:31.049> I

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
it's now drawing 16 milliamps and then I

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.190 
it's now drawing 16 milliamps and then I
can<00:01:31.350> tell<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.650> off<00:01:31.710> again<00:01:32.869> just<00:01:33.869> using<00:01:34.020> that

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
can tell it off again just using that

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.899 
can tell it off again just using that
button<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.680> that's<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.040> capacitor<00:01:35.729> there

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
button so that's that capacitor there

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.179 
button so that's that capacitor there
that's<00:01:36.150> doing<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:39.170> now<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.650> turn<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:41.070> on

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
that's doing that now if I turn it on

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.410 
that's doing that now if I turn it on
and<00:01:41.810> we'll<00:01:42.810> try<00:01:42.990> taking<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.530> voltage<00:01:43.979> down

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
and we'll try taking this voltage down

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.460 
and we'll try taking this voltage down
it's<00:01:45.420> going<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.630> be<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> lot<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:45.960> clicking<00:01:48.470> and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
it's going to be a lot of clicking and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.590 
it's going to be a lot of clicking and
it<00:01:49.619> should<00:01:49.799> turn<00:01:49.979> off<00:01:50.189> at<00:01:50.520> around<00:01:50.820> 3<00:01:51.270> volts<00:01:53.600> so

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
it should turn off at around 3 volts so

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.910 
it should turn off at around 3 volts so
it's<00:01:54.720> turned<00:01:54.869> off<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> little<00:01:55.290> bit<00:01:55.439> soon<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.890> I

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
it's turned off a little bit soon and I

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.670 
it's turned off a little bit soon and I
expect<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:57.240> fact<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.719> still<00:01:57.930> on<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.500> is

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
expect it in fact is is still on it is

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.700 
expect it in fact is is still on it is
still<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:59.009> but<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.310> LEDs<00:01:59.810> very<00:02:00.810> dimmed<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.439> if

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
still on but the LEDs very dimmed so if

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.040 
still on but the LEDs very dimmed so if
I<00:02:01.829> just<00:02:02.009> bring<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.189> back<00:02:02.369> up

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.890 

so<00:02:05.770> if<00:02:05.860> I<00:02:05.920> take<00:02:06.100> it<00:02:06.250> down<00:02:06.400> to<00:02:06.580> three<00:02:07.000> we'll<00:02:07.750> just

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
so if I take it down to three we'll just

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:17.850 
so if I take it down to three we'll just
go<00:02:07.990> below<00:02:08.290> three<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:17.170> then<00:02:17.380> if<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.560> bring<00:02:17.710> it

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
go below three and then if I bring it

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.980 
go below three and then if I bring it
back<00:02:17.980> up<00:02:18.010> back<00:02:18.520> up<00:02:18.550> again<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:22.600> so<00:02:22.750> it's<00:02:22.900> no

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
back up back up again and so it's no

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.020 
back up back up again and so it's no
longer<00:02:23.170> on<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:23.740> it's<00:02:23.860> turned<00:02:24.040> itself<00:02:24.250> off<00:02:24.430> now

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
longer on so it's turned itself off now

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.350 
longer on so it's turned itself off now
this<00:02:25.210> MOSFET<00:02:26.670> its<00:02:27.900> vgs<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.110> around<00:02:29.380> 2<00:02:29.800> volts<00:02:30.360> to

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
this MOSFET its vgs is around 2 volts to

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.380 
this MOSFET its vgs is around 2 volts to
4<00:02:31.540> volts<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.080> it<00:02:32.470> will<00:02:32.620> work<00:02:32.800> it<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.330> or<00:02:34.330> just

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
4 volts so it will work it to or just

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.930 
4 volts so it will work it to or just
above<00:02:34.960> 2<00:02:35.410> so<00:02:36.160> you<00:02:36.250> can't<00:02:36.460> guarantee<00:02:36.820> this

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
above 2 so you can't guarantee this

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.150 
above 2 so you can't guarantee this
circuit<00:02:37.330> will<00:02:37.450> turn<00:02:37.630> off<00:02:37.780> at<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:37.960> safe<00:02:38.230> lipo

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
circuit will turn off at a safe lipo

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.030 
circuit will turn off at a safe lipo
voltage<00:02:39.550> but<00:02:39.790> adding<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.660> TC<00:02:41.050> 54<00:02:41.620> means<00:02:41.860> that

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
voltage but adding the TC 54 means that

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.470 
voltage but adding the TC 54 means that
it<00:02:42.130> pulls<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.930> gate<00:02:44.140> on<00:02:44.380> that<00:02:44.440> transistor

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
it pulls the the gate on that transistor

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.880 
it pulls the the gate on that transistor
that<00:02:46.480> will<00:02:46.750> we'll<00:02:47.230> look<00:02:47.350> at<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.770> the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
that will we'll look at and the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.870 
that will we'll look at and the
schematic<00:02:49.050> pulls<00:02:50.050> it<00:02:50.200> low<00:02:50.410> so<00:02:50.710> that<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:51.640> turns

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
schematic pulls it low so that it turns

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.680 
schematic pulls it low so that it turns
off<00:02:52.030> so<00:02:52.180> let's<00:02:52.300> have<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.420> look<00:02:52.540> at<00:02:52.630> the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
off so let's have a look at the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.450 
off so let's have a look at the
schematic<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:53.380> we<00:02:53.470> can<00:02:53.620> see<00:02:54.190> what<00:02:54.340> we're

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
schematic so that we can see what we're

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.520 
schematic so that we can see what we're
talking<00:02:54.790> about<00:02:54.850> so<00:02:55.660> we've<00:02:55.810> got<00:02:55.930> our<00:02:56.020> diagram

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
talking about so we've got our diagram

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.900 
talking about so we've got our diagram
here<00:02:56.740> and<00:02:56.920> let<00:02:57.250> me<00:02:57.310> just<00:02:57.370> run<00:02:57.670> through<00:02:57.700> it

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
here and let me just run through it

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.630 
here and let me just run through it
really<00:02:58.120> quickly<00:02:58.680> so<00:02:59.680> we've<00:02:59.800> got<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.310> MOSFET

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
really quickly so we've got the MOSFET

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.320 
really quickly so we've got the MOSFET
here<00:03:00.820> its<00:03:01.120> source<00:03:01.420> is<00:03:01.600> connected<00:03:01.810> voltage<00:03:02.380> in

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
here its source is connected voltage in

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.270 
here its source is connected voltage in
and<00:03:04.330> we've<00:03:04.540> got<00:03:04.570> a<00:03:04.990> 100k<00:03:05.590> resistor<00:03:05.740> connected

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
and we've got a 100k resistor connected

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.900 
and we've got a 100k resistor connected
to<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:07.150> gate<00:03:07.510> on<00:03:07.990> there<00:03:08.320> and<00:03:08.710> that's<00:03:09.160> apparent

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
to the gate on there and that's apparent

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.640 
to the gate on there and that's apparent
that<00:03:10.000> well<00:03:10.209> Dave<00:03:10.810> Jones<00:03:11.020> explained<00:03:11.440> you

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
that well Dave Jones explained you

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.750 
that well Dave Jones explained you
wouldn't<00:03:11.860> want<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.070> flapping<00:03:12.520> in<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.670> breeze

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
wouldn't want it flapping in the breeze

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.190 
wouldn't want it flapping in the breeze
but<00:03:13.270> basically<00:03:13.570> you<00:03:13.690> don't<00:03:13.810> want<00:03:13.989> it<00:03:14.050> not

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
but basically you don't want it not

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.180 
but basically you don't want it not
connected<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.709> anything

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
connected to anything

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.540 
connected to anything
because<00:03:15.940> weird<00:03:16.180> things<00:03:16.480> happen<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:18.100> then

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
because weird things happen and then

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.400 
because weird things happen and then
it's<00:03:18.700> connected<00:03:19.180> to<00:03:19.209> this<00:03:19.540> transistor<00:03:20.020> and

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
it's connected to this transistor and

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.350 
it's connected to this transistor and
now<00:03:20.680> while<00:03:20.890> this<00:03:21.040> transistors<00:03:21.700> in<00:03:21.910> an<00:03:22.090> off

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
now while this transistors in an off

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.140 
now while this transistors in an off
state<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:24.400> it's<00:03:24.520> not<00:03:24.640> connected<00:03:25.120> to

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
state and so it's not connected to

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.710 
state and so it's not connected to
ground<00:03:25.300> this<00:03:26.230> MOSFET<00:03:26.560> won't<00:03:26.950> be<00:03:27.100> turning<00:03:27.400> on

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
ground this MOSFET won't be turning on

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.020 
ground this MOSFET won't be turning on
the<00:03:28.720> gate<00:03:29.290> of<00:03:29.440> this<00:03:29.560> transistor<00:03:29.980> is<00:03:30.370> connected

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
the gate of this transistor is connected

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.060 
the gate of this transistor is connected
to<00:03:31.239> a<00:03:31.450> switch<00:03:31.959> here<00:03:32.290> which<00:03:32.620> in<00:03:32.770> turn<00:03:32.920> is

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
to a switch here which in turn is

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.949 
to a switch here which in turn is
connected<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.610> 100k<00:03:34.000> resistor<00:03:34.150> at<00:03:34.840> the

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
connected to the 100k resistor at the

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.630 
connected to the 100k resistor at the
top<00:03:35.200> here<00:03:35.440> which<00:03:35.530> goes<00:03:35.770> to<00:03:35.950> voltage<00:03:36.220> in<00:03:36.400> so

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
top here which goes to voltage in so

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.210 
top here which goes to voltage in so
when<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:37.660> press<00:03:37.840> on<00:03:38.020> that<00:03:38.140> switch<00:03:38.410> you<00:03:39.010> turn

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
when you press on that switch you turn

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.100 
when you press on that switch you turn
this<00:03:39.430> transistor<00:03:39.880> on<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.330> then<00:03:40.959> that

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
this transistor on and then that

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.590 
this transistor on and then that
essentially<00:03:41.590> grounds<00:03:42.010> out<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.430> gate<00:03:42.700> on<00:03:42.940> the

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
essentially grounds out the gate on the

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.960 
essentially grounds out the gate on the
MOSFET<00:03:44.260> so<00:03:45.130> turning<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.610> on

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
MOSFET so turning it on

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.360 
MOSFET so turning it on
once<00:03:46.330> that<00:03:46.510> MOSFET<00:03:47.200> is<00:03:47.350> on<00:03:47.530> you've<00:03:48.190> got

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
once that MOSFET is on you've got

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.090 
once that MOSFET is on you've got
another<00:03:48.730> 100k<00:03:49.150> resistor<00:03:49.360> here<00:03:49.930> going<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.440> the

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
another 100k resistor here going to the

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.400 
another 100k resistor here going to the
base<00:03:51.280> of<00:03:51.489> that<00:03:51.520> transistor<00:03:52.270> so<00:03:52.900> that<00:03:53.050> keeps

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
base of that transistor so that keeps

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.620 
base of that transistor so that keeps
that<00:03:53.800> transistor<00:03:54.430> on<00:03:54.580> so<00:03:54.820> it's<00:03:55.090> like<00:03:55.600> a

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
that transistor on so it's like a

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.280 
that transistor on so it's like a
self-perpetuating<00:03:56.190> circuit<00:03:57.480> now<00:03:58.480> because<00:03:59.170> we

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
self-perpetuating circuit now because we

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.250 
self-perpetuating circuit now because we
want<00:03:59.410> that<00:03:59.560> switch<00:03:59.800> to<00:03:59.950> be<00:04:00.070> an<00:04:00.190> on<00:04:00.310> off<00:04:00.520> thing

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
want that switch to be an on off thing

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.090 
want that switch to be an on off thing
once<00:04:02.260> that<00:04:02.530> is<00:04:02.769> on<00:04:03.070> it<00:04:04.030> also<00:04:04.180> turns<00:04:04.959> on<00:04:05.200> once

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
once that is on it also turns on once

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.580 
once that is on it also turns on once
the<00:04:06.280> circuits<00:04:06.700> on<00:04:06.850> it<00:04:07.060> also<00:04:07.180> turns<00:04:07.570> on<00:04:07.750> this

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
the circuits on it also turns on this

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.690 
the circuits on it also turns on this
transistor<00:04:09.340> here<00:04:10.950> through<00:04:11.950> this<00:04:12.070> one<00:04:12.370> mega

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
transistor here through this one mega

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.949 
transistor here through this one mega
ohm<00:04:12.790> resistor<00:04:13.270> and<00:04:13.450> we've<00:04:13.930> got<00:04:14.080> our<00:04:14.230> capacitor

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
ohm resistor and we've got our capacitor

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.039 
ohm resistor and we've got our capacitor
that's<00:04:15.620> so<00:04:15.739> that<00:04:15.860> we<00:04:15.980> can<00:04:16.130> have<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.910> pause<00:04:17.630> in

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
that's so that we can have a pause in

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.449 
that's so that we can have a pause in
the<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.560> button<00:04:18.859> so<00:04:19.009> it<00:04:19.070> doesn't<00:04:19.340> oscillate

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
the the button so it doesn't oscillate

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.570 
the the button so it doesn't oscillate
continuously<00:04:20.470> so<00:04:21.470> when<00:04:21.620> you<00:04:21.709> um<00:04:21.949> when<00:04:21.979> you

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
continuously so when you um when you

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.580 
continuously so when you um when you
then<00:04:22.699> press<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.060> switch<00:04:23.270> again<00:04:23.560> after<00:04:24.560> a

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
then press the switch again after a

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.520 
then press the switch again after a
little<00:04:24.680> while<00:04:24.800> this<00:04:25.780> bit<00:04:26.780> here<00:04:26.990> is<00:04:27.139> connected

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
little while this bit here is connected

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.499 
little while this bit here is connected
directly<00:04:27.680> to<00:04:28.039> ground<00:04:28.190> once<00:04:28.759> this<00:04:28.910> transistors

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
directly to ground once this transistors

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.480 
directly to ground once this transistors
on<00:04:29.660> so<00:04:29.810> it<00:04:29.930> shorts<00:04:30.199> out<00:04:30.289> the<00:04:30.440> base<00:04:30.590> of<00:04:31.340> this

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
on so it shorts out the base of this

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.999 
on so it shorts out the base of this
transistor<00:04:31.699> and<00:04:32.090> turns<00:04:32.300> it<00:04:32.419> off<00:04:32.889> so<00:04:33.889> that's

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
transistor and turns it off so that's

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.820 
transistor and turns it off so that's
the<00:04:34.190> simple<00:04:34.550> power<00:04:34.729> switch<00:04:35.410> and<00:04:36.410> then<00:04:36.680> what

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
the simple power switch and then what

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.150 
the simple power switch and then what
I've<00:04:36.949> done<00:04:37.160> is<00:04:37.400> modified<00:04:37.880> it<00:04:38.030> so<00:04:38.180> I've<00:04:38.300> added

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
I've done is modified it so I've added

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.460 
I've done is modified it so I've added
ATC<00:04:40.160> 54<00:04:40.759> which<00:04:41.570> is<00:04:41.720> the<00:04:41.840> voltage<00:04:42.110> detector

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
ATC 54 which is the voltage detector

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.210 
ATC 54 which is the voltage detector
down<00:04:42.710> here<00:04:42.919> it's<00:04:43.910> got<00:04:44.120> VN<00:04:45.110> going<00:04:45.470> directly<00:04:45.889> to

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
down here it's got VN going directly to

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.409 
down here it's got VN going directly to
the<00:04:46.910> drain<00:04:47.720> of<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.260> MOSFET<00:04:49.300> so<00:04:50.300> it's

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
the drain of the MOSFET so it's

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:51.879 
the drain of the MOSFET so it's
measuring<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.900> voltage<00:04:51.020> that's<00:04:51.500> coming<00:04:51.740> out

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
measuring the voltage that's coming out

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.300 
measuring the voltage that's coming out
and<00:04:52.419> then<00:04:53.419> it's<00:04:53.750> V<00:04:53.960> out<00:04:54.110> is<00:04:54.380> connected<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:54.889> 100k

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
and then it's V out is connected to 100k

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.070 
and then it's V out is connected to 100k
resistor<00:04:55.430> so<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.210> base<00:04:56.449> of<00:04:56.810> a<00:04:56.900> transistor

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
resistor so the base of a transistor

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.840 
resistor so the base of a transistor
down<00:04:57.560> here<00:04:57.889> so<00:04:58.610> once<00:04:58.789> if<00:04:59.050> the<00:05:00.050> T<00:05:00.199> to<00:05:00.320> 54<00:05:00.919> detects

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
down here so once if the T to 54 detects

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.540 
down here so once if the T to 54 detects
that<00:05:01.970> the<00:05:02.150> voltage<00:05:02.539> is<00:05:02.810> lower<00:05:03.199> than<00:05:03.830> 3<00:05:04.160> volts

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
that the voltage is lower than 3 volts

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.890 
that the voltage is lower than 3 volts
it<00:05:05.180> will<00:05:05.240> turn<00:05:05.780> on<00:05:06.400> its<00:05:07.400> output<00:05:07.729> that<00:05:08.210> the<00:05:08.570> VL

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
it will turn on its output that the VL

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.659 
it will turn on its output that the VL
and<00:05:09.199> it<00:05:09.590> will<00:05:09.710> turn<00:05:09.889> on<00:05:10.010> that<00:05:10.130> transistor

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
and it will turn on that transistor

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.339 
and it will turn on that transistor
growing<00:05:11.240> at<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.419> base<00:05:11.570> to<00:05:11.810> this<00:05:11.930> transistor

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
growing at the base to this transistor

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:14.589 
growing at the base to this transistor
so<00:05:12.680> turning<00:05:12.949> off<00:05:13.130> the<00:05:13.280> circuit<00:05:13.520> and<00:05:14.479> that's

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
so turning off the circuit and that's

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.150 
so turning off the circuit and that's
essentially<00:05:14.930> it<00:05:15.169> all<00:05:15.410> it<00:05:15.560> is<00:05:15.680> it's<00:05:15.979> pretty

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
essentially it all it is it's pretty

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.219 
essentially it all it is it's pretty
simple<00:05:16.580> it's<00:05:16.940> only<00:05:17.210> a<00:05:17.270> small<00:05:17.479> modification<00:05:17.750> to

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
simple it's only a small modification to

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.469 
simple it's only a small modification to
de<00:05:18.349> circuit<00:05:18.860> but<00:05:19.610> hopefully<00:05:20.030> it<00:05:20.120> will<00:05:20.150> come<00:05:20.330> in

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
de circuit but hopefully it will come in

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.360 
de circuit but hopefully it will come in
