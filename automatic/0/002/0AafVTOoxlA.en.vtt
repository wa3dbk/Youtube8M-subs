community here in Los Angeles a little

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.430 
community here in Los Angeles a little
bit<00:00:56.309> I'm<00:00:56.430> starting<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.730> learn<00:00:56.910> more<00:00:57.090> as<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.930> go<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
bit I'm starting to learn more as I go I

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.729
