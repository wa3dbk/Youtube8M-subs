00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:08.630
 hello good today we're going to do something 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.170
 different let's start celebrating of 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.190
 origami 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.139
 this video is something general 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.670
 let's say almost all the things of 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.000
 origami are started as a 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.080
 square and we have a folio the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.080
 rectangular folio 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.930
 since the square folios are expensive in 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.120
 the stationery stores and for 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.570
 save us that money we are going to make a 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.550
 general video and I'll show you how to do 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.450
 a painting is something very simple magical and 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.450
 An example 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.330
 we sing the paper 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.930
 important in the bureaucracy there is a 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.880
 rule how much better do you leave the lines 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.880
 put better you stay 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.890
 the figure of affection machine 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.199
 then we make this mark I marked him 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.559
 a lot because normally the figures 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.559
 what do i usually do 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.440
 usually they have this dinner and this double 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.440
 Now what we do is 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.820
 backward this 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.510
 and carefully we make a variation to 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:32.970
 cadiz and now we have two options or 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:36.120
 catch the scissors or with your hands 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.790
 I prefer we know since the family 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.600
 face is an art that is made with the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.670
 chalks 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.390
 but it is to consumer taste then 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.970
 we choose and with the nail marking well 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.650
 the better we mark it easier and easier 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.640
 be reinforce then what we have what 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.890
 what we end up having is this 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.740
 fixed we are the square and we have a 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.430
 surplus processed because we do with 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.430
 very careful 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.650
 and makes the sun short 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.519
 perfect and we already have a square 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.989
 and from here we would start 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.989
 to make all figures 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.590
 As you can see it is very simple and very fast 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.410
 and nothing else I hope you liked a 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.410
 greeting
