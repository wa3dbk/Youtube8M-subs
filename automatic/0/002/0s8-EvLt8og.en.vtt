Acme warrior now we actually have the
agony<00:03:04.030> attacker<00:03:04.510> which<00:03:04.840> is<00:03:05.020> very<00:03:05.620> similar<00:03:05.860> to

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
agony attacker which is very similar to

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.640 
agony attacker which is very similar to
this<00:03:06.220> one<00:03:06.460> as<00:03:06.580> well<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.810> I<00:03:07.930> actually<00:03:08.230> have

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
this one as well and I actually have

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.800 
this one as well and I actually have
another<00:03:09.010> Acme<00:03:09.550> attacker<00:03:09.850> coming<00:03:10.270> next<00:03:10.510> week

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
another Acme attacker coming next week

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.290 
another Acme attacker coming next week
for<00:03:11.080> a<00:03:11.110> review<00:03:11.470> a<00:03:11.680> proper<00:03:12.550> review<00:03:12.700> this<00:03:13.030> time

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
for a review a proper review this time

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.570 
for a review a proper review this time
because<00:03:13.690> when<00:03:14.290> I<00:03:14.320> reviewed<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:14.950> last<00:03:15.130> abner

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
because when I reviewed the last abner

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.430 
because when I reviewed the last abner
attacker<00:03:15.910> they<00:03:16.540> needed<00:03:16.960> to<00:03:17.080> make<00:03:17.230> some

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
attacker they needed to make some

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.580 
attacker they needed to make some
serious<00:03:17.710> improvements<00:03:18.780> this<00:03:19.780> one<00:03:20.050> is<00:03:20.260> very

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
serious improvements this one is very

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.590 
serious improvements this one is very
similar<00:03:21.070> to<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.340> atma<00:03:21.700> attacker<00:03:22.060> a<00:03:22.180> pardon

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
similar to the atma attacker a pardon

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.200 
similar to the atma attacker a pardon
this<00:03:22.690> one<00:03:22.840> actually<00:03:23.020> has<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.410> 21<00:03:24.070> not<00:03:25.000> sure

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
this one actually has a 21 not sure

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.360 
this one actually has a 21 not sure
engine<00:03:25.630> they<00:03:26.020> don't<00:03:26.320> send<00:03:26.650> in<00:03:26.830> its<00:03:26.980> SH

nitrogen<00:03:28.120> but<00:03:28.360> believe<00:03:28.780> me<00:03:28.810> it<00:03:29.110> is<00:03:29.320> an<00:03:29.530> SH

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
nitrogen but believe me it is an SH

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.250 
nitrogen but believe me it is an SH
match<00:03:30.190> our<00:03:30.400> engine<00:03:30.700> is<00:03:31.180> basically<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:32.020> same

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
match our engine is basically the same

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.740 
match our engine is basically the same
as<00:03:32.320> an<00:03:32.500> SH<00:03:33.060> everything<00:03:34.060> is<00:03:34.150> looking<00:03:34.330> very<00:03:34.450> nice

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
as an SH everything is looking very nice

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.450 
as an SH everything is looking very nice
I<00:03:35.080> mean<00:03:35.200> set<00:03:35.530> up<00:03:35.650> nicely<00:03:35.860> is<00:03:36.070> actually<00:03:36.430> a

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
I mean set up nicely is actually a

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.900 
I mean set up nicely is actually a
beautiful<00:03:37.030> looking<00:03:37.300> buggy<00:03:37.660> I<00:03:37.810> have<00:03:38.170> to<00:03:38.350> say<00:03:38.910> so

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
beautiful looking buggy I have to say so

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.760 
beautiful looking buggy I have to say so
what<00:03:40.060> I<00:03:40.090> will<00:03:40.180> do<00:03:40.390> now<00:03:40.570> I<00:03:40.600> think<00:03:40.720> is<00:03:41.170> go<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:41.620> get

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
what I will do now I think is go and get

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.890 
what I will do now I think is go and get
the<00:03:41.950> video<00:03:42.130> camera<00:03:42.640> in<00:03:42.760> my<00:03:42.880> hands<00:03:43.240> and<00:03:43.420> we'll

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
the video camera in my hands and we'll

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.949 
the video camera in my hands and we'll
make<00:03:44.590> us<00:03:44.709> start<00:03:45.040> taking<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:45.850> closer<00:03:46.120> look<00:03:46.209> under

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
make us start taking a closer look under

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.370 
make us start taking a closer look under
the<00:03:47.080> body<00:03:47.260> shell<00:03:47.530> enjoy
