00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
 hello welcome to the booth just as low boiling pot 2011 then you're 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.930
 may be surprised to see us here for some of you 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.870
 who knew him mainly in France we will not have to see our 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.870
 activities little digital products pc and television 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:14.610
 you must know that 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.610
 the sheath of the chiba group is also in energy management 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.230
 pass by 7 35% of the group's global turnover that makes it 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.960
 very very long time that we are in these activities and what is 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.919
 new is that more and more the group is interested in 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.890
 develop however activities his know-how his skills in 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.109
 other parts of the world in particular 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:38.569
 in europe and in france we are lucky to be partners on a big 

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:40.469
 big smart city pilot project 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.260
 in Lyon confluence during a war an engine 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.690
 it is for us a first is also the first event on Tuesday 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.449
 test 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.200
 2009 in Paris 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.070
 this is a first because to them for a year now now a year the fight 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.790
 against AIDS has been cited 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.580
 and put the social accelerator activities around the 100 pts by 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.770
 communicated 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.510
 and so percent we are here to introduce ourselves 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.890
 both the projects we are working on 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.470
 in France on wea bio in Lyon confluence but in another part of the world in 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.900
 yokohama cytises 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.350
 but we have a china in the usa 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.539
 well here is the set of projects 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.010
 tonight is an evening we are working on 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.550
 and we also present 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.690
 all the actions we propose in this area 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.960
 which touches both the building area of ​​the un 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.460
 christophe martin of the netherlands nest of the residential no one with 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.710
 the smart home 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.650
 but also 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.650
 renewable energy production with photovoltaic systems 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.440
 the revelation of energy storage with mothers equipped with 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.290
 storage system and his mentor wheat and of course that the shot of 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.360
 heart of all the system the brain the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 community health of the management system that allows 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.820
 but also to the sites and communities it's piloted these sets of 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.940
 residence buildings infrastructure and production 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.020
 of renewable energy so 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.920
 we complete and understand 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.940
 and that he had a steering system 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.949
 that improve their energy efficiency 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.049
 and tend towards 3h 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.049
 but quote him ap after this meeting imprint 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:23.509
 an example on the ground we are working today it has been seen 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:25.989
 the project of lyon 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.649
 it is a project 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:30.279
 between tiny noses and Japanese debt 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.439
 and after that unfortunately the urban community of Dunkerque 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.399
 a project that includes both 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:39.339
 a positive energy building so that will produce more energy than it 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:43.239
 does not sell consume so it poses a goal to adapt the building 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.629
 energy production but also to reduce 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.780
 energy consumption than to bet all the parameters 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:50.809
 that allow you 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:52.969
 to do that that's the first point 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:54.789
 according to the constitution 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:58.209
 the infrastructure for electric vehicles in car-sharing 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.099
 that too is one of the major issues of the smarties teese urban mobility to 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.709
 low footprint 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.179
 carbon and then the third pole it's gold and so profits the 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:13.079
 renovation of apartments to equip them with steering systems 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.199
 energy could also say their fac their energy bill yet 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:20.199
 in concrete terms a big big project we're working on 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:22.779
 which revolves around the axé 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:24.589
 fable this tuesday march 10th
