00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.790
 people what exactly at the start with the video 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.730
 the subject of jazz was asked more often 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.519
 It makes sense to diet now only 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.980
 one that does not but only the days 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.779
 short difference so kitas is 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.750
 simply yes you are just what you see 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.390
 what he's upset is you have the fed 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.449
 extremely low and the kohlen dÃ¶rte 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.609
 extremely high protein fashion rating one kilo 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.309
 per in the entrance per kilogram bit 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.469
 higher up to two kilograms one can 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.390
 That's a risk and title like that 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.239
 it said all you can eat everything 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.430
 simply clear and titles are useful 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.960
 Why do rock chip I guess 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.390
 you should be in the beginning so the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.879
 Theory behind it is just that 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.950
 Metabolism falls asleep when you diet 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.949
 some series extremely slow and 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.930
 then logitech and thereby becomes the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.670
 Hand pushed extremely hard and through this 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.800
 In the end you can push more fat 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.670
 lose weight as if you just go through the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.070
 Etikette and that sounds too good 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.960
 to be true and just as like everything in 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.610
 if it is too good so if it is so 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.860
 it sounds good to be true 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.180
 usually as thoughtful as it used to be 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.049
 has worked with the human 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.939
 body 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.009
 you had 67 days to eat little 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.650
 that means you have the ethics for 67 days 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.900
 then you have a really fat difference 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.580
 dgh you have somehow experienced high and 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.799
 has taken so much pure 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.560
 Pure skin hewn just like you just do 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.290
 Skilled one had the title 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.950
 as are the people now the diets 16 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.350
 days have you and according to the logic 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.189
 so it is from this year experts 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.500
 that you then lose more weight than you do 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.710
 if you just continue the day he is 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.590
 it would have and thinks something is fat 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.490
 fat is a forgotten one 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.090
 life insurance that means without fat 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.670
 Best deceased earned there since that 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.100
 for times only in low energy 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.350
 disposal from the fat reserves 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.850
 can get 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.390
 and if I used to lose weight earlier 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.789
 would have been through this check day as 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.060
 if you do not hear this 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.879
 We would have been better then 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.459
 if you winsen this title in 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.719
 does not hear at all 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.719
 As you already know, that makes everything 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:25.750
 no sense a title with a lot of fat 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:28.489
 will make you fat 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.760
 so if you can fix it better 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.620
 said that we have not got a title yet 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.260
 500 grams of fat then you will 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.819
 probably 500 deposit program of the 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.280
 body is programmed for 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.159
 Survive and fat is something 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.280
 It is essential for times where you are 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:48.139
 there is less energy and there for that 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.700
 What else did not really have 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.379
 really many features others cuddle 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.500
 small but the main function is flat 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.329
 the storage of energy and of the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.439
 reason you can do it a bit 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.180
 derive 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.220
 that just decided it totally 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.829
 nonsense are from physiological ones 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.590
 that means you could theoretically yes 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.959
 because I did not do two weeks break 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.019
 just by blatantly one day 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.269
 exaggerating make them mentally 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:19.069
 or could they make mental sense 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:21.349
 yes they could be quite good if you were there 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.109
 is just the request has what 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.329
 Somehow something to eat and you 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.430
 could not clear and shape 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.199
 He definitely decided 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.840
 better than we break off if you do 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:33.919
 his goal has not yet reached but 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.760
 otherwise, nothing would happen to me now 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.500
 come to mind 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.359
 that actually decided that 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.229
 Justify it if you honestly 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:45.169
 is except that alternatively fun 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:47.780
 clearly it has given me makes it fun with you 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.340
 But I like to go and see me 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.560
 on the calories it's just as much me 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.569
 But as I said then you have to stop 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.790
 also live with the consequences 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.579
 that means either longer or longer 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.169
 hertha that or else, by the way, me 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.209
 had in my competition either 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:04.250
 one called him sustainably decided date 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.319
 just through the area and if I have to 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.120
 I quickly lost weight 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.549
 I decided so can it 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.640
 To do so is to take one sits well 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.580
 already bite 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.730
 It's hard because I have one 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.040
 to make a whole chat with a cinema 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:23.960
 so as I said I would not 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:27.240
 really recommend in the diet 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.710
 yes always construction you can do it gladly 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.810
 when you get the next one day 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.280
 little compensation and the next but one 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.530
 maybe also and depending on how 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.660
 we take the plants off 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.669
 but also still in the construction one becomes 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.830
 either way, and if and when 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.510
 It makes you happy like me 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.850
 for example, just make yourself 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.410
 suggest manhard has to deal with that 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.750
 reward 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.880
 he likes to do that but to think 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.250
 that one especially diet where you 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.260
 really like a sponge sucking everything up 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.800
 yes, absorb everything the club 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.450
 shoot that to think that then you 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.390
 somehow gets off scot-free and 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.430
 even lose weight more than you would 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.970
 through diet yes that is unfortunately wrong 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.970
 of course that is total bullshit though 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.430
 as I said for the psyche it can 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:19.080
 quite sensible make short number called 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:21.060
 so cried could make sense where you are 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.640
 The whole metabolism must be said 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.530
 a story is not relevant so 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.470
 the numbers I have seen are 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.840
 so low that on the repeat thereby 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.750
 that we just have more energy system what 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.340
 yes, even if only one day relatively little 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.500
 It's going to be decided a bit 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.150
 the conversion of coal fed was fed 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.919
 that in greed has been extremely low 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.050
 the rate and a little bit of 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.060
 food fat which has to do compulsively 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.410
 is the club but no more store 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.550
 Others called but you have more again 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.110
 Energy system of what but the next day 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.450
 but it can not benefit yet 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.919
 everything they digest for nothing and the 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.110
 The next day, even if you are full 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:00.060
 you are not in the deficit 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.940
 deficit in yesterday's energy 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.430
 + voss again full memory glycogen 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.900
 which in turn follows everyone 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.790
 a little bit 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.800
 can reduce that is also a first 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.020
 Repeater also has its own pages 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.620
 There is no draw for the acceptance 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.590
 necessary and will also be in the party 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:22.310
 is going to drive longer again 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:23.750
 forcibly and has the cool 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.979
 that function through me earlier 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.240
 memory then a bit harder 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:27.740
 Maybe I can work out that way 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.380
 can get a little more muscle 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.479
 yes you have to say that but that is 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.949
 as I said a theory I have like 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:35.690
 said in the contest either 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:37.820
 but decided the risks if 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.010
 I lost quickly has me in 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.840
 Cuba that was already with the video 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.970
 for the theme of james keep the video 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.070
 then celebrate give me the thumb up 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:49.550
 commented coachman the video with the 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:51.889
 field otherwise wish you still like 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.310
 always one day and see you in the 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:54.310
 next video
