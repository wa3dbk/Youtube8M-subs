pretty<00:01:41.070> nice<00:01:41.430> yeah<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.000> keeps<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.810> holes<00:01:42.990> all

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
pretty nice yeah it keeps the holes all

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.389 
pretty nice yeah it keeps the holes all
the<00:01:43.200> way<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.439> little<00:01:43.619> bit<00:01:43.770> more<00:01:44.040> when<00:01:44.189> you're<00:01:44.280> up

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399

whichever side you're using well that's

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.639 
whichever side you're using well that's
nice<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.360> then<00:02:00.570> now<00:02:00.689> what<00:02:00.810> about<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.229> they

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
nice and then now what about this they

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.560 
nice and then now what about this they
say<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.399> keeps<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.820> from<00:02:03.270> slipping

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
say that this keeps it from slipping

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.630 
say that this keeps it from slipping
it's<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.110> good<00:02:04.290> grip<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> good<00:02:05.369> grip

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
it's a good grip it is it is a good grip

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.190 
it's a good grip it is it is a good grip
when<00:02:06.360> you're<00:02:06.479> using<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.840> all<00:02:06.960> day<00:02:06.990> you

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
when you're using it all day you

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.139 
when you're using it all day you
definitely<00:02:07.469> knows<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.129> comfort<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.789> in

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
definitely knows that comfort and in

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.630 
definitely knows that comfort and in
that<00:02:09.360> traction<00:02:09.780> on<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.229> okay<00:02:10.770> but<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.520> know

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
that traction on it so okay but you know

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.270 
that traction on it so okay but you know
what<00:02:11.819> should<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.450> lose<00:02:12.870> your

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
what should you lose your

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.740 
what should you lose your
so<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.550> speak<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:14.120> it<00:02:14.180> falls<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.660> ground

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
so to speak and it falls to the ground

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.260 
so to speak and it falls to the ground
that's<00:02:15.560> where<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.920> quality<00:02:16.400> comes<00:02:16.640> in<00:02:16.880> is<00:02:17.090> it

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
that's where the quality comes in is it

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.090 
that's where the quality comes in is it
a<00:02:17.360> well-built<00:02:17.720> tool<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.650> well-built

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
a well-built tool it is a well-built

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.680 
a well-built tool it is a well-built
tool<00:02:19.370> it's<00:02:19.670> it's<00:02:20.000> brought<00:02:20.240> this<00:02:20.420> thing's

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
tool it's it's brought this thing's

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.510 
tool it's it's brought this thing's
probably<00:02:20.840> been<00:02:21.110> dropped<00:02:21.380> a<00:02:21.530> dozen<00:02:22.370> times

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
probably been dropped a dozen times

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.990 
probably been dropped a dozen times
already<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.900> then<00:02:24.350> no<00:02:24.770> brakes<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:25.370> still

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
already and and then no brakes and still

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.700 
already and and then no brakes and still
operates<00:02:26.390> just<00:02:26.480> like<00:02:26.660> it<00:02:26.870> did<00:02:26.990> it<00:02:27.110> when<00:02:27.440> we<00:02:27.560> got

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
operates just like it did it when we got

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.470 
operates just like it did it when we got
it<00:02:27.890> yeah<00:02:28.700> how<00:02:28.850> long<00:02:29.000> would<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.180> expect

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
it yeah how long would you expect

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.870 
it yeah how long would you expect
something<00:02:29.810> like<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:29.959> to<00:02:30.140> last<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:30.830> this<00:02:31.100> this

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
something like this to last so this this

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.699 
something like this to last so this this
tool<00:02:32.090> probably<00:02:32.510> lasts<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:32.930> couple<00:02:32.990> years<00:02:33.500> and

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
tool probably lasts a couple years and

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.740 
tool probably lasts a couple years and
you<00:02:34.310> can<00:02:34.430> always<00:02:34.670> rebuild<00:02:34.850> them<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.360> get<00:02:35.720> a

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
you can always rebuild them and get a

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.480 
you can always rebuild them and get a
couple<00:02:36.020> more<00:02:36.140> years<00:02:36.350> out<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.650> them<00:02:36.740> okay<00:02:37.310> so

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
couple more years out of them okay so

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.610 
couple more years out of them okay so
when<00:02:38.270> you<00:02:38.360> talk<00:02:38.540> about<00:02:38.570> how<00:02:39.230> much<00:02:39.350> you<00:02:39.470> have<00:02:39.560> to

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.120 
spend to get the tool that you get what
about<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:41.959> value<00:02:42.140> is<00:02:42.500> this<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.709> good<00:02:42.920> value

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
it's a good value I'm tool cost is

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.470 
it's a good value I'm tool cost is
always<00:02:46.130> something<00:02:46.340> that's<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.730> concern<00:02:47.120> in<00:02:47.360> the
