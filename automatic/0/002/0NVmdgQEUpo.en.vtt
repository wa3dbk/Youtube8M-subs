this<00:00:44.219> car<00:00:44.579> might<00:00:44.969> just<00:00:45.270> shine<00:00:46.969> and<00:00:47.969> ice<00:00:48.300> track

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309

this<00:00:50.309> could<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.700> course<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> big<00:00:51.660> green

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
this could of course be a big green

this could of course be a big green

but<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.149> reckon<00:00:54.539> fast<00:00:54.930> cars<00:00:55.320> are<00:00:55.559> now<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:55.980> easy

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
but I reckon fast cars are now so easy

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.830 
but I reckon fast cars are now so easy
