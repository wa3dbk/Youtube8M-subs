00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.720 
day this is average what I get right
about<00:03:44.870> here

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
about here

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.500 
about here
this<00:03:46.730> is<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.090> max<00:03:47.410> that's<00:03:48.410> it<00:03:48.950> so<00:03:49.940> I'm<00:03:50.270> used<00:03:50.450> to

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
this is the max that's it so I'm used to

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.850 
this is the max that's it so I'm used to
actually<00:03:50.660> seeing<00:03:50.960> data<00:03:51.140> speeds<00:03:51.410> like<00:03:51.530> this<00:03:51.680> or

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
actually seeing data speeds like this or

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.030 
actually seeing data speeds like this or
slower<00:03:53.470> and<00:03:54.640> pings<00:03:55.640> of<00:03:55.880> about<00:03:56.090> that<00:03:56.270> or<00:03:56.540> slower

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
slower and pings of about that or slower

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.180 
slower and pings of about that or slower
so<00:03:58.240> there<00:03:59.240> may<00:03:59.510> have<00:03:59.750> been<00:03:59.810> some<00:04:00.380> some

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
don't we need to see what the results

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.470 
don't we need to see what the results
are<00:04:11.030> it's<00:04:11.330> already<00:04:11.540> pretty<00:04:11.810> piss-poor<00:04:12.080> so<00:04:12.650> wow

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480

are it's already pretty piss-poor so wow
that's<00:04:14.480> not<00:04:14.600> that<00:04:14.810> good<00:04:15.050> so<00:04:15.230> if<00:04:15.590> we<00:04:15.680> go<00:04:15.770> down

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
that's not that good so if we go down

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.650 
that's not that good so if we go down
here<00:04:16.250> you<00:04:16.520> can<00:04:16.670> see<00:04:16.700> some<00:04:17.000> of<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.180> speed<00:04:17.420> tests

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
here you can see some of the speed tests

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.820 
here you can see some of the speed tests
I<00:04:17.720> did<00:04:17.900> before<00:04:19.090> they're<00:04:20.090> better<00:04:20.750> but<00:04:21.650> they're

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
I did before they're better but they're

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.379 
I did before they're better but they're
still<00:04:22.100> definitely<00:04:22.520> not

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
still definitely not

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:24.969 
still definitely not
a<00:04:23.419> lot<00:04:23.659> of<00:04:23.689> them<00:04:23.840> are<00:04:23.960> not<00:04:24.110> within<00:04:24.439> with<00:04:24.650> Sprint

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
a lot of them are not within with Sprint

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
good actually for split not for any

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.339 
good actually for split not for any
other<00:04:38.120> carrier<00:04:38.479> but<00:04:38.599> for<00:04:38.779> split<00:04:39.020> this<00:04:39.169> is

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
other carrier but for split this is

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.619 
other carrier but for split this is
really<00:04:39.590> good<00:04:39.740> right<00:04:39.889> here<00:04:40.099> and<00:04:40.279> I<00:04:40.909> thought<00:04:41.120> wow

really good right here and I thought wow
they<00:04:42.349> really<00:04:42.560> did<00:04:42.680> upgrade<00:04:42.860> it<00:04:43.270> but<00:04:44.270> they

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
they really did upgrade it but they

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:45.760 
they really did upgrade it but they
really<00:04:44.719> didn't<00:04:44.990> because<00:04:45.259> if<00:04:45.379> you<00:04:45.469> look<00:04:45.650> down

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
really didn't because if you look down

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.510 
really didn't because if you look down
here<00:04:46.090> right<00:04:47.090> before<00:04:47.360> I<00:04:47.569> get<00:04:47.749> off<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:48.319> bus<00:04:48.520> you

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
here right before I get off the bus you

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.399 
here right before I get off the bus you
know<00:04:49.639> these<00:04:50.120> these<00:04:50.509> speeds<00:04:50.779> right<00:04:50.960> here<00:04:51.199> are

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:51.409 
know these these speeds right here are

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.100 
know these these speeds right here are
bad<00:04:52.180> and<00:04:53.180> let's<00:04:53.419> go<00:04:53.539> down<00:04:53.689> to<00:04:53.719> San<00:04:53.960> Jose

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
bad and let's go down to San Jose

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.730 
bad and let's go down to San Jose
earlier

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
earlier

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.580 
earlier
that's<00:04:55.129> the<00:04:55.310> highest<00:04:55.669> one<00:04:55.819> I<00:04:55.849> got<00:04:56.090> right<00:04:56.270> there

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
that's the highest one I got right there

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.730 
that's the highest one I got right there
um<00:04:57.590> these<00:04:58.340> are<00:04:58.400> another<00:04:58.699> high<00:04:58.879> ones<00:04:59.120> now<00:04:59.930> here

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
um these are another high ones now here

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.399 
um these are another high ones now here
we<00:05:00.830> go<00:05:00.860> right<00:05:01.219> here<00:05:01.840> look<00:05:02.840> at<00:05:02.930> that<00:05:03.080> one<00:05:03.199> last

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:03.409 
we go right here look at that one last

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:04.179 
we go right here look at that one last
night<00:05:03.650> actually

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:04.189 
night actually

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:06.909 
night actually
looks<00:05:04.520> pretty<00:05:04.729> good<00:05:05.229> especially<00:05:06.229> the<00:05:06.500> upload

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
looks pretty good especially the upload

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.790 
looks pretty good especially the upload
speed<00:05:07.129> that's<00:05:07.400> really<00:05:07.819> good<00:05:08.000> um<00:05:08.620> so<00:05:09.620> let's

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
speed that's really good um so let's

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.140 
speed that's really good um so let's
look<00:05:09.860> at<00:05:10.009> San<00:05:10.159> Jose<00:05:10.779> 61<00:05:11.779> 38<00:05:12.680> 951<00:05:13.460> these<00:05:14.000> are

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
look at San Jose 61 38 951 these are

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.490 
look at San Jose 61 38 951 these are
actually<00:05:14.449> really<00:05:14.719> terrible<00:05:15.050> speeds<00:05:15.349> the

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
actually really terrible speeds the

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.749 
actually really terrible speeds the
reason<00:05:15.770> why<00:05:15.830> I<00:05:15.919> say<00:05:16.099> they're<00:05:16.219> terrible<00:05:16.520> speeds

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
reason why I say they're terrible speeds

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:21.339 
reason why I say they're terrible speeds
is<00:05:16.909> because<00:05:17.210> in<00:05:17.689> San<00:05:18.650> Jose<00:05:18.979> I<00:05:19.509> always<00:05:20.509> always

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
is because in San Jose I always always

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:27.700 
is because in San Jose I always always
get<00:05:22.129> between<00:05:23.120> 900<00:05:24.110> and<00:05:25.240> 1200<00:05:26.240> up<00:05:26.779> to<00:05:27.050> 1500

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
get between 900 and 1200 up to 1500

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.969 
get between 900 and 1200 up to 1500
kilobits<00:05:28.099> per<00:05:28.189> second<00:05:29.349> always<00:05:30.349> it's<00:05:30.710> always

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
kilobits per second always it's always

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:36.219 
kilobits per second always it's always
within<00:05:31.310> that<00:05:31.400> range<00:05:31.610> and<00:05:31.909> today<00:05:33.339> this<00:05:35.080> this<00:05:36.080> is

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
within that range and today this this is

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.529 
within that range and today this this is
at<00:05:36.349> my<00:05:36.439> work<00:05:36.650> all<00:05:37.219> this<00:05:37.430> is<00:05:37.610> that<00:05:37.729> my<00:05:37.849> at<00:05:38.150> my<00:05:38.330> job

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
at my work all this is that my at my job

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.269 
at my work all this is that my at my job
this<00:05:39.469> is<00:05:39.649> terrible

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
this is terrible

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:44.200 
this is terrible
this<00:05:40.879> is<00:05:41.000> horrible<00:05:41.839> so<00:05:42.729> there<00:05:43.729> you<00:05:43.819> have<00:05:43.879> it

this is horrible so there you have it

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.110 
this is horrible so there you have it
sprint<00:05:45.080> may<00:05:45.500> have<00:05:45.770> upgraded<00:05:46.339> in<00:05:46.490> some<00:05:46.759> areas

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
sprint may have upgraded in some areas

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.170 
sprint may have upgraded in some areas
downgraded<00:05:48.050> in<00:05:48.169> others<00:05:48.560> and<00:05:48.879> most<00:05:49.879> of<00:05:50.029> all
