and<00:00:57.739> what<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.239> obviously<00:01:00.239> as<00:01:00.420> you

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
and what that is is obviously as you

and what that is is obviously as you
know<00:01:00.570> when<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.020> lift<00:01:01.260> you're<00:01:01.530> creating<00:01:02.039> micro

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
know when you lift you're creating micro

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.840 
know when you lift you're creating micro
trauma<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.390> muscles<00:01:04.040> slight<00:01:05.040> tears<00:01:05.400> it's

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850

exercise induced muscle damage very very
minimal<00:01:09.890> like<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.010> said<00:01:11.189> again<00:01:11.369> microscopic

minimal like I said again microscopic

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.480 
minimal like I said again microscopic
but<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.960> there<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.470> causes<00:01:13.830> soreness<00:01:14.280> it

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
but it's there it causes soreness it

what<00:01:27.900> that's<00:01:28.049> coming<00:01:28.409> from<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.829> when<00:01:29.159> you're

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
what that's coming from is when you're

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.120 
what that's coming from is when you're
unaccustomed<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.390> eccentric<00:01:31.049> or<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
unaccustomed to the eccentric or the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.730 
unaccustomed to the eccentric or the
negative<00:01:32.670> portion<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.329> movement<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:33.780> take

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
negative portion of the movement so take

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.030 
negative portion of the movement so take
for<00:01:34.979> instance<00:01:35.070> when<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.579> do<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> bicep<00:01:36.720> curl

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
for instance when you do a bicep curl

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.800 
for instance when you do a bicep curl
when<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.130> have<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.460> weight<00:01:38.759> like<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.150> this

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
when you have the weight like this this

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.060 
when you have the weight like this this
would<00:01:39.990> be<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.140> eccentric<00:01:40.770> you're

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
would be the eccentric you're

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.069 
would be the eccentric you're
lengthening<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.880> muscle<00:01:42.299> that's<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
lengthening the muscle that's the

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.679 
lengthening the muscle that's the
negative<00:01:43.560> portion<00:01:44.329> usually<00:01:45.329> when<00:01:45.450> you're<00:01:45.600> not

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
negative portion usually when you're not

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.109 
negative portion usually when you're not
accustomed<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.649> slow<00:01:46.950> negative<00:01:47.460> that's

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
accustomed to that slow negative that's

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.270 
accustomed to that slow negative that's
where<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.689> dom's<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.259> coming<00:01:49.590> from<00:01:49.770> that

where that dom's is coming from that

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.609 
where that dom's is coming from that
muscle<00:01:50.670> soreness<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.240> due<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.200> eccentric

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
muscle soreness is due to the eccentric

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
because I get comments and questions

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.670 
because I get comments and questions
sometimes<00:03:09.459> saying<00:03:09.790> how<00:03:10.360> come<00:03:10.570> my<00:03:10.780> shoulder<00:03:11.470> or

sometimes saying how come my shoulder or

sometimes saying how come my shoulder or
my<00:03:11.709> chest<00:03:11.950> of<00:03:12.640> something<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.150> still<00:03:13.420> in<00:03:13.840> pain

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
my chest of something is still in pain

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.190 
my chest of something is still in pain
two<00:03:14.890> weeks<00:03:15.100> after<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.550> did<00:03:15.970> whatever<00:03:16.720> exercise

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
two weeks after I did whatever exercise

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.220 
two weeks after I did whatever exercise
it<00:03:17.380> may<00:03:17.620> be<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:18.910> might<00:03:19.150> be<00:03:19.269> an<00:03:19.360> injury<00:03:19.840> not<00:03:20.200> a

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
it may be that might be an injury not a

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.720 
it may be that might be an injury not a
soreness<00:03:20.800> so<00:03:21.040> you<00:03:21.130> have<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.400> be<00:03:21.519> able<00:03:21.580> to

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
soreness so you have to be able to

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.490 
soreness so you have to be able to
understand<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.300> differences<00:03:22.780> in<00:03:22.959> pain<00:03:23.230> and

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
understand the differences in pain and

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.740 
understand the differences in pain and
if<00:03:24.130> it<00:03:24.250> is<00:03:24.430> an<00:03:24.610> injury<00:03:24.910> I<00:03:24.970> highly<00:03:25.540> suggest

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
if it is an injury I highly suggest

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.570 
if it is an injury I highly suggest
staying<00:03:26.200> away<00:03:26.380> from<00:03:26.440> any<00:03:26.769> movements<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.430> are

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
staying away from any movements that are

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.180 
staying away from any movements that are
involved<00:03:27.940> with<00:03:27.970> that<00:03:28.060> muscle<00:03:28.680> or<00:03:29.680> any<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:30.100> the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
involved with that muscle or any of the

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.380 
involved with that muscle or any of the
surrounding<00:03:30.340> muscles<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:30.970> be<00:03:31.090> honest<00:03:31.300> you

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
surrounding muscles to be honest you

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.670 
surrounding muscles to be honest you
definitely<00:03:31.840> don't<00:03:31.959> want<00:03:32.170> to<00:03:32.260> further<00:03:32.500> an

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
definitely don't want to further an

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.620 
definitely don't want to further an
injury<00:03:32.980> so<00:03:33.220> I<00:03:33.250> highly<00:03:33.850> suggest<00:03:34.030> getting<00:03:34.300> that

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
injury so I highly suggest getting that

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.720 
injury so I highly suggest getting that
checked<00:03:34.930> out<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:36.430> that's<00:03:36.880> pretty<00:03:37.239> much<00:03:37.360> it<00:03:37.870> so

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
checked out and that's pretty much it so

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.840 
checked out and that's pretty much it so
no<00:03:40.380> muscle<00:03:41.380> soreness<00:03:41.620> is<00:03:41.950> not<00:03:42.190> an<00:03:42.370> indicator

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
no muscle soreness is not an indicator

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.990 
no muscle soreness is not an indicator
of<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:43.120> good<00:03:43.299> workout<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:44.860> more<00:03:44.890> you<00:03:45.459> work<00:03:45.760> out

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
of a good workout the more you work out

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.020 
of a good workout the more you work out
the<00:03:46.420> more<00:03:46.570> you<00:03:46.630> become<00:03:46.840> accustomed<00:03:47.110> to<00:03:47.680> these

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
the more you become accustomed to these

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.340 
the more you become accustomed to these
eccentric<00:03:49.030> movements<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:49.810> increasing<00:03:50.260> the

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
eccentric movements and increasing the

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.770 
eccentric movements and increasing the
intensity<00:03:50.799> over<00:03:50.950> time<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.970> less<00:03:52.269> sore<00:03:52.600> you're

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
intensity over time the less sore you're

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.410 
intensity over time the less sore you're
going<00:03:53.049> to<00:03:53.200> be<00:03:53.760> if<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:54.910> have<00:03:54.940> any<00:03:55.239> other
