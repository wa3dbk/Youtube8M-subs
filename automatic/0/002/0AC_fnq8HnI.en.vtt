00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
actually played pretty good and not and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.990 
actually played pretty good and not and
I<00:01:06.479> thought<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.869> myself<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.470> know<00:01:07.590> without<00:01:08.189> you

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
I thought to myself you know without you

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.399 
I thought to myself you know without you
know<00:01:09.119> hearing<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.450> from<00:01:09.750> Jesus<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.260> don't

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
know hearing that from Jesus I don't

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.600 
know hearing that from Jesus I don't
think<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.680> could<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:10.920> got<00:01:11.070> through<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.460> and

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
think I could have got through it and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.940 
think I could have got through it and
you<00:01:12.270> know<00:01:12.420> everything<00:01:12.900> from<00:01:13.200> no<00:01:13.350> one<00:01:13.590> has<00:01:13.770> been

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
you know everything from no one has been

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.600 
you know everything from no one has been
easy<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.979> that's<00:01:17.189> interesting

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
easy and so and that's interesting

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.890 
easy and so and that's interesting
because<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:18.090> know<00:01:18.119> what<00:01:18.270> Jesus<00:01:18.540> talks<00:01:18.780> about

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
because you know what Jesus talks about

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.660 
because you know what Jesus talks about
he<00:01:19.170> says<00:01:19.350> buy<00:01:19.470> my<00:01:19.740> yoke<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.189> easy<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.549> my

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
he says buy my yoke is easy and my

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.390 
he says buy my yoke is easy and my
burden<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:21.090> wide<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.689> often<00:01:22.400> Christianity

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
burden is wide and so often Christianity

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.490 
burden is wide and so often Christianity
is<00:01:23.610> perceived<00:01:24.330> from<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.600> distance<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.409> a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
is perceived from a distance it's just a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.679 
is perceived from a distance it's just a
bunch<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.830> rules<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.490> yeah<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.119> guys<00:01:27.330> are<00:01:27.360> no
