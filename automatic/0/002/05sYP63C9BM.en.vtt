00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
was into plastic looking her silky from

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.979 
was into plastic looking her silky from
ear<00:02:58.820> to<00:02:58.850> shining<00:02:59.530> so<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.830> is<00:03:00.950> so<00:03:01.220> key<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:02.840> is

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
ear to shining so it is so key and it is

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.259 
ear to shining so it is so key and it is
under<00:03:03.230> percent<00:03:03.470> density<00:03:03.910> so<00:03:04.910> it's<00:03:05.090> pretty

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
under percent density so it's pretty

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.740 
under percent density so it's pretty
full<00:03:05.510> but<00:03:06.170> they<00:03:06.590> do<00:03:06.650> have<00:03:07.209> higher<00:03:08.209> density

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
full but they do have higher density

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.150 
full but they do have higher density
raise<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.200> lower<00:03:09.260> density<00:03:09.769> race

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
raise and lower density race

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.590 
raise and lower density race

at<00:04:21.030> my<00:04:21.060> hairline<00:04:21.919> and<00:04:22.919> what<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.160> did<00:04:23.400> was

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
at my hairline and what I did was

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.010 
at my hairline and what I did was
because<00:04:23.850> a<00:04:23.880> little<00:04:23.940> bit<00:04:24.090> late

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
because a little bit late

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.900 
because a little bit late
and<00:04:25.410> what<00:04:25.590> I<00:04:25.620> did<00:04:25.919> because<00:04:26.220> a<00:04:26.250> little<00:04:26.370> lace<00:04:26.639> was

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
and what I did because a little lace was

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.730 
and what I did because a little lace was
showing<00:04:27.330> I<00:04:27.479> actually<00:04:27.720> used<00:04:28.050> some<00:04:28.110> a<00:04:28.289> black

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
showing I actually used some a black

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.159 
showing I actually used some a black
eyeliner<00:04:29.190> pencil<00:04:29.220> and<00:04:29.910> a<00:04:29.940> little<00:04:30.210> mascara<00:04:30.630> and

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
eyeliner pencil and a little mascara and

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.409 
eyeliner pencil and a little mascara and
I'm<00:04:31.590> colored<00:04:31.949> in<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.340> lace<00:04:32.610> so<00:04:33.150> that<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.360> will

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
I'm colored in the lace so that it will

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.090 
I'm colored in the lace so that it will
blend<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.660> little<00:04:33.750> bit<00:04:33.870> better<00:04:33.960> because<00:04:34.919> I

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
blend a little bit better because I

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.350 
blend a little bit better because I
didn't<00:04:35.310> want<00:04:35.430> to<00:04:35.490> leave<00:04:35.610> no<00:04:35.760> hair<00:04:35.970> out<00:04:36.090> on<00:04:36.210> this

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
didn't want to leave no hair out on this

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.029 
didn't want to leave no hair out on this
side<00:04:36.570> so<00:04:37.050> I<00:04:37.110> have<00:04:37.139> no<00:04:37.380> hair<00:04:37.530> left<00:04:37.650> on<00:04:37.830> this<00:04:37.979> side

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
side so I have no hair left on this side

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.939 
side so I have no hair left on this side
and<00:04:38.400> just<00:04:38.720> my<00:04:39.720> little<00:04:40.020> edges<00:04:40.440> right<00:04:40.650> here<00:04:40.830> on

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
and just my little edges right here on

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.250 
and just my little edges right here on
this<00:04:41.070> side<00:04:41.280> so<00:04:41.970> this<00:04:42.090> is<00:04:42.300> technically<00:04:42.780> behind

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
this side so this is technically behind

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.200 
this side so this is technically behind
the<00:04:43.350> hairline<00:04:43.530> I<00:04:43.740> guess<00:04:43.889> you<00:04:44.039> could<00:04:44.190> say<00:04:44.370> but<00:04:44.580> I

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
the hairline I guess you could say but I

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.020 
the hairline I guess you could say but I
basically<00:04:45.720> know<00:04:45.960> leave<00:04:46.199> out<00:04:46.910> like<00:04:47.910> I<00:04:48.000> said

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
basically know leave out like I said

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
using the drawstring if it's so secure I

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.110 
using the drawstring if it's so secure I
noticed<00:05:51.230> another<00:05:51.290> unit<00:05:51.830> is<00:05:51.950> that<00:05:51.980> is<00:05:52.430> tangling

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
noticed another unit is that is tangling

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.880 
noticed another unit is that is tangling
a<00:05:53.270> little<00:05:53.600> bit<00:05:53.780> not<00:05:54.050> so<00:05:54.080> much<00:05:54.440> I'm<00:05:54.620> it<00:05:54.740> as<00:05:54.830> a

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
a little bit not so much I'm it as a

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.350 
a little bit not so much I'm it as a
curl<00:05:55.070> unit<00:05:55.340> so<00:05:55.430> I'm<00:05:55.550> expecting<00:05:55.790> that<00:05:56.000> it<00:05:56.240> is

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
curl unit so I'm expecting that it is

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.750 
curl unit so I'm expecting that it is
tangling<00:05:56.780> a<00:05:56.870> little<00:05:57.110> bit<00:05:57.230> and<00:05:57.740> I<00:05:58.190> did<00:05:58.520> see<00:05:58.730> a

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.550 
tangling a little bit and I did see a
little<00:05:58.880> bit<00:05:59.060> of<00:05:59.120> shading<00:05:59.420> nothing<00:06:00.140> too<00:06:00.350> crazy

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
little bit of shading nothing too crazy

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.350 
little bit of shading nothing too crazy
but<00:06:00.920> their<00:06:01.100> unit<00:06:01.400> is<00:06:01.550> shedding<00:06:01.880> a<00:06:01.970> little<00:06:02.090> bit

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
but their unit is shedding a little bit

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.170 
but their unit is shedding a little bit
so<00:06:03.320> there's<00:06:03.740> two<00:06:03.890> things<00:06:03.920> I<00:06:04.370> do<00:06:04.430> not<00:06:04.640> like<00:06:04.880> or

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
against I've noticed and I'm pretty sure

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.320

someone's<00:06:06.950> gonna<00:06:07.070> complain<00:06:07.370> about<00:06:07.520> is<00:06:08.030> that

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
someone's gonna complain about is that

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.480
