turn<00:01:51.450> towards<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.290> ball<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.280> use<00:01:53.549> a

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
turn towards the ball you have to use a

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.090 
turn towards the ball you have to use a
normal<00:01:54.119> pass<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.659> order<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.409> perform<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
normal pass in order to perform the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.639 
normal pass in order to perform the
movement<00:01:56.340> properly<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.930> movement<00:01:58.469> is

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
movement properly and this movement is

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.800 
movement properly and this movement is
effective<00:01:59.219> everywhere<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.030> opponents<00:02:00.600> field

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
effective everywhere in opponents field

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.770 
effective everywhere in opponents field
as<00:02:01.110> far<00:02:01.560> as<00:02:01.799> there<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.250> free<00:02:02.549> space<00:02:02.880> behind<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
as far as there is free space behind the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.380 
as far as there is free space behind the
receiver<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.159> he<00:02:05.430> will<00:02:05.579> be<00:02:05.640> able<00:02:06.240> to

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
receiver so that he will be able to

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.930 
receiver so that he will be able to
leave<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.780> ball<00:02:06.960> between<00:02:07.500> his<00:02:07.740> legs<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.789> is

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
leave the ball between his legs this is

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.119 
leave the ball between his legs this is
a<00:02:08.970> great<00:02:09.330> way<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.629> create<00:02:10.170> an<00:02:10.349> attack<00:02:10.679> along

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
a great way to create an attack along

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.450 
a great way to create an attack along
the<00:02:11.310> wing<00:02:11.489> by<00:02:11.760> using

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
the wing by using

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.850

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
technique or else to use it near to the

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.550 
technique or else to use it near to the
penalty<00:02:15.280> box<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:16.120> perform<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.780> movement<00:02:17.290> and

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
penalty box to perform the movement and

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.130 
penalty box to perform the movement and
to<00:02:17.620> combine<00:02:18.160> it<00:02:18.550> with<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.820> shot<00:02:19.150> at<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.630> goal<00:02:19.840> or

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140

to combine it with a shot at the goal or
else<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:21.250> use<00:02:21.490> it<00:02:21.670> from<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.000> longer<00:02:22.360> distance<00:02:22.540> to

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
else to use it from a longer distance to

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.130 
else to use it from a longer distance to
the<00:02:23.470> goal<00:02:23.680> if<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.340> use<00:02:24.520> fast<00:02:24.880> players<00:02:25.420> like

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
the goal if you use fast players like

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.650 
the goal if you use fast players like
Bale<00:02:26.440> like<00:02:26.830> Ronaldo<00:02:27.250> they<00:02:27.970> are<00:02:28.030> almost

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
Bale like Ronaldo they are almost

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.170 
Bale like Ronaldo they are almost
unstoppable<00:02:29.020> at<00:02:29.770> performing<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.700> movement

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
unstoppable at performing the movement

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.540 
unstoppable at performing the movement
because<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.810> their<00:02:32.290> speed<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.520> can

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
because of their speed and you can

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.510 
because of their speed and you can
easily<00:02:34.180> outrun<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.840> co<00:02:35.050> defense<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.740> then<00:02:36.280> to

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
easily outrun the co defense and then to

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.180 
easily outrun the co defense and then to
put<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.820> ball<00:02:37.120> in<00:02:37.150> but<00:02:37.960> even<00:02:38.560> if<00:02:38.710> you<00:02:38.830> use<00:02:39.010> a

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
put the ball in but even if you use a

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.550 
put the ball in but even if you use a
slower<00:02:39.550> player<00:02:39.940> like<00:02:40.300> Fernando<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:41.140> movement

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
slower player like Fernando the movement

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.860 
slower player like Fernando the movement
can<00:02:42.010> be<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.250> real<00:02:42.520> nightmare<00:02:42.850> for<00:02:43.720> the
