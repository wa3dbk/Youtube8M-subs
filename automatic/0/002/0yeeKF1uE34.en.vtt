recently finding out about the whole

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.900 
recently finding out about the whole
like<00:04:48.210> you<00:04:48.690> know<00:04:49.470> Power<00:04:49.830> Rangers<00:04:50.250> parody<00:04:50.729> and

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
like you know Power Rangers parody and

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.000 
like you know Power Rangers parody and
the<00:04:51.419> Simon<00:04:51.780> Cowell<00:04:51.960> thing<00:04:52.350> I'm<00:04:52.500> not<00:04:52.650> sure<00:04:52.889> I've

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
the Simon Cowell thing I'm not sure I've

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.469
