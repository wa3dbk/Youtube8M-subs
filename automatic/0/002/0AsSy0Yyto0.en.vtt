00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
a rifle mic and or you can use this XLR

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.030 
a rifle mic and or you can use this XLR
microphone<00:00:13.019> that<00:00:13.170> comes<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.620> camera<00:00:13.889> if

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
microphone that comes with the camera if

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.589 
microphone that comes with the camera if
you<00:00:14.160> wish<00:00:14.429> but<00:00:14.790> one<00:00:15.000> from<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.269> lone<00:00:15.389> shot

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
you wish but one from the lone shot

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.080 
you wish but one from the lone shot
would<00:00:15.719> be<00:00:15.750> much<00:00:16.170> better<00:00:16.199> sound<00:00:16.650> quality<00:00:17.090> okay

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
would be much better sound quality okay

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.210 
would be much better sound quality okay
so<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.390> connects<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.900> camera<00:00:19.230> via<00:00:19.410> an<00:00:19.710> XLR

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
so it connects to the camera via an XLR

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.089 
so it connects to the camera via an XLR
cable<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.939> 3<00:00:21.900> pin<00:00:22.109> XLR<00:00:22.460> cable<00:00:23.460> okay<00:00:24.710> which<00:00:25.710> can

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
cable a 3 pin XLR cable okay which can

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.359 
cable a 3 pin XLR cable okay which can
connect<00:00:26.640> into<00:00:27.150> input<00:00:27.779> one<00:00:28.109> here<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.980> can<00:00:29.189> put

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
connect into input one here you can put

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.130 
connect into input one here you can put
two<00:00:29.519> microphones<00:00:30.060> into<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.480> camera<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.080> if

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
two microphones into this camera so if

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.110 
two microphones into this camera so if

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
you have a second microphone you would

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.240 
you have a second microphone you would
just<00:00:33.270> plug<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.600> into<00:00:33.809> input<00:00:34.469> 2<00:00:34.739> which<00:00:35.040> is

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
just plug that into input 2 which is

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.270 
just plug that into input 2 which is
here<00:00:36.200> okay<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.500> if<00:00:37.649> you're<00:00:37.770> interviewing<00:00:38.040> two

microphone<00:01:09.420> which<00:01:10.140> can<00:01:10.350> be<00:01:10.439> found<00:01:10.619> at<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
microphone which can be found at the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.270 
microphone which can be found at the
front<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> camera<00:01:11.939> above<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:13.100> above<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
front of the camera above the above the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.120 
front of the camera above the above the
lens<00:01:14.520> which<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.000> here<00:01:15.560> this<00:01:16.560> microphone<00:01:16.979> is

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
lens which is here this microphone is

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.440 
lens which is here this microphone is
not<00:01:17.369> particularly<00:01:17.820> good<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.299> would

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
not particularly good so I would

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.499 
not particularly good so I would
recommend<00:01:18.869> not<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.110> use<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.560> one<00:01:20.270> okay<00:01:21.270> or

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
recommend not to use in that one okay or

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.770 
recommend not to use in that one okay or
you<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.619> move<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.159> switch<00:01:23.400> down<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.570> where

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
you can move this switch down to where

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.020 
you can move this switch down to where
it<00:01:24.930> says<00:01:24.960> input<00:01:25.710> one<00:01:26.009> okay<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.880> means

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
it says input one okay so that means

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.940 
it says input one okay so that means
that<00:01:27.330> channel<00:01:27.689> one<00:01:27.900> anything<00:01:28.470> coming<00:01:28.740> into

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
that channel one anything coming into

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.620 
that channel one anything coming into
your<00:01:29.100> left<00:01:29.369> channel<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.939> going<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.450> come

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
your left channel is going to come

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.810 
your left channel is going to come
through<00:01:30.900> from<00:01:31.140> input<00:01:31.680> one<00:01:31.890> which<00:01:32.189> was<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.520> this

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
through from input one which was on this

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.340 
through from input one which was on this
side<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.240> camera<00:01:33.450> underneath<00:01:34.110> where<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
side of the camera underneath where the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.600 
side of the camera underneath where the
microphone<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.090> okay<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:37.200> then<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:38.220> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
microphone is okay you then have a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.520 
microphone is okay you then have a
switch<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> right<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.229> switch

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530

which is for your audio level control
you<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.820> either<00:01:44.909> set<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.450> set<00:01:45.689> back<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.110> auto

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
you can either set that set back to auto

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.830 
you can either set that set back to auto
which<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.820> camera<00:01:48.060> will<00:01:48.180> automatically

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
which the camera will automatically

which the camera will automatically
control<00:01:49.079> your<00:01:49.409> levels<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.130> which<00:01:50.369> means

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
control your levels for you which means

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.060 
control your levels for you which means
when<00:01:51.390> something<00:01:51.720> gets<00:01:51.960> really<00:01:52.409> loud<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.920> may

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
when something gets really loud it may

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.499 
when something gets really loud it may
take<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> second<00:01:53.700> or<00:01:53.790> two<00:01:53.820> for<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.240> make<00:01:54.329> it

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
take a second or two for it to make it

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.940 
take a second or two for it to make it
quieter<00:01:54.960> or<00:01:55.110> something<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:55.500> really<00:01:55.710> quiet

quieter or something it's really quiet
may<00:01:56.520> take<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> second<00:01:57.149> or<00:01:57.240> two<00:01:57.270> for<00:01:57.390> make<00:01:57.689> it

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
may take a second or two for make it

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.810 
may take a second or two for make it
louder<00:01:58.079> if<00:01:58.409> you're<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.310> quiet<00:01:59.610> environment

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
louder if you're in a quiet environment

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.840 
louder if you're in a quiet environment
it<00:02:00.509> may<00:02:00.750> also<00:02:00.930> try<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.439> boost<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.890> sound<00:02:02.340> so

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
it may also try and boost that sound so

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.429 
it may also try and boost that sound so
you<00:02:02.939> may<00:02:03.090> end<00:02:03.270> up<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.479> quite<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.810> lot<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.229> loud

okay okay so just below that we've then
got<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.819> switch<00:02:42.090> for<00:02:42.690> our<00:02:43.500> channel<00:02:43.920> 2<00:02:44.070> which

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
got the switch for our channel 2 which

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.550 
got the switch for our channel 2 which
is<00:02:44.430> our<00:02:44.519> right<00:02:44.760> channel<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.209> on<00:02:46.019> this<00:02:46.260> switch

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
is our right channel and on this switch

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.410 
is our right channel and on this switch
to<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.950> left-hand<00:02:47.519> side<00:02:47.730> we<00:02:47.910> actually<00:02:47.940> now

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
to the left-hand side we actually now

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.530 
to the left-hand side we actually now
have<00:02:48.600> three<00:02:49.140> options<00:02:49.519> so<00:02:50.519> our<00:02:50.790> first<00:02:51.120> option

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
have three options so our first option

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.650 
have three options so our first option
is<00:02:51.930> for<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.890> come<00:02:53.100> from<00:02:53.130> this<00:02:54.000> internal

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
is for it to come from this internal

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.770 
is for it to come from this internal
microphone<00:02:55.170> okay<00:02:55.860> our<00:02:56.180> second<00:02:57.180> option<00:02:57.569> if<00:02:57.720> we

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
microphone okay our second option if we

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.530 
microphone okay our second option if we
flick<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.620> down<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:59.100> for<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.300> come<00:03:00.510> from

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
flick that down is for it to come from

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.009 
flick that down is for it to come from
input<00:03:01.380> 1<00:03:01.769> so<00:03:02.519> it<00:03:02.640> means<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:03.120> whatever<00:03:03.330> signal

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
input 1 so it means that whatever signal

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.870 
input 1 so it means that whatever signal
is<00:03:04.140> going<00:03:04.380> into<00:03:04.560> input<00:03:04.950> 1<00:03:05.190> will<00:03:05.430> be<00:03:05.550> split

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
is going into input 1 will be split

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.509 
is going into input 1 will be split
between<00:03:06.000> channels<00:03:06.569> 1<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.019> channels<00:03:07.590> 2<00:03:07.860> so<00:03:08.459> it

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
between channels 1 and channels 2 so it

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.100 
between channels 1 and channels 2 so it
will<00:03:08.550> go<00:03:08.730> both<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.090> our<00:03:09.209> left<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.989> our

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
will go both to our left and to our

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.570 
will go both to our left and to our
right<00:03:10.290> channels<00:03:10.680> that's<00:03:10.860> if<00:03:10.980> we've<00:03:11.100> got<00:03:11.250> one

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
right channels that's if we've got one

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.449 
right channels that's if we've got one
microphone<00:03:12.180> if<00:03:12.890> however<00:03:13.890> we<00:03:14.100> have<00:03:14.250> two

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
microphone if however we have two

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.789 
microphone if however we have two
microphones<00:03:14.730> plugged<00:03:15.360> in<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.720> whatever<00:03:16.620> is

microphones plugged in and whatever is

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.319 
microphones plugged in and whatever is
going<00:03:16.980> into<00:03:17.220> input<00:03:17.579> 2<00:03:17.760> we<00:03:17.910> want<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.180> come

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
going into input 2 we want to come

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.090 
going into input 2 we want to come
through<00:03:18.480> onto<00:03:18.690> our<00:03:18.810> right<00:03:19.019> channel<00:03:19.500> we<00:03:20.070> can

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
through onto our right channel we can

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.670 
through onto our right channel we can
flick<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:21.269> switch<00:03:21.630> down<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.170> where<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.650> says

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
flick that switch down to where it says

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.310 
flick that switch down to where it says
input<00:03:23.400> 2<00:03:23.700> at<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.720> moment<00:03:25.049> I<00:03:25.110> have<00:03:25.290> no

we<00:03:34.650> are<00:03:34.680> using<00:03:34.799> one<00:03:35.220> microphone<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:36.329> this

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
we are using one microphone so this

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.220 
we are using one microphone so this
switch<00:03:36.900> I<00:03:37.170> am<00:03:37.350> going<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.650> flick<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.850> input<00:03:39.630> 1

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
switch I am going to flick to input 1

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.220 
switch I am going to flick to input 1
which<00:03:41.070> means<00:03:41.280> my<00:03:41.850> input<00:03:42.390> 1<00:03:42.510> signal<00:03:42.780> is<00:03:43.049> being

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
which means my input 1 signal is being

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.729 
which means my input 1 signal is being
split<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.890> left<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.670> right<00:03:45.350> okay<00:03:46.380> again<00:03:46.709> I

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
split to left and to right okay again I

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.099 
split to left and to right okay again I
have<00:03:46.980> my<00:03:47.010> switch<00:03:47.489> that<00:03:48.000> says<00:03:48.239> auto<00:03:48.600> or<00:03:49.079> manual

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
have my switch that says auto or manual

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.830 
have my switch that says auto or manual
this<00:03:50.100> needs<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.489> be<00:03:50.579> a<00:03:50.609> manual<00:03:51.060> mode<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.720> again

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
this needs to be a manual mode and again

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.099 
this needs to be a manual mode and again
I<00:03:52.140> can<00:03:52.470> turn<00:03:52.680> this<00:03:52.920> dial<00:03:53.160> down<00:03:53.660> so<00:03:54.660> what<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:54.840> need

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
I can turn this dial down so what I need

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.920 
I can turn this dial down so what I need
to<00:03:55.260> do<00:03:55.440> is<00:03:55.730> to<00:03:56.730> make<00:03:56.910> sure<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.329> my<00:03:57.510> audio

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
to do is to make sure that my audio

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.460 
to do is to make sure that my audio
levels<00:03:58.320> over<00:03:59.070> a<00:03:59.190> correct<00:03:59.750> level<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:01.290> what<00:04:01.440> I

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
levels over a correct level so what I

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.340 
levels over a correct level so what I
need<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.859> do<00:04:02.040> is<00:04:02.310> press<00:04:03.239> this<00:04:03.420> button<00:04:03.690> at<00:04:04.200> the

check if I press this button on my

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.080 
check if I press this button on my
screen<00:04:09.570> I<00:04:09.840> will<00:04:10.440> see<00:04:10.980> my<00:04:11.160> audio<00:04:11.489> levels<00:04:11.880> in

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
screen I will see my audio levels in

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.039 
screen I will see my audio levels in
clearer<00:04:12.660> detail<00:04:13.579> so<00:04:14.579> at<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.090> moment<00:04:15.269> I<00:04:15.660> need

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
clearer detail so at the moment I need

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.250 
clearer detail so at the moment I need
to<00:04:16.200> have<00:04:16.440> my<00:04:16.769> levels<00:04:17.190> as<00:04:17.370> I'm<00:04:17.640> talking<00:04:18.260> into

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
to have my levels as I'm talking into

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.930 
to have my levels as I'm talking into
the<00:04:19.530> microphone<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:20.190> levels<00:04:20.489> need<00:04:20.729> to<00:04:20.820> be

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
the microphone the levels need to be

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.240 
the microphone the levels need to be
around<00:04:21.180> about<00:04:21.450> where<00:04:21.690> it<00:04:21.870> says<00:04:22.159> 22

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
around about where it says 22

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.190 
around about where it says 22
a correct<00:04:23.700> signal<00:04:24.120> anything<00:04:24.600> above<00:04:24.990> that

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
a correct signal anything above that

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.140 
a correct signal anything above that
will<00:04:25.380> start<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:25.770> distort<00:04:26.130> anything<00:04:26.910> below

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
will start to distort anything below

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.450 
will start to distort anything below
that<00:04:27.180> will<00:04:27.480> be<00:04:27.600> slightly<00:04:27.870> too<00:04:28.110> quiet<00:04:28.250> so<00:04:29.250> I'm

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
that will be slightly too quiet so I'm

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.610 
that will be slightly too quiet so I'm
going<00:04:29.640> to<00:04:29.700> turn<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.120> dials<00:04:30.480> on<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:31.230> side<00:04:31.440> of

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
going to turn the dials on the side of

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.550 
going to turn the dials on the side of
the<00:04:31.710> camera<00:04:32.130> until<00:04:32.340> I<00:04:33.060> get<00:04:33.450> a<00:04:33.480> correct<00:04:34.020> sound

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
the camera until I get a correct sound

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.280 
the camera until I get a correct sound
level<00:04:34.980> okay<00:04:35.520> so<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:36.360> may<00:04:36.540> get<00:04:36.690> your<00:04:36.780> subject

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
level okay so you may get your subject

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.470 
level okay so you may get your subject
to<00:04:37.530> say<00:04:37.800> one<00:04:38.070> two<00:04:38.100> one<00:04:38.610> two<00:04:38.640> or<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.240> speak

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
to say one two one two or to speak

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.150 
to say one two one two or to speak
through<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.720> alphabet<00:04:40.200> or<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.800> read<00:04:40.980> the

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
through the alphabet or to read the

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.620 
through the alphabet or to read the
first<00:04:41.370> line<00:04:41.610> of<00:04:41.670> their<00:04:42.000> script<00:04:42.390> or<00:04:42.600> something

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
first line of their script or something

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.590 
first line of their script or something
just<00:04:43.170> so<00:04:43.260> that<00:04:43.410> you<00:04:43.500> can<00:04:43.590> get<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:43.800> sound<00:04:44.010> check

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
just so that you can get a sound check

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.750 
just so that you can get a sound check
okay<00:04:45.600> if<00:04:46.440> after<00:04:46.980> you've<00:04:47.130> done<00:04:47.280> this<00:04:47.490> you're

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
okay if after you've done this you're

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.700 
okay if after you've done this you're
still<00:04:48.090> getting<00:04:48.330> no<00:04:48.750> levels<00:04:49.140> coming<00:04:49.500> through

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
still getting no levels coming through

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.490 
still getting no levels coming through
and<00:04:50.060> it<00:04:51.060> may<00:04:51.210> be<00:04:51.270> because<00:04:51.540> you're<00:04:51.840> using<00:04:52.080> the

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
and it may be because you're using the

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.250 
and it may be because you're using the
wrong<00:04:52.830> input<00:04:53.400> type<00:04:53.580> on<00:04:53.790> the<00:04:53.880> camera<00:04:54.270> so<00:04:54.900> just

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
wrong input type on the camera so just

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.680 
wrong input type on the camera so just
behind<00:04:55.650> where<00:04:56.040> the<00:04:56.460> microphone<00:04:57.090> sits<00:04:57.390> you've

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
behind where the microphone sits you've

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.950 
behind where the microphone sits you've
got<00:04:57.840> another<00:04:58.169> plastic<00:04:59.090> lid<00:05:00.090> here<00:05:00.419> which<00:05:00.780> you

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
got another plastic lid here which you

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.020 
got another plastic lid here which you
can<00:05:01.140> lift<00:05:01.320> up<00:05:01.500> we<00:05:01.830> have<00:05:02.040> a<00:05:02.070> switch<00:05:02.490> for<00:05:02.669> input

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
can lift up we have a switch for input

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.510 
can lift up we have a switch for input
one<00:05:03.210> and<00:05:03.450> a<00:05:03.600> switch<00:05:03.900> for<00:05:04.080> input<00:05:04.470> two<00:05:04.710> for<00:05:05.370> each

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
one and a switch for input two for each

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.120 
one and a switch for input two for each
switch<00:05:05.940> we<00:05:06.240> have<00:05:06.270> three<00:05:06.870> options<00:05:07.050> it<00:05:07.890> can

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
switch we have three options it can

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.850 
switch we have three options it can
either<00:05:08.280> be<00:05:08.460> a<00:05:08.730> line<00:05:09.120> level<00:05:09.540> input<00:05:10.110> which

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
either be a line level input which

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.740 
either be a line level input which
generally<00:05:11.400> would<00:05:11.550> be<00:05:11.700> something<00:05:12.180> from<00:05:12.480> say<00:05:12.720> a

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
generally would be something from say a

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.990 
generally would be something from say a
sound<00:05:13.140> desk<00:05:13.500> or<00:05:13.710> something<00:05:14.100> and<00:05:14.280> so<00:05:14.880> you're

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
sound desk or something and so you're

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.670 
sound desk or something and so you're
taking<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.390> direct<00:05:15.720> direct<00:05:16.110> feed<00:05:16.350> from<00:05:16.380> a

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
taking the direct direct feed from a

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.730 
taking the direct direct feed from a
sound<00:05:16.919> desk<00:05:17.190> and<00:05:17.480> your<00:05:18.480> next<00:05:18.750> option<00:05:19.050> down<00:05:19.260> is

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
sound desk and your next option down is

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.550 
sound desk and your next option down is
where<00:05:20.040> it<00:05:20.160> says<00:05:20.400> mic<00:05:20.790> and<00:05:21.120> your<00:05:22.020> third<00:05:22.320> option

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
where it says mic and your third option

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.720 
where it says mic and your third option
down<00:05:22.919> is<00:05:23.160> where<00:05:23.340> it<00:05:23.430> says<00:05:23.580> mic<00:05:23.970> plus<00:05:24.690> 48<00:05:25.230> V<00:05:25.730> plus

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
down is where it says mic plus 48 V plus

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.540 
down is where it says mic plus 48 V plus
48<00:05:27.210> V<00:05:27.360> stands<00:05:27.720> for<00:05:27.840> phantom<00:05:28.440> power<00:05:28.710> most

to<00:05:55.350> mic<00:05:55.800> okay<00:05:56.700> bear<00:05:57.479> in<00:05:57.660> mind<00:05:57.840> when<00:05:58.110> you're

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
to mic okay bear in mind when you're

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.469 
to mic okay bear in mind when you're
using<00:05:58.470> phantom<00:05:58.830> power<00:05:59.220> it<00:05:59.760> will<00:06:00.000> take<00:06:00.270> more

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
using phantom power it will take more

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.600 
using phantom power it will take more
battery<00:06:00.900> power<00:06:00.930> and<00:06:01.380> so<00:06:02.040> your<00:06:02.160> battery<00:06:02.310> may

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
battery power and so your battery may

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.010 
battery power and so your battery may
drain<00:06:02.850> slightly<00:06:03.330> quicker<00:06:03.479> than<00:06:03.750> what<00:06:03.870> it

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
drain slightly quicker than what it

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.500 
drain slightly quicker than what it
would<00:06:04.140> without<00:06:05.130> using<00:06:05.520> 48<00:06:05.940> power<00:06:06.150> 48<00:06:06.780> V<00:06:08.510> okay

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
would without using 48 power 48 V okay

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.690 
would without using 48 power 48 V okay
and<00:06:09.720> the<00:06:10.229> same<00:06:10.410> would<00:06:10.620> be<00:06:10.770> for<00:06:11.010> input<00:06:11.310> two<00:06:11.460> so

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
and the same would be for input two so

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.980 
and the same would be for input two so
depending<00:06:12.150> on<00:06:12.210> what<00:06:12.390> you're<00:06:12.540> putting<00:06:12.720> in

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
depending on what you're putting in

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.930 
depending on what you're putting in
whether<00:06:13.169> it's<00:06:13.380> a<00:06:13.470> line<00:06:13.650> level<00:06:13.860> input<00:06:14.310> whether

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
whether it's a line level input whether

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.280 
whether it's a line level input whether
it's<00:06:15.120> a<00:06:15.210> microphone<00:06:15.570> that<00:06:15.690> doesn't<00:06:16.110> require

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
it's a microphone that doesn't require

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.200 
it's a microphone that doesn't require
power<00:06:16.680> or<00:06:17.040> a<00:06:17.100> microphone<00:06:17.640> that<00:06:17.729> does<00:06:18.030> require

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
power or a microphone that does require

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.600 
power or a microphone that does require
power<00:06:18.660> okay<00:06:19.260> as<00:06:19.470> we're<00:06:19.650> only<00:06:19.800> using<00:06:20.010> one<00:06:20.400> I

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
power okay as we're only using one I

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.659 
power okay as we're only using one I
only<00:06:20.790> need<00:06:21.030> to<00:06:21.120> change<00:06:21.300> this<00:06:21.570> for<00:06:21.750> input<00:06:22.080> one

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669 
only need to change this for input one

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:25.880 
only need to change this for input one
okay<00:06:23.669> so<00:06:24.330> looking<00:06:24.780> at<00:06:24.900> our<00:06:25.050> screen<00:06:25.410> now<00:06:25.620> it's

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
okay so looking at our screen now it's

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.190 
okay so looking at our screen now it's
telling<00:06:26.340> me<00:06:26.370> that<00:06:26.490> input<00:06:26.790> one<00:06:27.270> is<00:06:27.450> go<00:06:28.050> into

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
telling me that input one is go into

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.330 
telling me that input one is go into
channel<00:06:28.830> 1<00:06:28.860> and<00:06:29.360> 2<00:06:30.360> channel<00:06:30.840> 2<00:06:31.020> if<00:06:31.260> I<00:06:31.860> had<00:06:32.070> two

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
channel 1 and 2 channel 2 if I had two

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.070 
channel 1 and 2 channel 2 if I had two
microphones<00:06:32.940> in<00:06:33.030> there<00:06:33.330> it<00:06:33.510> would<00:06:33.630> say<00:06:33.840> input

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
microphones in there it would say input

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.810 
microphones in there it would say input
1<00:06:34.470> input<00:06:34.710> 2

I can just press this button again and
it<00:06:57.060> will<00:06:57.120> take<00:06:57.300> me<00:06:57.390> back<00:06:57.420> to<00:06:57.630> my<00:06:57.690> main<00:06:57.930> screen

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 
it will take me back to my main screen

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.280 
it will take me back to my main screen
the<00:06:58.920> bottom<00:06:59.250> right<00:06:59.490> hand<00:06:59.670> corner<00:06:59.820> I<00:07:00.390> can<00:07:00.990> still

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.290 
the bottom right hand corner I can still

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.620 
the bottom right hand corner I can still
see<00:07:01.560> my<00:07:01.890> audio<00:07:02.280> levels<00:07:02.640> and<00:07:02.880> I<00:07:03.240> have<00:07:03.360> a<00:07:03.390> rough

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:03.630 
see my audio levels and I have a rough

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.130 
see my audio levels and I have a rough
idea<00:07:04.020> of<00:07:04.230> where<00:07:04.710> those<00:07:04.920> levels<00:07:05.280> need<00:07:05.520> to<00:07:05.550> be<00:07:05.640> at

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:06.140 
idea of where those levels need to be at

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.720 
idea of where those levels need to be at
so<00:07:07.140> when<00:07:07.290> you're<00:07:07.440> using<00:07:07.620> audio<00:07:08.010> on<00:07:08.280> these<00:07:08.490> at

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:08.730 
so when you're using audio on these at

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.970 
so when you're using audio on these at
five<00:07:08.940> cameras<00:07:09.390> and<00:07:09.690> you<00:07:10.200> will<00:07:10.470> need<00:07:10.620> to<00:07:10.680> have<00:07:10.950> a

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:10.980 
five cameras and you will need to have a

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.740 
five cameras and you will need to have a
set<00:07:11.250> of<00:07:11.280> headphones<00:07:11.550> so<00:07:11.970> that<00:07:12.120> you<00:07:12.240> can<00:07:12.390> hear

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:12.750 
set of headphones so that you can hear

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.200
