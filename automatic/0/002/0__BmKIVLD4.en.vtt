00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
I just wanted to do a little video

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.669 
I just wanted to do a little video
explaining<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.490> new<00:00:29.670> lap<00:00:29.939> counter<00:00:30.470> he<00:00:31.470> has<00:00:31.650> a

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
explaining the new lap counter he has a

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.799 
explaining the new lap counter he has a
lap<00:00:31.949> counter<00:00:32.309> mounted<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.090> we'll<00:00:33.630> do<00:00:33.780> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
lap counter mounted here so we'll do a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.240 
lap counter mounted here so we'll do a
little<00:00:33.989> video<00:00:34.170> explaining<00:00:34.710> how<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.920> program

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
little video explaining how to program

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.530 
little video explaining how to program
we<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.489> new<00:00:35.670> lap<00:00:35.880> counter<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.360> works

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
we have a new lap counter that works

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.729 
we have a new lap counter that works
with<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.559> control<00:00:37.980> unit

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
with the control unit

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.950 
with the control unit
okay<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.890> lap<00:00:41.070> counter<00:00:41.460> programs<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.719> same

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
okay the lap counter programs the same

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.229 
okay the lap counter programs the same
way<00:00:43.170> as<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> previous<00:00:43.620> lap<00:00:44.070> counter<00:00:44.460> what<00:00:45.120> you

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
way as the previous lap counter what you

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.700 
way as the previous lap counter what you
do<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.510> use<00:00:45.809> first<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.590> select<00:00:46.980> if<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.309> want<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
do is use first you select if you want a

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.020 
do is use first you select if you want a
lap<00:00:49.710> race<00:00:49.980> or<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> timed<00:00:50.550> race

SLO<00:01:57.479> it's<00:01:57.780> abbreviated<00:01:58.439> there<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.670> have<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
SLO it's abbreviated there you have the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.120 
SLO it's abbreviated there you have the
the<00:02:01.259> other<00:02:01.409> option<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:03.540> racers<00:02:04.200> drive

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
the other option is the racers drive

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.280 
the other option is the racers drive
around<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.520> track<00:02:05.759> once<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.540> leader<00:02:06.810> crosses

around the track once the leader crosses
the<00:02:07.380> line<00:02:07.590> everybody<00:02:08.129> gets<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.489> finish<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
the line everybody gets the finish the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.180 
the line everybody gets the finish the
laps<00:02:09.179> their<00:02:09.929> total<00:02:10.349> number<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.619> laps<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.129> if

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
laps their total number of laps so if

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.850 
laps their total number of laps so if
it's<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.400> 10-lap<00:02:11.790> race<00:02:11.819> then<00:02:12.690> every<00:02:13.260> racer<00:02:13.620> will

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
it's a 10-lap race then every racer will

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.080 
it's a 10-lap race then every racer will
