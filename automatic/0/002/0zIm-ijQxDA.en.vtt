00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
end results obviously this is of course

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.399 
end results obviously this is of course
reinforcing<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> basic<00:01:50.880> motor<00:01:51.090> skills<00:01:51.409> which

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
reinforcing a basic motor skills which

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
development the idea behind these

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.590 
development the idea behind these
applications<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.119> actually<00:01:57.420> kind<00:01:57.570> of

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
applications to is actually kind of

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.280 
applications to is actually kind of
unique<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.140> sense<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:59.780> the<00:02:00.780> application

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
unique in the sense that the application

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.530 
unique in the sense that the application
very<00:02:01.710> much<00:02:01.890> wants<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.430> reinforce<00:02:03.149> your

child's ability to actually nav

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.910 
child's ability to actually nav
iPad<00:02:06.040> or<00:02:06.220> an<00:02:06.400> iPhone<00:02:07.200> that's<00:02:08.200> obviously<00:02:08.740> the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
iPad or an iPhone that's obviously the

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.779 
iPad or an iPhone that's obviously the
objective<00:02:09.310> with<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.429> lot<00:02:09.670> of<00:02:09.700> different

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
objective with a lot of different

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.640 
objective with a lot of different
children's<00:02:10.390> applications<00:02:10.929> but<00:02:11.080> sliced<00:02:11.350> and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
children's applications but sliced and

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.560 
children's applications but sliced and
sort<00:02:12.310> of<00:02:12.370> refreshing<00:02:12.640> actually<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.330> have<00:02:13.450> it

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
sort of refreshing actually to have it

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.510 
sort of refreshing actually to have it
set<00:02:13.780> out<00:02:13.810> loud<00:02:14.490> within<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.640> app<00:02:16.650> let<00:02:17.650> me<00:02:17.770> flip

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
set out loud within the app let me flip

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.070 
set out loud within the app let me flip
those<00:02:18.700> around<00:02:18.880> obviously<00:02:19.360> you<00:02:19.450> can<00:02:19.600> tap<00:02:19.810> to

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
those around obviously you can tap to

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.100 
those around obviously you can tap to
actually<00:02:20.730> rotate<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.880> pieces<00:02:22.270> but<00:02:22.900> as<00:02:23.020> I<00:02:23.080> was

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
actually rotate the pieces but as I was

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.570 
actually rotate the pieces but as I was
saying<00:02:23.410> it's<00:02:23.560> nice<00:02:23.740> to<00:02:23.890> have<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.190> out<00:02:24.370> as<00:02:24.550> a

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
saying it's nice to have that out as a

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.630 
saying it's nice to have that out as a
stated<00:02:25.000> goal<00:02:25.320> simply<00:02:26.320> because<00:02:26.470> we<00:02:27.310> don't<00:02:27.490> see

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
stated goal simply because we don't see

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.050 
stated goal simply because we don't see
too<00:02:27.850> much<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:29.340> but<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.490> a<00:02:30.520> valid<00:02:30.820> point

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
too much of that but it is a valid point

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.280 
too much of that but it is a valid point
obviously<00:02:31.270> your<00:02:31.630> child<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:31.990> going<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.200> be

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
obviously your child is going to be

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.630 
obviously your child is going to be
using<00:02:32.410> devices<00:02:32.620> like<00:02:33.040> this<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.370> rest<00:02:33.459> of

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
using devices like this the rest of

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.910 
using devices like this the rest of
their<00:02:33.760> life<00:02:34.200> therefore<00:02:35.200> it's<00:02:35.380> actually<00:02:35.740> quite

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
their life therefore it's actually quite

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.090 
their life therefore it's actually quite
nice<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.880> quite<00:02:37.060> useful<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:38.470> have<00:02:38.650> all<00:02:38.950> of

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.660 
nice and quite useful to have all of
that<00:02:39.330> up<00:02:40.330> on<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.570> front<00:02:40.900> end<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:42.280> obviously

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
that up on the front end so obviously

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.460

in all we really like the graphics of
the<00:03:14.140> application<00:03:14.620> is<00:03:14.709> not<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.100> most<00:03:15.370> visually

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
the application is not the most visually

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.870 
the application is not the most visually
stunning<00:03:16.540> of<00:03:17.430> children's<00:03:18.430> apps<00:03:18.610> that<00:03:18.760> we've

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
stunning of children's apps that we've

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.449

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
ever seen in terms of like I guess we're

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.560 
ever seen in terms of like I guess we're
sort<00:03:21.640> of<00:03:21.670> spoiled<00:03:22.060> we've<00:03:22.180> seen<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.390> lot<00:03:22.540> of
