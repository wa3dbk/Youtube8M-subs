opinions on the trueskill matchmaking

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.380 
opinions on the trueskill matchmaking
itself<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:12.600> let's<00:01:12.810> get<00:01:12.930> into<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:14.210> from<00:01:15.210> what<00:01:15.360> I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
itself so let's get into it from what I

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.359 
itself so let's get into it from what I
believe<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.229> true<00:01:16.409> skill<00:01:16.650> matchmaking<00:01:17.100> is

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
believe the true skill matchmaking is

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.149 
believe the true skill matchmaking is
going<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.880> either<00:01:18.090> win<00:01:18.600> loss<00:01:18.920> because<00:01:19.920> they're

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
going on either win loss because they're

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.130 
going on either win loss because they're
trying<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.460> put<00:01:20.610> up<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.909> know<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.240> competitive

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.260 
game and you know that means that
chances<00:01:47.250> are<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.670> know<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.820> could<00:01:48.149> be

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
chances are you know you could be

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.780 
chances are you know you could be
running<00:01:48.570> into<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.140> know<00:01:49.310> parties<00:01:50.310> or<00:01:50.520> even

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
running into you know parties or even

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.080 
running into you know parties or even
full<00:01:51.030> parties<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.689> black<00:01:52.020> ops<00:01:52.229> 2<00:01:52.820> so<00:01:53.820> i'm<00:01:53.909> not

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
full parties in black ops 2 so i'm not

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.270 
full parties in black ops 2 so i'm not
sure<00:01:54.360> if<00:01:54.509> they're<00:01:54.630> gonna<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:54.869> basing<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.409> upon

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
sure if they're gonna be basing on upon

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.249 
sure if they're gonna be basing on upon
either<00:01:56.549> win<00:01:56.850> loss<00:01:57.090> which<00:01:57.509> i<00:01:57.780> think<00:01:57.990> would

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
either win loss which i think would

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.660 
either win loss which i think would
probably<00:01:58.619> be<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.130> know<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.369> best<00:01:59.549> way

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
probably be like you know the best way

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.280 
probably be like you know the best way
to<00:01:59.790> base<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.240> if<00:02:00.360> they<00:02:00.540> want<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:01.170> know

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
to base it if they want you know

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.889 
to base it if they want you know
competitive<00:02:01.829> katie's<00:02:02.729> also<00:02:03.119> an<00:02:03.180> option<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.659> so

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
competitive katie's also an option is so

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.050 
competitive katie's also an option is so
score<00:02:04.320> permanent<00:02:04.770> because<00:02:04.829> i'm<00:02:05.460> guessing

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
score permanent because i'm guessing

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.219 
score permanent because i'm guessing
since<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.390> black<00:02:06.630> ops<00:02:06.869> they'll<00:02:07.049> be<00:02:07.110> bringing

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
since it's black ops they'll be bringing

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.320 
since it's black ops they'll be bringing
them<00:02:07.439> back<00:02:07.560> score<00:02:07.920> per<00:02:08.069> minute<00:02:08.340> I'm<00:02:08.940> not<00:02:09.149> sure

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
them back score per minute I'm not sure

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.480 
them back score per minute I'm not sure
how<00:02:09.599> they're<00:02:09.810> going<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:09.959> factor<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.649> but<00:02:10.979> uh

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
how they're going to factor it in but uh

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.490 
how they're going to factor it in but uh
I'm<00:02:12.000> not<00:02:12.210> quite<00:02:12.420> sure<00:02:12.450> but<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.110> guess<00:02:13.380> we'll

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
I'm not quite sure but I guess we'll

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.990 
I'm not quite sure but I guess we'll
have<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.710> find<00:02:13.980> out<00:02:14.130> I'm<00:02:14.310> assuming<00:02:14.790> I'll<00:02:14.880> be

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
have to find out I'm assuming I'll be

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.610 
have to find out I'm assuming I'll be
win<00:02:15.180> loss<00:02:15.420> though<00:02:15.720> just<00:02:16.050> because<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.410> think

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
win loss though just because I think

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.100 
win loss though just because I think
that's<00:02:16.950> kind<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.250> what<00:02:17.400> shows<00:02:17.640> more<00:02:18.000> not<00:02:18.660> skill

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
that's kind of what shows more not skill

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.600 
that's kind of what shows more not skill
per<00:02:19.320> se<00:02:19.530> but<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.860> know<00:02:19.950> you'll<00:02:20.160> find<00:02:20.430> more

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
per se but you know you'll find more

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.820 
per se but you know you'll find more
competitive<00:02:21.180> in<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.660> uh<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:22.220> ratio<00:02:24.830> the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
competitive in that uh that ratio the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.220 
competitive in that uh that ratio the
one<00:02:26.040> problem<00:02:26.340> i<00:02:26.760> kind<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.030> have<00:02:27.240> with<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:28.020> is

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
one problem i kind of have with this is

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.530 
one problem i kind of have with this is
that<00:02:28.320> i<00:02:28.800> have<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.100> feeling<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:29.550> if<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.330> is

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
that i have a feeling that if it is

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.120 
that i have a feeling that if it is
going<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.780> be<00:02:30.810> true<00:02:31.110> skill<00:02:31.350> matchmaking<00:02:31.830> that

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
going to be true skill matchmaking that

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.570 
going to be true skill matchmaking that
every<00:02:33.000> game<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:34.050> gonna<00:02:34.230> be<00:02:34.440> like<00:02:34.680> try<00:02:35.130> harding

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
matchmaking is quite gonna work but I've

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.070 
matchmaking is quite gonna work but I've
also<00:05:03.040> heard<00:05:03.280> that<00:05:03.340> it<00:05:03.760> is<00:05:04.180> only<00:05:04.390> a<00:05:04.510> playlist

also heard that it is only a playlist
that<00:05:05.380> is<00:05:05.500> true<00:05:05.710> skill<00:05:05.920> matchmaking<00:05:06.340> and<00:05:07.140> if

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
that is true skill matchmaking and if

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.720 
that is true skill matchmaking and if
that's<00:05:08.440> but<00:05:08.920> sounds<00:05:09.190> something<00:05:09.430> that's

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
that's but sounds something that's

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.490 
that's but sounds something that's
believable<00:05:10.120> and<00:05:10.540> I<00:05:10.840> think<00:05:11.140> people<00:05:11.290> are

believable and I think people are

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.780 
believable and I think people are

this if it wasn't just the one playlist
you<00:06:06.040> know<00:06:06.160> it<00:06:06.490> would<00:06:06.790> become<00:06:07.180> annoying<00:06:07.540> after

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840
