get started on the the same part I left
off<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.620> other<00:00:10.650> main<00:00:10.980> riff<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.460> on<00:00:11.580> the

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
off and the other main riff and on the

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:22.340 
off and the other main riff and on the
second<00:00:11.969> bar<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.330> main<00:00:12.480> roof<00:00:18.800> and<00:00:21.350> windows

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
second bar of the main roof and windows

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.189 
second bar of the main roof and windows
sound<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.859> like<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.420> and<00:00:24.420> I'm<00:00:24.930> pretty<00:00:25.080> sure

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
sound is like that and I'm pretty sure

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.480 
sound is like that and I'm pretty sure
the<00:00:25.320> way<00:00:25.410> work<00:00:25.619> plays<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.720> which<00:00:27.720> means<00:00:27.750> uh

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
the way work plays it is which means uh

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.479 
the way work plays it is which means uh
yeah<00:00:29.490> hits<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.880> open<00:00:30.150> open<00:00:30.689> g<00:00:30.869> string<00:00:30.900> and

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
yeah hits the open open g string and

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:37.639 
yeah hits the open open g string and
slams<00:00:32.489> his<00:00:32.930> finger<00:00:33.930> down<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.469> e<00:00:36.440> like<00:00:37.440> that

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
slams his finger down on the e like that

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.400 
slams his finger down on the e like that
so<00:00:37.890> there's<00:00:38.070> no<00:00:38.129> picking<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.290> seems<00:00:40.290> as

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
so there's no picking of the seems as

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.549 
so there's no picking of the seems as
though<00:00:40.500> he<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:40.649> hits<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.010> open<00:00:41.129> G<00:00:41.930> and<00:00:42.930> then

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
though he just hits the open G and then

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.430 
though he just hits the open G and then
hammers<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:44.329> onto<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> E<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.230> fourth

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
hammers on onto the E and the fourth

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.880 
hammers on onto the E and the fourth
string<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.160> anyway<00:00:47.399> um<00:00:48.440> that's<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.590> riff<00:00:49.739> and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
string so anyway um that's that riff and

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.490 
string so anyway um that's that riff and
then<00:00:49.980> also<00:00:50.570> it<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> main<00:00:52.050> riff<00:00:52.260> there's

Warren throws in like the like the two

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:05.700 
Warren throws in like the like the two
open<00:00:58.370> strings<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.520> bottom<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.000> ago

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.310 

well<00:01:06.190> there<00:01:06.400> are<00:01:06.460> things<00:01:06.670> that<00:01:06.970> I<00:01:07.480> just<00:01:07.780> found

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
well there are things that I just found

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.930 
well there are things that I just found
out<00:01:08.500> recently<00:01:08.530> by<00:01:08.950> watching<00:01:09.400> actually<00:01:09.550> my

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
out recently by watching actually my

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.050 
out recently by watching actually my
first<00:01:10.330> video<00:01:10.480> is<00:01:10.810> that<00:01:10.990> I<00:01:11.200> think<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.820> can<00:01:12.940> play

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
first video is that I think you can play

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.220 
first video is that I think you can play
the<00:01:13.240> actual<00:01:13.840> riff<00:01:14.170> better<00:01:14.440> if<00:01:14.710> you<00:01:14.920> emphasize

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
the actual riff better if you emphasize

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:25.320 
the actual riff better if you emphasize
these<00:01:17.230> notes<00:01:17.500> so<00:01:17.650> I<00:01:17.860> was<00:01:18.190> kind<00:01:18.430> of<00:01:18.490> like<00:01:24.330> what

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
these notes so I was kind of like what

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.480 
these notes so I was kind of like what
else<00:01:25.450> is<00:01:25.600> there<00:01:25.780> art<00:01:26.020> so<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:26.560> then<00:01:26.680> there's

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
else is there art so and then there's

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.740 
else is there art so and then there's
this<00:01:27.640> one<00:01:28.470> which<00:01:29.470> is<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.820> that<00:01:33.970> goes<00:01:34.180> on<00:01:34.570> the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
this one which is so that goes on the

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.320 
this one which is so that goes on the
third<00:01:35.110> stroke<00:01:35.470> starting<00:01:36.190> at<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:37.090> sharp<00:01:39.330> so

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
third stroke starting at the a sharp so

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.810 
third stroke starting at the a sharp so
you<00:01:40.360> pretty<00:01:40.630> much<00:01:40.720> just<00:01:40.780> pull<00:01:41.320> it<00:01:41.410> off<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:42.640> the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
you pretty much just pull it off on the

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:54.080 
you pretty much just pull it off on the
third<00:01:43.060> fret

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.539

lead<00:02:55.359> back<00:02:55.540> into<00:02:55.780> every<00:02:55.959> bar<00:02:56.170> he'll<00:02:56.709> wanna

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
lead back into every bar he'll wanna

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.360 
lead back into every bar he'll wanna
kind<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.340> do<00:02:57.489> like

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.640 

which<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:06.030> think<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.540> can<00:03:06.570> either<00:03:06.870> do<00:03:07.080> as<00:03:07.260> this

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
which I think you can either do as this

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.320 
which I think you can either do as this
or<00:03:08.490> just<00:03:08.960> and<00:03:10.670> that's<00:03:11.670> pretty<00:03:11.940> much<00:03:12.060> once

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
or just and that's pretty much once

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.260 
or just and that's pretty much once
again<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.570> target<00:03:12.900> notice<00:03:13.250> and<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.940> can<00:03:15.180> even

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
again a target notice and you can even

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.870 
again a target notice and you can even
put<00:03:15.570> one<00:03:15.750> put<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.890> put<00:03:17.520> your<00:03:17.550> first<00:03:17.730> finger

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
put one put the put your first finger

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.080 
put one put the put your first finger
separated<00:03:18.810> by<00:03:18.950> one<00:03:19.950> fret<00:03:20.280> or<00:03:20.730> put<00:03:21.120> them<00:03:21.210> both

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
separated by one fret or put them both

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.300 
separated by one fret or put them both
whichever<00:03:24.090> sounds<00:03:24.330> good<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.890> anyway<00:03:25.890> so

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
whichever sounds good to you anyway so

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.220 
whichever sounds good to you anyway so
then<00:03:26.460> again<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:26.850> goes<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.180> chorus

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.869 

which<00:03:33.349> once<00:03:33.590> again<00:03:33.860> is<00:03:34.010> just<00:03:34.040> that<00:03:34.370> chord<00:03:34.670> with

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
which once again is just that chord with

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.400 
which once again is just that chord with
the<00:03:34.910> opening

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
the opening

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.190 
the opening
and<00:03:37.070> adding<00:03:37.400> on<00:03:37.520> the<00:03:37.640> D<00:03:37.820> yeah<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.840> second

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
and adding on the D yeah the second

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.809 
and adding on the D yeah the second
string<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:40.100> EHR<00:03:40.700> on<00:03:41.360> the<00:03:41.660> fourth<00:03:41.900> string

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.350 

and<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.540> pre-solar<00:03:46.079> park<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:46.790> like<00:03:47.790> this<00:03:48.030> and

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
and the pre-solar park is like this and

00:03:48.360 --> 00:04:04.940 
and the pre-solar park is like this and
I'm<00:03:48.569> pretty<00:03:48.599> sure<00:03:48.840> it<00:03:48.959> goes<00:03:49.109> in<00:03:49.319> to<00:03:49.349> be<00:04:03.950> anyway

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
I'm pretty sure it goes in to be anyway

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.729 
I'm pretty sure it goes in to be anyway
and<00:04:05.939> that<00:04:06.299> work<00:04:06.659> is<00:04:06.780> pretty<00:04:07.049> much<00:04:07.170> just<00:04:09.739> so

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
and that work is pretty much just so

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:17.259 
and that work is pretty much just so
it's<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.129> the<00:04:11.670> E<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.569> a<00:04:15.289> it<00:04:16.289> up<00:04:16.470> two<00:04:17.070> frets

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
it's the the E and the a it up two frets

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.689 
it's the the E and the a it up two frets
so<00:04:21.470> then<00:04:22.470> I<00:04:22.620> just<00:04:22.650> play<00:04:22.860> that<00:04:22.979> my<00:04:23.099> barn<00:04:23.370> with<00:04:23.580> my

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
so then I just play that my barn with my

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.570 
so then I just play that my barn with my
first<00:04:23.880> and<00:04:24.090> third<00:04:24.210> finger<00:04:24.509> and<00:04:25.280> then<00:04:26.280> in

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
between those is just this this root

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:48.879 
between those is just this this root
note<00:04:30.419> of<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.900> B<00:04:31.080> on<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:32.070> a<00:04:32.099> string

and that last quarter to see and I don't
know<00:04:53.060> if<00:04:53.150> it<00:04:53.240> sounds<00:04:53.389> better<00:04:53.750> as<00:04:53.990> a<00:04:54.080> full<00:04:54.259> seat

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.740 
know if it sounds better as a full seat
or<00:04:55.729> just<00:04:56.060> that<00:04:56.150> you<00:04:56.240> kind<00:04:56.419> of<00:04:56.449> leave<00:04:56.629> your
