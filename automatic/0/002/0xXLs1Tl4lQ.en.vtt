again alright so let's see something

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.440 
again alright so let's see something
else<00:04:28.310> yes<00:04:28.550> let's<00:04:28.729> check<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.030> settings<00:04:29.330> again

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
else yes let's check the settings again

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.370 
else yes let's check the settings again
and<00:04:29.630> see<00:04:29.930> what<00:04:30.080> we<00:04:30.169> got<00:04:30.320> here<00:04:31.810> let's<00:04:32.810> try<00:04:33.110> and

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
and see what we got here let's try and

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:40.300 
and see what we got here let's try and
open<00:04:33.470> there<00:04:34.720> yep<00:04:35.979> see<00:04:38.740> that's<00:04:39.740> like<00:04:39.860> I<00:04:40.280> said

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
open there yep see that's like I said

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.420 
open there yep see that's like I said
it's<00:04:40.610> a<00:04:40.669> $29<00:04:41.240> phone<00:04:41.479> so<00:04:41.630> the<00:04:41.750> GPU<00:04:42.229> it's<00:04:42.740> not<00:04:43.310> as

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
it's a $29 phone so the GPU it's not as

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.240 
it's a $29 phone so the GPU it's not as
powerful<00:04:43.639> and<00:04:44.330> you<00:04:44.810> do<00:04:44.960> notice<00:04:45.229> some<00:04:45.710> stirring

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
powerful and you do notice some stirring

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.120 
powerful and you do notice some stirring
from<00:04:46.669> time<00:04:46.729> to<00:04:47.030> time<00:04:47.470> but<00:04:48.470> for<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:48.710> price<00:04:48.889> you

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
from time to time but for the price you

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.170 
from time to time but for the price you
really<00:04:49.400> can't<00:04:49.700> beat<00:04:49.850> it

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
really can't beat it

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.120 
really can't beat it
it<00:04:50.810> runs<00:04:51.020> almost<00:04:51.200> everything<00:04:51.770> there's<00:04:52.010> some

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
it runs almost everything there's some

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.310 
it runs almost everything there's some
applications<00:04:52.250> that<00:04:52.729> might<00:04:53.180> not<00:04:53.419> run<00:04:53.690> it<00:04:54.080> might

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
applications that might not run it might

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.190 
applications that might not run it might
require<00:04:54.470> higher<00:04:55.100> performance<00:04:55.820> it<00:04:56.630> does<00:04:56.870> come

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
require higher performance it does come

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.050 
require higher performance it does come
with<00:04:57.229> like<00:04:57.740> I<00:04:57.770> said<00:04:57.979> sort<00:04:58.460> of<00:04:58.550> applications

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
with like I said sort of applications

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.360 
with like I said sort of applications
most<00:04:59.389> of<00:04:59.539> it<00:04:59.690> is<00:04:59.990> simple<00:05:00.440> he<00:05:00.710> does<00:05:00.889> have<00:05:01.070> a<00:05:01.100> file

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
most of it is simple he does have a file

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.670 
most of it is simple he does have a file
manager<00:05:01.760> and<00:05:01.789> a<00:05:01.970> backup<00:05:02.360> and<00:05:02.780> as<00:05:03.289> well<00:05:03.470> as<00:05:03.560> your

manager and a backup and as well as your

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.440 
manager and a backup and as well as your
gallery<00:05:04.780> your<00:05:05.780> camera<00:05:06.169> itself<00:05:06.530> is<00:05:07.030> very<00:05:08.030> very

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
gallery your camera itself is very very

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.590 
gallery your camera itself is very very
minimal<00:05:09.200> as<00:05:09.410> well<00:05:09.620> so<00:05:09.950> nothing<00:05:10.400> to<00:05:10.729> be<00:05:10.880> excited
