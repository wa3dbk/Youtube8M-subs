can see I'm looking at my myself mounted
camera<00:01:48.450> here<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.899> then<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.049> one<00:01:49.259> which

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
camera here and then this one which

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.950 
camera here and then this one which
basically<00:01:50.040> moves<00:01:50.460> around<00:01:50.729> with<00:01:51.030> me<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.720> this

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
basically moves around with me so this

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.810 
basically moves around with me so this
is<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.200> camera<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.770> use<00:01:53.100> basically<00:01:53.579> it

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
is the camera that I use basically it

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.120 
is the camera that I use basically it
takes<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.119> different<00:01:54.270> shot<00:01:54.860> it's<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.979> good

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
takes a different shot it's a good

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.649 
takes a different shot it's a good
recommendation<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:57.060> only<00:01:57.270> thing<00:01:57.450> that's

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
recommendation the only thing that's

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.770 
recommendation the only thing that's
negative<00:01:58.020> about<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.469> for<00:01:59.030> see<00:02:00.030> pictures<00:02:00.540> out

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
negative about it for see pictures out

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.300 
negative about it for see pictures out
here<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.170> ocean<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.130> a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
here in the ocean is that this is a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.240 
here in the ocean is that this is a
still<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.719> have<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.229> really<00:02:04.259> lubricate<00:02:05.219> it

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
still so you have to really lubricate it

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.130 
still so you have to really lubricate it
so<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.670> doesn't<00:02:05.700> rest<00:02:06.240> out<00:02:06.509> that's<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.899> only

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
so it doesn't rest out that's the only

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.630 
so it doesn't rest out that's the only
recommendation<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:07.979> would<00:02:08.220> do<00:02:08.340> with<00:02:08.489> that

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
recommendation that I would do with that

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.100 
recommendation that I would do with that
because<00:02:08.789> it's<00:02:08.970> not<00:02:09.030> aluminum<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.869> it's<00:02:09.959> not

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
because it's not aluminum and it's not

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.500 
because it's not aluminum and it's not
stainless<00:02:10.470> steel<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.160> there's<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.940> chance<00:02:12.030> for

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
stainless steel so there's a chance for

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.700 
stainless steel so there's a chance for
it<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.660> rest

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
it to rest

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.190 
it to rest
out<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:14.250> keep<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.180> up<00:02:15.300> on<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.570> surface<00:02:16.020> you

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
out I keep it up on the surface you

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.930 
out I keep it up on the surface you
could<00:02:16.350> actually<00:02:16.530> drop<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.160> down<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.730> want

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
could actually drop it down if you want

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.780 
could actually drop it down if you want
you<00:02:18.570> know<00:02:18.660> just<00:02:18.810> turn<00:02:19.080> your<00:02:19.200> camera<00:02:19.550> I'll<00:02:20.550> drop

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
you know just turn your camera I'll drop

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:30.650 
you know just turn your camera I'll drop
it<00:02:20.850> down<00:02:21.120> here<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.880> basically<00:02:29.880> you'll<00:02:30.480> have

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
it down here and basically you'll have

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.870 
it down here and basically you'll have
your<00:02:30.780> shot<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:31.500> that's<00:02:32.190> one<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.550> reasons

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
your shot so that's one of the reasons

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.820 
your shot so that's one of the reasons
why<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.030> got<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:33.480> because<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:34.080> got<00:02:34.410> tired<00:02:34.680> of

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
why I got it because I I got tired of

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.620 
why I got it because I I got tired of
taking<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.310> from<00:02:35.460> one<00:02:35.910> mount<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.330> another

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
taking it from one mount to another

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.650
