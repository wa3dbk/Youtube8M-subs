 your legislation allow unions 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.610
 and so be these same workers and 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.909
 workers who defend their 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.220
 qatar rights we launched this 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.289
 campaign several workers and 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.330
 qatar airways workers in 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.450
 activity or have approached removed 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.369
 we have sent messages 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.280
 first to thank to thank 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.680
 for being the voice of society that voice 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.060
 that they do not have can not have no 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.939
 they allow them to have 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.189
 but also to tell us that these 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:50.740
 abuses that we have denounced are not the 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:55.789
 only they suffer continuously from 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:58.039
 abuse of management the manager 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.860
 general of Mr. Alba's company 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:03.020
 that has a very dictatorial style 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.470
 towards its workers and 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.670
 this is what they suffer daily 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.290
 these foreigners working in doha 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.890
 particularly the workers who 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.959
 they suffer from abuses that can even be 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.090
 evidencing in work contracts 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.700
 we have had access to contracts 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.670
 work where the workers are 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.489
 forced to ask permission to change 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.480
 your marital status and you even have to 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:36.830
 ask permission to get pregnant 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:39.319
 this beyond what is it going against 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.799
 the international conventions of the 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.320
 oit to try despite being part and 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.550
 Member State not member of the ILO 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.980
 fulfill 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.390
 these issues and this makes the 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.110
 workers continually see 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.090
 intimidated beyond a system that 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.950
 has qatar airways that during the 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.470
 private and private time and 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.080
 rest of your workers who are 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.660
 continuously being watched there 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.760
 surveillance cameras there are schedules in 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.210
 those who can not receive visits on 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.850
 all the catalog workers is 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.040
 this worries us and that is why we are 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.980
 trying to help these workers 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.320
 from the efe ee so they can have 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.560
 a union representation that defends 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.560
 your rights
