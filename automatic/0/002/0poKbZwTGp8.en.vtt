 visa 2011 welcome to the room on time 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.429
 we now present a climbing slope 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.509
 the last arrived for the bastardidentro vineyard 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.489
 the apa offered 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.090
 as you can see 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.570
 the form is derived from the 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.170
 from Rome it is well known anastasi 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.280
 vehicle 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.360
 but this time we have a shoe with a square overhanging shape 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.950
 slightly because we still wanted to keep a compromise 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.940
 best compromise that could be achieved 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.380
 as fit fit anyway performance 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.800
 the proof is blessed 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.920
 mount a phoneix eraser on the school 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.570
 while you 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.060
 under the rubber edge 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.140
 clad 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.290
 with the new humanistic app 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.700
 maya always in cordura as indeed the whole anastasis line 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.810
 via new ball fight love the cap 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.130
 that allows 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.370
 it is a homogeneous filling and a perfect fitting fit. according to moi una 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.150
 shoe 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.730
 reserved woman. to an audience 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.910
 that spaces 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.950
 however, from the most demanding overhanging ateliers 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.910
 verticals of a certain level 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.910
 the best compromise tree compromised between two things 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.360
 we will present now 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.330
 a derivative of the mythical 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
 gay issues the scarp approach 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.470
 top server of the external fa 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.540
 from this shoe we have derived the new interior ka 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.510
 camvoice canvas because unlike 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.130
 of the original tennis tree 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.130
 where the upper 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.959
 in nubuck leather 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.279
 we wanted to lighten the shoe 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:15.279
 neck an upper step webcam 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.319
 do not remove 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.429
 sturdiness the shoe increases 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.949
 very much the fit to understand. the material can 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.349
 adhere better which form in our foot and at the same time the 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.159
 breathability that p 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.789
 nubuck leather sometimes 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:34.789
 leave something to be desired 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:37.299
 basically the shoe with me 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.349
 montsant and pearl technical features 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.189
 duct sole makes time 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.019
 the sole that ages the best compromise 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.629
 right on the rassu approach that is 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.619
 when we must abc give to the wall 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:55.600
 eldo nice to walk on steep rocky cliff paths and more 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.759
 but then we have to face the walls where 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.789
 the technical soul is the klineman soul of this shoe 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:09.419
 burgundy with marine always points in file then start rubber 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:14.079
 and rubber that still allows us to tackle even enough grades 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.179
 high then conform 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:19.179
 to our graphic qualities you 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.999
 very light because in any case the insertion of the puma on low cam 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:25.239
 suitable 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.889
 fine 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.399
 however, the press has a lot of weight 

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:32.709
 is 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.599
 it should be should be 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.689
 everst is also available in the uniemens women's version version 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:42.259
 hence the slightly narrower story on the heel 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.879
 a new product meanwhile clap rock 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.639
 I would like to introduce you to camphor now 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.280
 one of our shoes 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.950
 is fai think3 kinder + best selling 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.270
 the particularity 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.829
 of this shoe is 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.089
 on the school where we have 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:09.450
 introduced the star s1 hotel a more suitable school 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.209
 to what is liked to what the walk to trekking to 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.000
 to the insertion in the internal point of a c4 style insert the puma all 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:20.359
 spoil 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.419
 on our claimbing line shoes this allows 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:26.949
 the moment we face a wall 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.020
 classic via ferrata in any case very high steps 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.090
 to be able to have 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.139
 a grip 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.249
 homogeneous on the entire plant of the shoe but for a little bit more passage 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:40.210
 details a little bit more difficult 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.110
 books for the puma of climbing at the tip just to adhere better small 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.460
 cleats supports 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.189
 burgundy rubber 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:52.970
 hahaha along the tip this too that of adherence during the walk 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.610
 a belt system allows you to have a little more filling 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.809
 relaxed failed tuning of the walkways a little more 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:02.730
 intense a little longer 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.710
 but just as the king's shoe 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.830
 be a little more technical 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.750
 we can hold it 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.450
 so as to biliribina he asks to have the greatest following possible 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.539
 the shoe equipped with this proprietary system 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.599
 helps a lot on stability because it blocks the family at the portegÃ¨ xvi 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:24.770
 edited 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:25.910
 twists 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.039
 lateral 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.169
 why and then it is very important because if we face aion 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.240
 europe a little bit more details with boulders 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.170
 completely protect all 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.080
 ankle 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.930
 that part the back of the shoe 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.890
 the leather upper but little so very resistant to abrasion with holes 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.580
 that still allow breathability
