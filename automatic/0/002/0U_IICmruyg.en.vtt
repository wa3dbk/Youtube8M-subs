for<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.250> small<00:02:36.550> grid<00:02:36.760> I'm<00:02:36.940> just<00:02:37.150> gonna<00:02:37.300> do<00:02:37.540> it

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
for the small grid I'm just gonna do it

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.550 
for the small grid I'm just gonna do it
in<00:02:37.810> manual<00:02:38.260> mode<00:02:38.970> okay<00:02:40.080> so<00:02:41.080> let's<00:02:41.290> start

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
in manual mode okay so let's start

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.360 
in manual mode okay so let's start
logging<00:02:42.120> it's<00:02:43.120> my<00:02:43.300> first<00:02:43.650> move<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:44.980> second

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
logging it's my first move to the second

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.390 
logging it's my first move to the second
position<00:02:46.020> hit<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.140> log<00:02:47.350> button<00:02:47.680> each<00:02:48.370> time

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
position hit the log button each time

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.500 
position hit the log button each time
you<00:02:48.760> hit<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:48.970> log<00:02:49.150> button<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:50.380> sends<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:52.000> XY

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
you hit the log button it sends the XY

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.320 
you hit the log button it sends the XY
position<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:53.440> value<00:02:53.920> of<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.090> signal

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
position and the value of the signal

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.090 
position and the value of the signal
returned<00:02:55.840> back<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:57.040> software<00:02:58.350> so<00:02:59.350> this

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
returned back to the software so this

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.300 
returned back to the software so this
way<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.370> can<00:03:00.700> see<00:03:01.739> what<00:03:02.739> you're<00:03:02.920> actually

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
way you can see what you're actually

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.190 
way you can see what you're actually
logging<00:03:03.580> as<00:03:03.910> you<00:03:04.120> go<00:03:06.269> at<00:03:07.269> this<00:03:07.569> point<00:03:07.690> the

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
logging as you go at this point the

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.360 
logging as you go at this point the
software<00:03:09.010> uses<00:03:09.610> a<00:03:10.049> grayscale<00:03:11.049> from<00:03:11.709> black<00:03:12.340> to

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
software uses a grayscale from black to

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.590 
software uses a grayscale from black to
a<00:03:13.120> white<00:03:13.510> on<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:15.040> logging<00:03:15.489> I'm<00:03:15.760> trying<00:03:16.209> to<00:03:16.420> see

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
a white on the logging I'm trying to see

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.740 
a white on the logging I'm trying to see
if<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:16.840> can<00:03:17.049> get<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:17.380> changed<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.700> whatever<00:03:19.060> plat

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
if I can get it changed to whatever plat

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.539 
if I can get it changed to whatever plat
you<00:03:19.989> currently<00:03:20.350> use<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.799> if<00:03:20.920> you<00:03:21.040> notice<00:03:21.370> in

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
you currently use it if you notice in

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.890 
you currently use it if you notice in
the<00:03:21.580> background<00:03:22.360> on<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.720> right<00:03:23.069> there's<00:03:24.069> a

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
the background on the right there's a

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.220 
the background on the right there's a
color<00:03:25.900> plat<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:27.940> it<00:03:28.239> might<00:03:28.600> be<00:03:28.750> possible<00:03:29.170> to

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
color plat that it might be possible to

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.699 
color plat that it might be possible to
have<00:03:29.440> it<00:03:29.590> done<00:03:29.769> in<00:03:29.799> that<00:03:30.130> so<00:03:31.120> I'm<00:03:32.079> talking<00:03:32.530> to

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
have it done in that so I'm talking to

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.670 
have it done in that so I'm talking to
the<00:03:33.160> software<00:03:33.549> guy<00:03:34.510> now<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.109> see<00:03:35.290> if<00:03:35.380> we<00:03:35.530> can

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
the software guy now and see if we can

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.560 
the software guy now and see if we can
get<00:03:35.859> something<00:03:36.160> done<00:03:36.340> where<00:03:36.790> whatever<00:03:37.120> plat

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
get something done where whatever plat

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.990 
get something done where whatever plat
you<00:03:37.810> have<00:03:38.019> selected<00:03:39.600> as<00:03:40.600> your<00:03:41.079> default<00:03:42.000> it'll

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
you have selected as your default it'll

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.940 
you have selected as your default it'll
log<00:03:43.540> in<00:03:43.870> that<00:03:44.579> or<00:03:45.579> show<00:03:45.910> it<00:03:45.940> as<00:03:46.329> you<00:03:46.750> log<00:03:47.019> those

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
log in that or show it as you log those

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.170 
log in that or show it as you log those
colors<00:03:48.430> of<00:03:48.820> that<00:03:49.060> plat<00:03:50.760> so<00:03:51.760> we're<00:03:51.910> just<00:03:51.940> going

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
colors of that plat so we're just going

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.130 
colors of that plat so we're just going
to<00:03:52.269> keep<00:03:52.420> going<00:03:52.660> them<00:03:52.959> on<00:03:53.140> the<00:03:54.660> move<00:03:55.660> into<00:03:55.840> the

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
to keep going them on the move into the

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.270 
to keep going them on the move into the
fifth<00:03:56.530> row<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:58.829> going<00:03:59.829> back<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.190> other

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
you just sent from the logger okay now

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.350 
you just sent from the logger okay now
what's<00:04:41.530> good<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:41.950> logger<00:04:42.190> also<00:04:42.700> stored<00:04:43.120> this

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
what's good the logger also stored this

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.270 
what's good the logger also stored this
in<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:43.720> position<00:04:44.230> so<00:04:44.410> you<00:04:44.470> have<00:04:44.740> a<00:04:44.770> copy<00:04:45.070> in

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
I'm just gonna put six plus six Tests

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.210 
I'm just gonna put six plus six Tests
and<00:05:05.670> we're<00:05:06.670> gonna<00:05:06.760> save<00:05:07.030> that<00:05:07.060> out<00:05:07.450> and<00:05:08.220> then
