introduce you today our newest product
which<00:00:36.940> is<00:00:37.090> the<00:00:37.239> ultra<00:00:37.690> stunt<00:00:37.960> mini<00:00:38.650> Tramp<00:00:39.010> it's

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
which is the ultra stunt mini Tramp it's

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.540 
which is the ultra stunt mini Tramp it's
the<00:00:39.970> first<00:00:40.330> mini<00:00:40.780> Tramp<00:00:41.110> that's<00:00:41.980> been

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
the first mini Tramp that's been

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.970 
the first mini Tramp that's been
designed<00:00:43.000> strictly<00:00:43.330> for<00:00:43.540> stunt<00:00:44.020> work<00:00:44.230> and<00:00:44.440> not

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
designed strictly for stunt work and not

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.610 
designed strictly for stunt work and not
for<00:00:45.280> gymnastics<00:00:45.489> but<00:00:46.480> we've<00:00:46.989> placed<00:00:47.290> wheels

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
for gymnastics but we've placed wheels

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.560 
for gymnastics but we've placed wheels
on<00:00:47.860> the<00:00:47.980> machine<00:00:48.340> on<00:00:48.610> that<00:00:48.699> done<00:00:49.150> that<00:00:49.300> on<00:00:49.449> the

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
on the machine on that done that on the

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.390 
on the machine on that done that on the
trampoline<00:00:50.050> so<00:00:50.650> that<00:00:50.830> it<00:00:50.920> can<00:00:51.040> easily<00:00:51.190> be

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
trampoline so that it can easily be

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.810 
trampoline so that it can easily be
moved<00:00:51.670> around<00:00:51.850> the<00:00:52.120> set<00:00:53.220> and<00:00:54.220> also<00:00:54.550> can<00:00:54.730> be

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
moved around the set and also can be

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.240 
moved around the set and also can be
moved<00:00:55.140> back<00:00:56.140> and<00:00:56.320> forth<00:00:56.410> to<00:00:56.710> transportation

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
moved back and forth to transportation

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.759 
moved back and forth to transportation
with<00:00:57.850> greater<00:00:58.090> ease<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:59.260> is<00:00:59.470> a<00:00:59.500> prototype

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
with greater ease this is a prototype

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.479 
with greater ease this is a prototype
model<00:01:00.400> we<00:01:01.269> are<00:01:01.420> making<00:01:02.290> upgrades<00:01:02.620> with<00:01:03.070> it<00:01:03.250> the

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
model we are making upgrades with it the

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.460 
model we are making upgrades with it the
upgrades<00:01:03.880> will<00:01:04.059> include<00:01:04.330> pads<00:01:04.989> all<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:05.380> way

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
upgrades will include pads all the way

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.850 
upgrades will include pads all the way
around<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.860> springs<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.840> wheel<00:01:08.200> positions

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
around the springs the wheel positions

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.710 
around the springs the wheel positions
will<00:01:09.009> be<00:01:09.040> modified<00:01:09.490> so<00:01:09.700> that<00:01:10.030> balance<00:01:10.420> is

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
will be modified so that balance is

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.850 
will be modified so that balance is
better<00:01:10.960> than<00:01:11.080> that<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.350> quality<00:01:11.560> of<00:01:11.740> the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
better than that the quality of the

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.100 
better than that the quality of the
wheels<00:01:12.070> are<00:01:12.280> better<00:01:12.490> our<00:01:12.790> goal<00:01:13.420> is<00:01:13.660> is<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:13.869> be

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
wheels are better our goal is is to be

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.310 
wheels are better our goal is is to be
able<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.440> use<00:01:14.590> this<00:01:14.920> mini<00:01:15.850> Tramp<00:01:16.180> for<00:01:16.330> people

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
able to use this mini Tramp for people

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.200 
able to use this mini Tramp for people
in<00:01:17.410> like<00:01:17.619> professional<00:01:18.190> wrestlers<00:01:18.610> or<00:01:18.729> NFL

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
in like professional wrestlers or NFL

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.960 
in like professional wrestlers or NFL
football<00:01:19.690> players<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.380> also<00:01:21.250> for<00:01:21.550> smaller

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
football players and also for smaller

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.700 
football players and also for smaller
stunt<00:01:22.479> people<00:01:22.600> as<00:01:22.899> well<00:01:23.050> there's<00:01:23.350> never<00:01:23.590> been

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
stunt people as well there's never been

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.570 
stunt people as well there's never been
a<00:01:23.860> mini<00:01:24.100> Tramp<00:01:24.160> thats<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:25.420> strong<00:01:25.840> enough<00:01:26.170> or

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
a mini Tramp thats and strong enough or

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.820 
a mini Tramp thats and strong enough or
had<00:01:27.580> enough<00:01:28.140> spring<00:01:29.140> strength<00:01:29.560> that<00:01:29.680> would

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
had enough spring strength that would

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.039 
had enough spring strength that would
allow<00:01:30.180> very<00:01:31.180> large<00:01:31.500> performers<00:01:32.500> to<00:01:32.830> actually

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
allow very large performers to actually

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.450 
allow very large performers to actually
do<00:01:35.049> mini<00:01:35.290> transport<00:01:35.830> before<00:01:36.189> because<00:01:36.369> they

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
do mini transport before because they

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.789 
do mini transport before because they
would<00:01:36.580> always<00:01:36.790> bottom<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.270> system<00:01:37.630> out<00:01:37.810> the

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
would always bottom the system out the

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.770 
would always bottom the system out the
frame<00:01:39.130> is<00:01:39.369> is<00:01:39.640> much<00:01:40.030> stronger<00:01:40.299> than<00:01:40.450> a<00:01:40.600> normal

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
frame is is much stronger than a normal

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.399 
frame is is much stronger than a normal
mini<00:01:41.080> Tramp<00:01:41.320> it<00:01:41.350> has<00:01:41.470> a<00:01:41.500> much<00:01:41.710> larger

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
mini Tramp it has a much larger

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.719 
mini Tramp it has a much larger
footprint<00:01:44.409> and<00:01:44.560> has<00:01:44.680> more<00:01:45.040> surface<00:01:45.250> area<00:01:45.520> so

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
footprint and has more surface area so

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.740 
footprint and has more surface area so
it<00:01:45.850> won't<00:01:46.060> slide<00:01:46.330> around<00:01:48.330> what<00:01:49.330> I<00:01:49.360> want<00:01:49.630> to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
it won't slide around what I want to

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.390 
it won't slide around what I want to
figure<00:01:49.900> out<00:01:50.170> is<00:01:50.380> is<00:01:50.650> that<00:01:50.890> we<00:01:51.009> start<00:01:51.220> with<00:01:51.310> the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
figure out is is that we start with the

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.670 
figure out is is that we start with the
biggest<00:01:51.490> person<00:01:51.909> first<00:01:52.119> you<00:01:52.689> whack<00:01:52.960> it<00:01:52.990> and<00:01:53.439> we

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
biggest person first you whack it and we

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.050 
biggest person first you whack it and we
need<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.890> figure<00:01:54.040> out<00:01:54.220> which<00:01:54.369> Springs<00:01:54.759> we<00:01:54.909> need

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
need to figure out which Springs we need

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.179 
need to figure out which Springs we need
to<00:01:55.150> drop<00:01:55.360> for<00:01:55.420> which<00:01:55.750> weight<00:01:56.020> people<00:01:56.470> that's

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
to drop for which weight people that's

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:58.740 
to drop for which weight people that's
really<00:01:57.460> where<00:01:57.700> we're<00:01:57.880> at<00:01:57.909> it<00:01:58.150> with<00:01:58.270> this<00:01:58.479> so

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
really where we're at it with this so

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.020 
really where we're at it with this so
the<00:01:58.900> whole<00:01:59.079> idea<00:01:59.110> is<00:01:59.500> we<00:01:59.680> want<00:01:59.860> a<00:02:00.030> trampoline

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
the whole idea is we want a trampoline

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.120 
the whole idea is we want a trampoline
that<00:02:01.840> will<00:02:01.960> work<00:02:02.079> for<00:02:02.140> people<00:02:02.680> that<00:02:02.860> are<00:02:02.979> like

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
that will work for people that are like

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.609 
that will work for people that are like
professional<00:02:03.850> wrestlers<00:02:04.360> but<00:02:04.689> NFL<00:02:05.259> football

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
professional wrestlers but NFL football

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.560 
professional wrestlers but NFL football
players<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.400> be<00:02:06.610> aware<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.119> be<00:02:07.329> able<00:02:07.420> to

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
players and be aware and to be able to

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.759 
players and be aware and to be able to
drop<00:02:07.720> down<00:02:07.930> from<00:02:08.170> there<00:02:08.320> that's<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.590> whole

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
drop down from there that's the whole

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:17.990 
drop down from there that's the whole
goal

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.340 

most<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.180> stress<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.600> tended<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:19.990> be<00:02:20.140> right

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
most of the stress is tended to be right

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.660 
most of the stress is tended to be right
in<00:02:20.470> here<00:02:20.680> these<00:02:20.830> are<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.100> springs<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.460> were

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
in here these are the springs that were

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.220 
in here these are the springs that were
stretching<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.210> my<00:02:22.360> damage<00:02:22.810> has<00:02:22.960> been<00:02:22.990> on

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
stretching the my damage has been on

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.960 
stretching the my damage has been on
these<00:02:23.320> bottom<00:02:23.740> springs<00:02:24.130> for<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.520> stretching

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
these bottom springs for the stretching

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:34.559 
these bottom springs for the stretching
and<00:02:25.120> actually<00:02:25.870> ripped<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.260> bed<00:02:26.500> out<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.920> it

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.830 

because<00:02:44.459> of<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.819> spring<00:02:45.629> layout<00:02:46.020> it<00:02:47.010> allows

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
because of the spring layout it allows

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.100 
because of the spring layout it allows
greater<00:02:48.840> height<00:02:49.200> greater<00:02:49.560> distance<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.640> also

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
greater height greater distance and also

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.500 
greater height greater distance and also
it<00:02:52.110> allows<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.800> mini-tramp<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.790> perform<00:02:54.300> well

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
it allows the mini-tramp to perform well

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.809 
it allows the mini-tramp to perform well
for<00:02:54.709> very<00:02:55.709> large<00:02:55.890> jumpers<00:02:56.430> which<00:02:56.670> a

for very large jumpers which a

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.000 
for very large jumpers which a
conventional<00:02:57.480> gymnastics<00:02:58.019> mini-tramp<00:02:58.500> just

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
conventional gymnastics mini-tramp just

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.300 
conventional gymnastics mini-tramp just
simply<00:02:59.640> doesn't<00:02:59.819> have<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.060> ability<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:01.310> take

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
simply doesn't have the ability to take

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.890 
simply doesn't have the ability to take
that<00:03:02.489> kind<00:03:02.700> of<00:03:02.849> pounding<00:03:05.599> this<00:03:06.599> is<00:03:06.870> a

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
that kind of pounding this is a

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.900 
that kind of pounding this is a
development<00:03:07.680> mini-tramp<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.580> is<00:03:08.730> not<00:03:08.880> a

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
development mini-tramp this is not a

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.089 
development mini-tramp this is not a
production<00:03:09.330> mini<00:03:09.450> Tramp<00:03:09.750> but<00:03:10.200> our<00:03:10.319> goal<00:03:10.500> is<00:03:10.799> is

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
production mini Tramp but our goal is is

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.869 
production mini Tramp but our goal is is
to<00:03:11.130> have<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:11.870> may<00:03:12.870> Tramp<00:03:13.220> produced<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:14.760> we

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
to have this may Tramp produced so we

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.280 
to have this may Tramp produced so we
can<00:03:15.060> sell<00:03:15.239> it<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.480> stunt<00:03:15.780> performers

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
can sell it to stunt performers

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.750 
can sell it to stunt performers
worldwide

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760
