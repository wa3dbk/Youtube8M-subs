00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.049
 and a pleasure to be with daniel and see you and 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.850
 danielle a pleasure knew grace line 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.309
 that these videos thank you for again 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.530
 for inviting me and also always be with 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.240
 these wonderful bremer projects 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.810
 because you can also do so many 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.449
 nice things the truth that is endless 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.119
 of ideas exactly what dremel gives me 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.650
 is the opportunity to work all the 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.689
 material is good to do things very 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.330
 creative as it is creative because today 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.580
 let's work with the mini lathe that 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.500
 the scalar idea because you saw that when 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.690
 the openworks appear, people are fascinated 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.580
 because it would be so difficult is easy is 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.430
 easy but it's another technique I do not know how to use 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.470
 a bench jigger but what 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.180
 we are going to use the same lathe as for 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.640
 so it's a technique that is 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.629
 good the mini lathe besides that has 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.869
 many tiny little things this is a 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.760
 hook this is one of the most sets 

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:01.339
 complete and good for that person 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.570
 does not stop and not have all the 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:07.510
 variety is always we offer you this one 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.640
 there is this set that has a lot of variety 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.320
 a little of everything good for doing what 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.940
 different things since the one that has the 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.650
 mini lathe can have the kit 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.270
 accessories what is this that is 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.280
 spectacular to do everything 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.290
 as is if we want here to 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.479
 polish to cut to burn over 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.270
 glass on metals to spend metal 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.580
 to record good but many things there 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.850
 we have the lamp look what is a 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.100
 Pumpkin can also be scaled 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.440
 little bit with the pumpkin and make a 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.570
 lamp so let's see what you do and 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.479
 the truth that is a technique that 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.149
 good is something different to get him 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.610
 profit and good to do in this pumpkin 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.280
 this type of work or some other 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.350
 things and it can be a design that you choose 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.600
 any very cute I love this 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.090
 butterfly and now let's see all the 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.090
 secrets of how to do the step we're going 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.520
 I love good design you saw this 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.830
 I can do good self if it is 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.720
 draftsman does it directly and if not 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.670
 well we can look for some image by 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.530
 internet and print it and directly there 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.920
 with carbon paper 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.290
 what we do is paste it and if 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.600
 we cut well around the contour 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.220
 we put carbon paper and others hurt 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.420
 directly then there we already have 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.980
 all the drawing to be able to work it 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.280
 there we will work with what we are going to 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.500
 work to make this draft with 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.690
 bits and small mosques 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.150
 tiny and then with some strawberries 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.250
 as to fully make the parts of 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.770
 the hearts the parts that are not 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.440
 round yes so let's work with 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.110
 small little dots circles and 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.200
 then we will go calando with the same 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.080
 strawberry until you get to the drawings if it's a 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.880
 the technique so little by little it will go 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.000
 arriving the whole drawing is going to go 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.220
 calando so good is patience towards 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.300
 our short patience is with much 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.340
 precision 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:10.850
 there we are good min and what first 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.170
 we have to do is good obviously is 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.930
 a precision job 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.780
 we're going to need to have the flexible and 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.970
 we are also going to need not to put 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.890
 nozzles but have the mandrel 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.490
 because we are going to use different types of 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.550
 bits for this we will choose a 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.860
 small drill and this self-adjusting mother 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.750
 the good that fits any 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.860
 drill bit if all we do 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.890
 is going to close what we put it and there 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.920
 we just tighten one that already 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:48.640
 we have there we're going to go directly to 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.640
 work to start drilling 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.510
 good once we have already done all 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.200
 the drilling we're going to do is we have 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.750
 that changing the accessory turns off the 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.960
 turn off the lathe is pressed to lock 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:29.100
 the shaft loosen the mandrel and there we go to 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.750
 go with a strawberry that is very small 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.800
 and that will serve me for 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.160
 contour 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.540
 the largest parts 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.720
 What are they 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:43.000
 these droplets take out the heart or the 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.030
 butterfly body the technique in the 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.500
 same technique is similar nothing but 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:52.060
 this strawberry allows me to cut 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.970
 bordering the entire drawing and cutting it to 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:59.250
 the time then there we will have this 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.250
 I draw all openwork with this same strawberry 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:18.229
 the truth that is great it was very 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:20.629
 nice the project and also do so many 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:23.300
 things because you've made glass you've made 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:26.749
 now in the next we are going to set the 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.509
 eggs as if that the good thing that other 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:31.879
 technique that I will teach in the next 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:35.330
 good program that is just part 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:36.949
 of this type of technique thanks to the 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.919
 speed of the lathe and all the 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:42.710
 variety of accessories and materials that 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:45.259
 we can get to record that allows us 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.169
 record from wood metal is good at 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:51.830
 case of another program let's go 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:54.949
 dabble with what they are game that is 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.529
 a good one asks for a lot so d'angelo 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:59.120
 a pleasure the truth that was great 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:01.310
 look at everything that can be done is 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.339
 craftsmanship because what it does is with 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:07.250
 these stadiums pulse and hurry so a 

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:10.460
 pleasure do not have many videos by 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:13.330
 course on youtube with the whole line of 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.660
 e-mail that we are accumulating videos with 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:19.310
 great we follow 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:23.180
 dremel presents the new tool 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:25.250
 micro dremel the versatile and in graiver 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:29.090
 I learned to use our tools 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:31.570
 and accessories I followed dremel argentina in 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.570
