well basically what they're doing now is

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.010 
well basically what they're doing now is
they're

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
they're

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.470 
they're
forming<00:00:21.020> ranks<00:00:21.530> they're<00:00:22.340> lining<00:00:22.640> up<00:00:22.910> by<00:00:23.150> size

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
forming ranks they're lining up by size

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.280 
forming ranks they're lining up by size
by<00:00:23.960> height<00:00:25.390> tallest<00:00:26.390> man<00:00:26.570> except<00:00:27.020> for<00:00:27.200> the

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
line up by height now in a minute he's

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.250 
line up by height now in a minute he's
going<00:00:37.760> to<00:00:37.880> give<00:00:38.030> them<00:00:38.210> another<00:00:38.540> command<00:00:39.020> the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
going to give them another command the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.470 
going to give them another command the
maxim<00:00:39.680> and<00:00:39.920> we'll<00:00:40.220> be<00:00:42.730> right<00:00:43.730> face

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
maxim and we'll be right face

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.410 
maxim and we'll be right face
for<00:00:45.470> left<00:00:45.950> they<00:00:46.160> succeed<00:00:46.580> under<00:00:46.790> let's<00:00:47.150> take

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
for left they succeed under let's take

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:55.030 
for left they succeed under let's take
this<00:00:47.629> time

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.220 

he's<00:00:55.579> just<00:00:55.910> moving<00:00:56.270> them<00:00:56.390> into<00:00:56.600> position

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
he's just moving them into position

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:05.420 
he's just moving them into position
freaking

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:15.600 

we<00:01:05.730> face<00:01:05.970> forward

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.200 

I<00:01:15.700> go<00:01:16.420> form<00:01:16.780> them<00:01:16.930> into<00:01:17.050> two<00:01:17.380> rings<00:01:17.730> and<00:01:18.730> the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
I go form them into two rings and the

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.030 
I go form them into two rings and the
way<00:01:19.330> they'll<00:01:19.600> do<00:01:19.780> that<00:01:20.050> is<00:01:20.260> the<00:01:20.410> alternates

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
way they'll do that is the alternates

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:39.840 
way they'll do that is the alternates
side<00:01:23.370> you<00:01:24.370> can<00:01:24.490> see<00:01:24.550> how<00:01:24.940> performing

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:48.410 

right

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.430 

now<00:01:49.420> they're<00:01:49.630> getting<00:01:49.780> their<00:01:50.050> proper

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
now they're getting their proper

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.680 
now they're getting their proper
interval<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.600> be<00:01:52.600> able<00:01:52.750> to<00:01:54.180> get<00:01:55.180> their<00:01:55.360> ranks

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
interval to be able to get their ranks

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.070 
interval to be able to get their ranks
all<00:01:55.870> dressed<00:01:56.230> properly<00:01:56.980> both<00:01:57.580> across<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.420> in

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
all dressed properly both across and in

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.130 
all dressed properly both across and in
ranks<00:01:59.590> and<00:02:03.120> he<00:02:04.120> should<00:02:04.390> be<00:02:04.540> giving<00:02:04.870> another

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
ranks and he should be giving another

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:14.160 
ranks and he should be giving another
command<00:02:05.560> here<00:02:05.830> in<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:05.979> minute

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.410 

what<00:02:14.800> they'll<00:02:15.069> ultimately<00:02:15.430> do<00:02:16.209> is<00:02:16.840> they<00:02:17.440> will

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
what they'll ultimately do is they will

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.839 
what they'll ultimately do is they will
when<00:02:19.420> he<00:02:19.660> gives<00:02:20.020> them<00:02:20.260> right<00:02:20.770> face<00:02:21.069> again

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
when he gives them right face again

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.180 
when he gives them right face again
they'll<00:02:22.480> be<00:02:22.989> twos<00:02:23.410> will<00:02:23.709> double<00:02:24.010> they'll

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
they'll be twos will double they'll

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.570 
they'll be twos will double they'll
count<00:02:24.400> them<00:02:24.670> all<00:02:25.500> one<00:02:26.500> two<00:02:26.770> one<00:02:27.010> two<00:02:27.220> one<00:02:27.250> two

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
count them all one two one two one two

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.960 
count them all one two one two one two
then<00:02:28.569> what<00:02:28.750> he'll<00:02:28.900> do<00:02:29.080> is<00:02:29.230> he'll<00:02:29.440> say<00:02:29.970> he'll

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
then what he'll do is he'll say he'll

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.750 
then what he'll do is he'll say he'll
give<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.270> command<00:02:31.680> right<00:02:32.680> face<00:02:33.010> when<00:02:33.640> he

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
give the command right face when he

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.340 
give the command right face when he
gives<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.090> command<00:02:34.390> right<00:02:34.690> face

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
gives a command right face

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.370 
gives a command right face
what'll<00:02:35.980> happen<00:02:36.160> is<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.270> they'll<00:02:37.540> form<00:02:37.989> into

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
what'll happen is that they'll form into

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.570 
what'll happen is that they'll form into
ranks<00:02:39.310> of<00:02:39.880> four<00:02:40.380> for<00:02:41.380> marching<00:02:41.680> purposes<00:02:42.370> so

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
ranks of four for marching purposes so

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.150 
ranks of four for marching purposes so
that<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:43.030> twos<00:02:43.269> will<00:02:43.599> double<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.140> one's<00:02:44.920> the

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
that the twos will double the one's the

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.040 
that the twos will double the one's the
note<00:02:45.370> with<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:45.700> number<00:02:46.030> ones<00:02:46.330> will<00:02:46.630> stay<00:02:46.870> in

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
note with the number ones will stay in

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.699 
note with the number ones will stay in
place

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
place

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.440 
place
and<00:02:47.860> then<00:02:48.489> a<00:02:48.519> tooth<00:02:48.850> will<00:02:49.060> move<00:02:49.239> in<00:02:49.480> between

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
and then a tooth will move in between

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:09.500 
and then a tooth will move in between
you'll<00:02:52.450> see<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.750> here

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.160 

now<00:03:10.080> that<00:03:10.319> this<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:11.010> where<00:03:11.190> they'll<00:03:11.340> form<00:03:11.610> into

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
now that this is where they'll form into

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:57.350 
now that this is where they'll form into
front<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.260> four

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.320 

thing<00:03:58.360> they<00:03:58.570> learned<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:59.200> do<00:03:59.830> is<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.940> learn<00:04:01.270> the

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
thing they learned to do is to learn the

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.620 
thing they learned to do is to learn the
stack<00:04:01.690> arms<00:04:02.110> because<00:04:02.670> there's<00:04:03.670> there's<00:04:03.910> no

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
stack arms because there's there's no

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.270 
stack arms because there's there's no
stacking<00:04:05.200> stumbles<00:04:05.620> or<00:04:05.710> anything<00:04:05.950> it's<00:04:06.160> all

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
stacking stumbles or anything it's all

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.040 
stacking stumbles or anything it's all
done<00:04:06.550> by<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:06.820> way<00:04:07.150> they're<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.570> band<00:04:07.810> that's

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
done by the way they're the band that's

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.960 
done by the way they're the band that's
in<00:04:08.290> or<00:04:08.410> off<00:04:08.940> so<00:04:09.940> it's<00:04:10.120> kind<00:04:10.420> of<00:04:10.480> tricky<00:04:11.970> but

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
in or off so it's kind of tricky but

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.330 
in or off so it's kind of tricky but
they<00:04:13.210> it<00:04:13.840> takes<00:04:14.080> a<00:04:14.200> little<00:04:14.380> practice<00:04:14.470> once<00:04:15.100> if

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
they it takes a little practice once if

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.220 
they it takes a little practice once if
once<00:04:15.580> they<00:04:15.760> get<00:04:15.940> it<00:04:16.120> then<00:04:16.299> it's<00:04:16.510> just<00:04:16.750> that

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
once they get it then it's just that

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:33.250 
once they get it then it's just that
they<00:04:17.560> understand<00:04:18.100> it

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:47.310 

stat<00:04:34.040> tell<00:04:34.640> me<00:04:34.730> right
