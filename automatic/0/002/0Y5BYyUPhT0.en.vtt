00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.610 

so<00:02:33.160> I'm<00:02:33.670> playing<00:02:34.269> a<00:02:34.390> little<00:02:34.569> bit<00:02:34.660> backwards<00:02:35.140> by

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
so I'm playing a little bit backwards by

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.860 
so I'm playing a little bit backwards by
curling<00:02:36.280> my<00:02:36.400> lashes<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:37.120> apply<00:02:37.300> my<00:02:37.630> mascara

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
curling my lashes and apply my mascara

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.040 
curling my lashes and apply my mascara
first<00:02:38.550> rebellious<00:02:39.550> right<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.209> that's

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
first rebellious right and that's

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.620 
first rebellious right and that's
because<00:02:41.470> my<00:02:41.709> liquid<00:02:42.160> liner<00:02:42.400> formula<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.180> quite

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
because my liquid liner formula is quite

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.630 
because my liquid liner formula is quite
thick<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:44.230> tends<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.650> clump<00:02:45.010> on<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.489> my

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
thick and it tends to clump on to my

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.330 
thick and it tends to clump on to my
naked<00:02:46.000> eye<00:02:46.180> lashes<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.989> lining<00:02:47.739> my<00:02:47.860> eyes<00:02:47.890> with

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
naked eye lashes and lining my eyes with

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
an angled brush and black eyeshadow

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.229

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.060 
here's my favorite eyeliner of all time
it<00:03:04.000> is<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.390> Milani<00:03:04.720> liquid<00:03:05.290> eyeliner<00:03:05.799> so

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
it is the Milani liquid eyeliner so

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.069 
it is the Milani liquid eyeliner so
first<00:03:06.459> I<00:03:06.670> start<00:03:07.000> off<00:03:07.060> with<00:03:07.329> a<00:03:07.360> triangle<00:03:08.049> shape

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
first I start off with a triangle shape

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.680 
first I start off with a triangle shape
fill<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:08.739> in<00:03:08.829> just<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.160> bit<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:09.519> then<00:03:10.090> extending

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
fill it in just a bit and then extending

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.030 
fill it in just a bit and then extending
it<00:03:10.810> inward<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:11.680> creating<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.579> rhombus<00:03:13.030> shape

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.259 

then<00:03:18.040> I<00:03:18.069> work<00:03:18.430> my<00:03:18.580> way<00:03:18.700> from<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:19.030> inner<00:03:19.180> eye

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
then I work my way from the inner eye

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:42.330 
then I work my way from the inner eye
corner<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:19.989> connect<00:03:20.319> it

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.040 

so<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.400> line<00:03:43.820> the<00:03:43.970> bottom<00:03:44.120> I<00:03:44.420> like<00:03:44.570> to<00:03:44.600> take<00:03:44.840> the

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
so to line the bottom I like to take the

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.230 
so to line the bottom I like to take the
smallest<00:03:45.470> amount<00:03:46.070> of<00:03:46.220> liquid<00:03:46.610> liner<00:03:46.910> and

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
smallest amount of liquid liner and

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.540 
smallest amount of liquid liner and
stroke<00:03:47.990> it<00:03:48.020> on<00:03:48.320> the<00:03:48.560> bottom<00:03:48.710> lash<00:03:49.010> line<00:03:49.040> and

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
stroke it on the bottom lash line and

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.280 
stroke it on the bottom lash line and
this<00:03:49.640> acts<00:03:49.940> as<00:03:50.120> an<00:03:50.300> adhesive<00:03:50.450> for<00:03:51.200> the

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
this acts as an adhesive for the

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.470 
this acts as an adhesive for the
eyeshadow

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.710 

and<00:03:59.069> lastly<00:04:00.069> I<00:04:00.190> end<00:04:00.580> it<00:04:00.700> off<00:04:00.819> with<00:04:00.849> applying

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
and lastly I end it off with applying

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.960 
and lastly I end it off with applying
mascara<00:04:01.900> to<00:04:02.319> the<00:04:02.440> bottom<00:04:02.709> of<00:04:02.739> my<00:04:03.099> lashes<00:04:05.970> so

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
mascara to the bottom of my lashes so

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.360 
mascara to the bottom of my lashes so
