so before bypassing the bootloader

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.749 
so before bypassing the bootloader
you<00:01:27.140> have<00:01:27.259> to<00:01:27.380> make<00:01:27.560> sure<00:01:27.770> that<00:01:28.039> a<00:01:28.190> device<00:01:28.550> is

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
you have to make sure that a device is

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:38.380 
you have to make sure that a device is
rooted<00:01:35.649> now<00:01:36.649> let's<00:01:36.890> begin<00:01:37.069> by<00:01:37.700> passing<00:01:37.940> the
