touches technique objects are selected
by<00:00:27.630> touch<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.650> allows<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.160> user<00:00:29.310> to

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
by touch this allows the user to

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.070 
by touch this allows the user to
manipulate<00:00:29.699> an<00:00:30.179> object<00:00:30.510> without<00:00:30.660> clicking

the mouse each cursor is completely

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.299 
the mouse each cursor is completely
independent<00:00:33.780> thus<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.800> possible<00:00:35.250> to

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
independent thus it is possible to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.160 
independent thus it is possible to
select<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.880> move<00:00:36.030> multiple<00:00:36.450> objects<00:00:36.960> at<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
same time however this also means that

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.420

the user can sometimes inadvertently

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.819 
the user can sometimes inadvertently
place<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.360> contact<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.050> an<00:00:43.170> object<00:00:43.350> when<00:00:43.710> they
