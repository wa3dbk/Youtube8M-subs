00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.030
 I fear they appeared at the box office when a day of the kingdom becomes 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.220
 a thick fog separating this territory the others this disaster does not 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.789

 he channeled the power of arms to bring prosperity to his kingdom many a 

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:12.590

 anyway 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.619
 in his attempt dies 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.590
 they become spectrum and move to the nexus 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.760
 it may be a very innovative story 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.740
 but the title tells few details 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.850
 this sector 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.009
 the nexus is a meeting place where part of the story is told 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.220
 grant missions and there is a store to buy items 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.260
 level up our weapons by repairing them as well as the presence of a 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.909
 person who keeps some of our utensils so that it does not grow too much 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.500
 our character 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.560
 to carry out most of these actions 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.670
 we must eliminate demons to recover the souls 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.549
 and so 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.000
 trade with them or change them by experience 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.130
 this mysterious world is what divides life and death there are two types 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.469
 of modalities of our body 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:10.799
 one of them 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.249
 it is pure and the other the soul state 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:17.629
 each with different characteristics such as the ability to have more health 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:23.769
 by monzón this is a title of the action rpg genre with a lot of freedom 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.529
 the universe of the game contains different worlds that becomes 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.400
 a kind of image of the saint 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.679
 in the third person with a lot of secondary content 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:36.519
 that we can only overcome with a certain level otri votes 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:41.719
 before starting our adventure it is essential to create our hero the 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:46.219
 editor is very complete apart from baptizing the character and changing some 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:51.239
 general characteristics such as gender hair color or age also fits the 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.590
 possibility of entering into more specific changes what is important is 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:59.339
 choose one of the ten available classes such as brno 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:00.899
 hunter or thief 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:04.949
 it is a difficult and important decision as it will determine our weapons 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.859
 Magic 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.859
 cuartango resistance among many other aspects 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:14.219
 all forms afterwards he demands them more and we will be at our pleasure 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:18.929
 the control and position of the buttons is very well implemented 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:22.669
 the protest served to change the weapons of each hand 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.889
 magic there were other healing elements or Molotov cocktail 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.189
 they are used for the weapons that we carry in each of our hands or 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.230
 shields being each 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.159
 for a simple attack the other for a strong one 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.919
 the attacks can be combined anyway 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.559
 will cross an enemy with our army from behind for making attacks 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:44.709
 going to the devil with the shield 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.629
 defend yourself is also very important we can do it with the shield or 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:49.629
 dodging 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.819
 our speed is fundamental 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.169
 and that will depend on the elements 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.229
 behind our backs here 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:59.189
 heavier are 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.839
 apart from the energy and magic bar it is also very important 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:03.809
 they rest 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:07.159
 because if we run we use our faults very fast 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.329
 will descend and our hero will get tired 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.870
 It is important to keep 'this is us' from gender villena, as it will not 

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:17.989
 nothing to start using weapons quickly to eliminate the 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.079
 enemies like that the azkar calculating the movements 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:26.539
 is characterized by being a video game not suitable for 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:27.960
 confident in the genre 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.969
 not even for those who have enough experience 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.919
 the title is aimed at those passionate 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.930
 other attack actions 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.190
 counted is not high 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.669
 yes no more than high 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.680
 to this we must add that there are no zones, people remember 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.500
 three hours in the sun 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.370
 the siena thanks to the opening of shortcuts that will give us speed to return where 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.259
 we leave it 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:55.069
 if you die in pieces before the beginning of the world losing all the souls 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.069
 recovered 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:04:59.289
 anyway 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.240
 we can go back to the pool of blood 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.749
 where moss died and recover weapons 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:05.889
 besides, it must be said 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.599
 fictional agencies at very high 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.470
 Each bonig presents a challenge for the player even 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.490
 more easy 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.860
 dimon soul is characterized by having an elaborate online mode 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:19.520
 the experienced in this type of gender 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.920
 we see the console connected to the internet will access directly to the servers 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.919
 you can play with other users directly 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.490
 indirectly 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.400
 when we play we will visualize marks on the floor 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.909
 which are messages and the other players to help us 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:36.759
 which we can also do 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:39.009
 there is also the position 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.800
 Rezende so that other comrades know that a warrior has died and 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.289
 activate it to see the player's last actions through a soul 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.750
 as for the 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.150
 the director the online 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.150
 if you were and we enjoyed the adventure with three other users 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.960
 we have the ability to defeat other users 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:58.110
 if it is to overcome 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.960
 a certain gtc in both cases 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.139
 we will play a lot of effort 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.330
 dimón only he can be a wonderful game in terms of the gameplay 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.940
 but technically 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.790
 Although the scenarios are gigantic and with hardly any charges, there are irregularities 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.580
 the enemy characters and environments is not very well defined and there are 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.260
 some centrals and citations anyway the artistic direction is 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.689
 sublime in every way 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:25.620
 creation of the era as for the variety of enemies 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.020
 and in some cases with its originality if we add to this a soundtrack and 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.260
 some fresh sound effects solve some of the problems 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.409
 mentioned 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:40.169
 the magic of the middle ages will come to playstation 3 with a south rudder 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:43.489
 video game expected to arrive late in Europe but promises hours 

00:06:43.489 --> 00:06:46.189
 and hours of play we only have two flaws 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:49.580
 without difficulty and sometimes its technical section 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.580
 aspects were also those people who are looking for 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.350
 are you willing to save money
