hours<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.960> that's<00:01:04.229> not<00:01:04.409> good<00:01:04.710> because<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
hours and that's not good because the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.719 
hours and that's not good because the
digestive<00:01:06.509> system<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.079> so<00:01:07.409> quick<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.040> poor

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
digestive system is so quick and so poor

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.440 
digestive system is so quick and so poor
many<00:01:09.630> times<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.770> toxins<00:01:11.460> from<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> food<00:01:12.119> are

many times the toxins from the food are
not<00:01:12.509> properly<00:01:13.259> eliminated<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.310> they<00:01:14.759> are

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
stored in the pigs fat that means that

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.609 
stored in the pigs fat that means that
pig<00:01:18.210> can<00:01:18.390> eat<00:01:18.509> all<00:01:18.659> kinds<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.109> Filth<00:01:19.439> and
