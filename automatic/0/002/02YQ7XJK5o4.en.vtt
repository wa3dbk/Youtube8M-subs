00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
we're just going to put a line out the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.270 
we're just going to put a line out the
side<00:00:32.369> for<00:00:32.759> our<00:00:32.850> mummies<00:00:33.270> sort<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.960> makeup<00:00:34.280> and

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.430 
side for our mummies sort of makeup and
then<00:00:35.730> we're<00:00:35.850> going<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.090> do<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> eyebrows<00:00:37.050> so

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
then we're going to do the eyebrows so

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.310 
then we're going to do the eyebrows so
just<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.070> hill<00:00:38.489> on<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.820> top<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:40.020> double

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
just a hill on the top and you double

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.850 
just a hill on the top and you double
that<00:00:40.350> line<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.280> do<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.579> twice<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.210> then<00:00:43.200> two

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
that line so do that twice and then two

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.279 
that line so do that twice and then two
lines<00:00:44.160> from<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.670> eyebrows<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> inside<00:00:46.260> of

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
lines from the eyebrows to the inside of

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.410 
lines from the eyebrows to the inside of
the<00:00:46.590> eyes<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.399> then<00:00:47.940> we're<00:00:48.090> going<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.239> do

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the eyes and then we're going to do

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.029 
the eyes and then we're going to do
three<00:00:48.930> Wiggles<00:00:49.379> at<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> bottom<00:00:50.070> for<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> nose

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
three Wiggles at the bottom for the nose

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.939 
three Wiggles at the bottom for the nose
there<00:00:53.039> we<00:00:53.160> go<00:00:53.809> okay<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> inside<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
there we go okay on the inside of the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.560 
there we go okay on the inside of the
eyes<00:00:56.100> what<00:00:56.640> we're<00:00:56.760> going<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.940> do<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.329> a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
eyes what we're going to do is a

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.630 
eyes what we're going to do is a
reflection<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.649> circle<00:00:58.980> at<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.100> top<00:00:59.190> and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
reflection so the circle at the top and

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.340 
reflection so the circle at the top and
then<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> black<00:01:00.270> circle<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.899> middle<00:01:00.930> which

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
then a black circle in the middle which

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.429 
then a black circle in the middle which
we<00:01:01.559> color<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.309> that's<00:01:02.609> our<00:01:02.820> pupil<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:04.260> one

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
we color in and that's our pupil so one

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.899 
we color in and that's our pupil so one
at<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.680> top<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.129> then<00:01:05.250> one<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> middle

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
at the top and then one in the middle

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.700 
at the top and then one in the middle
and<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.360> middle<00:01:06.570> one<00:01:06.659> gets<00:01:06.869> colored<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.290> okay

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
and the middle one gets colored in okay

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.200 
and the middle one gets colored in okay
from<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.189> nose<00:01:08.400> we're<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:09.000> two

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
from the nose we're going to do two

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.510 
from the nose we're going to do two
lines<00:01:09.510> down<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.409> then<00:01:11.070> we're<00:01:11.189> going<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.340> do

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
lines down and then we're going to do

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.420 
lines down and then we're going to do
lips<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:12.960> I'm<00:01:13.049> going<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.260> do<00:01:13.380> two<00:01:13.650> bumps<00:01:14.010> here

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
lips so I'm going to do two bumps here

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.980 
lips so I'm going to do two bumps here
and<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:15.600> curve<00:01:16.140> underneath<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.659> now<00:01:18.659> I'm<00:01:18.780> going

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
and a curve underneath and now I'm going

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.170 
and a curve underneath and now I'm going
to<00:01:19.080> do<00:01:19.290> my<00:01:19.500> cheek<00:01:19.740> my<00:01:20.340> chin<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.090> my<00:01:21.750> cheek<00:01:22.049> so

to do my cheek my chin and my cheek so

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.149 
to do my cheek my chin and my cheek so
start<00:01:24.180> basically<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.290> line<00:01:25.710> with<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> eyes

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
start basically in line with the eyes

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.340 
start basically in line with the eyes
and<00:01:26.189> come<00:01:27.060> down<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.630> around<00:01:27.840> under<00:01:28.320> your

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
and come down and around under your

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.370 
and come down and around under your
mouth<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.979> then<00:01:29.670> two<00:01:30.000> ears<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> bit<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.259> a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
mouth and then two ears with a bit of a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.530 
mouth and then two ears with a bit of a
hook<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.710> there<00:01:31.950> another<00:01:32.610> one<00:01:32.820> over<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.240> side

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
hook in there another one over this side

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.890 
hook in there another one over this side
with<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.990> bit<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.259> hook<00:01:35.060> all<00:01:36.060> right<00:01:36.240> now<00:01:36.689> a

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
with a bit of a hook all right now a

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.780 
with a bit of a hook all right now a
line<00:01:37.170> goes<00:01:37.439> straight<00:01:37.770> across<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.340> top<00:01:38.549> from

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
line goes straight across the top from

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.130 
line goes straight across the top from
ear<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.180> ear<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:40.579> then<00:01:41.579> we're<00:01:42.180> going<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.479> do<00:01:42.689> a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
ear to ear and then we're going to do a

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.530 
ear to ear and then we're going to do a
line<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.950> goes<00:01:44.189> up<00:01:44.460> across<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.270> back<00:01:45.390> down

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
line that goes up across and back down

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.569 
line that goes up across and back down
it's<00:01:45.869> basically<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.009> shape<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.460> rectangle

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
it's basically the shape of a rectangle

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.789 
it's basically the shape of a rectangle
and<00:01:48.180> then<00:01:48.630> within<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.229> we're<00:01:49.439> going<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.619> do

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
and then within that we're going to do

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.310 
and then within that we're going to do
more<00:01:50.130> rectangles<00:01:50.909> they<00:01:51.840> sort<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.110> look<00:01:52.259> like

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
more rectangles they sort of look like

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.550 
more rectangles they sort of look like
the<00:01:52.590> keys<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> piano<00:01:54.079> straight<00:01:55.079> across<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
the keys on a piano straight across the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.880 
the keys on a piano straight across the
top<00:01:55.880> okay<00:01:56.880> from<00:01:57.060> his<00:01:57.270> chin<00:01:57.719> we're<00:01:58.290> going<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.740> do
