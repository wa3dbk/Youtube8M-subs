00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.230
 Hello 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.600
 in this video I will show how the settings 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.280
 effective mouse control 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.790
 using those settings that are now 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.790
 will show 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.469
 blurry barrel 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.090
 also for example fly like this up 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.840
 kicked 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.840
 I leveled the plane 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.660
 or the like that the sides 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.010
 so go to settings 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:57.070
 here the control circuit must stand 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:01:00.530
 mouse muscular settings 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.260
 default mouse sensitivity is 50 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.600
 percent mouse sensitivity you 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.040
 can either put the maximum or 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.990
 to customize 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:15.070
 I set it to default 50 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.070
 percent click on advanced settings 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.020
 and check the camera binding is important 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.890
 stand 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:36.320
 setting the mouse inertia horizon 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:40.979
 set the alignment speed to 0 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:47.000
 also set to 0 intimacy 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.000
 cream choose the maximum value 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:55.160
 size guests vision is also maximum 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:58.380
 value size alignment area 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.630
 remove the depth 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.280
 areas of coup about 90 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:09.509
 percent if 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.310
 there are ticks on the vertical version of ibo 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.530
 position limit other than land 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.530
 automatically and flaps need to be removed 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.530
 click apply okay 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.890
 in the control settings, select all 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:37.990
 and look for such action as bend 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.990
 backwards 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:48.840
 set space on button 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:53.790
 apply the next action on the heel 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:03:02.810
 set left on to roll 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:02.810
 right on d also apply and ok 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:10.340
 Tell me what advantages 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.340
 give us such control settings 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.290
 press a button and 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.600
 see that the plane started spinning around 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.970
 its axis 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.970
 yes aerobatics is called. 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.650
 push up the plane to be sugar 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:46.599
 I'm doing a blurry barrel is necessary 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.599
 press the button and the spacebar simultaneously 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.960
 or button and space 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.190
 since the alignment we put on 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.880
 zero ie plane pier is not 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.880
 leveled 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.100
 and align by pressing the buttons go we 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.910
 we can turn the plane because children 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.910
 upside down 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.410
 sides 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:32.540
 Now we will land the plane on the tail 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:40.210
 I start to perform a different barrel if this 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:40.210
 the plane can not get 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.500
 this case bot 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.539
 so you want to fight try 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:24.849
 The advantages of this right are also possible with 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:27.819
 using such a barrel evade 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:31.180
 frontal attack that is, move away from 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:33.280
 the enemy when he hung on the tail here 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.410
 You can specially otsadit playing 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.830
 with partner and partner will already be this 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:40.560
 code to shoot basically everything I wanted 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.590
 to show 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.740
 put varnishes subscribe to my videos 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:52.630
 the next video will be about how 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:55.199
 effectively do before all saying goodbye 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.199
 she is all good
