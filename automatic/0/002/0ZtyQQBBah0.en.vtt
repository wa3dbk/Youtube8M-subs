 someone will see it and it will give me gems 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.930

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.930
 gems 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.170

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.829

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:14.300
 familiar or not this can not be 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.300

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.499
 Well, it's better 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.180

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:24.220

 after a long day of work 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.030
 virtual it's time to play a little 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.430
 a moment I can not play a game about 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.100

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.190

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.730

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.730
 that the game is over 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.420

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.420
 soda 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:14.180

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.180
 ironic game over 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.870

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.870
