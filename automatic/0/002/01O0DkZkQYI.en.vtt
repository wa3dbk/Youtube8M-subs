00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
believe a 6 XL if I'm not mistaken it

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.370 
believe a 6 XL if I'm not mistaken it
might<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> 6<00:01:31.500> XL<00:01:31.979> or<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.610> 7<00:01:33.030> XL<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.960> goes<00:01:34.350> up

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
might be a 6 XL or a 7 XL but it goes up

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.609 
might be a 6 XL or a 7 XL but it goes up
really<00:01:34.829> pretty<00:01:35.100> high<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.970> ranges<00:01:36.600> for<00:01:36.930> sizes

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
really pretty high in ranges for sizes

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.350 
really pretty high in ranges for sizes
so<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.130> really<00:01:38.400> like<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.939> doesn't<00:01:39.150> just

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
so I really like that it doesn't just

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.149 
so I really like that it doesn't just
cater<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:40.110> one

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
cater to one

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.440 
cater to one
six<00:01:41.549> eyes<00:01:41.789> but<00:01:42.179> it<00:01:42.600> caters<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.020> all<00:01:43.439> sizes<00:01:43.829> so

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
six eyes but it caters to all sizes so

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.059 
six eyes but it caters to all sizes so
definitely<00:01:45.450> check<00:01:45.569> them<00:01:46.049> out<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.530> prices<00:01:46.920> are
