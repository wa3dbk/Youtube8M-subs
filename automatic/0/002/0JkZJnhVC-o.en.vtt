excess ground and also there during the
tamping<00:01:39.990> process<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.829> lost<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.250> little

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
tamping process and you lost a little

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.300 
tamping process and you lost a little
bit<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> side<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:43.470> mean<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.770> wastage

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
bit on the side and I mean that wastage

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.730 
bit on the side and I mean that wastage
how<00:01:44.549> much<00:01:44.850> would<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.270> account<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.710> a

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
how much would that account for for a

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.620 
how much would that account for for a
normal<00:01:47.220> sort<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.430> cafe<00:01:47.880> day-to-day<00:01:48.329> running

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
through how it works I mean take what is

through how it works I mean take what is
what's<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.510> big<00:02:33.630> idea<00:02:33.750> here<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.470> came

what's the big idea here that you came
up<00:02:34.770> with<00:02:34.950> yeah<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:35.820> we<00:02:35.970> identified<00:02:36.570> that

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
up with yeah so we identified that

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.920 
up with yeah so we identified that
problem<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:38.070> bin<00:02:38.220> was<00:02:38.400> just<00:02:38.580> talking<00:02:38.850> about

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
problem that bin was just talking about

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.570 
problem that bin was just talking about
its<00:02:39.930> we<00:02:40.260> found<00:02:40.709> out<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:40.980> was<00:02:41.070> about<00:02:41.280> sort<00:02:41.550> of

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
its we found out it was about sort of

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.310 
its we found out it was about sort of
five<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.970> ten<00:02:42.120> percent<00:02:42.480> maybe<00:02:42.630> an<00:02:42.870> average<00:02:43.170> of

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
five to ten percent maybe an average of

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.130 
five to ten percent maybe an average of
eight<00:02:43.560> percent<00:02:44.010> waste<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:45.510> we<00:02:45.630> just<00:02:45.870> came<00:02:46.080> up

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
eight percent waste so we just came up

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.140 
eight percent waste so we just came up
with<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.410> solution<00:02:46.620> which<00:02:47.160> we<00:02:47.820> sort<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.030> started

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
with a solution which we sort of started

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.930 
with a solution which we sort of started
with<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.980> little<00:02:49.980> muffin<00:02:50.310> tray<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:50.760> just

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
with a little muffin tray and just

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.840 
with a little muffin tray and just
hacked<00:02:51.150> sword<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:52.160> sort<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.220> bottom<00:02:53.520> off<00:02:53.640> it

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
hacked sword the sort of bottom off it

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.570 
hacked sword the sort of bottom off it
and<00:02:54.030> so<00:02:54.300> that<00:02:54.330> it<00:02:54.510> acted<00:02:54.810> as<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:54.959> little<00:02:55.200> funnel

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
and so that it acted as a little funnel

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.730 
and so that it acted as a little funnel
and<00:02:56.580> then<00:02:56.790> we<00:02:57.030> we<00:02:57.540> sort<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.810> talked<00:02:58.530> some

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
and then we we sort of talked some

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.530 
and then we we sort of talked some
engineering<00:02:59.190> companies<00:02:59.580> and<00:02:59.820> got<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.090> proper

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
engineering companies and got a proper

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.780 
engineering companies and got a proper
sort<00:03:01.020> of<00:03:01.140> stainless<00:03:01.560> steel<00:03:01.590> funnel<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.640> then

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
sort of stainless steel funnel and then

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.640 
sort of stainless steel funnel and then
attached<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.209> little<00:03:03.330> handle<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.020> so<00:03:04.620> that

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
attached a little handle to it so that

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.440 
attached a little handle to it so that
you<00:03:04.950> can<00:03:05.100> put<00:03:05.280> your<00:03:05.400> thumb<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:06.030> bruster<00:03:06.240> can

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
you can put your thumb the bruster can

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.050 
you can put your thumb the bruster can
put<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.720> thumb<00:03:06.959> on<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.260> handle<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:08.670> the

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
put the thumb on the handle and the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.000 
put the thumb on the handle and the
funnel<00:03:09.330> obviously<00:03:09.660> sits<00:03:09.900> on<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.260> basket<00:03:10.920> of

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
funnel obviously sits on the basket of

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.979 
funnel obviously sits on the basket of
the<00:03:11.100> Porta<00:03:11.310> filter<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:12.239> when<00:03:12.390> when<00:03:12.660> they<00:03:12.780> put

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
the Porta filter so when when they put

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.740 
the Porta filter so when when they put
it<00:03:13.080> under<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.380> grinder<00:03:13.920> at<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:15.180> funnel<00:03:15.510> stops

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
it under the grinder at the funnel stops

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.090 
it under the grinder at the funnel stops
the<00:03:15.930> coffee<00:03:16.110> grinds<00:03:16.410> from<00:03:16.590> falling<00:03:16.830> over<00:03:16.920> the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
the coffee grinds from falling over the

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.740 
the coffee grinds from falling over the
edge<00:03:17.220> josan<00:03:18.060> action<00:03:18.360> been<00:03:18.510> because

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
edge josan action been because

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.750 
edge josan action been because
essentially<00:03:19.110> it's<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.410> flu<00:03:19.769> that<00:03:20.130> sort<00:03:20.370> of<00:03:20.430> sits

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
essentially it's a flu that sort of sits

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.479 
essentially it's a flu that sort of sits
on<00:03:20.970> top<00:03:21.239> of<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.750> little<00:03:22.620> mental<00:03:22.920> receptacle

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
on top of the little mental receptacle

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.970 
on top of the little mental receptacle
isn't<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.760> it's<00:03:23.910> like<00:03:24.060> it's<00:03:24.420> like<00:03:24.510> a

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
isn't it it's like it's like a

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.440 
isn't it it's like it's like a
centimeter<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.190> half<00:03:26.370> lid<00:03:26.730> yeah<00:03:27.120> it's<00:03:27.300> just

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
centimeter and a half lid yeah it's just

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.330 
centimeter and a half lid yeah it's just
that<00:03:27.570> really<00:03:28.230> is<00:03:28.350> just<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.620> tiny<00:03:28.830> we<00:03:29.010> funnel

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
that really is just a tiny we funnel

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.580 
that really is just a tiny we funnel
that<00:03:29.880> sits<00:03:30.090> over<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.480> see<00:03:30.660> at<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.320> point

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
that sits over and you see at that point

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.900 
that sits over and you see at that point
it<00:03:31.680> was<00:03:31.739> nothing<00:03:32.070> spotted<00:03:32.370> other<00:03:32.550> side<00:03:32.730> it's

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
it was nothing spotted other side it's

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.790 
it was nothing spotted other side it's
all<00:03:33.030> so<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:33.959> can<00:03:34.080> see<00:03:34.260> what<00:03:34.380> would<00:03:34.560> fall<00:03:34.769> over

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
all so you can see what would fall over

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.710 
all so you can see what would fall over
is<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.880> sitting<00:03:36.120> on<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.269> outside<00:03:36.570> of<00:03:36.660> the

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
is it sitting on the outside of the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.750 
is it sitting on the outside of the
funnel<00:03:36.989> there<00:03:37.140> and<00:03:37.650> as<00:03:37.800> we<00:03:37.950> tap<00:03:38.160> it<00:03:38.640> all

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
funnel there and as we tap it all

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.009 
funnel there and as we tap it all
settles<00:03:39.060> nicely<00:03:39.390> into<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.630> porter<00:03:39.870> filter

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
settles nicely into the porter filter

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.500 
settles nicely into the porter filter
and<00:03:40.610> then

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
and then

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.240 
and then
10<00:03:43.760> polish<00:03:44.930> done<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.290> no<00:03:46.470> this<00:03:46.769> was<00:03:47.010> nothing

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
10 polish done and no this was nothing

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.369 
10 polish done and no this was nothing
well<00:03:47.970> very<00:03:48.329> minimal<00:03:48.810> but<00:03:48.959> pretty<00:03:49.319> much

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
well very minimal but pretty much

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.130 
well very minimal but pretty much
nothing<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:50.129> you<00:03:50.879> know<00:03:51.000> apart<00:03:51.390> from<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:52.110> fact

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
nothing and you know apart from the fact

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.410 
nothing and you know apart from the fact
that<00:03:52.409> we've<00:03:53.069> wasted<00:03:53.250> nothing<00:03:53.819> so<00:03:54.299> we're<00:03:54.390> not

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
that we've wasted nothing so we're not

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.679 
that we've wasted nothing so we're not
wasting<00:03:54.629> any<00:03:54.930> money<00:03:55.110> we<00:03:56.010> know<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.250> that<00:03:56.760> that

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
wasting any money we know that that that

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.240 
wasting any money we know that that that
coffee<00:03:57.989> is<00:03:58.140> going<00:03:58.379> to<00:03:58.439> have<00:03:58.560> 22<00:03:58.920> grams<00:03:59.099> of

machine<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:12.750> mean<00:04:12.989> you<00:04:13.140> you're<00:04:13.829> expending<00:04:14.220> a

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
machine I mean you you're expending a

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.580 
machine I mean you you're expending a
lot<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.489> energy<00:04:14.640> how<00:04:15.420> much<00:04:15.750> more<00:04:16.109> does<00:04:16.350> this

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
lot of energy how much more does this

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.229 
lot of energy how much more does this
add<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:17.100> process<00:04:17.549> of<00:04:17.669> making<00:04:17.970> a<00:04:18.030> coffee

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
add to the process of making a coffee

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.340 
add to the process of making a coffee
the<00:04:18.479> fact<00:04:18.660> you've<00:04:18.750> got<00:04:18.870> to<00:04:18.959> put<00:04:19.109> on<00:04:19.229> this

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
the fact you've got to put on this

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.110 
the fact you've got to put on this
little<00:04:19.560> sort<00:04:19.829> of<00:04:19.889> filter<00:04:20.160> unit<00:04:20.699> this<00:04:20.789> flow

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
little sort of filter unit this flow

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.629 
little sort of filter unit this flow
onto<00:04:21.359> your<00:04:21.630> basket<00:04:22.139> when<00:04:22.470> we<00:04:22.590> first<00:04:22.770> saw<00:04:22.979> it<00:04:23.010> we

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
onto your basket when we first saw it we

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.580 
onto your basket when we first saw it we
did<00:04:23.820> think<00:04:24.060> her<00:04:24.270> maybe<00:04:24.990> that's<00:04:25.229> going<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.440> take

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
did think her maybe that's going to take

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.350 
did think her maybe that's going to take
an<00:04:25.740> extra<00:04:25.979> step<00:04:26.039> of<00:04:26.400> work<00:04:26.789> and<00:04:27.030> it's<00:04:27.120> going<00:04:27.300> to

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
an extra step of work and it's going to

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.000 
an extra step of work and it's going to
be<00:04:27.449> a<00:04:27.479> bit<00:04:27.630> more<00:04:27.720> difficult<00:04:27.780> but<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:28.650> really<00:04:28.830> is

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
be a bit more difficult but it really is

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.890 
be a bit more difficult but it really is
quite<00:04:29.130> an<00:04:29.430> actual<00:04:29.699> thing<00:04:29.880> just<00:04:30.330> put<00:04:30.720> it<00:04:30.810> on

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
quite an actual thing just put it on

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.840 
quite an actual thing just put it on
your<00:04:31.050> thumbs<00:04:31.260> already<00:04:31.560> there<00:04:31.740> it's<00:04:32.400> sort<00:04:32.520> of<00:04:32.639> a

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
your thumbs already there it's sort of a

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.370 
your thumbs already there it's sort of a
molds<00:04:33.300> itself<00:04:33.389> to<00:04:33.690> how<00:04:33.780> you<00:04:33.840> hold<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.199> hand

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
molds itself to how you hold the hand

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.830 
molds itself to how you hold the hand
the<00:04:34.710> portafilter<00:04:35.039> handle<00:04:35.430> anyway<00:04:35.729> and<00:04:36.060> so

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
the portafilter handle anyway and so

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.050 
the portafilter handle anyway and so
we've<00:04:37.139> found<00:04:37.320> it's<00:04:37.620> not<00:04:37.919> slowed<00:04:38.130> us<00:04:38.250> down<00:04:38.280> even

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
we've found it's not slowed us down even

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.129 
we've found it's not slowed us down even
a<00:04:39.120> little<00:04:39.270> bit<00:04:39.360> just<00:04:39.630> part<00:04:39.870> of<00:04:39.900> a<00:04:39.990> national

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
a little bit just part of a national

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.800 
a little bit just part of a national
routine<00:04:40.680> so<00:04:41.160> yeah<00:04:41.550> we're<00:04:41.729> quite<00:04:41.880> quite

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
routine so yeah we're quite quite

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.360 
routine so yeah we're quite quite
formula<00:04:43.199> and<00:04:43.530> it<00:04:43.650> does<00:04:43.830> I<00:04:43.860> mean<00:04:44.010> it<00:04:44.130> looks
