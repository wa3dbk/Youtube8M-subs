00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.979
 the crazy ones we also recycle 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.180
 3 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.810
 greetings community of birds how they 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.730
 I'm the car on this beautiful day 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.759
 Wednesday I have a new recipe to the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.610
 grill to show you almost any 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.529
 cut not to say all can be done 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.210
 grilled but sometimes we grab a 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.730
 little bit afraid to try new things 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.760
 because we do not know if it can go hard or 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.370
 without flavor with whatever it is today we are going to 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.829
 disprove a myth that is said about the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.770
 pechito that only comes out rich in the oven 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.860
 milanesa nothing not that is not like that gentlemen 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.520
 let's make a little flat grill going 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.190
 to be luxury well tasty well good 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.079
 soft 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:04.690
 the recipe is simple it only takes pepper 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.580
 come out and here we have the little bit 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.310
 is a cut that is in the 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.190
 back room of the network is round 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.620
 it is usually used to make milanesas or 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.410
 to cook in the oven but that happens 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.030
 because nobody tried it on the grill in 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.490
 other countries as in brazil is known 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.920
 as well strong lizard in Mexico 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.200
 venezuela boys and so ends the 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.750
 mini class of the day now let's start 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.520
 do to the presiento we retire it 30 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.830
 minutes before the hillsides so you do not 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.450
 it's so cold like that when we get it to 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.790
 the grill does not undergo a change of 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.940
 very large temperature and do not strain 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:44.230
 and then come out hard 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:46.540
 and a beauty to see that little by little 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.970
 start to perspire this is the time 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.659
 to add a good layer of salt 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.179
 thick or salt barbecue 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:59.329
 do not be afraid of going over the salt 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.329
 with the soil absorb what they need 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:11.110
 birth 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.630
 This end is to total taste and likes a 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.030
 little more spicy and more 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.130
 we have the one who films us who loves 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.310
 the spicy so we're going to get him 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.120
 it's not worth it and now if we went to the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.980
 grill look what 's grill 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.980
 pure pure Argentinean meat of ours 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.960
 before and the whole objective is in a 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.960
 principle seal it well on medium heat 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.650
 8 seconds of heat has to 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.269
 hold your hand and so we will leave 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.510
 approximately for 8 to 10 minutes per 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.159
 side until they are browned and then you 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.440
 let's remove the heat and do it to 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.440
 slow fire will no longer see 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.270
 so it has to look great very well now 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.010
 but beware, there is still a little bit 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.990
 raw of some loquito that eat it 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.450
 well but we do not 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.760
 now you have to lower the game a little 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.470
 lower the temperature 10 seconds the 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.040
 heat has to hold hands more or 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.860
 less and so the new one or cook for 20 to 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.920
 25 minutes on each side everything depends on the 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.110
 size of what is the small 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.810
 for the wait a beer africa not 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.790
 may be missing 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.030
 and with a table of heights is a 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.450
 festival we are going to arm it and take it to 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.450
 the guys 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.960

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.960
 yes yes yes 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:53.410
 an hour has passed and everything is almost almost 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.930
 ready that they do not even think about puncturing it nor 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.310
 cut it to see how it's coming because if 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.530
 you will not lose all the games that 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.920

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.319
 is going to dry everything ready the peceto what 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.110
 let's do now let it rest for 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.299
 7 minutes so that for the juices to 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.760
 inside settle down and the meat relax 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:16.200
 so that when we cut it, do not lose 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.200
 everything and do not feel better 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.130
