00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.250
 ill today in this video already 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.140
 brand new info about the next one 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.580
 dlc which is expected in ours 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.170
 I have already yesterday video 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.880
 may tell about works for games 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.439
 indirectly the next dlc itself 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.090
 has confirmed and that while doing 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.680
 It is allowed to walk in the race 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.989
 such mega ramona so what 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.279
 can place and this information has the 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.599
 the mod hedgefunds just before 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.610
 some weeks found 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.590
 and this info I have just this 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.270
 Video is going to have the month 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.440
 Fans just found out again 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.940
 means you can definitely him 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.079
 Trust it is as I said only lies 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.120
 The bus is not rockstar games 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.620
 but just confirms the motto jazz 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.059
 fans and he already has so many 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.530
 things predicted such as the 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.929
 blow ring and then he is actually 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.969
 get the update with the egon genz 2 or 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.929
 it is precisely this in this he just has it 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.879
 even a few weeks ago 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.010
 predicted and now rockstar 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.749
 games she has then published herself 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.460
 So you realize you can open one 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:03.230
 trust each case correctly and yes how 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.030
 said this info about that 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.610
 next dlc come just from them 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.100
 yes the dlc which name the goal too 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.050
 wear and it will probably be a dlc with 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.180
 the nameless thing you do not know exactly 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.130
 but he has just been in coaching 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.180
 gta 5 something with the code name 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.770
 found 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.630
 the code name lothar that could be now 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.159
 just mean that it is just in the low rider 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.689
 So is such vehicles such as 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.729
 example, the virtual that something like that 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.469
 such classic lauda or it is 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.390
 just the opposite of highlife so 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:30.920
 just about everything that should be cheap 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.930
 a cheap dc I say so now 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.920
 with many cheap things you know 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.719
 not exactly in any case 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.430
 something with the name going on as an example 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.950
 he just brought that to those 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.469
 god games dlcs that's just the code 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.360
 name lux was and with this dlc is even 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.149
 the code name in kolding of gta 5 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.530
 yes, he has now out in the ever 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.969
 it is said that it will probably something 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.159
 be cheap or just with rental bikes 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.049
 then just one more ahead 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.119
 and indeed it seems that way 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.649
 rockstar games are just getting involved with dcs 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.479
 bit repeated and because he has 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.700
 noted that the spouses games part 1 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.619
 &amp; 2 dlc also a bit more 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.079
 Highlife dlc fit means many expensive 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.720
 Vehicles luxury apartments and general 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.369
 pretty expensive items and now 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.750
 he compares just this low update 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.040
 which will expect us with the 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.750
 hipster update that we had at that time 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.970
 and I think you can definitely 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.110
 Pretty good comparison and me 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.790
 think this comparison is pretty 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.890
 right because if you do this time 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.510
 look at hipster dlc or at 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.250
 a little bit back the hdl c 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.110
 if you already played gta 5 there 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.640
 has been there a bit already 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.930
 you also have a lot of cars 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.010
 get and those cars go there 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.380
 everyone was pretty 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.730
 Cheap were just such old cars 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.290
 from the 70s such typical 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.390
 Hipster cars you just got there 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.910
 and not really expensive supercars 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.920
 So all pretty cheap cars and 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.209
 he thinks that this very low dlc what 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.320
 We will also expect in this 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.690
 To go is called many 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.400
 vehicles and just cheap 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.930
 Vehicles and just for that 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.209
 he also has the vehicles 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.160
 found out that this low update 12 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.780
 bring new vehicles 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.100
 he has the vehicles now too 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.080
 but I already found out 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.130
 can with these twelve names the vines 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.940
 has not found out yet really 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.110
 start a lot 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.180
 but I would say we look 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.100
 this all this once on he has yes 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.000
 a complete list of all twelve 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.019
 coatings, so to speak, creates all twelve 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.800
 just found out then still the 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.930
 names to it 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.070
 and yes I was through this list of the 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.570
 Whole vehicles is just in the 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.190
 embed background and you see already 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.290
 that she's a bit weird out of mine 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.360
 names such as virtue chino or 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.190
 that's all the vehicles that learn 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.200
 we already have in the game already 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.549
 or you had in the game and find that 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.750
 I'm pretty funny that's me 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.430
 all so a bit repetitive and im 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.780
 principle only others pay 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.209
 are written behind these names 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.880
 become like for example from o2 world 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.900
 to 33 and so on and so on 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.519
 unfortunately you can find with these names 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.500
 do not start very much 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.239
 and I'm curious in any case 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.480
 what exactly is waiting for us now 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.769
 becomes 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.480
 But I think you can definitely 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.820
 it's going to hold on to everyone 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.620
 if a dlc be what you are going in the direction 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.700
 Vehicles and mega ramps is the 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.530
 rockstar games has the wg already on 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.030
 beginning said confirmed itself already in 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.920
 that such mega ram and mega 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.420
 loopings and something will happen and now 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.340
 he just found out that it was 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.560
 because just in general is going his things 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.850
 Lorraine has many vehicles and 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.959
 ramps I find the whole match as a 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.579
 bit to say I'm definitely 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.320
 curious what is still waiting for us 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.519
 Of course you will always write yours 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.780
 opinion and take the comments what 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.170
 Do you think about it? I think of everyone 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.380
 case 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.510
 this will become the main card of this one 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.160
 the main point of the DLC is that it is just around 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.419
 many vehicles and this country race 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.019
 we go as I said your opinion 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.250
 below 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.930
 in the comments I hope, of course 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.340
 always that I changed the video though 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.080
 in the test ampoule now on the way what 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.090
 a movie is a 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.090
 skin purely people fire krems
