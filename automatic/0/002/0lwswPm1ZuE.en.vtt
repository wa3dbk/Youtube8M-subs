00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:17.870 
just gonna cover it very lightly because
the<00:03:09.600> seeds<00:03:09.870> are<00:03:10.050> so<00:03:10.200> small<00:03:15.350> but<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.730> right<00:03:17.730> up

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
the seeds are so small but the right up

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.660 
the seeds are so small but the right up
one<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.300> said<00:03:18.510> covered<00:03:18.960> some<00:03:19.740> some<00:03:20.160> some

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
one it said covered some some some

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.760 
one it said covered some some some
places<00:03:20.970> they<00:03:21.270> cover<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.660> with<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:22.070> half-inch<00:03:23.510> I

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
places they cover it with a half-inch I

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.070 
places they cover it with a half-inch I
think<00:03:25.770> that's<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.040> bit<00:03:26.220> much<00:03:26.570> as<00:03:27.570> small<00:03:27.960> as

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
think that's a bit much as small as

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.930 
think that's a bit much as small as
these<00:03:28.230> seeds<00:03:28.500> are

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:39.000 

I<00:03:35.470> gets<00:03:36.470> enough<00:03:36.770> seed<00:03:37.070> there<00:03:37.400> yeah<00:03:37.910> let<00:03:38.180> me

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
I gets enough seed there yeah let me

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.320 
I gets enough seed there yeah let me
pinch<00:03:40.010> your<00:03:40.190> little<00:03:40.520> light<00:03:40.670> on<00:03:40.700> one<00:03:41.030> side

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
pinch your little light on one side

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:59.470 
pinch your little light on one side
there<00:03:51.070> seal<00:03:52.070> it<00:03:52.160> back<00:03:52.370> up<00:03:57.520> there<00:03:58.520> now<00:03:59.390> I'm

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
there seal it back up there now I'm

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.840 
there seal it back up there now I'm
gonna<00:03:59.630> cover<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:00.410> with<00:04:00.560> a<00:04:00.590> light<00:04:01.190> coating<00:04:01.610> of

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
gonna cover it with a light coating of

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:26.960 
gonna cover it with a light coating of
seed<00:04:02.810> starting<00:04:03.290> mix

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:38.090 

around<00:04:27.970> spread<00:04:28.750> it<00:04:28.900> around<00:04:29.050> nice<00:04:29.560> and<00:04:29.770> evenly

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.900

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
he said I didn't plant any my cover with

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.930 
he said I didn't plant any my cover with
that<00:04:43.090> quarter-inch<00:04:43.930> sherry<00:04:44.460> you<00:04:45.460> can<00:04:45.640> you

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
that quarter-inch sherry you can you

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.340 
that quarter-inch sherry you can you
could<00:04:46.120> still<00:04:46.720> see<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.880> edge<00:04:48.880> of<00:04:49.060> that<00:04:49.350> pot

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
upon the seed there that one geranium

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.530 
upon the seed there that one geranium
did<00:07:04.390> very<00:07:05.020> nicely<00:07:05.320> the<00:07:05.620> other<00:07:05.770> one<00:07:06.300> not<00:07:07.300> so

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.560 
like I said is the puzzle say it's like
the<00:07:31.060> first<00:07:31.270> time<00:07:31.450> cuz<00:07:31.930> I<00:07:32.850> was<00:07:33.850> probably<00:07:34.120> a<00:07:34.270> kid

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:34.570 
the first time cuz I was probably a kid
