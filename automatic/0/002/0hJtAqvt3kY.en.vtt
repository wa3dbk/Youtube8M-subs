00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.340
 to make a boxwood or hot 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.849
 we will need powders for bossing 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.120
 of any type and color an ink 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.579
 transparent pad for boxing that 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.809
 it is the characteristic of drying out a lot 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.150
 slowly 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:46.620
 so if you have time to apply 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:51.010
 dusts of the stamps are fine by 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:54.560
 any type even these to be mounted 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:58.130
 so obviously the acrylic block 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:03.590
 where to put the stamp a container 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:07.010
 like this for excess dust e 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.760
 light gun that emits only heat and not 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.770
 air 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.340
 in this way it will not fly 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.340
 powders 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.900
 let's start wetting the stamp with 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.900
 the ink 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.250
 then we stamp on the card 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.460
 now over the container we sprinkle the 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.460
 white powder stamp 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.700
 once the accesses of 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:18.070
 dust we use light gun for 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.070
 heat granules and let them dissolve 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.230
 we use the container for 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.230
 recover unused dust 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.520
 clean up the stamp with a simple one 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.520
 wet towel 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.580
 we repeat the same operation for the 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:08.620
 transparent powder that will only create 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.620
 a tone on tone on the card 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.000
 finally we use a powder 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.000
 glittery gold color 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.960
 next time and good work
