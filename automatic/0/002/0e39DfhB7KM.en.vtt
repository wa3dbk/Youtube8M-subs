 it goes here in the snow and from restaurant simple this you can do more 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:20.019
 tell about the restaurant that has just opened and that is good at that time 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.899
 and yes we are just almost every day according to her remains a very good one 

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.390
 had the good reviews 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.729
 that of course always applies to me at the start of the restaurant 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:34.069
 in addition for the city's real waters it is a welcome change 

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:35.860
 We are very happy with them 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.720
 0 2 that actually all start a restaurant themselves 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.540
 He always returned to restaurants and worked on it was always sort of 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.730
 starting point 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.390
 Today a child does not want to leave their own restaurant if I am up for it 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.810
 I've been looking for a building in Amsterdam and Haarlem in it 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.810
 utrecht many countries are not going smoothly and 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.440
 yes that actually went any concept fast company was viewed 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.410
 of an injection of starred restaurant refused internationally 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.700
 Kanye in Florida to see the work in the square of the city 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.390
 well i don't know if you actually have direct influence on seeing me again 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.090
 am a bit of the one 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.180
 of the few traffic jams I focus on the board I got rid of it 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.320
 that is not the case that I throw most of the principles overboard for weeks on the road 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.790
 of cooking but more to look at the tastes you empty on the plate me 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.830
 do not want too much taste I want to limit 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.950
 one and I think we just 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.150
 of course use modern techniques but at least really alone 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.880
 for necessary things 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.820
 and I also think that I have a very big fun cup and that parking guests 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.049
 up to now, that went very well, what we like to do as we always have 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.520
 finding important what was important is really a follower from the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.890
 kitchen with with the dishes 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.900
 Yes, that's possible 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.950
 that gives an extra dimension to the table people like to be the chef 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.840
 to speak 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.220
 but the interaction between front and back is also very important like that 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.409
 not correct or did not go through at first 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.469
 then you notice that you do not sit at the table either, there was a lot loose 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:19.169
 with the pilot in the nail showers 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:23.729
 that is not neat and this small kitchen from this leather aprons walk there 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:24.290
 also in 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.690
 the music channel mtv 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.060
 tap harder you often know 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.109
 the intention 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:32.169
 yes i think it's nice that easy anp 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:36.179
 a potty raises reasonable of this time but what it is important that 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:37.769
 quality a portrait the knife 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:38.679
 9 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:42.729
 your name is 548 euros or not very much but it is the first thing you do 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.589
 ford that must be enough 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:50.199
 state 8 that is our philosophy and that must really be propagated 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:54.579
 but I really enjoy working with each other like that if I don't 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.759
 idea would be to make your guests work
