00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
some of the problems that can be

some of the problems that can be

and<00:00:15.360> speak<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:16.910> about<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.270> topic<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:19.080> think

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
and speak to about this topic I think

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.730 
and speak to about this topic I think
we've<00:00:21.420> talked<00:00:21.689> about<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.080> problems<00:00:22.230> with<00:00:22.560> hip

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
we've talked about the problems with hip

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.790 
we've talked about the problems with hip
resurfacing<00:00:23.359> over<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.480> years<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.140> as<00:00:25.410> of

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.269 
resurfacing over the years and as of
2010<00:00:26.580> it's<00:00:26.849> even<00:00:27.510> easier<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.099> discuss<00:00:29.099> this

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
2010 it's even easier to discuss this

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.099 
2010 it's even easier to discuss this
issue<00:00:29.460> because<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.090> much<00:00:30.240> information<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.960> now

edge to edge motion it's only 69 degrees
and<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:26.250> can<00:02:26.430> just<00:02:26.640> see<00:02:26.820> that<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.239> poor<00:02:27.480> head

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660

and you can just see that the poor head
neck<00:02:27.870> ratio<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.650> thing<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:28.920> leads<00:02:29.310> to

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
neck ratio is the thing that leads to

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.520 
neck ratio is the thing that leads to
reduce<00:02:30.239> range<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.750> motion<00:02:31.109> and<00:02:31.230> impingement

reduce range of motion and impingement
and<00:02:32.540> what<00:02:33.540> this<00:02:33.750> does<00:02:34.079> actually<00:02:34.440> is<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.400> leads

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
and what this does actually is it leads

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.449 
and what this does actually is it leads
to<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.180> number<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.780> things<00:02:37.019> limits<00:02:37.859> the<00:02:38.010> motion

2007 the dislocation rate is 1.8 percent

now<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:20.310> getting<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.819> that<00:03:20.940> point<00:03:21.269> one<00:03:21.810> reason

now so getting to that point one reason

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.719 
now so getting to that point one reason
is<00:03:22.380> that<00:03:22.410> they<00:03:22.739> have<00:03:22.950> reduced<00:03:23.130> range<00:03:23.549> of

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:23.729 
is that they have reduced range of

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:25.939 
is that they have reduced range of
motion<00:03:24.060> so<00:03:24.090> this<00:03:24.359> class<00:03:24.600> is<00:03:24.660> impingement<00:03:25.500> but

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
motion so this class is impingement but

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:27.770 
motion so this class is impingement but
why<00:03:26.130> else<00:03:26.370> do<00:03:26.579> these<00:03:26.729> hips<00:03:26.970> dislocate<00:03:27.570> more

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
why else do these hips dislocate more

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.080 
why else do these hips dislocate more
often<00:03:28.139> in<00:03:28.919> order<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.280> do<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.579> surgery<00:03:29.790> you

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
often in order to do the surgery you

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.740 
often in order to do the surgery you
have<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.389> destabilize<00:03:31.109> the

have to destabilize the

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
to a greater extent than you would have

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
to assume do total hip replacement

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.200 
to assume do total hip replacement
because<00:03:36.040> of<00:03:36.310> course<00:03:36.520> the<00:03:36.670> head<00:03:36.850> is<00:03:36.970> in<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.180> way

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.000 
because of course the head is in the way
and<00:03:37.390> so<00:03:37.720> you<00:03:37.840> have<00:03:38.020> to<00:03:38.170> mobilize<00:03:38.350> it<00:03:38.860> to<00:03:38.950> a
