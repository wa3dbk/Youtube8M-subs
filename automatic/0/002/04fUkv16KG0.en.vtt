00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.580 
it's a great opportunity for the state
to<00:02:12.629> work<00:02:12.810> from<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.140> public

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
to work from a public

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.160 
to work from a public
and<00:02:13.709> private<00:02:13.980> sector<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.520> have<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:15.170> happen

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
and private sector to have this happen

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.870 
and private sector to have this happen
but<00:02:16.709> I<00:02:16.739> think<00:02:16.950> it's<00:02:17.040> just<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.370> start

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
but I think it's just the start

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.760 
but I think it's just the start
and<00:02:18.030> things<00:02:18.569> will<00:02:18.720> build<00:02:18.959> on<00:02:19.140> itself<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.709> think

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
and things will build on itself I think

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.470 
and things will build on itself I think
you<00:02:20.099> have<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.520> make<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.790> investment<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.360> get

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
you have to make the investment to get

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.320 
you have to make the investment to get
it<00:02:21.599> going<00:02:21.900> but<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:23.040> think<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.700> rewards<00:02:24.120> will<00:02:24.270> be

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
it going but I think the rewards will be

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.559 
it going but I think the rewards will be
