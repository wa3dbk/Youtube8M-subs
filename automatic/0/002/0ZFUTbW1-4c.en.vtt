00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.179
 and then people about the neighborhood with one more 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:19.100
 tutorial and a history will be of 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.779
 seems to be frize and is difficult but 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.449
 I'll give you a touch there. 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.099
 It is easy just easy training mode 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.869
 that I'll spend the video here 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.789
 in a matter of a week you're already going 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.000
 learn to make this gay movement 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.280
 there the first step puts the two 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.530
 knees and 112 elbow do not know in which 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.489
 position is if you were once that boy 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.930
 damn 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.780
 I think you already do it there when 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.170
 It was a child so stay in that position. 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.170
 on here 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.899
 this will help you to find out which 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.850
 The side you're going to do 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.859
 You will already have your one little resistance 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.899
 arm was not looking, so do this 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.280
 movement that will make it easier for you 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.970
 learn to make a hand 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.670
 observe the knee and stand above the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.350
 elbow do not blame him see a look 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.020
 In this video, there you go. 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.750
 notion more or less how to fit 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.630
 embedded as you'll get more or 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.650
 least of our how to fit the knee 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.430
 and on the elbow 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.430
 now in this video 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.670
 the second step if you have done the 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.259
 same process as the previous video you 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.750
 You will realize places that will make you 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.729
 if you do it right put your hand 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.649
 left forward we do with 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.630
 left puts is a front right 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.159
 this will serve for you to create 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.100
 arm resistance 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:01.030
 The arm did not look like me. 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.030
 like this video here 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.860
 if you are doing the second step 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.349
 and it already has a way for you to have a 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.510
 notion more or less still feel the weight 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:20.340
 of this phrase as if it were only by hand 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.200
 he has to train his balance so 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.390
 place the hand on the front puts the 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.590
 here is how I look at the video that 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.590
 you will understand 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.870
 because this movement and particularly I 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.720
 I think it's essential you have the notion of 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.790
 balance felt the weight now only stays 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.800
 the base as if it were the second 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.040
 mentally taking the video that way 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.040
 here o 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.620
 the guys and I will give a touch that house 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.600
 are now learning and freising 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.250
 It's good to train and wear jeans because 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.030
 will not be slipping too much in the 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.400
 elbow 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.650
 but the proof of life you train 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.450
 too much or picking up your jeans is 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.480
 get active with burns nearby 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.610
 hallak no ac at your elbow but it is 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.470
 normal is already in the life of me remembered 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.500
 They deceived pay attention in the afternoon 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.680
 legs because I 'm going to leave a video there 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.910
 way just right and the wrong way then 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.640
 I'm gonna explain 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.070
 if you climb very worth it in the store 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.250
 you will fall on the head will download 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.320
 so you better do with the 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.730
 downloaded is a look at the video that you 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.730
 You will understand the beauty better. 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.840
 is 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.730
 it is now you will realize even if the 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.920
 picture is a little 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.770
 I'm getting this sleepy face. 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.240
 but because you know where I live if 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.250
 do not watch video have a look at 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.890

 week you train every day you go 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.630
 learn to make this move then it is 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.160
