action<00:00:25.529> figures<00:00:26.150> from<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.720> second<00:00:28.109> season

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
action figures from the second season

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.540 
action figures from the second season
but<00:00:29.730> they're<00:00:29.910> actually<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.359> first<00:00:30.570> series

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
but they're actually the first series

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
but they're actually the first series
because<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.669> guess<00:00:32.820> did<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.059> make<00:00:33.239> them<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.450> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
because I guess did I make them in the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.540 
because I guess did I make them in the
first<00:00:33.780> season<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.800> they<00:00:34.920> started<00:00:35.489> making

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
first season so they started making

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.160 
first season so they started making
these<00:00:36.620> towards<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> second<00:00:38.070> season<00:00:38.989> so<00:00:39.989> this

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
these towards the second season so this

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.250 
these towards the second season so this
is<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.890> first<00:00:41.129> series<00:00:41.879> but<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.930> second

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
is the first series but for the second

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.840 
is the first series but for the second
season<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> show<00:00:46.489> The<00:00:47.489> Walking<00:00:47.700> Dead

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
that came out ones these ones where the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.910

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.619 
age is 13 and up and there's some other
ones<00:00:59.219> kind<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.699> like<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.969> little<00:01:00.180> different

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
ones kind of like a little different

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.049 
ones kind of like a little different
maybe<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.829> gun<00:01:02.160> was<00:01:02.430> pointed<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:03.000> way

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
maybe like the gun was pointed this way

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.820 
maybe like the gun was pointed this way
or<00:01:03.359> sometimes<00:01:03.719> have<00:01:03.899> different<00:01:04.080> weapons<00:01:04.589> and

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
or sometimes have different weapons and

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.580 
or sometimes have different weapons and
those<00:01:05.760> were<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.420> Walmart<00:01:06.840> Edition<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.380> think

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
those were the Walmart Edition I think

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.399 
those were the Walmart Edition I think
Tom<00:01:07.740> one<00:01:07.890> was<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.340> um<00:01:08.640> age-appropriate<00:01:09.630> like

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
Tom one was like um age-appropriate like

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.340 
Tom one was like um age-appropriate like
eight<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.100> up<00:01:11.280> or<00:01:11.640> something<00:01:11.970> like<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.350> so

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
eight and up or something like that so

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.340 
eight and up or something like that so
this<00:01:13.470> one's<00:01:13.680> uh<00:01:14.270> we<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.450> got<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.080> cuz<00:01:16.259> I

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
this one's uh we I got this one cuz I

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.929 
this one's uh we I got this one cuz I
thought<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.590> one<00:01:16.770> was<00:01:16.799> better<00:01:17.040> because<00:01:17.820> it

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
thought this one was better because it

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.520 
thought this one was better because it
was<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.060> better<00:01:18.299> box<00:01:18.570> bigger<00:01:18.869> box<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> ones

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
was a better box bigger box of the ones

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.289 
was a better box bigger box of the ones
were<00:01:19.619> smaller<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:22.580> yeah<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.640> think<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:24.180> got

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
were smaller and yeah I think we got

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.719 
were smaller and yeah I think we got
these<00:01:24.570> retail<00:01:25.560> price<00:01:25.860> which<00:01:26.280> was<00:01:26.490> probably

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
these retail price which was probably

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.520 
these retail price which was probably
like<00:01:27.290> seventeen<00:01:28.290> twelve<00:01:28.950> bucks<00:01:29.840> now<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.110> eBay

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
like seventeen twelve bucks now on eBay

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.920 
like seventeen twelve bucks now on eBay
for<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:33.119> whole<00:01:33.270> set<00:01:33.990> set<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.890> five<00:01:35.930> they're

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
for the whole set set of five they're

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.450 
for the whole set set of five they're
probably<00:01:37.140> there<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.560> think<00:01:37.770> I've<00:01:38.009> seen<00:01:38.159> Oh<00:01:38.250> for

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
probably there I think I've seen Oh for

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.830 
probably there I think I've seen Oh for
three<00:01:39.450> hundred<00:01:39.540> bucks<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.229> up<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.579> crazy

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
three hundred bucks and up so it's crazy

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.160 
three hundred bucks and up so it's crazy
so<00:01:42.840> here<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.140> got<00:01:43.259> Rick<00:01:43.530> Grimes<00:01:44.090> Grimes

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
so here you got Rick Grimes Grimes

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:53.450 
so here you got Rick Grimes Grimes
deputy<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:48.360> then<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.659> got<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:52.250> Sambi<00:01:53.250> book

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
deputy and then you got a Sambi book

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.800 
deputy and then you got a Sambi book
biter

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.200 

and<00:01:57.810> then<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.050> got<00:01:58.260> another<00:01:59.690> zombie<00:02:00.690> Walker

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
and then you got another zombie Walker

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.390 
and then you got another zombie Walker
so<00:02:03.210> that's<00:02:03.330> probably<00:02:03.510> why<00:02:03.690> the<00:02:03.750> age<00:02:04.400> was

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
so that's probably why the age was

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.490 
so that's probably why the age was
higher<00:02:06.150> on<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.540> one<00:02:06.690> because<00:02:06.810> there's<00:02:07.260> more

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
higher on this one because there's more

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.320 
higher on this one because there's more
blood<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.070> gore<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.340> stuff<00:02:08.670> like<00:02:08.820> that<00:02:09.060> I

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
blood and gore and stuff like that I

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.960 
blood and gore and stuff like that I
think<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.170> ones<00:02:10.350> from<00:02:10.470> Walmart<00:02:10.979> weren't<00:02:11.850> as

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
think the ones from Walmart weren't as

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.510 
think the ones from Walmart weren't as
gory<00:02:14.510> then<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.660> got<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.320> one<00:02:16.650> which<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:17.190> by

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
gory then you got this one which is by

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.570 
gory then you got this one which is by
itself<00:02:17.910> on<00:02:18.560> eBay<00:02:19.560> or<00:02:19.710> anywhere<00:02:20.040> else<00:02:20.070> cost

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
itself on eBay or anywhere else cost

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.620 
itself on eBay or anywhere else cost
like<00:02:20.820> I<00:02:20.970> think<00:02:21.030> upwards<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.080> 80<00:02:22.320> bucks<00:02:22.620> and

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
like I think upwards to 80 bucks and

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.670 
like I think upwards to 80 bucks and
retail<00:02:24.630> was<00:02:24.780> I'm<00:02:24.900> telling<00:02:25.170> retail<00:02:25.440> was<00:02:25.560> like

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
retail was I'm telling retail was like

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.460 
retail was I'm telling retail was like
