00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:27.019
 Halli hello and welcome 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.699
 youtube i am the right one to 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.250
 a new video yes and today for you 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.469
 One last prayer with the ball 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.199
 is there and nice in hall 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.820
 diamonds camouflage how to get the 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:38.600
 get camouflage diamonds for the 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.670
 do not know it yet 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.800
 I want to tell that easily 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.210
 I suggest you the map that is the topic 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.010
 I think everyone should cover you 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.260
 the know very nice little map so 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.290
 initially difficult or difficult to 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.930
 snipers because there and the cliq scope 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.059
 must and buy clicks if that is 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.360
 I would like to be able to train 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.250
 not so bad and for everyone 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.659
 the 10h this is not just one 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.739
 golden camouflage but they have the 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.600
 diamonds done 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.780
 how can I get that this is easy 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.970
 if you do not know yet you have to 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.890
 just the weapons from the respective 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.439
 system playing on gold that is called 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.579
 i have had all sniper on gold that 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.710
 I think so after the first one 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.689
 week when I have everything on gold and have 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.760
 on diamond so therefore all with 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.060
 diamonds staggered himself now with 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.340
 maybe expect the fat maybe short 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.100
 to mention I have a wild here 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.330
 Card used for the third tower 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.430
 I just think that's pretty good for everyone 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.930
 I then have the variable visor 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.340
 simply because you have the fund chandler 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.200
 Has 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.760
 I also do not understand why why 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.530
 you do not have on the pc automatically 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.060
 that variable like you in it because we 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.830
 have your head ends here in the game 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.180
 integrated but if I with the 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.580
 normal as the ins is copied then 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.799
 I'm so close I think oh what is now 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.060
 I'm so close to the enemy that 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.380
 I can not do that with the players 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.990
 That's why you have to actually on the pc 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.119
 always take the variable and 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.070
 there is unfortunately the slot for this 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.450
 example follows the full coat bullet 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.189
 then I also have you occupied 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.990
 the laser just so I if I 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.159
 may be luck of the draw times it chooses you 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.569
 melee goes and me pretty 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.619
 Maybe I still have to cast off 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.920
 the chance to meet 1 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.460
 Therefore this laser is advised and then 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.200
 I still have 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.260
 I still have something I still variable them 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.750
 her magazine extension 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.940
 I think I have the magazines 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.370
 Extension yes and definitely have 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.800
 I also the tact 65 magazine extension 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.480
 with it quite standard with easy 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.800
 Chosen then for the core above 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.090
 faster weapons change if I have 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.280
 I can also get my day with Marga 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.990
 of 14 is a lot more power has 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.760
 and does a lot more harm than to 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.930
 example here you can see the answer 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.740
 has needs that only a shot and more 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:47.100
 damage makes the 57 for example 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.810
 that's why I have the 57 here 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.910
 had the day 54 time not fans 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.320
 because if I can give a marker 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.240
 I simply my tactic with 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.700
 get out and nimble them so 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.720
 take away the magazine exactly fast 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.720
 I'm in here, I saw it now 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:05.340
 not a magazine extension of his martina 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.710
 Further, one must consider it 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.910
 are some sniper in black ops 2 and 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.240
 the choice is really the best 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.710
 example is now over a month out 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.400
 Almost the second and a half 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.750
 that about there not rds he 50 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.350
 maybe not even better 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.360
 to the public plays because they less 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.910
 hit brand makes i think in any case 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.880
 that they are much more hit-market than 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.770
 this sniper in mw3 mw3 at that time i had 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.420
 already said that makes me wear as the 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.640
 Internet 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.620
 that this sniper is here the ballista a lot 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.150
 Too many hit brands are far too many 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.040
 hit market is just cool weapon but power 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.270
 me too many could hacker and I will 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.160
 not even the precision 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.150
 do without because I know if I ever 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.560
 do not meet someone 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.760
 I do not really have that money if I 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.050
 I like it because he does not know yet 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.480
 right on the chest quite simply money 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.840
 I have the hunter here 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.930
 killer then 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.370
 These loans drone the hot then 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.190
 I do not quite know 62 and 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.810
 italy I have the head there completely 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.849
 simply because you are not right yet 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.920
 I know what I crystallize 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.110
 need him for a lead hunter 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:16.690
 Killer need this paper airplane 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:18.630
 So 525 points is the post office way and 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.799
 I do not really know yet 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.150
 I have to make six kids in there 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.790
 one for all and then I have one 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.410
 on 74 my predator so I can then 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:31.270
 after five kills this in paper planes 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.860
 take because I will anyway after 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.740
 A cool more if I'm in the movie 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.240
 I need six boxes of the 525 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.740
 points I can not exceed 500 points 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.750
 Do you see it war 100 points 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.820
 Pokal then 600 I get 100 again 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.590
 and then have 600 points and then up 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.800
 A kill with the paper plane should 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.960
 Ben Kingsley came pretty soon 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.060
 yes, that's why you are not so 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.530
 what the best ones crystallize out 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.630
 places are for a free especially with 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.620
 The sniper would find me 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.289
 of course, if you like me your 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.639
 opinion and your killstreaks had here 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.350
 with a free for everyone with the sniper 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.660
 take in the comments 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.830
 I see what you hear with me 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.870
 because everyone takes something different 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.010
 I would be very interested in that 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.840
 then I will also be interested 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.000
 what you think about sniping what is that 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.950
 best sniper for you is that 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.099
 idea he is 50 feet salary maccarone hands 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.960
 Is it the ids he 50 because they are more precise 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:23.590
 or what is that weapon with 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.849
 he likes to write me but in 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.190
 the comments and what about 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:29.919
 you find the hit market that america 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.620
 do by train is as for example 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.599
 with the intervention or with the msr in 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.070
 black ops was in modern warfare 3 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.840
 Write that in the comments 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.450
 and hope, of course, as always that will be 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.560
 the video has fallen and forget 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.740
 of course, evaluate and subscribe 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.740
