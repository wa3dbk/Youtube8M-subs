00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
trick to this though it's kind of like

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.060 
trick to this though it's kind of like
exploit<00:00:48.510> sheet<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.020> I'm<00:00:49.110> sure<00:00:49.350> Blizzard<00:00:49.980> will

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
exploit sheet and I'm sure Blizzard will

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.040 
exploit sheet and I'm sure Blizzard will
fix<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.550> very<00:00:50.850> quickly<00:00:51.059> because<00:00:51.600> they<00:00:51.750> fix

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
fix this very quickly because they fix

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.299 
fix this very quickly because they fix
other<00:00:52.289> things<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.559> I've<00:00:52.710> shown<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.160> past

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
other things that I've shown in the past

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.850 
other things that I've shown in the past
very<00:00:53.610> quickly<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.300> what<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.480> do<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.989> as<00:00:55.260> your

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
very quickly but what you do is as your

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.709 
very quickly but what you do is as your
AOE<00:00:56.250> killing<00:00:56.699> them<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.969> gets<00:00:57.120> single<00:00:57.390> target

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
AOE killing them it gets single target

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.479 
AOE killing them it gets single target
then<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:57.989> keep<00:00:58.079> tab<00:00:58.739> targeting<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.460> killing

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
then just keep tab targeting and killing

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.029 
then just keep tab targeting and killing
them<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.539> want<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.809> jump<00:01:01.079> around<00:01:01.289> that's<00:01:01.829> is

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
them you want to jump around that's is

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.369 
them you want to jump around that's is
key<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.879> because<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.229> stand

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
key to this because if you just stand

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.530 
key to this because if you just stand
still<00:01:04.619> or<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.400> walk<00:01:05.610> around<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.299> won't

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
still or you just walk around it won't

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.600 
still or you just walk around it won't
be<00:01:06.720> enough<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.110> force<00:01:07.380> them<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.590> spawn<00:01:08.010> for

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
be enough to force them to spawn for

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.280 
be enough to force them to spawn for
some<00:01:08.790> reason<00:01:09.150> when<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.360> jump<00:01:09.659> around<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.140> that

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
some reason when you jump around in that

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.500 
some reason when you jump around in that
area<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:11.010> triggers<00:01:11.460> them<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.790> instantly<00:01:12.240> spawn

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
area it triggers them to instantly spawn

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.960 
area it triggers them to instantly spawn
just<00:01:12.930> about<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.680> continually<00:01:14.340> kill<00:01:14.760> these

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
just about so you continually kill these

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.110 
sort of use this as a leveling place
kinda<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.310> that's<00:02:11.430> kind<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.670> tricky<00:02:11.849> if

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
kinda and that's kind of tricky if

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.050 
kinda and that's kind of tricky if
you're<00:02:12.239> just<00:02:12.480> 90

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
you're just 90

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.030 
you're just 90
or<00:02:13.209> low-level<00:02:13.450> 90s<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.140> really<00:02:14.440> can't<00:02:14.709> use<00:02:14.860> it

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
or low-level 90s you really can't use it

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.010 
or low-level 90s you really can't use it
maybe<00:02:15.280> but<00:02:15.940> maybe<00:02:16.150> higher<00:02:16.450> levels<00:02:16.840> if<00:02:16.930> you

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
maybe but maybe higher levels if you

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.930 
maybe but maybe higher levels if you
want<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.319> if<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.860> could<00:02:17.950> have<00:02:18.099> a<00:02:18.280> powerful<00:02:18.580> AoE

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
want it if you could have a powerful AoE

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.030 
want it if you could have a powerful AoE
in<00:02:19.390> kill<00:02:19.780> la<00:02:19.959> those<00:02:20.140> creatures<00:02:20.319> very<00:02:20.739> quickly

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
in kill la those creatures very quickly

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.440 
in kill la those creatures very quickly
you<00:02:21.220> could<00:02:21.310> actually<00:02:21.520> actually<00:02:22.060> technically

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
you could actually actually technically

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.199 
you could actually actually technically
use<00:02:22.630> as<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:23.290> leveling<00:02:24.130> spot<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.640> for<00:02:24.940> AOE

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.050 
use as a leveling spot to for AOE
farming<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:26.020> this<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:27.220> fastest<00:02:27.730> way<00:02:27.790> that

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
farming so this is the fastest way that

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
bodyguard follower way better than

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.410 
bodyguard follower way better than
spending<00:02:32.800> hours<00:02:33.340> doing<00:02:33.550> anything<00:02:33.790> else<00:02:34.060> there

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
spending hours doing anything else there

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.660 
spending hours doing anything else there
