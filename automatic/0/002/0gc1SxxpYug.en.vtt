00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
and i do four sets of about eight to ten

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.510 
and i do four sets of about eight to ten
reps<00:00:34.380> after<00:00:35.380> that<00:00:35.590> exercise<00:00:36.070> i<00:00:36.309> do<00:00:36.489> a

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520

variation<00:00:36.850> of<00:00:37.149> squats<00:00:37.739> squads<00:00:38.739> are<00:00:39.010> crucial

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
variation of squats squads are crucial

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.310 
variation of squats squads are crucial
when<00:00:40.180> it<00:00:40.300> comes<00:00:40.540> to<00:00:40.690> training<00:00:40.930> for<00:00:41.230> your

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
when it comes to training for your

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.380 
when it comes to training for your
vertical<00:00:41.770> jump<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:42.610> reason<00:00:42.940> for<00:00:43.120> that<00:00:43.150> is

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
vertical jump the reason for that is

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.510 
vertical jump the reason for that is
because<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.750> work<00:00:44.020> required<00:00:44.410> receps<00:00:44.920> the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
because the work required receps the

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.370 
because the work required receps the
work<00:00:45.730> your<00:00:45.910> gluteus<00:00:46.270> maximus<00:00:46.750> if<00:00:46.960> you<00:00:47.080> squat

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
work your gluteus maximus if you squat

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.800 
work your gluteus maximus if you squat
really<00:00:47.680> low<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.280> hit<00:00:48.430> your<00:00:48.610> calves<00:00:48.820> and<00:00:49.090> all

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
really low the hit your calves and all

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.660 
really low the hit your calves and all
around<00:00:50.110> there<00:00:50.380> a<00:00:50.410> great<00:00:50.740> leg<00:00:51.040> workout<00:00:51.070> and

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
around there a great leg workout and

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.050 
around there a great leg workout and
target<00:00:52.000> your<00:00:52.180> legs<00:00:52.390> perfectly<00:00:53.520> now<00:00:54.520> when<00:00:55.030> I

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
target your legs perfectly now when I

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.030 
target your legs perfectly now when I
squad<00:00:55.540> I<00:00:55.750> start<00:00:56.020> off<00:00:56.079> squatting<00:00:56.530> as<00:00:56.650> low<00:00:56.800> as<00:00:56.950> i

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
squad I start off squatting as low as i

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.190 
squad I start off squatting as low as i
can<00:00:57.250> and<00:00:57.460> then<00:00:57.520> eventually<00:00:57.820> i<00:00:58.300> work<00:00:58.660> my<00:00:58.870> way<00:00:59.170> up

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
can and then eventually i work my way up

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.819 
can and then eventually i work my way up
to<00:00:59.380> quarter<00:00:59.800> squats<00:01:00.130> I<00:01:00.540> do<00:01:01.540> not<00:01:01.780> advise<00:01:02.320> you<00:01:02.650> do

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
to quarter squats I do not advise you do

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.859 
to quarter squats I do not advise you do
a<00:01:02.860> lot<00:01:03.130> of<00:01:03.160> quarters<00:01:03.640> wats<00:01:03.880> mainly<00:01:04.390> focus<00:01:04.750> on

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
a lot of quarters wats mainly focus on

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.690 
a lot of quarters wats mainly focus on
full<00:01:05.110> squats<00:01:05.439> because<00:01:05.619> the<00:01:05.920> lower<00:01:06.100> you<00:01:06.310> squat

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
full squats because the lower you squat

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.090 
full squats because the lower you squat
the<00:01:07.149> more<00:01:07.360> muscle<00:01:07.600> you<00:01:07.869> activate<00:01:08.860> and<00:01:09.070> the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
the more muscle you activate and the

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.020 
the more muscle you activate and the
more<00:01:09.460> gluttonous<00:01:10.119> Maximus<00:01:10.630> you<00:01:10.780> work<00:01:12.030> right

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
more gluttonous Maximus you work right

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.580 
more gluttonous Maximus you work right
here<00:01:13.060> you<00:01:13.270> see<00:01:13.420> me<00:01:13.540> do<00:01:13.659> squats<00:01:13.960> again<00:01:14.110> but<00:01:14.500> I'm

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
here you see me do squats again but I'm

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.110 
here you see me do squats again but I'm
not<00:01:14.740> going<00:01:14.920> as<00:01:15.190> low<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.700> reason<00:01:15.940> for<00:01:15.970> that

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
not going as low and the reason for that

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.670 
not going as low and the reason for that
is<00:01:16.360> because<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.659> way<00:01:16.930> did<00:01:17.140> get<00:01:17.290> a<00:01:17.320> lot<00:01:17.500> heavier

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
is because the way did get a lot heavier

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.399 
is because the way did get a lot heavier
and<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:19.210> reps<00:01:19.450> did<00:01:19.690> become<00:01:19.960> harder<00:01:20.260> to

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
and the reps did become harder to

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.520 
and the reps did become harder to
perform<00:01:20.880> still<00:01:21.880> though<00:01:22.120> I<00:01:22.150> do<00:01:22.360> try<00:01:22.780> my<00:01:22.810> best<00:01:23.290> to

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
perform still though I do try my best to

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.280 
perform still though I do try my best to
get<00:01:23.740> at<00:01:23.950> least<00:01:23.979> four<00:01:24.460> to<00:01:24.670> six<00:01:24.970> sets<00:01:25.330> of<00:01:25.510> four<00:01:26.110> to

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
get at least four to six sets of four to

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.620 
get at least four to six sets of four to
eight<00:01:26.530> reps<00:01:26.920> per<00:01:27.040> workout<00:01:27.670> because<00:01:27.970> when<00:01:28.540> it

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
eight reps per workout because when it

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.510 
eight reps per workout because when it
comes<00:01:28.780> to<00:01:28.930> working<00:01:29.110> my<00:01:29.320> legs<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:29.740> squats<00:01:30.040> I<00:01:30.250> go

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
comes to working my legs and squats I go

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.340 
comes to working my legs and squats I go
all<00:01:30.670> out<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:30.909> I<00:01:31.180> try<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.420> lift<00:01:31.720> as<00:01:31.900> much<00:01:31.930> weight

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
all out and I try to lift as much weight

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.520 
all out and I try to lift as much weight
as<00:01:32.409> I<00:01:32.560> can<00:01:33.210> but<00:01:34.210> do<00:01:34.390> not<00:01:34.600> start<00:01:34.990> doing<00:01:35.290> any

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
as I can but do not start doing any

as I can but do not start doing any
plyometric<00:01:36.310> exercises<00:01:36.820> unless<00:01:37.390> you<00:01:37.510> can

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
plyometric exercises unless you can

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.080 
plyometric exercises unless you can

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
squat at least 1.5 times your body

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.480 
squat at least 1.5 times your body
weight<00:01:40.180> because<00:01:41.080> if<00:01:41.260> you<00:01:41.350> can<00:01:41.500> ask<00:01:41.619> what<00:01:41.860> 1.5

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
weight because if you can ask what 1.5

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.190

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.880 
times your body weight playing metrics
will<00:01:44.560> almost<00:01:44.770> be<00:01:44.950> pointless<00:01:45.369> to<00:01:45.490> perform

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
will almost be pointless to perform

will almost be pointless to perform
after<00:01:47.890> that<00:01:48.010> I<00:01:48.070> did<00:01:48.400> reverse<00:01:48.760> barbell<00:01:49.330> lunges

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
after that I did reverse barbell lunges

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.880 
after that I did reverse barbell lunges
