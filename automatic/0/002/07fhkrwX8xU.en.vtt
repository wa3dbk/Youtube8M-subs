00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.480
 curious what is going on warmly 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.160
 to a new video and today it works 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.650
 to the topic how do I improve mine 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.330
 child achievement and you know it 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.639
 maybe if you do some exercise 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.560
 wanted studio is perhaps the second 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.119
 or third exercise and just come 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.380
 not further from the trains one creates 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.510
 maybe nine or ten 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.699
 but I'm really on 11 12 or 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.980
 even 13 high and that's what I have today 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.199
 an extra tip for you and that is 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.000
 It's always like this when you're in an exercise a lot 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.570
 you want to get better then you have to 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.329
 just do it every day yes and that 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.210
 The first thing we do is say that 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.489
 every day if you are so if you are 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.770
 a studio is that you always trained 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.350
 after the training a set profit train 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.460
 just make a set but always after 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.010
 every training also after the third 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.739
 training still extra use 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.510
 more artificial and then with you 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.140
 now ask every day if I yes 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.820
 not in the studio 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.739
 then i have the perfect solution here 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.760
 for you maybe that ever 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.369
 seen up here a chin-up bar 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.530
 that's exactly what I always do 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.820
 that I just always when I have time 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.790
 have at home just a few pull-ups 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.590
 made every day and me here 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.240
 write down that shows that one moment 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.759
 Shortly here I have a little note 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.140
 I always write that on one 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.799
 Cheap are what I'm looking for 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.509
 have had and you and I could 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.540
 simply extremely increase the trains 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.640
 in that I always do that in the gym 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.860
 I always did after training 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.990
 and up here also on this chin-up 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.210
 that 's it, that' s the one here 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.159
 screwed this right in here 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.780
 if you think so I with 30 euro 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.240
 tasted I link you once 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.439
 and that holds up to 300 many so there 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.850
 we must not have fear that mr 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.200
 underdress there's that for 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.200
 the door frame 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.170
 You can then you can here so 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.549
 but they are just so thin 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.670
 door frame and that are only up to 100 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.670
 kilo so yes I do not see 100 kilo 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.979
 But then I feel in yet 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.899
 a bit safer and I'm doing now 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.009
 just use before you can 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.610
 always switch a little bit between 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.160
 spread and attack and what was left 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.240
 Very important is to use fire 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.010
 just done a bit with the 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.570
 Warming shoulders is one 's shoulders 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.220
 let circles circle over poor people 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.060
 that she at least the shoulder one 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.920
 are a bit warm 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.920
 And whoever it may start already 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.850
 Yes 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.720
 yes she saw you could too 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.020
 if he is not quite the last, for example 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.150
 create and drop off briefly and then 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.000
 spread or briefly in tight grip 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.440
 and there are a few more exactly and 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.140
 what I wanted to say 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.660
 you do not have to do that if you have that 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.690
 Muscular cat enuresis in the biceps or 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.840
 racism then it is not good 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.630
 possibility but otherwise every day 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.030
 simple and the world how do yours see that 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.030
 train services will increase quite a bit 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.209
 and see you next time 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.209
 you get a start and look
