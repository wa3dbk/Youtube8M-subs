00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.870
 of media are like in the video I teach you 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.580
 how to decorate a cake with a background 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.610
 heart shaped for valentine 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.200
 now that you have these weights you will see 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.869
 that I put there is going to be a mini 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.150
 simple simply some roses and some 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.710
 unhindered strips to the tails so that what 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.560
 you can do at home easily and without 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.840
 no problem here you have the video 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.430
 to cover a cake with fondant 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.410
 first thing we will do is extend 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.820
 our will have to have a 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:41.750
 so covered with a frosting or a 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.330
 hook and above all it has to be hard 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.450
 I had a fridge so that at night 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.150
 harden and so is much better and much 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.650
 easier to put the bottom of the 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.780
 soft 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.650
 we will start extending well a 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.400
 performance 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.400
 good 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.460
 It does not have to be too thin or too 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.460
 fat because if it's too thin 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.990
 put on top of the cake but 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.320
 neither do we need to stay very 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.320
 Fat 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.230
 once we have the most extended 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.640
 we can pass 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.640
 to put it on top of the cake 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.750
 as our foundation 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.830
 and we spread it over 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.090
 very carefully 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.760
 you are a little bit that looks good and about 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.760
 above 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.570
 and I use an iron to paralyze the 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.400
 fondant if you do not have one like this 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.030
 you can use something that looks like 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.980
 provided it is smooth and not not 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.410
 hit already you see that this does not stick there 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.880
 be to found but well I have to 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.950
 that you do not have, you can use something 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.360
 suffered I do not have does not have to be 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.360
 exactly the same 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.090
 and put is a little bit ready what we're going 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.790
 to do is 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.989
 our finger 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.989
 going down to the bottom 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.500
 I am always in the background and you are going down 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.710
 and once we have 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.360
 in google it 's messing well 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.760
 analyzed 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.270
 let's cut the leftover what it 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.270
 that we have left 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.489
 it is not necessary that the cuts look at me 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.989
 I always leave a little just in case 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.349
 I broke something that has a little bit of 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.349
 fondant 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.420
 work with him 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.250
 and this we can save it for 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.280
 if you have not messed up cardboard and nothing 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.590
 you can save because it 's one of the 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.980
 thematic both fondant 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.980
 and now we are doing by the sides 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:00.850
 once we have the whole cake 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.850
 smoothed and we can go to decorate it 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:07.650
 I'll do what I will put 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:10.900
 around 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.800
 two interlaced ways to cover what 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.349
 what is 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.349
 then all the bottom part of the part 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.820
 I have made these cuts 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.500
 the fondant strips one red and one 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.990
 white and it's very easy 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.340
 how it is done simply 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.340
 take the two ends 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.160
 and go to one above the 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.160
 other 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.230
 ah 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.810
 take the ctera 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.230
 you put it around 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.360
 You can pay it a little with conagua 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.680
 with the tips 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.680
 Well, a little water 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:16.779
 and we add 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.250
 and a little bit for me 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:36.630
 and I'm not going to be put 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.689
 here to decorate a little more 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.549
 roses I made with fondant 2 

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:44.469
 If you want to see how it's done you have a 

00:06:40.549 --> 00:06:44.469
 video of how to make roses make up 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:07:00.200
 also these two leaves 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.200
 soldier and also knew how to put 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:06.250
 and this is put behind him 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.030
 leave what they are what is the part of 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.340
 behind the roses 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:13.000
 it's a little water condemned signs 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.050
 placed as you want 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.039
 and this 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.039
 we would have 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:30.180
 with a decoration you can see that barely 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:32.729
 nothing is left that is very easy to surprise 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.210
 we have put three roses and the stars 

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:37.930
 headed by one side 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:39.669
 it's very easy to do it at home 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.810
 what you liked that you try it and 

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:42.810
 See you in the next video
