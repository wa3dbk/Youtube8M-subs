00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.120 

so<00:01:13.430> as<00:01:14.180> you<00:01:14.390> can<00:01:14.540> hear<00:01:14.869> this<00:01:15.440> compressor<00:01:15.950> can

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
so as you can hear this compressor can

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.000 
so as you can hear this compressor can
add<00:01:16.310> a<00:01:16.340> lot<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:16.760> your<00:01:16.970> tone<00:01:17.409> and<00:01:18.409> I'm<00:01:18.830> using

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
add a lot to your tone and I'm using

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.340 
add a lot to your tone and I'm using
quite<00:01:19.220> a<00:01:19.310> bright<00:01:19.580> guitar<00:01:20.000> I<00:01:20.240> find<00:01:20.900> that<00:01:21.050> it<00:01:21.200> has

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
quite a bright guitar I find that it has

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.410 
quite a bright guitar I find that it has
lots<00:01:21.530> of<00:01:21.740> volume<00:01:21.950> on<00:01:22.220> tap<00:01:22.460> so<00:01:22.490> I'll<00:01:23.030> increase

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
lots of volume on tap so I'll increase

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.140 
lots of volume on tap so I'll increase
that<00:01:23.659> volume<00:01:23.900> a<00:01:24.050> little<00:01:24.170> bit<00:01:24.350> more<00:01:24.530> now<00:01:24.710> and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
that volume a little bit more now and

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.640 
that volume a little bit more now and
I'll<00:01:26.150> add<00:01:26.420> a<00:01:26.450> little<00:01:26.960> bit<00:01:27.110> more<00:01:27.140> compression

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
I'll add a little bit more compression

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.190 
I'll add a little bit more compression
and<00:01:28.340> I<00:01:29.440> will<00:01:30.440> show<00:01:30.830> you<00:01:30.890> how<00:01:31.159> this<00:01:31.280> knob<00:01:31.520> works

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
and I will show you how this knob works

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.940 
and I will show you how this knob works
in<00:01:33.200> a<00:01:33.320> little<00:01:33.530> bit<00:01:34.270> here<00:01:35.270> is<00:01:35.479> a<00:01:35.930> few<00:01:36.200> chords<00:01:36.590> for

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
in a little bit here is a few chords for

00:01:36.950 --> 00:02:18.030 
in a little bit here is a few chords for
you

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.070 

so<00:02:19.040> as<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.849> can<00:02:19.940> see<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.420> can<00:02:20.569> add<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.720> lot<00:02:21.050> of

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
so as you can see that can add a lot of

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.220 
so as you can see that can add a lot of
volume<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:22.730> can<00:02:22.910> dial<00:02:23.209> down<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.629> compression

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
volume you can dial down the compression

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.729 
volume you can dial down the compression
and<00:02:24.550> you<00:02:25.550> can<00:02:25.730> use<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.239> pretty<00:02:26.420> much<00:02:26.690> as<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:26.989> as

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
and you can use it pretty much as a as

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.940 
and you can use it pretty much as a as
an<00:02:28.160> EQ<00:02:28.670> boost<00:02:29.569> pedal<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.980> sorts<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:32.480> let's<00:02:33.230> go

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
an EQ boost pedal of sorts that let's go

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.589 
an EQ boost pedal of sorts that let's go
back<00:02:34.129> to<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.340> higher<00:02:34.580> compression<00:02:34.970> setting<00:02:35.390> and

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
back to a higher compression setting and

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.539 
back to a higher compression setting and
I'll<00:02:35.900> just<00:02:36.110> play<00:02:36.560> some<00:02:36.769> chords<00:02:37.069> and<00:02:37.190> then<00:02:37.370> I'll

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
I'll just play some chords and then I'll

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.130 
I'll just play some chords and then I'll
play<00:02:37.819> with<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.120> decay<00:02:38.420> knob<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:38.900> let<00:02:39.019> you

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
play with the decay knob and let you

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:54.520 
play with the decay knob and let you
know<00:02:39.260> how<00:02:39.739> that<00:02:39.950> affects<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:42.410> tone

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.559 

you

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:09.460 

you

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:46.369 

you

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.470 

so<00:03:47.379> as<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:47.680> can<00:03:47.799> see<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:48.700> decay<00:03:49.030> knob<00:03:49.209> really

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
so as you can see the decay knob really

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.960 
so as you can see the decay knob really
affects<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.989> sustained<00:03:50.440> and<00:03:50.739> it<00:03:51.400> just<00:03:51.610> gives<00:03:51.760> us

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
affects a sustained and it just gives us

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.720 
affects a sustained and it just gives us
a<00:03:52.090> little<00:03:52.120> bit<00:03:52.390> more<00:03:52.599> control<00:03:53.080> on<00:03:53.290> the

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
a little bit more control on the

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.430 
a little bit more control on the
compressed<00:03:54.730> signal<00:03:54.959> through<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.049> Evergreen

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
compressed signal through the Evergreen

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.890 
compressed signal through the Evergreen
compressor<00:03:56.950> now<00:03:57.879> I'm<00:03:58.000> going<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.180> get<00:03:58.269> a<00:03:58.540> little

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
compressor now I'm going to get a little

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.420 
compressor now I'm going to get a little
darker<00:03:59.319> in<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.500> tone<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:02.040> just<00:04:03.040> to<00:04:03.190> show<00:04:03.370> you

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
darker in the tone and just to show you

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.520 
darker in the tone and just to show you
how<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.760> tone<00:04:04.060> knob<00:04:04.269> affects<00:04:04.690> things<00:04:04.989> and<00:04:05.319> how

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
how the tone knob affects things and how

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.039 
how the tone knob affects things and how
it<00:04:05.680> becomes<00:04:06.159> really<00:04:06.370> clear<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:07.540> transparent

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
it becomes really clear and transparent

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.759 
it becomes really clear and transparent
and<00:04:08.500> darker<00:04:08.890> like<00:04:09.069> a<00:04:09.099> Ross<00:04:10.140> old<00:04:11.140> Ross<00:04:11.470> style

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
and darker like a Ross old Ross style

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:35.570 
and darker like a Ross old Ross style
compressor<00:04:12.010> to<00:04:12.640> the<00:04:12.730> left<00:04:12.909> here<00:04:13.090> now

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:05:22.469 

you

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.330 

so<00:05:23.479> as<00:05:23.720> you<00:05:24.169> can<00:05:24.320> see<00:05:24.380> the<00:05:24.860> Evergreen

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
so as you can see the Evergreen

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.370 
so as you can see the Evergreen
compressor<00:05:25.850> from<00:05:25.970> barefoot<00:05:26.389> effects<00:05:26.720> has<00:05:27.260> an

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
compressor from barefoot effects has an

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.710 
compressor from barefoot effects has an
incredible<00:05:27.860> amount<00:05:28.010> of<00:05:28.160> rich<00:05:28.419> sustain<00:05:29.419> a

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
incredible amount of rich sustain a
