00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
server with a thermograph server you can

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.030 
server with a thermograph server you can
use<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:12.780> as<00:00:12.960> well<00:00:13.170> if<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:13.620> have<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.740> server

update<00:00:39.170> which<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.410> came<00:00:40.530> out<00:00:40.680> by<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.920> way

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
update which just came out by the way

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.060 
update which just came out by the way
it's<00:00:41.250> really<00:00:41.399> good<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.570> he<00:00:42.960> used<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.469> system

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
it's really good and he used this system

it's really good and he used this system
so<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.360> put<00:00:45.570> down<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> Minecraft<00:00:46.260> sitting

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
so you put down the Minecraft sitting

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.000 
so you put down the Minecraft sitting
there<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.430> go<00:00:47.579> wow<00:00:47.910> that's<00:00:48.149> loud<00:00:48.980> let<00:00:49.980> me

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
there and you go wow that's loud let me

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.369 
there and you go wow that's loud let me
just<00:00:50.250> turn<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.430> down<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.360> then<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.570> go<00:00:51.780> in

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
just turn that down and then you go in

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.950 
just turn that down and then you go in
one<00:00:52.710> direction<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:53.579> not<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.329> fast<00:00:54.629> but

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
one direction it's not that fast but

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.389 
one direction it's not that fast but
it's<00:00:55.920> used<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.370> lot<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:57.770> minecraft<00:00:58.770> server<00:00:59.039> and

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
it's used a lot in minecraft server and

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.540 
it's used a lot in minecraft server and
home<00:00:59.670> craft<00:01:00.000> server

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.850 

but<00:01:03.060> I<00:01:03.090> thought<00:01:03.450> of<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.630> couple<00:01:03.810> of<00:01:04.020> other<00:01:04.470> best

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
but I thought of a couple of other best

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.480 
but I thought of a couple of other best
solutions<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.990> good<00:01:07.170> solution<00:01:07.490> but

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
solutions this is a good solution but

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.790 
solutions this is a good solution but
you<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.910> to<00:01:09.210> spam<00:01:09.630> your<00:01:09.900> spacebar<00:01:10.320> quite<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
you have to spam your spacebar quite a

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.540 
you have to spam your spacebar quite a
lot<00:01:11.360> which<00:01:12.360> probably<00:01:12.870> isn't<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.440> best<00:01:13.650> for

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
lot which probably isn't the best for

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.210 
lot which probably isn't the best for
video<00:01:14.850> fetish<00:01:15.680> because<00:01:16.680> they'll<00:01:16.800> make<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.980> lot

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
video fetish because they'll make a lot

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.030 
video fetish because they'll make a lot
of<00:01:17.250> noise<00:01:18.140> so<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.410> haven't<00:01:19.740> actually<00:01:19.860> seen

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
of noise so I haven't actually seen

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.610 
of noise so I haven't actually seen
anyone<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:20.760> this<00:01:20.940> system<00:01:21.360> before<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.590> I

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
anyone do this system before so I

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.080 
anyone do this system before so I
thought<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.070> builder<00:01:23.550> and<00:01:23.760> maybe<00:01:24.720> retweeted<00:01:25.050> to

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
thought a builder and maybe retweeted to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.090 
thought a builder and maybe retweeted to
ether<00:01:27.090> or<00:01:27.120> something<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.570> don't<00:01:27.720> know<00:01:28.040> so<00:01:29.040> you

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
ether or something I don't know so you

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.330 
ether or something I don't know so you
sit<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> first<00:01:29.729> minecart<00:01:30.770> point<00:01:31.770> at<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
sit in the first minecart point at the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.050 
sit in the first minecart point at the
second<00:01:32.700> one<00:01:32.850> which<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.000> three<00:01:33.390> blocks<00:01:33.570> obey<00:01:35.060> me

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
second one which is three blocks obey me

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.480 
second one which is three blocks obey me
just<00:01:36.240> show<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.450> one<00:01:37.170> two<00:01:37.560> three<00:01:38.009> rocks<00:01:38.340> away

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
just show you one two three rocks away

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.180 
just show you one two three rocks away
they<00:01:39.150> sitting<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:39.540> point<00:01:39.900> at<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.380> minecart

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
they sitting here point at this minecart

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.490 
they sitting here point at this minecart
and<00:01:41.369> just<00:01:41.970> keep<00:01:42.540> clicking<00:01:42.869> right-click

and just keep clicking right-click

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.490 
and just keep clicking right-click
you'll<00:01:43.740> go<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> lot<00:01:44.340> faster<00:01:44.930> then<00:01:45.930> if<00:01:46.320> you've

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
you'll go a lot faster then if you've

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.420 
you'll go a lot faster then if you've
seen<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:46.800> a<00:01:46.860> minecart

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
seen in a minecart

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.680 
seen in a minecart
it's<00:01:47.580> a<00:01:47.729> lot<00:01:48.149> better<00:01:49.160> so<00:01:50.270> this<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.450> good<00:01:51.660> for

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
it's a lot better so this is good for

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.510 
it's a lot better so this is good for
like<00:01:52.550> long-distance<00:01:53.550> transport<00:01:54.800> and<00:01:55.800> for<00:01:56.369> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
like long-distance transport and for the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.150 
like long-distance transport and for the
nether<00:01:56.729> hood's<00:01:56.940> nether<00:01:57.630> hub<00:01:57.720> system<00:01:58.050> so<00:01:59.040> I've

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
nether hood's nether hub system so I've

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.030 
nether hood's nether hub system so I've
got<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.460> idea<00:01:59.640> from<00:02:00.259> an<00:02:01.259> old<00:02:01.800> elevator

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
got this idea from an old elevator

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.330 
got this idea from an old elevator
system<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.149> could<00:02:03.330> use<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.869> for<00:02:04.340> going

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
system you could use this for going

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.870 
system you could use this for going
vertically<00:02:05.940> as<00:02:06.180> well<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.479> just<00:02:06.630> use<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> boat

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
vertically as well you just use a boat

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.300 
vertically as well you just use a boat
yeah<00:02:09.570> I<00:02:09.900> don't<00:02:10.110> see<00:02:10.380> I<00:02:10.410> haven't<00:02:10.800> seen<00:02:10.950> anyone

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
yeah I don't see I haven't seen anyone

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.180 
yeah I don't see I haven't seen anyone
do<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:11.700> system<00:02:12.210> before<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:13.620> only<00:02:13.830> problem

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
do this system before the only problem

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.130 
do this system before the only problem
with<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:15.090> does<00:02:15.360> use<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.600> lot<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:15.900> mind

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
with it is it does use a lot of mind

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.080 
with it is it does use a lot of mind
cuts<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:16.650> if<00:02:16.800> you've<00:02:16.980> got<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.400> good<00:02:17.760> amount<00:02:18.000> of

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
cuts so if you've got a good amount of

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
cuts so if you've got a good amount of
iron<00:02:18.890> they're<00:02:19.890> not<00:02:20.100> viewed<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:21.480> with<00:02:21.900> this

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
iron they're not viewed so with this

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.690 
iron they're not viewed so with this
system<00:02:22.350> up<00:02:22.680> though<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:23.070> can<00:02:23.250> change<00:02:23.520> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
system up though you can change the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.340 
system up though you can change the
blocks<00:02:23.970> obviously<00:02:24.450> but<00:02:24.660> with<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:24.990> shape

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
blocks obviously but with this shape

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.380 
blocks obviously but with this shape
that<00:02:25.380> bill<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:26.430> can<00:02:26.640> run<00:02:26.910> down<00:02:27.090> here

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
that bill you can run down here

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.200 
that bill you can run down here
perfectly<00:02:27.990> fine<00:02:28.290> just<00:02:29.010> like<00:02:29.880> this<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.180> can

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
perfectly fine just like this you can

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.730 
perfectly fine just like this you can
even<00:02:30.450> jump<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:30.960> you<00:02:31.020> won't<00:02:31.200> hit<00:02:31.320> your<00:02:31.470> head<00:02:31.590> on

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
even jump and you won't hit your head on

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.880 
even jump and you won't hit your head on
anything<00:02:32.010> okay<00:02:32.600> I<00:02:33.600> just<00:02:33.840> did<00:02:34.020> it's<00:02:34.590> rare

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
anything okay I just did it's rare

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.760 
anything okay I just did it's rare
you'll<00:02:35.100> hit<00:02:35.280> your<00:02:35.460> head<00:02:35.580> on<00:02:35.730> anything<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:37.590> can

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
you'll hit your head on anything you can

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.100 
you'll hit your head on anything you can
also<00:02:37.950> use<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.280> horse<00:02:38.640> but<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.240> haven't<00:02:39.870> thought

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
also use a horse but I haven't thought

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.850 
also use a horse but I haven't thought
of<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.320> good<00:02:40.500> system<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.100> use<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.430> horse<00:02:41.700> yet

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
of a good system to use a horse yet

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.100 
of a good system to use a horse yet
maybe<00:02:43.860> making<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.340> roof<00:02:44.670> one<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.480> bit<00:02:45.750> one

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
maybe making the roof one a bit one

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.280 
maybe making the roof one a bit one
higher<00:02:46.350> here<00:02:46.890> would<00:02:47.610> fix<00:02:47.850> that<00:02:47.990> but<00:02:48.990> at<00:02:49.200> the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
higher here would fix that but at the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.900 
higher here would fix that but at the
moment<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.680> just<00:02:49.800> have<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.040> do<00:02:50.100> a<00:02:50.130> little<00:02:50.340> hop

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
moment you just have to do a little hop

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.510 
moment you just have to do a little hop
and<00:02:51.300> you'll<00:02:51.960> get<00:02:52.110> through<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:53.340> won't

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
and you'll get through you won't

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.020 
and you'll get through you won't
suffocate<00:02:53.850> because<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:55.340> redstone<00:02:56.340> lamps

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
suffocate because the redstone lamps

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.110 
suffocate because the redstone lamps
transparent<00:02:58.930> blocks<00:02:59.580> so<00:03:00.580> that's<00:03:00.730> good

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
transparent blocks so that's good

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.040 
transparent blocks so that's good
but<00:03:01.570> I<00:03:01.840> think<00:03:02.470> if<00:03:03.040> we<00:03:03.610> just<00:03:03.640> destroy<00:03:04.360> these<00:03:04.720> two

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
but I think if we just destroy these two

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.650 
but I think if we just destroy these two
blocks<00:03:05.350> and<00:03:05.970> then<00:03:06.970> make<00:03:07.180> them<00:03:07.390> one<00:03:07.630> higher

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
blocks and then make them one higher

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.850 
blocks and then make them one higher
should<00:03:10.660> be<00:03:10.780> out<00:03:10.870> or<00:03:11.050> through<00:03:11.350> that<00:03:11.500> perfectly

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
should be out or through that perfectly

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.710 
should be out or through that perfectly
fine<00:03:12.010> yeah<00:03:12.760> so<00:03:13.150> that's<00:03:13.330> good

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
fine yeah so that's good

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.510 
fine yeah so that's good
you<00:03:14.350> just<00:03:14.530> walk<00:03:14.680> through<00:03:14.710> this<00:03:15.040> bit<00:03:15.280> for

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
you just walk through this bit for

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.370 
you just walk through this bit for
really<00:03:15.820> fine<00:03:16.000> so<00:03:16.690> if<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.870> wanted<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.140> make<00:03:17.290> the

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
really fine so if you wanted to make the

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.810 
really fine so if you wanted to make the
horse<00:03:17.530> go<00:03:17.590> through<00:03:17.890> it<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.280> just<00:03:18.460> have<00:03:18.550> to

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
horse go through it you just have to

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.030 
horse go through it you just have to
push<00:03:19.090> these<00:03:19.270> ones<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:19.960> little<00:03:20.350> bit<00:03:20.500> higher<00:03:20.830> up

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
push these ones a little bit higher up

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.460 
push these ones a little bit higher up
just<00:03:21.370> like<00:03:21.490> that<00:03:22.290> okay

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470
