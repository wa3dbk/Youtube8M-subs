Star Coin you will be able to move on to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.459 
Star Coin you will be able to move on to
the<00:00:47.370> third<00:00:47.640> which<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:49.140> not<00:00:49.200> really

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the third which is it's not really

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.260 
the third which is it's not really
tricky<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.250> you're<00:00:50.430> gonna<00:00:50.520> have<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.850> use<00:00:51.030> a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
tricky but you're gonna have to use a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.200 
tricky but you're gonna have to use a
cannon<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.079> order<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.680> get<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> star<00:00:53.160> coin<00:00:53.370> so

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
cannon in order to get the star coin so

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.389 
cannon in order to get the star coin so
here<00:00:54.360> we<00:00:54.449> go<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:54.719> are<00:00:54.780> moving<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.160> third

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
here we go we are moving on to the third

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.400 
here we go we are moving on to the third
and<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.180> order<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.570> get<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.840> all<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.140> have<00:00:58.230> to

and in order to get that all you have to

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.069 
and in order to get that all you have to
do<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.859> basically<00:00:59.670> jump<00:01:00.390> across<00:01:00.660> this

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
do is basically jump across this

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.319 
do is basically jump across this
platform<00:01:01.469> right<00:01:01.980> here<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.489> after<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.090> jump

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
platform right here and after you jump

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.939 
platform right here and after you jump
across<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.899> as<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.229> see<00:01:04.409> we<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:04.710> jumped

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
across it as you see we just jumped

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.980 
across it as you see we just jumped
across<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.460> now<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.090> go<00:01:06.210> into<00:01:06.390> this

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
across and now you have to go into this

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.320 
across and now you have to go into this
cannon<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.860> then<00:01:08.159> you're<00:01:08.729> gonna<00:01:08.820> shoot<00:01:09.119> right

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
and now a new level appeared and I

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.069 
and now a new level appeared and I
didn't<00:02:15.549> actually<00:02:15.700> go<00:02:15.969> over<00:02:16.299> this<00:02:16.450> level<00:02:16.900> in

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
didn't actually go over this level in

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.110 
didn't actually go over this level in
the<00:02:17.230> previous<00:02:17.650> videos<00:02:18.159> so<00:02:18.760> let's<00:02:18.909> do<00:02:19.090> that

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
the previous videos so let's do that

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.520 
the previous videos so let's do that
right<00:02:19.510> now<00:02:19.719> it's<00:02:19.989> world<00:02:20.700> 4-3<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:21.909> course<00:02:22.530> 4-3

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
right now it's world 4-3 so course 4-3

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.459 
right now it's world 4-3 so course 4-3
and<00:02:24.269> it's<00:02:25.269> pretty<00:02:25.540> easy<00:02:25.749> to<00:02:25.900> find<00:02:26.109> the<00:02:26.260> star

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
to our next level one thing that I

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.129 
to our next level one thing that I
noticed<00:03:56.560> is<00:03:56.739> that<00:03:57.099> I<00:03:57.489> had<00:03:57.759> to<00:03:57.909> turn<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.449> 3d<00:03:58.930> on

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
noticed is that I had to turn the 3d on

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.080 
noticed is that I had to turn the 3d on
when<00:03:59.439> I<00:03:59.469> was<00:03:59.620> in<00:03:59.680> some<00:04:00.489> of<00:04:00.519> these<00:04:00.729> levels

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
when I was in some of these levels

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.020 
when I was in some of these levels
because<00:04:01.810> it's<00:04:02.049> really<00:04:02.620> tough<00:04:02.949> to<00:04:03.189> kind<00:04:03.790> of<00:04:03.849> see

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
because it's really tough to kind of see

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.699 
because it's really tough to kind of see
your<00:04:04.209> depth<00:04:04.449> perception<00:04:04.659> in<00:04:05.319> the<00:04:05.439> levels

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
your depth perception in the levels

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.439 
your depth perception in the levels
without<00:04:05.979> the<00:04:06.099> 3d<00:04:06.459> on<00:04:06.579> and<00:04:06.819> that's<00:04:07.239> another

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
without the 3d on and that's another

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:08.849 
without the 3d on and that's another
thing<00:04:07.689> I've<00:04:07.840> been<00:04:07.989> playing<00:04:08.199> this<00:04:08.349> game<00:04:08.560> for
