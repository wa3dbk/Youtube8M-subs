can't say that I've never cheated

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.969 
can't say that I've never cheated
because<00:07:10.039> there<00:07:10.610> was<00:07:10.759> a<00:07:10.789> few<00:07:11.060> times<00:07:11.949> where<00:07:12.949> I

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:12.979 
because there was a few times where I

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:15.760 
because there was a few times where I
had<00:07:13.310> like<00:07:13.580> some<00:07:14.240> tortilla<00:07:14.660> chips<00:07:14.780> with<00:07:15.560> like

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770 
had like some tortilla chips with like

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.559 
had like some tortilla chips with like
salsa<00:07:16.069> and<00:07:16.520> like<00:07:16.669> in<00:07:16.789> a<00:07:16.849> restaurant<00:07:17.150> and<00:07:17.479> I

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:17.569 
salsa and like in a restaurant and I

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:18.730

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:18.740 
think that that was the worst that I

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.700 
think that that was the worst that I
ever<00:07:18.919> did<00:07:19.240> um<00:07:20.240> I've<00:07:20.810> never<00:07:21.080> had<00:07:21.319> any<00:07:21.470> goodies
