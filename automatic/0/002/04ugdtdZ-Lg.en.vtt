00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
the reboost packs and hopefully and pull

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.400 
the reboost packs and hopefully and pull
something<00:03:28.810> cool

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
something cool

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.500 
something cool
Jim<00:03:30.010> bit<00:03:30.370> out<00:03:30.520> and<00:03:30.820> there<00:03:30.940> we<00:03:31.030> go<00:03:31.209> so<00:03:31.420> we'll

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
Jim bit out and there we go so we'll

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.140

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
open a it's plasma phrasal is about say

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.940 
open a it's plasma phrasal is about say
a<00:03:34.180> team<00:03:34.450> plasma<00:03:34.690> one<00:03:34.990> I<00:03:35.230> don't<00:03:35.709> think<00:03:35.860> that

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
a team plasma one I don't think that

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.880 
a team plasma one I don't think that
sets<00:03:36.190> been<00:03:36.370> released<00:03:36.640> yet<00:03:36.850> but<00:03:36.880> a<00:03:37.000> team<00:03:37.330> plasma

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
sets been released yet but a team plasma

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
sets been released yet but a team plasma
that<00:03:38.890> would<00:03:38.980> be<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.070> pretty<00:03:39.250> interesting<00:03:39.459> set

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
that would be a pretty interesting set

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
plasma storm one up hopefully even pull

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.110 
plasma storm one up hopefully even pull
something<00:04:15.520> a<00:04:15.550> bit<00:04:15.670> better<00:04:15.820> in<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.000> regular

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
something a bit better in the regular

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.240 
something a bit better in the regular
rare<00:04:16.570> but<00:04:16.750> you<00:04:16.840> know<00:04:16.959> what<00:04:17.260> I'm<00:04:17.470> not<00:04:17.739> too<00:04:17.950> fast

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
rare but you know what I'm not too fast

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.220 
rare but you know what I'm not too fast
start<00:04:18.760> with<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.209> flight<00:04:19.600> so<00:04:19.750> they<00:04:19.900> include

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
start with the to flight so they include

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.050 
start with the to flight so they include
I<00:04:20.440> think<00:04:20.650> I<00:04:20.739> think<00:04:21.010> they're<00:04:21.640> going<00:04:21.729> to<00:04:21.850> not

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
I think I think they're going to not

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.670 
I think I think they're going to not
give<00:04:22.240> you<00:04:22.330> as<00:04:22.479> much<00:04:22.630> in<00:04:22.810> the<00:04:22.900> boost<00:04:23.110> packs

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
give you as much in the boost packs

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.409 
give you as much in the boost packs
hopefully<00:04:24.280> that's<00:04:24.490> not<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:24.789> case<00:04:24.940> so<00:04:25.000> if<00:04:25.270> we

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
hopefully that's not the case so if we

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:26.350 
hopefully that's not the case so if we
can<00:04:25.510> get<00:04:25.570> something

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
can get something

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.399
