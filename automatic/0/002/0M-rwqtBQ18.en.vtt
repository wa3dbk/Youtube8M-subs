 Hello everyone in this video, I would like to 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:31.590
 tell about the wireless mouse 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:36.610
 which ordered online this did not 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:40.060
 black from green interspersed by 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.150
 center and on the sides in principle it is very 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.739
 the lung has a switch that is it can 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.050
 turn off when they are required here by myself 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.180
 optics is located and so small 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.699
 bluetooth transmitter which is inserted 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:01:01.170
 directly candy himself bear very 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:04.230
 simple it has a flat wheel with 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.020
 button and has a button to switch 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:10.010
 sensitivity but change kids 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.900
 the Chinese are a mouse 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.800
 from one type 2a battery example here 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:23.860
 such 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:27.130
 duracell all close turn on this 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.410
 optics can blue 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.630
 usually red i'm fine i have a mouse 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:37.070
 in red there is wireless here are blue 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.930
 one battery is enough I used 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.140
 one battery lasts a month and that 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.940
 most importantly this mouse has 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.250
 auto power off well this is for those who do not 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.020
 knows this if the mouse is not used in 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.640
 some time she herself 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.830
 disconnects it is very convenient it 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:00.670
 saves the battery itself auto shutdown 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.860
 happens in about 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.470
 I didnâ€™t notice where I donâ€™t know 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.610
 minutes 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.420
 after a moment she turned off in the car 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.420
 This is a very convenient feature.
