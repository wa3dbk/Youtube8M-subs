00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
that salt I've got a wave deflector

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.230 
that salt I've got a wave deflector
which<00:02:33.960> is<00:02:34.110> this<00:02:34.800> orange<00:02:35.190> piece<00:02:35.580> on<00:02:35.760> top<00:02:35.940> cause

which is this orange piece on top cause

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.160 
which is this orange piece on top cause
its<00:02:36.690> high-visibility<00:02:37.070> colored<00:02:38.070> as<00:02:38.220> well<00:02:39.170> but

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
its high-visibility colored as well but

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.050 
its high-visibility colored as well but
the<00:02:40.290> way<00:02:40.380> you've<00:02:40.560> deflector<00:02:41.220> helps<00:02:41.820> to

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
the way you've deflector helps to

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.970 
the way you've deflector helps to
prevent<00:02:42.330> water<00:02:42.660> from<00:02:42.840> actually<00:02:43.380> lapping<00:02:43.770> in

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
prevent water from actually lapping in

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.580 
prevent water from actually lapping in
to<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.820> snorkel<00:02:45.150> itself<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.570> deflects<00:02:46.110> the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
to the snorkel itself it deflects the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.350 
to the snorkel itself it deflects the
water<00:02:46.770> away<00:02:46.980> from<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.460> main<00:02:47.610> ball<00:02:47.850> because

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
water away from the main ball because

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.880 
water away from the main ball because
you<00:02:48.450> don't<00:02:48.600> want<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.810> running<00:02:48.990> down<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.800> helps

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
you don't want it running down it helps

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.340 
you don't want it running down it helps
to<00:02:50.160> divert<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.730> water<00:02:50.760> away<00:02:51.450> drop<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.260> out

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
to divert the water away drop it out

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.170 
to divert the water away drop it out
from<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.710> bottom<00:02:53.010> here<00:02:53.310> Rob<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.970> down<00:02:54.060> the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
from the bottom here Rob and down the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.080 
from the bottom here Rob and down the
snowball<00:02:54.590> ice<00:02:55.590> no<00:02:55.740> up<00:02:55.830> itself<00:02:56.130> it's<00:02:56.610> flexible

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
snowball ice no up itself it's flexible

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.470 
snowball ice no up itself it's flexible
so<00:02:57.300> it's<00:02:57.720> very<00:02:57.810> difficult<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.290> break<00:02:59.330> on<00:03:00.330> the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
so it's very difficult to break on the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.330 
so it's very difficult to break on the
main<00:03:00.510> ball<00:03:00.870> down<00:03:01.320> here<00:03:01.850> got<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.880> movable<00:03:04.340> strap

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
main ball down here got a movable strap

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.820 
main ball down here got a movable strap
retainer<00:03:05.640> very<00:03:06.360> simple<00:03:06.630> design<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:07.650> can

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
retainer very simple design you can

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.320 
retainer very simple design you can
actually<00:03:07.950> take<00:03:08.250> this<00:03:08.370> piece<00:03:08.610> off<00:03:08.820> if<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.150> want

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
actually take this piece off if you want

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.820 
actually take this piece off if you want
to<00:03:09.510> just<00:03:09.870> by<00:03:10.020> pushing<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.740> off<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:12.830> simple

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
to just by pushing it off and simple

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.190 
to just by pushing it off and simple
strap<00:03:14.580> attachment<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.570> you<00:03:15.690> can<00:03:15.810> lift<00:03:15.960> up<00:03:16.170> the

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
strap attachment so you can lift up the

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.890 
strap attachment so you can lift up the
clip<00:03:16.590> put<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.610> strap<00:03:17.820> through<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.300> just

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
clip put the strap through and just

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.480 
clip put the strap through and just
release<00:03:19.530> it<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.860> that<00:03:19.950> will<00:03:20.040> snap<00:03:20.160> back<00:03:20.310> into

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
release it and that will snap back into

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.450 
release it and that will snap back into
place<00:03:20.700> locking<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.450> strap<00:03:21.720> into<00:03:22.710> position<00:03:23.310> oh

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
place locking the strap into position oh

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.370 
place locking the strap into position oh
so<00:03:23.880> you<00:03:24.000> can<00:03:24.120> move<00:03:24.240> that<00:03:24.420> up<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.660> down<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:25.170> suit

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
so you can move that up and down to suit

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.650 
so you can move that up and down to suit
the<00:03:25.530> particular<00:03:25.650> user

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
the particular user

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.940 
the particular user
another<00:03:27.660> bottom<00:03:27.960> you've<00:03:28.500> got<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.620> purging

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
another bottom you've got a purging

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.800 
another bottom you've got a purging
chamber<00:03:29.880> down<00:03:30.030> on<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.150> bottom<00:03:30.300> here<00:03:30.480> that

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
chamber down on the bottom here that

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.050 
chamber down on the bottom here that
one-way<00:03:31.380> valve<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:32.070> if<00:03:32.190> any<00:03:32.340> water<00:03:32.520> does<00:03:32.850> come

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
one-way valve so if any water does come

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.640 
one-way valve so if any water does come
in<00:03:33.210> especially<00:03:33.480> after<00:03:33.900> you've<00:03:34.170> duck<00:03:34.350> dives

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
in especially after you've duck dives

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.100 
in especially after you've duck dives
you<00:03:35.130> as<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.340> go<00:03:35.460> your<00:03:35.880> Balter<00:03:36.180> in<00:03:36.270> here<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.960> can

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
you as you go your Balter in here it can

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.960 
you as you go your Balter in here it can
be<00:03:37.230> purged<00:03:37.620> out<00:03:37.800> at<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:37.950> bottom<00:03:38.310> we<00:03:38.730> Robin

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
be purged out at the bottom we Robin

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.160 
be purged out at the bottom we Robin
have<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.210> force<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.600> all<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.900> way<00:03:40.020> up<00:03:40.050> with

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
have to force it all the way up with

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.830 
have to force it all the way up with
snorkel<00:03:40.790> it's<00:03:41.790> at<00:03:41.880> one-way<00:03:42.150> valve<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.570> bottom

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
snorkel it's at one-way valve and bottom

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.390 
snorkel it's at one-way valve and bottom
it<00:03:43.080> allows<00:03:43.350> that<00:03:43.530> ought<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.680> be<00:03:43.920> drained<00:03:44.220> out

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
it allows that ought to be drained out

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.760 
it allows that ought to be drained out
by<00:03:44.910> gravity<00:03:45.420> or<00:03:45.570> you<00:03:45.720> can<00:03:45.900> force<00:03:46.110> it<00:03:46.260> out<00:03:46.380> just

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
by gravity or you can force it out just

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.860 
by gravity or you can force it out just
by<00:03:46.980> breathing<00:03:48.890> so<00:03:49.890> full<00:03:50.280> silicon<00:03:50.870> section

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
by breathing so full silicon section

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.110 
by breathing so full silicon section
again<00:03:52.080> so<00:03:52.320> it<00:03:52.410> makes<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.620> very<00:03:52.680> flexible<00:03:53.340> being

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
again so it makes it very flexible being
