00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.710 

the<00:01:02.290> content<00:01:02.740> of<00:01:02.980> licking<00:01:03.460> chicken<00:01:03.820> are<00:01:04.000> right

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
the content of licking chicken are right

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.780 
the content of licking chicken are right
here<00:01:05.050> you<00:01:05.170> can<00:01:05.350> see<00:01:05.530> there's<00:01:05.710> a<00:01:05.980> bunch<00:01:06.550> of

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
here you can see there's a bunch of

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.090 
here you can see there's a bunch of
rubber<00:01:07.510> chickens<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:08.350> then<00:01:08.680> we<00:01:08.860> have

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
rubber chickens and then we have

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.730 
rubber chickens and then we have
basically<00:01:09.940> a<00:01:10.270> frisbee<00:01:10.900> here<00:01:11.290> which<00:01:11.470> has<00:01:11.680> a

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
basically a frisbee here which has a

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.270 
basically a frisbee here which has a
plus<00:01:12.340> one<00:01:12.580> penalty<00:01:12.820> on<00:01:13.270> one<00:01:13.510> side<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:14.050> a<00:01:14.920> minus

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
plus one penalty on one side and a minus

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.640 
plus one penalty on one side and a minus
one<00:01:15.550> on<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.730> other<00:01:15.850> side<00:01:16.120> so<00:01:16.900> each<00:01:17.200> player

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
one on the other side so each player

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.120 
one on the other side so each player
gets<00:01:17.980> a<00:01:18.790> chicken<00:01:19.540> and<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:20.440> game<00:01:20.680> will<00:01:20.950> begin

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
gets a chicken and the game will begin

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.969 
gets a chicken and the game will begin
at<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.030> beginning<00:01:22.210> of<00:01:22.510> the<00:01:22.690> game<00:01:22.870> one<00:01:23.650> player

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
at the beginning of the game one player

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.660 
at the beginning of the game one player
throws<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.880> frisbee<00:01:25.270> as<00:01:25.390> far<00:01:25.660> as<00:01:25.750> they<00:01:25.900> can

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
throws the frisbee as far as they can

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.620 
throws the frisbee as far as they can
hopefully<00:01:27.670> so<00:01:27.940> it<00:01:28.030> doesn't<00:01:28.300> go<00:01:28.360> in<00:01:28.450> another

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
hopefully so it doesn't go in another

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.080 
hopefully so it doesn't go in another
yard<00:01:28.960> then<00:01:29.800> each<00:01:30.100> player<00:01:30.460> is<00:01:30.670> going<00:01:30.790> to<00:01:30.880> come

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
yard then each player is going to come

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.170 
yard then each player is going to come
and<00:01:31.330> start<00:01:32.110> at<00:01:32.380> a<00:01:32.410> point<00:01:33.160> and<00:01:33.430> they're<00:01:34.090> going

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
and start at a point and they're going

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.460 
and start at a point and they're going
to<00:01:34.240> take<00:01:34.360> turns<00:01:34.570> trying<00:01:34.900> to<00:01:35.080> throw<00:01:35.290> their

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.700 
to take turns trying to throw their
chickens<00:01:35.979> at<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:37.090> point<00:01:37.330> so<00:01:38.320> one<00:01:38.440> player

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
chickens at the point so one player

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.020 
chickens at the point so one player
throws<00:01:38.979> their<00:01:39.100> chicken<00:01:39.369> first<00:01:39.520> you<00:01:39.729> can<00:01:39.850> throw

every<00:02:53.230> one<00:02:53.349> through<00:02:53.560> three<00:02:53.590> times<00:02:54.099> now<00:02:54.370> the

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
every one through three times now the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.330 
every one through three times now the
dog<00:02:55.209> interfered<00:02:55.930> so<00:02:56.260> this<00:02:56.650> one<00:02:56.830> hat<00:02:56.980> man<00:02:57.129> here

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
dog interfered so this one hat man here

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.920 
dog interfered so this one hat man here
but<00:02:57.459> if<00:02:57.550> anyone<00:02:57.849> had<00:02:58.000> landed<00:02:58.360> on<00:02:58.569> the<00:02:58.750> bonus

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
but if anyone had landed on the bonus

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.680 
but if anyone had landed on the bonus
then<00:02:59.860> that<00:03:00.310> person<00:03:00.489> would<00:03:00.730> have<00:03:00.790> got<00:03:00.970> minus<00:03:01.209> 12

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
then that person would have got minus 12

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.809 
then that person would have got minus 12
there<00:03:01.870> throw<00:03:02.170> just<00:03:02.890> like<00:03:03.069> on<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.340> other<00:03:03.489> side

i I mean we really can't go on any

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.950 
i I mean we really can't go on any
in-depth<00:04:27.789> analysis<00:04:28.300> you're<00:04:28.600> throwing<00:04:28.870> the

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
in-depth analysis you're throwing the

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.000 
in-depth analysis you're throwing the
frisbee<00:04:29.080> and<00:04:29.410> then<00:04:29.530> you're<00:04:29.650> trying<00:04:29.830> to<00:04:29.889> throw

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
frisbee and then you're trying to throw

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.860 
frisbee and then you're trying to throw
the<00:04:30.039> chicken<00:04:30.280> I<00:04:30.610> actually<00:04:31.030> like<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.570> plus<00:04:31.840> one

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
the chicken I actually like the plus one

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.570 
the chicken I actually like the plus one
penalty<00:04:32.260> side<00:04:32.680> better<00:04:32.919> because<00:04:33.220> I<00:04:33.280> like<00:04:33.460> the

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
penalty side better because I like the

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.379 
penalty side better because I like the
fact<00:04:33.700> that<00:04:33.820> you're<00:04:33.940> trying<00:04:34.090> to<00:04:34.180> hit<00:04:34.300> the

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
fact that you're trying to hit the
