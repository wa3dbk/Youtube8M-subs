00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.840 
going to show you how to properly make
an<00:00:08.530> engine<00:00:08.830> for<00:00:09.430> your<00:00:09.940> engine<00:00:10.510> bay<00:00:11.520> this<00:00:12.520> was

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:12.850 
an engine for your engine bay this was

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.810 
an engine for your engine bay this was
one<00:00:13.120> of<00:00:13.300> the<00:00:13.450> more<00:00:13.630> challenging<00:00:14.340> aspects<00:00:15.340> get

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
it alright so let's get into it we do

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.760 
it alright so let's get into it we do
have<00:00:27.010> our<00:00:27.250> little<00:00:27.460> platform<00:00:27.760> once<00:00:28.180> again<00:00:28.480> and

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
have our little platform once again and

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.880 
have our little platform once again and
we<00:00:29.770> are<00:00:30.010> going<00:00:30.279> to<00:00:30.430> build<00:00:30.699> this<00:00:31.180> you<00:00:31.869> model<00:00:32.230> but

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
we are going to build this you model but

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.689 
we are going to build this you model but
this<00:00:33.100> time<00:00:33.309> around<00:00:33.519> we<00:00:34.269> are<00:00:34.480> not<00:00:34.839> going<00:00:35.260> to

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
this time around we are not going to

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.880 
this time around we are not going to
just<00:00:36.699> choose<00:00:37.179> an<00:00:37.510> engine<00:00:37.839> which<00:00:38.019> I<00:00:38.260> know<00:00:38.319> fits

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
just choose an engine which I know fits

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.610 
just choose an engine which I know fits
in<00:00:39.039> there<00:00:39.249> but<00:00:39.729> we're<00:00:39.969> going<00:00:40.239> to<00:00:40.449> make<00:00:40.749> one<00:00:40.780> so

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
in there but we're going to make one so

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.799 
in there but we're going to make one so
you<00:00:41.679> choose<00:00:41.979> an<00:00:42.159> engine<00:00:42.489> and<00:00:42.579> now<00:00:43.210> when<00:00:43.690> you

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
you choose an engine and now when you

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.559 
you choose an engine and now when you
choose<00:00:44.109> the<00:00:44.319> engine<00:00:44.679> the<00:00:45.519> program<00:00:45.879> knows<00:00:46.089> how

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:46.569 
choose the engine the program knows how

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:49.709 
choose the engine the program knows how
large<00:00:46.809> the<00:00:47.019> engine<00:00:47.289> bay<00:00:47.440> is<00:00:47.469> so<00:00:48.399> it<00:00:48.760> will<00:00:49.359> if

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
large the engine bay is so it will if

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.950 
large the engine bay is so it will if
you<00:00:50.050> click<00:00:50.289> new<00:00:50.679> engine<00:00:51.129> give<00:00:51.940> you<00:00:52.269> a<00:00:52.479> proper

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
you click new engine give you a proper

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.910 
you click new engine give you a proper
box<00:00:53.769> for<00:00:54.249> the<00:00:54.370> engine<00:00:54.519> to<00:00:54.789> fit<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:55.719> engine<00:00:56.019> so

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
box for the engine to fit the engine so

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.759 
box for the engine to fit the engine so
let's<00:00:57.249> build<00:00:57.549> in<00:00:57.699> little<00:00:58.510> in<00:00:58.749> line<00:00:58.959> for<00:00:59.379> shall

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
let's build in little in line for shall

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.660 
let's build in little in line for shall
we<00:01:00.179> were<00:01:01.179> just<00:01:01.659> standard<00:01:02.170> staff<00:01:02.620> was<00:01:03.069> not

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
we were just standard staff was not

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.859 
we were just standard staff was not
stuff<00:01:03.999> but<00:01:04.299> stuff<00:01:04.330> to<00:01:05.140> put<00:01:05.259> in<00:01:05.320> there<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:06.869> you

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
stuff but stuff to put in there and you

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.679 
stuff but stuff to put in there and you
see<00:01:08.079> the<00:01:08.259> bounding<00:01:08.619> box<00:01:08.670> which<00:01:09.689> corresponds

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
see the bounding box which corresponds

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.100 
see the bounding box which corresponds
to<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:12.100> bone<00:01:12.670> in<00:01:12.850> box<00:01:13.060> with<00:01:13.299> your<00:01:13.630> engine<00:01:14.079> bay

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
to the bone in box with your engine bay

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.370 
to the bone in box with your engine bay
and<00:01:15.030> we<00:01:16.030> just<00:01:16.270> speed<00:01:16.570> through<00:01:16.600> here

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
and we just speed through here

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.010 
and we just speed through here
to<00:01:17.500> give<00:01:17.979> you<00:01:18.159> a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
to give you a

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.560 
to give you a
quick<00:01:20.020> look<00:01:20.950> at<00:01:21.130> it<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:23.760> hope<00:01:24.760> that's<00:01:25.150> already

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
quick look at it and hope that's already

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.550 
quick look at it and hope that's already
too<00:01:25.840> large<00:01:26.080> as<00:01:26.350> you<00:01:26.409> can<00:01:26.590> see<00:01:26.800> but<00:01:27.760> then<00:01:28.720> we<00:01:29.200> go

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
too large as you can see but then we go

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.960 
too large as you can see but then we go
for<00:01:30.190> something<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:32.940> caustic<00:01:33.940> source<00:01:34.270> of<00:01:35.050> us

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
for something this caustic source of us

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.280 
for something this caustic source of us
and<00:01:37.950> definitely<00:01:38.950> not<00:01:39.160> making<00:01:39.520> much<00:01:39.729> power

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
and definitely not making much power

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.749 
and definitely not making much power
alright<00:01:41.290> so<00:01:41.830> now<00:01:42.759> focusing<00:01:43.479> abarrach<00:01:43.840> arms<00:01:44.759> I

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
alright so now focusing abarrach arms I

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.640 
alright so now focusing abarrach arms I
would<00:01:45.940> like<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:47.520> yes<00:01:48.520> oh<00:01:48.850> right<00:01:49.750> we<00:01:50.320> have<00:01:50.440> build

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
would like it yes oh right we have build

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.380 
would like it yes oh right we have build
an<00:01:50.740> engine<00:01:50.890> which<00:01:51.160> actually<00:01:51.340> fits<00:01:51.729> as<00:01:51.910> you<00:01:52.240> can

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
an engine which actually fits as you can

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.410 
an engine which actually fits as you can
see<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:53.229> airbox<00:01:53.800> stuff<00:01:54.190> is<00:01:54.399> going<00:01:54.940> outside

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
see the airbox stuff is going outside

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.570 
see the airbox stuff is going outside
and<00:01:55.720> it<00:01:55.840> still<00:01:56.170> says<00:01:56.440> the<00:01:56.890> bounding<00:01:57.250> box<00:01:57.280> is

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
and it still says the bounding box is

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.930 
and it still says the bounding box is
green<00:01:57.880> this<00:01:58.300> is<00:01:58.450> how<00:01:58.600> it<00:01:58.720> works<00:01:59.399> it<00:02:00.399> controls

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
green this is how it works it controls

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.749 
green this is how it works it controls
if<00:02:01.300> all<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:02.020> important<00:02:02.890> engine<00:02:03.190> parts<00:02:03.550> are

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
if all the important engine parts are

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.680 
if all the important engine parts are
inside<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.869> box<00:02:05.080> and<00:02:05.380> all<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.479> parts<00:02:07.479> which

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
inside the box and all the parts which

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.400 
inside the box and all the parts which
can<00:02:08.020> be<00:02:08.200> shaped<00:02:08.590> like<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.280> air<00:02:09.670> intakes<00:02:10.410> they

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
can be shaped like the air intakes they

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.960 
can be shaped like the air intakes they
are<00:02:11.650> not<00:02:11.950> considered<00:02:12.519> because<00:02:12.820> your

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
are not considered because your

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.060 
are not considered because your
designers<00:02:13.420> can<00:02:13.570> hide<00:02:13.870> them<00:02:14.080> somewhere<00:02:14.320> in<00:02:14.709> the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
designers can hide them somewhere in the

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.720 
designers can hide them somewhere in the
car<00:02:15.480> probably<00:02:16.500> below<00:02:17.500> your<00:02:17.709> seat

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
car probably below your seat

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.250 
car probably below your seat
all<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.150> exhaust<00:02:19.510> guests<00:02:20.159> so<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:23.230> is

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
all the exhaust guests so this is

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.399 
all the exhaust guests so this is
already<00:02:23.769> fine<00:02:24.129> and<00:02:24.370> now<00:02:24.970> you<00:02:25.030> could<00:02:25.330> let<00:02:26.140> go

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
already fine and now you could let go

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.289 
already fine and now you could let go
for<00:02:26.590> ya<00:02:26.769> how<00:02:27.099> big<00:02:27.310> can<00:02:27.489> I<00:02:27.610> make<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:27.970> engine

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
for ya how big can I make this engine

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.420 
for ya how big can I make this engine
