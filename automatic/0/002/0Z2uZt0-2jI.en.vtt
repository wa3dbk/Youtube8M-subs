00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:10.220 
hey guys I'm nice smaller and then we'll

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.700 
hey guys I'm nice smaller and then we'll
show<00:00:10.490> you<00:00:10.520> lm.c<00:00:11.360> but<00:00:11.570> so<00:00:11.990> if<00:00:12.260> you<00:00:12.410> update<00:00:12.530> it

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
show you lm.c but so if you update it

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.580 
show you lm.c but so if you update it
the<00:00:13.700> lamp<00:00:13.880> turns<00:00:14.180> off<00:00:14.450> and<00:00:14.930> if<00:00:15.290> you<00:00:15.320> have<00:00:15.440> did

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
the lamp turns off and if you have did

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.580 
the lamp turns off and if you have did
it<00:00:15.680> again<00:00:15.980> the<00:00:16.400> lamp<00:00:16.609> turns<00:00:16.970> on<00:00:17.289> so<00:00:18.289> it<00:00:18.410> works

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
it again the lamp turns on so it works

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.160 
it again the lamp turns on so it works
just<00:00:18.740> like<00:00:19.130> a<00:00:19.190> normal<00:00:19.370> piston<00:00:19.970> Sybil<00:00:20.360> but<00:00:20.810> view

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
just like a normal piston Sybil but view

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.390 
just like a normal piston Sybil but view
file<00:00:21.470> lamp<00:00:21.680> instead<00:00:22.340> all<00:00:23.060> right<00:00:23.800> now<00:00:24.800> before<00:00:25.130> I

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
file lamp instead all right now before I

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.970 
file lamp instead all right now before I
move<00:00:25.640> on<00:00:25.820> I'd<00:00:26.240> like<00:00:26.660> to<00:00:26.690> tell<00:00:27.500> you<00:00:27.529> guys<00:00:27.710> this

move on I'd like to tell you guys this

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.760 
move on I'd like to tell you guys this
advantage<00:00:28.550> and<00:00:28.789> disadvantage<00:00:29.050> is<00:00:30.050> that<00:00:30.080> this

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
advantage and disadvantage is that this

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.319 
advantage and disadvantage is that this
lamp<00:00:31.520> but<00:00:31.880> doesn't<00:00:32.449> work<00:00:32.599> at<00:00:32.870> night<00:00:33.940> so<00:00:34.940> as<00:00:35.149> you

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
lamp but doesn't work at night so as you

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.720 
lamp but doesn't work at night so as you
can<00:00:35.420> see<00:00:35.690> it<00:00:36.020> does<00:00:36.290> work<00:00:36.590> when<00:00:37.040> it's<00:00:37.250> nighttime

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
can see it does work when it's nighttime

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.290 
can see it does work when it's nighttime
and<00:00:40.600> you<00:00:41.600> will<00:00:41.720> see<00:00:41.899> why<00:00:42.050> in<00:00:42.079> a<00:00:42.470> second<00:00:43.070> so<00:00:43.820> now

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
and you will see why in a second so now

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.920 
and you will see why in a second so now
let's<00:00:44.510> build<00:00:44.660> it<00:00:44.809> place<00:00:45.649> your<00:00:45.920> redstone<00:00:46.190> lamp

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
let's build it place your redstone lamp

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.130 
let's build it place your redstone lamp
rest<00:00:47.930> on<00:00:48.140> block<00:00:48.410> rest<00:00:49.340> on<00:00:49.719> zigbee<00:00:50.719> stone

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
rest on block rest on zigbee stone

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.340 
rest on block rest on zigbee stone
detector<00:00:51.620> rail<00:00:51.820> redstone<00:00:52.820> and<00:00:53.030> a<00:00:53.870> divided

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
detector rail redstone and a divided

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:03.190 
detector rail redstone and a divided
sensor<00:00:56.649> alright<00:01:00.489> so<00:01:01.489> there<00:01:01.789> there<00:01:02.360> is<00:01:02.450> some

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
sensor alright so there there is some

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.969 
sensor alright so there there is some
weird<00:01:03.469> bug<00:01:03.800> that<00:01:04.549> lets<00:01:05.119> you<00:01:05.330> make<00:01:05.590> lamp<00:01:06.590> BOTS

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
weird bug that lets you make lamp BOTS

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.570 
weird bug that lets you make lamp BOTS
using<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.790> daylight<00:01:08.119> sensor<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:09.580> the

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
using the daylight sensor and the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.060 
using the daylight sensor and the
concept<00:01:11.570> of<00:01:11.690> using<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:12.080> daylight<00:01:12.350> sensor<00:01:12.860> and

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
concept of using the daylight sensor and

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.060 
concept of using the daylight sensor and
the<00:01:13.100> back<00:01:13.460> was<00:01:13.729> found<00:01:14.390> by<00:01:14.690> mr.<00:01:15.440> fizzy<00:01:15.830> 16<00:01:16.340> and

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
the back was found by mr. fizzy 16 and

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.039 
the back was found by mr. fizzy 16 and
in<00:01:19.070> this<00:01:19.340> video<00:01:19.520> I'm<00:01:20.119> not<00:01:20.450> going<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.840> explain

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
made the singing and four versions of

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:42.450 
made the singing and four versions of
the<00:01:34.189> lamp<00:01:34.400> but<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.450> yeah<00:01:37.000> all<00:01:38.000> right

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.450 

if<00:01:42.580> you<00:01:42.880> want<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:43.330> use<00:01:43.570> the<00:01:44.350> rest<00:01:44.560> on<00:01:44.799> lamp<00:01:45.040> but

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
if you want to use the rest on lamp but

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.660 
if you want to use the rest on lamp but
when<00:01:45.940> it's<00:01:46.119> night<00:01:46.530> then<00:01:47.530> I<00:01:47.740> suggest<00:01:47.860> you<00:01:48.340> build

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
when it's night then I suggest you build

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.930 
when it's night then I suggest you build
the<00:01:49.060> lamp<00:01:49.960> but<00:01:50.260> that<00:01:50.530> rats<00:01:50.920> miners<00:01:51.340> camp<00:01:51.580> came

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
the lamp but that rats miners camp came

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.350 
the lamp but that rats miners camp came
up<00:01:52.150> diff<00:01:52.360> instead<00:01:53.190> it<00:01:54.190> uses<00:01:54.400> bone<00:01:54.820> meal<00:01:55.090> and

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
up diff instead it uses bone meal and

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.120 
up diff instead it uses bone meal and
you<00:01:55.540> need<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:55.810> review<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:56.259> but<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:56.740> works<00:01:56.950> at

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
you need to review it but it works at

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.990 
you need to review it but it works at
night<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.640> I<00:01:58.450> think<00:01:58.509> it's<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:59.110> only<00:01:59.710> way<00:02:00.000> to

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
night and I think it's the only way to

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.270 
night and I think it's the only way to
make<00:02:01.180> a<00:02:01.390> lamp<00:02:01.600> but<00:02:01.869> that<00:02:02.050> works<00:02:02.320> a<00:02:02.590> day<00:02:02.979> and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
make a lamp but that works a day and

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.200 
make a lamp but that works a day and
night<00:02:03.640> but<00:02:04.240> yeah<00:02:04.780> again<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:06.399> downside<00:02:06.909> is

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
night but yeah again the downside is

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.870 
night but yeah again the downside is
that<00:02:07.240> you<00:02:07.630> have<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:08.080> review<00:02:08.410> it<00:02:10.020> alright<00:02:11.020> so<00:02:11.880> if

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
that you have to review it alright so if

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.930 
that you have to review it alright so if
you<00:02:13.180> want<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.390> find<00:02:13.630> out<00:02:13.810> how<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.230> all<00:02:14.290> works

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
you want to find out how it all works

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.690
