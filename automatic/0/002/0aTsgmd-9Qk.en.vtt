00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
vampire side is the fact that you get a

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.569 
vampire side is the fact that you get a
50%<00:01:38.970> increase<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.450> magic<00:01:40.110> stamina<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.950> health

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
probably thinking the vampire is the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.340 
probably thinking the vampire is the

more dominant character to choose from

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.380 
more dominant character to choose from
but<00:02:07.829> there<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.129> con<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.940> there<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.149> actually

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
but there is a con and there is actually

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.750 
but there is a con and there is actually
only<00:02:09.720> one<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.129> fact<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.550> you

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
only one and that is the fact that you

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.309 
only one and that is the fact that you
can<00:02:11.940> not<00:02:12.150> go<00:02:12.330> into<00:02:12.629> first<00:02:12.870> person

playing with crossbows the only downside

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.939 
playing with crossbows the only downside
to<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.780> crossbow<00:03:25.139> is<00:03:25.199> that<00:03:25.349> it's<00:03:25.500> actually<00:03:25.709> a

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
to the crossbow is that it's actually a

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.699 
to the crossbow is that it's actually a
lot<00:03:26.430> slower<00:03:26.879> reloading<00:03:27.689> and<00:03:27.870> now<00:03:28.349> when<00:03:28.560> you're

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
lot slower reloading and now when you're

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.259 
lot slower reloading and now when you're
moving<00:03:28.889> while<00:03:29.220> you're<00:03:29.340> reloading<00:03:29.489> it's<00:03:29.939> quite

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
moving while you're reloading it's quite

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.330 
moving while you're reloading it's quite
slow<00:03:30.659> so<00:03:31.199> that's<00:03:31.530> pretty<00:03:31.739> much<00:03:31.859> the<00:03:32.040> end<00:03:32.069> of<00:03:32.280> my

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
slow so that's pretty much the end of my

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.839 
slow so that's pretty much the end of my
little<00:03:32.699> comparison<00:03:33.239> video<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.220> my<00:03:35.220> personal

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
little comparison video and my personal

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.909
