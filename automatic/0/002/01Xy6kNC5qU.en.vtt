00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.010 

correctly<00:01:51.619> correct<00:01:52.579> so<00:01:52.850> our<00:01:53.420> goal<00:01:53.630> here<00:01:53.659> is

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.460 
correctly correct so our goal here is
when<00:01:54.530> we

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
when we

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.790

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
can get them all but we do learn to get

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.790 
can get them all but we do learn to get

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
there I think just how involved they

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.050 
there I think just how involved they
have<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.740> get<00:03:23.890> in<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.190> okay<00:03:24.520> we're<00:03:24.700> gonna<00:03:24.790> spend

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
have to get in it okay we're gonna spend

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.020 
have to get in it okay we're gonna spend
a<00:03:25.210> couple<00:03:25.360> hours<00:03:26.160> moving<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.250> bridge<00:03:27.520> through

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
a couple hours moving the bridge through

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.600 
a couple hours moving the bridge through
and<00:03:28.420> just<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:29.170> big<00:03:29.380> process<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.190> just<00:03:30.370> how

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
and just the big process and just how
