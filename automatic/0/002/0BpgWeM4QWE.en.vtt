gesso<00:00:43.379> people<00:00:43.949> say<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.100> can't<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.790> you<00:00:44.820> can

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
gesso people say you can't do it you can

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.310 
gesso people say you can't do it you can
you<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.809> be<00:00:45.900> really<00:00:46.050> careful

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
you just have to be really careful

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.890 
you just have to be really careful
because<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.949> doesn't<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:48.000> not<00:00:48.089> permanent<00:00:48.390> if

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
because it doesn't it's not permanent if

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.640 
because it doesn't it's not permanent if
if<00:00:49.890> water<00:00:50.129> hits<00:00:50.400> it<00:00:50.580> but<00:00:51.479> again<00:00:51.720> if<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.140> use<00:00:52.229> my

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
if water hits it but again if you use my

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.250 
if water hits it but again if you use my
krylon<00:00:53.309> technique<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> video<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.140> my

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
krylon technique I have a video on my

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.439 
krylon technique I have a video on my
channel<00:00:55.290> try<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.860> link<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.400> it'll<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:57.269> will

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
channel try to link to it it'll it will

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.299 
channel try to link to it it'll it will
seal<00:00:57.659> it<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.900> permanently<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:59.040> is<00:00:59.190> just

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
seal it in permanently this is just

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.090 
seal it in permanently this is just
India<00:00:59.699> ink<00:00:59.940> after<00:01:00.870> i<00:01:00.930> did<00:01:01.080> some<00:01:01.320> water<00:01:01.769> drip

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
India ink after i did some water drip

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.939 
India ink after i did some water drip
edge<00:01:02.839> which<00:01:03.839> i<00:01:03.960> thought<00:01:04.110> was<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.260> kind<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.769> fun

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
edge which i thought was a kind of fun

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.270 
edge which i thought was a kind of fun
effect<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:07.440> water<00:01:07.620> dripping<00:01:08.010> out<00:01:08.190> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
effect so the water dripping out the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.020 
effect so the water dripping out the
India<00:01:08.520> ink<00:01:08.600> but<00:01:09.710> so<00:01:10.710> again<00:01:11.100> we're<00:01:11.430> creating<00:01:11.820> a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
India ink but so again we're creating a

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.499 
India ink but so again we're creating a
circle<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.250> some<00:01:14.250> more<00:01:14.460> side<00:01:14.969> drippage<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:17.509> was

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
circle and some more side drippage I was

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.899 
circle and some more side drippage I was
I<00:01:18.780> guess<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.350> Donna<00:01:19.799> down<00:01:20.039> a<00:01:20.070> circle

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
I guess in the Donna down a circle

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.300 
I guess in the Donna down a circle
drippage<00:01:21.360> phase<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.409> day<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.009> really

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
drippage phase this day this is a really

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.880 
drippage phase this day this is a really
quick<00:01:23.460> video<00:01:23.820> um<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.439> because<00:01:25.710> I

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
quick video um I but just because I

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.649 
quick video um I but just because I
wanted<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.189> keep<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.430> simple<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.149> it's<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.479> a

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
wanted to keep it simple so it's just a

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.139 
wanted to keep it simple so it's just a
little<00:01:28.259> bit<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.380> water<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.039> a<00:01:29.609> paper<00:01:29.909> towel

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
little bit of water and a paper towel

little bit of water and a paper towel
and<00:01:30.450> all<00:01:31.200> I'm<00:01:31.350> doing<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.219> circle<00:01:32.700> now

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
and all I'm doing is in that circle now

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.240 
and all I'm doing is in that circle now
that<00:01:33.030> everything's<00:01:33.450> dry<00:01:33.750> I'm<00:01:34.469> just<00:01:34.770> going<00:01:35.070> in

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
that everything's dry I'm just going in

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.760

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
and lifting up as much of the delusions

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.149 
and lifting up as much of the delusions
as<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.039> can<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.780> which<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:40.619> really<00:01:40.950> cool

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
as I can and which it's really cool

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.520 
as I can and which it's really cool
because<00:01:41.219> it<00:01:41.700> looks<00:01:41.939> like<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.390> almost<00:01:42.600> frosted

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
because it looks like you almost frosted

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.270 
because it looks like you almost frosted
it<00:01:44.299> or<00:01:45.299> gave<00:01:45.840> just<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.350> center<00:01:46.679> part<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.039> wash

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
it or gave just that center part of wash

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.730 
it or gave just that center part of wash
when<00:01:47.939> all<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.179> had<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.560> remove<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
when all you had to do is remove the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.330 
when all you had to do is remove the
color<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.840> yeah<00:01:51.840> really<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.979> that

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.800 
color so yeah really like that that that
made<00:01:53.520> me<00:01:53.700> happy<00:01:55.700> so<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.759> went<00:01:56.909> started<00:01:57.420> using<00:01:57.570> my

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
made me happy so I went started using my

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.660 
made me happy so I went started using my
micron<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.289> it's<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.799> epic<00:01:59.130> battle<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
micron and it's the epic battle of the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.959 
micron and it's the epic battle of the
pens<00:01:59.909> yet<00:02:00.210> again<00:02:00.560> my<00:02:01.560> micron<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.219> way<00:02:02.399> old<00:02:02.609> so<00:02:02.909> I

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
pens yet again my micron is way old so I

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.490 
pens yet again my micron is way old so I
switched<00:02:03.240> over<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.630> just<00:02:03.929> some<00:02:04.109> ballpoint<00:02:05.100> pen

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
switched over to just some ballpoint pen

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.850 
switched over to just some ballpoint pen
I<00:02:07.810> figure<00:02:08.810> I'm<00:02:08.899> working<00:02:09.229> in<00:02:09.320> a<00:02:09.410> junker<00:02:09.830> and

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
I figure I'm working in a junker and
