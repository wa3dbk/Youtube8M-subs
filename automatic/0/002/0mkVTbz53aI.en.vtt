00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.930
 Eh 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.990
 Tsukumo will end the fight 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.509
 -Just ask 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:08.890
 Who is it 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.509
 By the end of hygiene 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.699
 We absolutely lose because of 02 hop garden mall store participation 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:16.769
 You may like it when you think you can not 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.169
 If I can't zoom in, I wonder how this is 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.140
 I'm still using it or not 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.530
 The movie does it 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.739
 It is pop for that 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:27.199
 I hope everyone is happy Saturday is January 22 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.359
 The salary man is stronger but it is a minute 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.980
 I am working hard because it is closed on Sundays 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.829
 But you know 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.560
 There is a game development to everyone of the suburbs type city unit price 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.300
 The first 100 years of all 11r future 100 years 14 years into it 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.350
 Though 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.230
 That's the time 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.410
 Customers come in that schedule 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.690
 Yes I'm a little bit of the material in Japan 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.589
 It is said that Oita donated 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:55.800
 Even if you sit down 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.710
 I think there may be some requests, for example 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.620
 later 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.060
 It is in the bag, and in the United States in the young voice 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.450
 What do you want if you are dead inside? 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.450
 Some people are pulling 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.910
 Let's make a place of restructuring of the mountain which is only that restaurant 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.130
 I think but I should strike it 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.619
 I think it seems like there is a chrysanthemum stupid 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.729
 It's a bit fair and extreme, so it's a defensive first 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.389
 The way it was bundled was the best that came here to come 

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:33.310
 I wonder if I can do it for the person who is putting the low price 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.539
 Some people say 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.700
 If the person considers the edge from now on, 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.580
 Ecuador is getting more and more rebuilt 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.579
 In the fact that it is solid 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:44.940
 Air Do 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.880
 The material is good and there are three representative markets 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.830
 The Senate craftsman translates the court appearance country to 205 same company 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.399
 However 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.880
 That normal thing is done to the customer, but why 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.609
 I'm not playing outside the market 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:01.780
 In the committee 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.560
 We enjoy in family of students of eight schools clearly and are clear 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.549
 There is fc Tokyo but I do not need this 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.390
 And from that 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.679
 Furuta is good but 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:15.299
 Even if you ask how much it will cost for materials 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:15.789
 is 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:18.789
 Even if you know such a thing or enter the terms and conditions, yen 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.539
 Meters 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:23.889
 No such thing 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.909
 The conclusion of the impression of this work is concluded recently and the following period newly 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:28.779
 ing 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:32.200
 I also think that Mr. Ogai's legs are Mr. 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:34.820
 Even if you want to have the moderation of Otsu City 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.439
 Because it gets rough 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.969
 I wonder what I'm saying because I felt like 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:39.329
 Good 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.229
 Murata 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:43.229
 Yeah, it's crispy. 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:47.539
 Because there is something wrong when going to Jasper. 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.279
 It is said that if it is okay 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:53.019
 In what I think 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.290
 The film is really rice down 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.549
 I will do our customers, but the male influence is Yamamon, so today is war 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:01.389
 Once 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.780
 While digesting autot 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.780
 That means 607- 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:08.019
 In that 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.019
 It is a country that feels lonely because the distortion is gone 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:13.859
 I have to come again next week
