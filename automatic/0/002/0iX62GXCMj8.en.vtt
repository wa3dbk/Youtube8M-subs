be<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> really<00:02:19.890> good<00:02:20.130> taste<00:02:20.460> but<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.790> would

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
be a really good taste but it would

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.490 
be a really good taste but it would

right yeah that's a lot of calories but

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.130 
right yeah that's a lot of calories but

which has about five to six hundred

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.080 
which has about five to six hundred
calories<00:02:49.140> about<00:02:49.410> 50<00:02:49.770> grams<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.250> protein<00:02:50.490> so

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
calories about 50 grams of protein so

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.030 
calories about 50 grams of protein so
this<00:02:51.300> actually<00:02:51.480> fits<00:02:51.930> perfectly<00:02:52.620> into<00:02:52.860> my

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
macros I get about a hundred and fifty

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.040 
macros I get about a hundred and fifty
grams<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.590> carbs<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:56.130> day<00:02:56.430> plenty<00:02:57.270> of<00:02:57.540> fat

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
grams of carbs that day plenty of fat

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.990 
grams of carbs that day plenty of fat
and<00:02:58.320> then<00:02:58.740> a<00:02:58.770> hundred<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.250> fifty<00:02:59.520> grams<00:02:59.790> of

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.420 
and then a hundred and fifty grams of
protein<00:03:00.240> so<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.320> perfect<00:03:01.830> perfect
