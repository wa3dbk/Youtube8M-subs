00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:04.770
 work on the sncf line between tours and chinon has been going on since 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.340
 July 15th this morning on a level crossing near azay-le-cureau they have 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.659
 sometimes force drivers to make bets 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:14.660
 andy schleck for cars 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.770
 the less in a hurry had to wait for a good half hour 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.099
 work and the work will wait 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.099
 with the day to snap then when will it be time 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.689
 this work started in 2007 and will extend until 2010 for a 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.499
 of 9 million euros and today we will have a phase 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.150
 a bit special because we put what we call the gutters 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.520
 the gutters that will allow to put all of the that we 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.520
 let's settle behind me like air liquid in the usa 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.580
 reading these gutters then we will go from 10 successful in 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.060
 so with capacity speeds of 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.060
 information transfer that are out of proportion to what you want 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.640
 this is the first time that optical fiber has been installed on a 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.470
 the region 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.930
 with this funny machine unique in the world sncf agents will have installed 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.030
 more than 39 km of gutters along the railway line 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.970
 objective to avoid copper cable theft which causes many delays and 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.010
 increase rail traffic 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.210
 at the end of this work will set up some centralized commands 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.700
 which will allow my side 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.740
 according to the will of the regional council the number of circulations between tours and 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.370
 China in the lead 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.580
 it's interesting because it does not get off despite we're going to say that the 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.670
 details of the agreement the daily the cross say that it represents 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.900
 represents 2% dancing journeys from the center it is nearly 1000 people 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.380
 per day for this post with a lot of meticulous work 2006 study et al 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.170
 with the increase is the size of the sampdoria nothing big question 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.710
 of the future for transport 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.880
 since three weeks ago 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.530
 the rail traffic is totally interrupted between ballan-mirÃ© the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.060
 bargain hunters but the cards have been put in place for the transport of passengers 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.910
