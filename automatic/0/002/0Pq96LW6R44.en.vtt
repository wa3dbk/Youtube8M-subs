rest<00:02:39.920> now<00:02:40.100> you<00:02:40.580> break<00:02:40.850> down<00:02:41.030> more<00:02:41.360> tissue<00:02:42.220> than

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
rest now you break down more tissue than

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.150 
rest now you break down more tissue than
the<00:02:43.400> body's<00:02:43.820> ability<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.420> compensate<00:02:44.900> for<00:02:45.410> and

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
the body's ability to compensate for and

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.560 
the body's ability to compensate for and
you<00:02:46.310> wrestle<00:02:46.700> yeah<00:02:46.820> it<00:02:46.880> will<00:02:47.090> break<00:02:47.270> doing

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
you wrestle yeah it will break doing

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.130 
you wrestle yeah it will break doing
difference<00:02:48.220> because<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.370> body<00:02:49.610> can<00:02:49.820> only

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
difference because the body can only

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.630 
difference because the body can only
compensate<00:02:51.140> then<00:02:51.620> we<00:02:51.800> come<00:02:52.010> from<00:02:52.190> so<00:02:52.489> much

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
compensate then we come from so much

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.560 
compensate then we come from so much
breakdown<00:02:53.209> at<00:02:53.959> a<00:02:54.020> session<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:56.150> got<00:02:56.420> to

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
breakdown at a session you got to

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.110 
breakdown at a session you got to
understand<00:02:57.080> that<00:02:57.170> some<00:02:57.470> Claxton<00:02:58.070> they<00:02:58.820> train

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
understand that some Claxton they train

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.280 
understand that some Claxton they train
all<00:02:59.330> day<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.900> only<00:02:59.989> got<00:03:00.290> do<00:03:00.500> is<00:03:00.590> rest<00:03:00.830> I<00:03:02.290> can't

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
all day and only got do is rest I can't

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.199 
all day and only got do is rest I can't

the body can only come see once your
body<00:03:11.570> recovers<00:03:12.410> fully<00:03:13.330> then<00:03:14.330> it<00:03:14.480> goes

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
body recovers fully then it goes

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.750 
body recovers fully then it goes
backwards<00:03:15.560> for<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:15.920> record<00:03:16.220> retrogress

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
backwards for the record retrogress

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.940 
backwards for the record retrogress
people<00:03:17.090> realize<00:03:17.450> that<00:03:17.480> there's<00:03:18.290> only<00:03:18.500> so<00:03:18.830> if
