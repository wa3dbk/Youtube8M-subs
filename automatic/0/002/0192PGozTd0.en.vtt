this<00:04:17.489> was<00:04:17.549> kind<00:04:17.940> of<00:04:18.000> a<00:04:18.120> mistake<00:04:18.269> I<00:04:18.690> by<00:04:18.870> myself

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
this was kind of a mistake I by myself

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.420 
this was kind of a mistake I by myself
and<00:04:19.500> as<00:04:19.650> you<00:04:19.769> can<00:04:19.950> see<00:04:19.979> suddenly<00:04:20.700> amid<00:04:21.479> mooses

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
and as you can see suddenly amid mooses

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.190 
and as you can see suddenly amid mooses
value<00:04:23.430> went<00:04:23.669> up<00:04:23.700> to<00:04:23.880> 16<00:04:24.360> million<00:04:24.600> and<00:04:24.870> I<00:04:24.930> swear

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
value went up to 16 million and I swear

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.440 
value went up to 16 million and I swear
was<00:04:25.380> only<00:04:25.650> 4.5<00:04:26.250> not<00:04:26.490> long<00:04:26.640> ago<00:04:26.789> I'm

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
was only 4.5 not long ago I'm

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.000 
was only 4.5 not long ago I'm
entirely<00:04:27.810> sure<00:04:28.140> what<00:04:28.320> was<00:04:28.440> going<00:04:28.590> on<00:04:28.770> there

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
entirely sure what was going on there

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.650 
entirely sure what was going on there
but<00:04:29.460> that's<00:04:29.550> just<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:29.880> way<00:04:30.060> it<00:04:30.240> ended<00:04:30.510> up

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
but that's just the way it ended up

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.870 
but that's just the way it ended up
going<00:04:31.080> on<00:04:31.230> anyways<00:04:31.890> like<00:04:32.010> I<00:04:32.160> was<00:04:32.190> saying<00:04:32.580> one

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
going on anyways like I was saying one

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.370 
going on anyways like I was saying one
of<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.060> things<00:04:33.270> I<00:04:33.390> didn't<00:04:33.630> realize<00:04:33.870> it<00:04:34.020> was<00:04:34.170> I

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
of the things I didn't realize it was I

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.500 
of the things I didn't realize it was I
guess<00:04:34.680> it's<00:04:34.860> common<00:04:35.220> sense<00:04:35.250> but<00:04:35.670> it<00:04:36.150> requires

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
guess it's common sense but it requires

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.300 
guess it's common sense but it requires
you<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:36.810> think<00:04:37.050> quite<00:04:37.260> a<00:04:37.320> lot<00:04:37.590> is<00:04:37.740> that<00:04:37.950> you

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.870 
the final two years of their contract
let's<00:04:52.560> be<00:04:52.680> honest<00:04:53.010> you<00:04:53.160> know<00:04:53.280> so<00:04:53.700> that's

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
let's be honest you know so that's

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.130 
let's be honest you know so that's
something<00:04:54.030> I<00:04:54.150> didn't<00:04:54.390> really<00:04:54.480> keep<00:04:54.690> in<00:04:54.870> mind

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
something I didn't really keep in mind

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.170 
something I didn't really keep in mind
when<00:04:55.350> I<00:04:55.380> set<00:04:55.920> those<00:04:56.100> particular<00:04:56.550> instructions

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
when I set those particular instructions

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.940 
when I set those particular instructions
so<00:04:57.570> my<00:04:57.720> scouts<00:04:57.960> went<00:04:58.290> out<00:04:58.350> and<00:04:58.590> it<00:04:58.680> was<00:04:58.800> almost

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
so my scouts went out and it was almost

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.710 
so my scouts went out and it was almost
impossible<00:04:59.250> for<00:04:59.730> them<00:04:59.940> to<00:05:00.000> find<00:05:00.420> players

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
impossible for them to find players

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.810 
impossible for them to find players
because<00:05:01.320> like<00:05:01.440> I<00:05:01.590> said<00:05:01.650> to<00:05:02.250> find<00:05:02.430> players

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
because like I said to find players

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.790 
because like I said to find players
there<00:05:03.090> you<00:05:03.240> know<00:05:03.360> 1819<00:05:04.260> with<00:05:04.440> a<00:05:04.470> lot<00:05:04.710> of

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
there you know 1819 with a lot of

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.770 
there you know 1819 with a lot of
promise<00:05:05.190> in<00:05:05.310> them<00:05:05.490> they're<00:05:05.880> not<00:05:06.120> gonna<00:05:06.300> be<00:05:06.540> on

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
promise in them they're not gonna be on

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.510 
promise in them they're not gonna be on
their<00:05:06.990> last<00:05:07.200> two<00:05:07.440> years<00:05:07.620> of<00:05:07.830> a<00:05:07.890> contract<00:05:08.340> are

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
their last two years of a contract are

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.340 
their last two years of a contract are
they<00:05:08.700> so<00:05:08.760> you<00:05:09.360> know<00:05:09.450> the<00:05:09.600> results<00:05:10.050> i'm<00:05:10.170> going

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
they so you know the results i'm going

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.370 
they so you know the results i'm going
to<00:05:10.410> be<00:05:10.500> getting<00:05:10.620> back<00:05:10.890> I<00:05:11.070> guess<00:05:11.310> I'm<00:05:11.460> kind<00:05:11.670> of

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
to be getting back I guess I'm kind of

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.380 
to be getting back I guess I'm kind of
spoiling<00:05:13.380> what<00:05:14.130> the<00:05:14.250> scouts<00:05:14.490> did<00:05:14.790> but<00:05:15.030> you

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
spoiling what the scouts did but you

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.030 
spoiling what the scouts did but you
know<00:05:15.420> they<00:05:15.630> just<00:05:15.810> they<00:05:16.260> couldn't<00:05:16.740> come<00:05:16.860> back

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
know they just they couldn't come back

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.070 
know they just they couldn't come back
with<00:05:17.250> any<00:05:17.370> sort<00:05:17.610> of<00:05:17.700> good<00:05:17.910> Intel<00:05:18.420> at<00:05:18.630> all<00:05:18.840> and

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
with any sort of good Intel at all and

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.960 
with any sort of good Intel at all and
for<00:05:19.590> that<00:05:19.710> reason<00:05:19.770> you<00:05:20.160> know<00:05:20.340> that<00:05:20.520> was<00:05:20.640> my<00:05:20.790> own

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
for that reason you know that was my own

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.400 
for that reason you know that was my own
mistake<00:05:21.300> but<00:05:21.660> it<00:05:21.750> was<00:05:21.840> something<00:05:22.170> that<00:05:22.200> you

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
mistake but it was something that you

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.480 
mistake but it was something that you
know<00:05:22.500> kind<00:05:22.740> of<00:05:22.770> made<00:05:22.920> me<00:05:22.950> realize<00:05:23.340> you<00:05:23.370> know

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
know kind of made me realize you know

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.400 
know kind of made me realize you know
this<00:05:23.730> game<00:05:23.910> is<00:05:24.150> quite<00:05:24.480> a<00:05:24.510> bit<00:05:24.840> more<00:05:25.020> in<00:05:25.140> debt

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
this game is quite a bit more in debt

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.350 
this game is quite a bit more in debt
this<00:05:25.680> in<00:05:25.920> depth<00:05:26.250> this<00:05:26.400> year<00:05:26.640> you<00:05:27.000> really<00:05:27.240> have

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.940 
this in depth this year you really have
to<00:05:27.480> think<00:05:27.630> about<00:05:27.840> certain<00:05:28.290> things<00:05:28.320> and<00:05:28.680> I<00:05:28.920> just

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
to think about certain things and I just

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.800 
to think about certain things and I just
really<00:05:29.460> enjoyed<00:05:29.820> eating<00:05:29.970> I<00:05:30.090> was<00:05:30.240> really<00:05:30.570> happy

to see that you know FIFA actually

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.160 
to see that you know FIFA actually
requires<00:05:32.970> you<00:05:33.180> to<00:05:33.270> think<00:05:33.540> that<00:05:33.780> little<00:05:34.050> bit

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
requires you to think that little bit

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.870 
requires you to think that little bit
more<00:05:34.380> but<00:05:34.770> anyways<00:05:35.040> I<00:05:35.070> had<00:05:35.430> a<00:05:35.460> friendly

against PSG of course it was preseason

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.740 
against PSG of course it was preseason
and<00:05:38.040> I<00:05:38.310> was<00:05:38.460> expecting<00:05:38.910> the<00:05:39.240> big<00:05:39.450> black

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750
