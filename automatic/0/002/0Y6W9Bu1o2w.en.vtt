for<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.680> blood<00:00:05.100> good<00:00:05.400> maple<00:00:06.029> now<00:00:06.899> though<00:00:07.140> this

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
for a blood good maple now though this

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.410 
for a blood good maple now though this
is<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.710> type<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.370> Japanese<00:00:08.940> maple<00:00:10.639> Acer<00:00:11.639> pomade

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
is a type of Japanese maple Acer pomade

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.810 
is a type of Japanese maple Acer pomade
um<00:00:12.599> Bloodgood<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.590> what<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.099> means<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.639> me

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
um Bloodgood and what that means to me

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.430 
um Bloodgood and what that means to me
is<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.150> it's<00:00:15.330> gonna<00:00:15.509> be<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.719> much<00:00:15.990> smaller

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
is that it's gonna be a much smaller

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.210 
is that it's gonna be a much smaller
maple<00:00:17.039> probably<00:00:17.699> about<00:00:17.910> 18<00:00:18.480> feet<00:00:18.750> tall

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
maple probably about 18 feet tall

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.950 
maple probably about 18 feet tall
because<00:00:20.220> they're<00:00:20.460> small<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:21.180> lot<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.630> people

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
because they're small a lot of people

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.840 
because they're small a lot of people
are<00:00:22.080> able<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.500> grow<00:00:22.680> them<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:22.949> containers<00:00:22.980> just

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
are able to grow them in containers just

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.720 
are able to grow them in containers just
like<00:00:24.240> all<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.600> other<00:00:24.750> Japanese<00:00:25.410> maples<00:00:25.949> you

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
like all the other Japanese maples you

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.759 
like all the other Japanese maples you
may<00:00:26.970> need<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.359> up<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.750> container<00:00:28.199> size<00:00:28.529> at

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
may need to up the container size at

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.279 
may need to up the container size at
some<00:00:28.980> point<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.119> other<00:00:30.269> hand<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:31.080> can

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
some point on the other hand you can

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.530 
some point on the other hand you can
pull<00:00:31.590> them<00:00:31.769> back<00:00:31.949> up<00:00:32.189> later<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.360> can

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
pull them back up later and you can

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.650 
pull them back up later and you can
actually<00:00:33.750> root<00:00:34.320> prune<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.460> tree<00:00:35.850> what<00:00:36.510> you

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
actually root prune the tree what you

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.010 
actually root prune the tree what you
want<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.960> remember<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:39.000> canopy<00:00:39.450> and

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
want to remember is that the canopy and

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.400 
want to remember is that the canopy and
the<00:00:40.950> roots<00:00:41.219> are<00:00:41.550> kind<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.450> gonna<00:00:42.629> match<00:00:42.960> so

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
the roots are kind of gonna match so

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.410 
the roots are kind of gonna match so
you'll<00:00:44.100> probably<00:00:44.370> want<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.879> shrink<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
you'll probably want to shrink the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.440 
you'll probably want to shrink the
canopy<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.170> as<00:00:46.320> well<00:00:46.620> if<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.789> do<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.239> with

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
canopy in as well if you do that with

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.630 
canopy in as well if you do that with
the<00:00:48.629> roots<00:00:48.899> otherwise<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:50.039> has<00:00:50.250> quite<00:00:50.489> a

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the roots otherwise this one has quite a

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.369 
the roots otherwise this one has quite a
while<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.030> go<00:00:51.180> before<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.539> need<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.899> worry<00:00:52.110> about

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
while to go before I need to worry about

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.139 
while to go before I need to worry about
it<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.770> they'll<00:00:52.980> do<00:00:53.430> really<00:00:53.699> well<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
it and they'll do really well in a

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.670 
it and they'll do really well in a
container<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.719> size<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> number<00:00:55.590> of

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
container this size for a number of

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.049 
container this size for a number of
years<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:57.120> what<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:58.309> right<00:00:59.309> now<00:00:59.489> while<00:00:59.850> it's

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
years so what I do right now while it's

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.360 
years so what I do right now while it's
young<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.600> fairly<00:01:01.020> newly<00:01:01.559> planted<00:01:01.859> is

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
young and it's fairly newly planted is

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.250 
young and it's fairly newly planted is
make<00:01:02.670> sure<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.120> give<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.510> plenty<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.960> water

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
make sure that I give it plenty of water

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.830 
make sure that I give it plenty of water
because<00:01:05.040> like<00:01:05.220> any<00:01:05.519> tree<00:01:05.939> until<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.390> has<00:01:06.570> time

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
because like any tree until it has time

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.929 
because like any tree until it has time
for<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> roots<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.530> establish<00:01:08.189> whether<00:01:08.670> it's

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
for the roots to establish whether it's

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.969 
for the roots to establish whether it's
in<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> ground<00:01:09.420> or<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> container<00:01:10.170> keep<00:01:10.799> it

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
in the ground or a container keep it

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.890 
in the ground or a container keep it
well<00:01:11.159> watered<00:01:11.430> but<00:01:11.880> make<00:01:12.119> sure<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.540> good

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
well watered but make sure it's good

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.929 
well watered but make sure it's good
draining<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.619> don't<00:01:13.830> want<00:01:14.040> your<00:01:14.310> maple<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
draining you don't want your maple to

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.499 
draining you don't want your maple to
sit<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.479> water<00:01:16.070> if<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.340> were<00:01:17.549> getting<00:01:17.759> into<00:01:18.299> too

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
sit in water if I were getting into too

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.690 
sit in water if I were getting into too
much<00:01:18.689> Sun<00:01:19.110> I'd<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.799> burnt<00:01:20.130> leaves<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:20.670> you

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
much Sun I'd have burnt leaves but you

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.249 
much Sun I'd have burnt leaves but you
can<00:01:20.939> see<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> new<00:01:21.450> growth<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.900> good<00:01:22.110> and

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
can see the new growth is good and

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.010 
can see the new growth is good and
healthy<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.640> notice<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.450> have<00:01:24.479> bird

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
healthy if you notice that you have bird

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.050 
healthy if you notice that you have bird
Leafs<00:01:25.350> then<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.250> want<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.520> make<00:01:26.640> sure<00:01:26.670> you're

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
Leafs then you want to make sure you're

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.539 
Leafs then you want to make sure you're
watering<00:01:27.689> or<00:01:28.080> maybe<00:01:28.500> move<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> little

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
but as a rule Bloodgood maples do pretty

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.460

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
is I like to give my trees a fertilizer

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.450 
is I like to give my trees a fertilizer
spike<00:01:51.360> now<00:01:52.320> that's<00:01:52.590> gonna<00:01:52.920> be<00:01:55.189> pretty<00:01:56.189> much<00:01:56.430> a

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
spike now that's gonna be pretty much a

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.480 
spike now that's gonna be pretty much a
small<00:01:56.850> spike<00:01:57.600> for<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.110> sized<00:01:58.409> tree<00:01:58.920> as<00:01:59.159> they

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
small spike for this sized tree as they

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.999 
small spike for this sized tree as they
get<00:01:59.700> bigger<00:01:59.969> I'll<00:02:00.390> use<00:02:00.869> two<00:02:01.140> or<00:02:01.320> three<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.890> don't

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
get bigger I'll use two or three I don't

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.830 
get bigger I'll use two or three I don't
like<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.549> large<00:02:02.790> ones<00:02:03.090> because<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.479> feel<00:02:03.810> like

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
like the large ones because I feel like

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.600 
like the large ones because I feel like
they're<00:02:04.170> too<00:02:04.320> damaging<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.100> roots<00:02:05.340> when

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
they're too damaging to the roots when

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.700 
they're too damaging to the roots when
you<00:02:05.700> poke<00:02:05.939> them<00:02:06.119> down<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.479> there<00:02:06.689> but<00:02:07.439> all<00:02:07.560> you

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
you poke them down in there but all you

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.320 
you poke them down in there but all you
do<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.129> kind<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.429> make<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> little<00:02:08.940> bit<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.239> an

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
do is kind of make a little bit of an

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.530 
do is kind of make a little bit of an
indentation<00:02:09.929> into<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.560> soil<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:12.090> just<00:02:12.270> slip

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
indentation into the soil and just slip

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.650 
indentation into the soil and just slip
that<00:02:12.840> down<00:02:13.170> in<00:02:13.440> there

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
that down in there

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.260 
that down in there
and<00:02:13.750> what<00:02:13.930> that'll<00:02:14.140> do<00:02:14.410> is<00:02:14.440> slowly<00:02:15.270> release

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
and what that'll do is slowly release

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.110 
and what that'll do is slowly release
fertilizer<00:02:17.140> now<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:17.860> can<00:02:18.100> do<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.550> once<00:02:18.910> a

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
fertilizer now you can do that once a

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.330 
fertilizer now you can do that once a
year<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.600> usually<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:20.110> best<00:02:20.320> time<00:02:20.680> is<00:02:21.010> spring

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
year and usually the best time is spring

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.030 
year and usually the best time is spring
or<00:02:21.490> fall<00:02:21.520> I<00:02:22.120> like<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:22.840> do<00:02:23.020> my<00:02:23.230> trees<00:02:23.710> and<00:02:23.950> my

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
or fall I like to do my trees and my

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.880 
or fall I like to do my trees and my
shrubs<00:02:24.340> in<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:24.580> fall<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.990> other<00:02:26.140> thing<00:02:26.530> is

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
shrubs in the fall the other thing is

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.490 
shrubs in the fall the other thing is
that<00:02:27.190> maples<00:02:28.120> like<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.390> little<00:02:28.780> bit<00:02:28.930> of<00:02:29.020> acidic

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
that maples like a little bit of acidic

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.210 
that maples like a little bit of acidic
soil<00:02:29.860> so<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.700> like<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.180> go<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:31.990> bring<00:02:32.530> fir

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
soil so I like to go and bring fir

this has pine cones and other things in
it<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.460> just<00:02:36.940> find<00:02:37.180> underneath<00:02:37.630> my<00:02:38.050> trees

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
it that I just find underneath my trees

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.860 
it that I just find underneath my trees

now if you don't have that you can find
some<00:02:41.110> other<00:02:41.260> kind<00:02:41.500> of<00:02:41.650> compost<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.670> that'll

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
some other kind of compost and that'll

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.000 
some other kind of compost and that'll
also<00:02:43.420> give<00:02:43.660> nutrition<00:02:44.320> and<00:02:44.650> hold<00:02:44.860> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
on the layer of the top of the soil

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.790 
on the layer of the top of the soil
around<00:02:49.270> my<00:02:49.660> tree<00:02:51.720> now<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.810> nice<00:02:53.170> part<00:02:53.590> is

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
around my tree now the nice part is

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.880 
around my tree now the nice part is
that's<00:02:54.640> pretty<00:02:55.000> much<00:02:55.210> all<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.720> have<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:56.050> do<00:02:56.230> to
