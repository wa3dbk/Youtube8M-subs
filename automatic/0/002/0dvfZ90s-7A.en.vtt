00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:13.400
 This time, it will be the introduction of slick tripod dst 53 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:19.789
 What I usually carry is 900 grams in total of this equipment . Recommended load of the manufacturer 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.100
 At all even in the case where the maximum is 4 k So Well I because it has become particularly referred to as a cut in the tooth 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.690
 What 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.820
 But it is much rather too light does not stay in the under regulation 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:31.530
 Now this is about punch Le Vaux right, but this is effective because removal works on the left 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:36.620
 It is also possible to put 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:37.820
 And first, this is the tilt lock lever 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.210
 with this 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.079
 Lock 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.720
 It's released and now it's dropped naturally by gravity 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:52.850
 We will up slowly if there along with a hand It is now damper Itsui Kaiserslautern 6 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:55.870
 Next It is a pan edition also slowly to your smooth and the has worked is tentatively damper 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.780
 I will go through 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.170
 It's locked now 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.199
 Hey it will be in the form of the pan in such Fu to release the erotic lever 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:11.439
 It is then the removal of the quick shoe 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:14.310
 Loosen the right lever and this red button will be the lock button This lock button 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:18.750
 You can't get out without pressing 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.079
 And it will be in the form of stopping in this way with the right lever 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.110
 It this is in the just a good opportunity 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:30.299
 It is zooming this Sony power zoom 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:34.330
 I will show you the movement of this I am zooming at the highest speed right now 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.930
 It is a place called wisdom, and it is already the fastest. 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:41.820
 I'm doing at the fastest but 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:45.420
 It is quite fast Well But you know I appear to road late unlikely to have seen doing it this way 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.770
 Next it and have taken looks foot in m 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.450
 I'm starting at a medium speed, but it's slow, but it may seem like something too late 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.689
 I may not 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:59.659
 This is also me I hardly use Even this is early 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:05.960
 It's by is fast even this to go by me something most Why scenery landscape 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:11.810
 In the manufacturer, there is 3 stages of change switches and the sound zooming lever of this lever 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:16.010
 Though it will be able to adjust the speed of 2 levels in total of 6 levels by the pressure condition of 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.610
 In fact, it's almost the next thing I'm going to follow this cow 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.850
 Lowest speed 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.750
 I can hardly go by this only if I look at this 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.120
 Go by the finder over though you may end up in Fu say by slow day 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:32.790
 It is just right speed with this 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:36.510
 So it's almost this time of the day when you slow back and back when I'm back and I'll come back to you early 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:44.599
 The I and the still of the maximum speed position when not to shoot 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:44.599
 I'm zooming but not in most age slow time of the shooting to the maximum speed when returning 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.910
 Hey 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:57.030
 This is pretty good I like this picture 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:59.510
 To'm convenient It was really whether this change-over switch in the manual and electric I think honesty 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.510
 Become 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:08.480
 I 'm going to show you the next time , it's a quick shoe removal 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.050
 Loosen this right red lever and move back and forth 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.440
 Such position adjustment can be done 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:21.940
 I think this is also not move to buy it once you stop 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:25.150
 And Well Loosen this lever but the next it is and I'm angles open leg of the tripod This 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:31.310
 I can stop by 2-1, but if I go now max 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:35.260
 I try to stop in the most stable state by widening the angle is the best 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:41.829
 It means that it will spread to here in the widest state 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:44.590
 It is such feeling when it is widest and it was narrow in narrow place etc. in the most stable state 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:51.519
 It is a state which will be such Fu 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:55.250
 Not is a wide state I wide state narrow prima facie withstand Though I'm with is this with local express 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:04:01.250
 This is with the lighting of the led this is also very Yappa 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:02.390
 It's convenient I like shooting in the early morning or at night in most cases if it is not this 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:08.849
 Right 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:15.090
 It will disappear automatically when time passes, so the proof of the battery is also hey 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:17.760
 Prevent you to it this horizontally'm useful dream It is a ball leveler of this person in this one hand 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:22.019
 Also dyed with one hand tighten at will be 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:26.280
 Along with a little hand to punch elbow I'm not a Kiko Nde doing with one hand now 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:28.750
 I 'm going to do this, so it 's a tripod for video cameras . 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.930
 If you get used to it, it's still pretty easy, isn't it? 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:35.260
 I say clearly but I have a price 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:40.510
 Though I bought for about 5,000 yen for the first time 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:46.090
 2 has cut the yen Well I durability do not know and do not try to use this little whether 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:48.740
 But recently, it seems like my 43 has been improved. 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:55.120
 I because Anfu rod is high Well 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:55.120
 As a tripod for the Getting Started Thank you for more than Perhaps say
