00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.469
 Then one more afternoon, I'm out of line here. 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.519
 confusions are so many interpretations of 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.680
 bible falls so many rules uses and customs 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.439
 that the various names of persons 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.020
 they say they have basement, I call 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.080
 this I must admit I am confused 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.430
 in relation to the will of God 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.890
 although I looked at the word of God 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.199
 seeking to interpret 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.040
 against historical factors and all 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.610
 more 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.690
 erding on ramp do not feel guilty will 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.320
 to continue without understanding anything 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.270
 finish 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.280
 even so internally I feel 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.190
 guilty of maybe doing that 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.010
 God does not like smoking, for example. 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.600
 baby do not desist 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.000
 I can not find anything in the bible that 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.309
 condemns such practices but as during 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.270
 three years who have lived under the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.739
 God's will over the church was 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.600
 grafted on my head all these 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.619
 rules are three years that I have lived 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.700
 under the church that until today does not know what 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.619
 it's God's will 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.110
 until today he knows only rules and more 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.869
 present rules more precepts than 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:24.390
 church if night what is the will within 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:29.370
 you love your neighbor as yourself and 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:32.670
 him about all the things that 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:36.150
 the majority passes kindness is not this 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.210
 have an injury already implicit is already 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:44.220
 implied is already implicit in the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.220
 Implicit to the will of God is Christ 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.880
 I look at Christ, I know who God is. 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.960
 And the father we are an eye for Christ I know 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.200
 How man should be soft for Jesus looks 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.820
 For him I know how God is to look at them and 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.450
 how man should be an eye to what he 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.880
 said did taught and learning how is the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.010
 path of the will of God lived by a 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.080
 men 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:16.700
 learning how to treat the enemy 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:21.540
 perverse opportunist the whole gospel 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:25.040
 learning that forgiving is what keeps the 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:29.010
 My life says I'm sick in the world. 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.410
 learning that anxiety is one of the 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.130
 more horrific things to destroy the 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.260
 career of a human being because she 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.380
 counterfeits whatever the chance of 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.930
 wisdom and discernment and places people 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.230
 in a desperately distressed stream 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.200
 to achieve and achieve what 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.610
 does not inhabit the essential food or 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.070
 life or carry the meaning of the 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.410
 eternal that satisfies the heart all to 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.570
 anxiety 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.340
 He teaches me how to send a 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.120
 live for others 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.970
 in appearance in non- teaching expressions 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.340
 trying to meet the demands of 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.220
 conventions in low that if two more to 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:18.959
 to follow the conscience 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:23.160
 gospel teaches gratitude teaches me the 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:26.190
 mercy teaches love for justice 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.410
 and by the truth teaches that it matters first 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.950
 obey god than men this 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.360
 on here 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:37.799
 gatti eternally stays God's will 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.190
 and it's basic 31 in place and it keeps thinking 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.250
 that the will of God comes 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.180
 in discussing chinese hand we want 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.140
 see dri 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.120
 verse of the day is no way 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.480
 thinking god will you go 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.610
 make knowing more 15 denominations 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.950
 different and do a synthesis 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:01.630
 doctrine you will not be hospitalized 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:04.000
 then the bible my friend I say here 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.620
 every day that accompanies me every day knows 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.590
 Can not you hear any more? 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.350
 now coming these same ones for this 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.470
 you asked me a basic question 10 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.290
 my friend the bible is only worth reading 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.109
 if you have internalized both before 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.450
 new testament you know so much 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.210
 who is jesus and jesus is your key 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.430
 hermeneutic talk on my site caio 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.920
 fable dot net write the keyword 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.580
 or energetic or interpretive 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.680
 read everything when you understand that what 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.480
 to jesus as xavi hermeneutics you go 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.300
 see how everything gets dry 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.290
 before that there is no salvation for you 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.080
 neither for anyone 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.630
 I'm going to read, I'll see until I'm gone. 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.900
 never understand why the bible without 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.930
 Jesus only generates confusion the whole bible of 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.540
 genesis to the apocalypse read in which jesus 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.090
 be the interpretive key 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.880
 she only generates mental illness fanaticism 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.410
 death and death 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.230
 Do you want to read the Bible and want it? 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.270
 turn the word of God to you read 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.060
 first mateus marcos lucas and joão 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.480
 mateus max wilson just jesus learn 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.950
 Jesus then reads the letters of Paul neither the 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.740
 remainder of the new testament 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.450
 knowing before Jesus everything that is like 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.640
 jesus stayed that was not like jesus no 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.650
 stay there you can read what you want 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.980
 old testament that was how Jesus stays 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:30.690
 whatever was not already danced in the river 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:34.900
 Only then do we save the rest. 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.760
 single candidate but I already said so much 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.690
 It feels so rainy on the 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.580
 wet 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.710
 I'm going to have to talk about life control. 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.950
 because every day there are new people coming 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:48.880
 that's it and the people the church does not teach 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.740
 other than the kaleidoscopic 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:55.410
 that makes you crazy 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.410
 without knowing which direction to go. 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.060
 good that's it 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:03.220

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.590

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.690
 in his life in his soul and 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.570
 was grafted on my head all 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.360
 these rules and customs and everything else that 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.340
 man can create for his benefit and 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.200
 this guilty feeling has disturbed 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.660
 too without getting out of my sleep and taking me 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.330
 to the point of doubting God one of the 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.770
