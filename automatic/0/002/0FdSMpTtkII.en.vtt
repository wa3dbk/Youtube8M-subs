00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.290
 s 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.460
 hello my name is clemente kings today they 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.340
 let's teach decorating cupcakes in 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.160
 Christmas Eve shape the ingredients are 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:20.180
 13 vanilla cupcakes a liter of 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.210
 bergen cream dyes green yellow and 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.070
 red let's start whipping the cream 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.349
 first it is important to take the gallon and 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.500
 shake it lightly to mix 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.500
 All the ingredients 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.070
 we are going to open and deposit more or less 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.489
 a third or a quarter of the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.440
 case for this take into account that the 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.420
 cream will give us a performance of 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.170
 three times its volume we will beat 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.510
 always at an average speed and the 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.550
 average time will be between 8 and 10 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.530
 minutes this is for me to take a 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.260
 firm consistency according to the 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.850
 decoration that we are going to make as you 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.160
 I can mention that if you do not have this 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.320
 type of blender can also use 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.860
 a hand blender and the bablot cream goes 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.040
 to beat perfectly 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.870
 very well once the cream has been whipped 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.040
 make sure it has a consistency 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.580
 soft and creamy and have a peak 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.370
 firm 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.850
 well let's start painting the 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.850
 colors 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.119
 we will use for these three colors 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.689
 as we said let's use a bit of 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.570
 yellow let's also use a little bit of 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:41.150
 green color 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.150
 and we are going to use a lot of red color 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.600
 then that is the green color 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.690
 yellow color 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.220
 and a lot of red color 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.130
 then we are going to mix the colors 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.080
 homogeneously 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.020
 it's important not to beat too much 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.580
 so that the cream does not start to seal 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.770
 in agreement 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.870
 but the firm is a cream that accepts 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.940
 perfectly colors we can 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.280
 use lots of color and the 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.740
 cream is not going to change its taste we can 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.300
 also use colors in liquid that 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.910
 they only serve to paint the 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.510
 surface these we apply them with 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.510
 airbrush 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.239
 and today we're going to start decorating the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.730
 part of over the cupcakes we are going to 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.239
 use white cream and we will use 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.670
 a sleeve with a coupling can use 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.969
 As I mentioned at the beginning can 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.950
 use a duya number 808 that from 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.950
 ball to decorate the cupcakes 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:12.470
 let's start by putting drops of cream 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.140
 about the cupcakes we first use 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.030
 the part of the shore we will cover the 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.050
 part of the shore those who are at 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.630
 shore and we are going towards the center 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.490
 placing only drops of cream and 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.830
 later we finished filling 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.970
 the other spaces that remain 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.970
 between the cupcakes 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.629
 and then we're going to start 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.660
 to pierce the cream towards the center 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.730
 gently taking care not to crush 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.489
 too much the drop of cream that we put 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.660
 at the beginning to prevent him from going 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.660
 the edge of the cuts 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.170
 let's start 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.140
 to put the petals or leaves in color 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.750
 green for this we will fill the sleeve 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.020
 as I remember them we will use a 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.970
 Duya leaves this must be enough 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:08.460
 big since the petals have to 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:11.890
 to be quite wide a little bit fat 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.750
 we will place the petals one by one and 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.880
 let's take care of touching with the tip of 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.030
 the duia and start pressing so that 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:22.420
 the petal is taking a bit of size 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.300
 and we are going to cut to the shore taking care of 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:28.020
 that comes out slightly on the side of the 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.020
 cupcake 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:38.419
 now we are going to place the petals in 

00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:38.419
 red color equal we fill the sleeve 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:45.060
 we remove the air contained in the tip 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.940
 and now we are going to place them in the middle of 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.500
 the greens and likewise we are going to 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.070
 press and we will give you some 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.380
 volume and at the end we cut 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.860
 it is usually important that the tip 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:02.070
 of the shower touch the base of the cream 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.930
 so that the petal can get fat and 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.400
 this is going to give you a little more firmness 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.400
 and volume 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:15.259
 now on the greens we are going to place 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.920
 again another petal taking care of not 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:21.730
 treat it completely lightly 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.730
 body 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:29.090
 let's now use a cone that we're going 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.360
 to elaborate with a paper 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.710
 and we are going to deposit inside the rain of 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.020
 grass 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.710
 and here we are going to fill the cone with cream 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.710
 in yellow 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.940
 we close the cone and we will cut before 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.080
 of pressing the cream be out 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.629
 let's cut the tip of the chrono 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:54.139
 and now if we let yours leave 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:57.710
 so the cream starts to come out here 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:00.740
 let's make small 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:03.670
 and if what we are going to scale first 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.860
 towards the whole shore 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:09.010
 that are falling on the petals 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.490
 red to completely cover the cream 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.490
 white 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.050
 well that was all we hope they have 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.970
