00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:10.740
 Hello here is your turn 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.259
 turn screen so today i show 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.089
 you sometimes how guitar on a 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.560
 as you can see now that it is one 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.300
 Twelve-sided but you can too 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.630
 good on a normal six-sided 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.630
 play 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:28.199
 because on saturday, yes, yes 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.320
 we have a capo so one side 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.520
 disconnect from the here and in the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.000
 second bunch that sounds like about 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.000
 want 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.780
 and then I'll show you now 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.680
 Step by step, therefore, is on 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.680
 end then sounds like this 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.480
 bet 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.460
 so give it up when it's done 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.010
 let's just take a step for 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.010
 walked only once a power corp 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:47.820
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and best with one 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:54.240
 Slippery effect then that comes cool 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:57.840
 So that's why power kurt quite normal 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:05.220
 index finger in the seventh bunch and then the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:12.080
 ring and little finger and on the a 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.080
 and b page 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:22.020
 I do not work for much 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:23.930
 letters so ad ok so we have 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:51.780
 now 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:57.620
 we're going to hit it as well now 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:03:09.569
 the same power corp only 1 8 and 2 deeper 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:16.129
 So just hide and then 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:24.470
 back again with her 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:24.470
 perfect and then this continues 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.760
 what we in so nem I now call times 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.659
 in such a miserable course, two 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.659
 reasons through escapades 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.310
 ok and then again from the beginning 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:18.500
 Now we come to the next part 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:30.080
 it just happens again 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:33.340
 Power comes as next comes 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:44.380
 this singing I can not do any now 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:44.380
 So it was Korean 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.169
 there comes 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:58.769
 hey 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:13.630
 dgb and numerous in the second bunch also 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.630
 in the 4th 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:32.590
 So then only one ring finger 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.590
 move wish 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.280
 then back again 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.419
 by simply 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.630
 then just hit the changes 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.630
 sound stays the same 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:23.139
 dampen and then it goes back from 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:26.430
 front wonder so okay but again 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:26.430
 second couple together 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.770
 on Saturday 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.830
 No 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.370
 and you can just do it 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.470
 imitate 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:08.820
 I watch the video more often if 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:11.130
 you take a closer look at volt and 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.230
 otherwise have fun playing and 

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:16.290
