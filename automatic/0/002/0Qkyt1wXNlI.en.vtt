00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
copyright and what the web was doing

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.710 
copyright and what the web was doing
because<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.850> biggest<00:03:57.150> thing<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.420> web<00:03:57.570> is

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
because the biggest thing the web is

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.090 
because the biggest thing the web is
doing<00:03:58.079> is<00:03:58.730> allowing<00:03:59.730> people<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.329> hear<00:04:00.660> things

basically<00:04:09.239> that's<00:04:09.690> an<00:04:09.810> incredibly<00:04:10.410> good

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
basically that's an incredibly good

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:20.319 
basically that's an incredibly good
thing
