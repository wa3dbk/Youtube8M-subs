the<00:00:30.599> rope<00:00:30.779> let<00:00:31.019> me<00:00:31.109> show<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.260> how<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.470> do<00:00:31.650> it

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
the rope let me show you how to do it

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.510 
the rope let me show you how to do it
surprisingly<00:00:34.350> if<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:34.950> take<00:00:35.100> your<00:00:35.280> rope

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
surprisingly if you just take your rope

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
surprisingly if you just take your rope
and<00:00:35.700> pile<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.899> ground<00:00:37.730> it's<00:00:38.730> quite

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
and pile it on the ground it's quite

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.170 
and pile it on the ground it's quite
manageable<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.559> I'm<00:00:40.649> going<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.829> start<00:00:41.180> with

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
manageable so I'm going to start with

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.369 
manageable so I'm going to start with
the<00:00:42.329> two<00:00:42.570> ends<00:00:43.050> right<00:00:43.710> here<00:00:45.230> over<00:00:46.230> my

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
the two ends right here over my

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.860 
the two ends right here over my
shoulders<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.100> coil<00:00:47.760> from<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:48.480> without

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
shoulders and coil from here without

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.010 
shoulders and coil from here without
ever<00:00:49.200> making<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.680> circle<00:00:49.920> by<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:51.059> going<00:00:51.570> up

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
ever making a circle by just going up

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.330 
ever making a circle by just going up
and<00:00:52.440> back<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.980> making<00:00:53.579> loops<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:55.190> this<00:00:56.190> won't

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
and back and making loops and this won't

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.020 
and back and making loops and this won't
twist<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.850> Rope<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:58.039> doubled<00:00:59.039> because<00:00:59.460> in
