 fluffy applesauce bands and how we use the 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.069
 we'll show you that in now 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.550
 a new episode with the Sauerland 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.550
 barbecue 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.880
 welcome to a new episode 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.920
 with the Sauerland was the crew have it 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.320
 just seen we are doing today 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.200
 wonderful citizen bands so wonderful 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.050
 because totally crazy but still 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.050
 really delicious with the rye flour 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.059
 which is really nice and strong 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.970
 at the same time a nice sweet by the 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:43.020
 applesauce applesauce in a burger web 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.699
 yes that's just such a small kick 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.070
 bring in a bit of sweetness and give 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.540
 there is still a great aroma we 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.770
 do not need much and what for 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.020
 we need it for that I show you 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.760
 now off the table for our worries 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.410
 We are in need of apple juice plans right now 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.200
 Not so much as we catch 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:03.190
 then have milk with 200 milliliters 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.710
 We also an egg 550 wheat flour a 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.190
 of course we have a bit of butter there 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.270
 applesauce then a tie yeast as well 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.340
 a little salt and in the background type 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.780
 11.50 dark rye flour yes the team 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.820
 now shows how it goes on 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.700
 who with 50 g of butter because the milk 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.500
 given that is not warmed up now 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.340
 Hot because we make you the yeast 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.700
 immediately broken 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.450
 so it's not allowed to cook about 30 like that 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.649
 up to 40 degrees 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.240
 and continue driving over the traffic lights 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.610
 You will be noticed when the butter 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.429
 melts and then it continues now 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.619
 right with the pond as you see 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.330
 that melanie bowl given in the 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.860
 in the middle a ball made there I have the 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:51.009
 yeast already beaten in and now 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:55.080
 good that old handset in the middle one 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:57.849
 little of our milk butter mix 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.830
 and then the lowest level in the 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:01.929
 Middle do not mix so much in height 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.890
 because we are doing a little now 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.680
 advantage 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.789
 and if it all looks like that 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.440
 Covered it with a kitchen towel and 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.530
 put it in a warm place for 10 minutes 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.720
 place so you have our advantage 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.000
 beautiful bubbles thrown and now 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:24.570
 if an egg comes then a good prize 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.940
 salt and for the light sweetness in the burger 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.620
 and fruity note apple sauce 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.200
 please take care that you do not 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.180
 take apple compote because there you have 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.910
 pieces in it and in the apple sauce is everything 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.290
 It is beautiful and now everything will be 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.060
 kneaded together to a dough and 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.530
 if then so in nice dough lumps 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.459
 like here you did everything right 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.260
 Now like a cloth over it and 25 minutes 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.470
 let it go in a warm place 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.000
 yes front again can see the dough is 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.350
 we've got to do it well now 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.880
 knead again 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.360
 I've got a suggestion for that 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.540
 knead vigorously once and then 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.770
 come on a with baking paper 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.100
 laid baking tray is a bit 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:12.090
 water but there was the baking paper good 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.170
 We'll make twelve little trees like that 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.600
 now have little balls here 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.850
 Shaped, they'll come ten more 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.280
 minutes to go in a warm place 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.640
 then I press all again 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.940
 space and then they go in the oven 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.459
 200 degrees above bottom and down in it 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.320
 stands a bowl of boiling hot 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.530
 water and we'll meet again 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.019
 when they're done, that's them 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.400
 So that's our applemus rock bands 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.410
 something really special really nice 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.340
 fruity slightly sweetish really 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.040
 Great 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.860
 yes and at the same time also pithy 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.040
 it is by the used rye flour 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.680
 yes wheat flour is a bit 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.680
 Mainstream rye is clear then 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.380
 that's how it comes out right 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.040
 fits wonderfully to really hearty 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.930
 naturalise 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.870
 once you rockberger fits now 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.180
 wonderful season but also to 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.920

 another video of us with a mine 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.630
 enriched quirks really stop 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.430
 meat what a strong 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.580
 Eigen taste has to fit this 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.820
