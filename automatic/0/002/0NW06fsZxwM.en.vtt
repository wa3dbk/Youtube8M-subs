00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.160
 O 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.130
 and to the internet beauty with the galley let's 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.240
 I want to talk about a joint today. 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.949
 there to fish and ultralight is to practice 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.080
 The Taliban I say is needed here in the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.900
 I mostly stayed at the time I worked 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.320
 so slap the beach bee 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.239
 at that time it has to be very quiet no 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.269
 or with that very busy sea and 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.100
 It's also for you to lie down too. 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.290
 we also have issues that are pretty cool if 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.410
 I use this one to get certain guys 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.989
 of fish is there was a fishery that I 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:57.059
 I hit the island of paquetÃ¡ every time 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:05.520
 mexi every pound you feel their weight 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:07.590
 car and gets a little screwed but the 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.410
 Galera Savior is very cool is 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.950
 very large in this type of fishery 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.950
 it's cool 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.270
 I think it's a wand. 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.030
 telescope , it makes it difficult to 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.310
 I even commented in the video the difficulty 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.860
 was trying to catch the fish that the cow 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.320
 was using in a high wave the 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.930
 ideal would be a telescopic wave 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.120
 but here he is singing well 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.910
 using it was not so light it is a 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.680
 two-part wave ends up using was well 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.470
 cool for a fishing trip so 11 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.710
 bottom line but closer 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.360
 It's just kind of fishing on a beach. 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.050
 that it was more hectic a little traffic 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.700
 of fish a little higher-rated field 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.590
 I only had fish, I'm just sending fish. 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.090
 small then I was having a lot 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.490
 difficulty in game time left 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.980
 but when the fish was looking for 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.020
 fisgava then he has fled because 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.600
 sensitivity at the tip of the stick was very 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.580
 bad not digging redhead good playing area 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.290
 that the fishery now not 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.860
 it was cool here, we already here 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.870
 it would be great 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.100
 she looks fine, she's wearing the woman 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.500
 a little 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.640
 she has a very thin and well tip 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.880
 flexible 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.950
 so you want to say anything 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.350
 I'll feel good, you're one of those. 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.910
 I certainly would have caught it. 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.920
 enough fish that day I did not 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.750
 having practically nothing because now it is 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.660
 wrong then it's what I tell people 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.110
 always use the correct material is that 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.550
 chapel that spot in that research 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.770
 break a branch until you arrive later 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.900
 to get the bigger fish is at the end 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.489
 in the evening and then start to 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.739
 do research on bottom line 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.350
 It's okay, so I'm playing on guys. 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.900
 Wanna catch you want to catch small fish? 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.290
 you're only giving from an early age has a 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.140
 wand here is a copy of this 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:16.989
 here is a great request 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:19.420
 You're alone, this is the new here. 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.830
 That 's good, and this is it too. 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.930
 here appeared in a video 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.030
 I told you earlier about something. 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.989
 remember how you want the staff is 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.189
 talking about what minetti is this 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:35.140
 rider's milk 200 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:38.290
 I do not know how pretty she said she wanted to. 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.840
 cheap do not know if going to pay 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.500
 world would be good I do not know with the Chinese 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:50.530
 you are not comfortable ryder that the radius of 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:53.110
 two hundred asked for this type of 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.900
 fishery will stay on the altar because it 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:00.099
 will stay here ultralight conjunctive here 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.750
 it's and it's very small they can see and here 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.769
 Can you do that fishing? 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.959
 little fish 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.590
 is that even I was talking for example 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.239
 I was leaving a lot of small xerelete 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.639
 believe but still never much 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.409
 with little ones koke got more to 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.180
 We get playing even spend 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:18.639
 time until fish time arrives 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.310
 understood and was not doing it I think 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:24.610
 that stuff here in italy and theo 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:28.380
 okay more women here O is unique in 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:31.330
 You might call micro and not 200 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.250
 saying that he has balbino understand that 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.910
 he has bearing I know there must have 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.240
 leave 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.639
 okay if it is good or if it's bad I do not know 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.500
 still the note explains that he made the 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.849
 People are going to take a test there in the videos. 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.010
 this aluminum alloy 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:49.570
 good aluminum has everything the customer 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.639
 You need right 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.800
 Now I'll see the clear quality you have. 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:05:00.580
 lots of plastic such a galley 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:04.030
 here was very cheap and but a lot 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.330
 so fragile but here's a joke 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.780
 and also to show you the 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.310
 type and size that we call 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.010
 ultralight the shore beach fishery 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.479
 beach that has a calm sea nokia 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.630
 image of staging you will not 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:22.990
 to be able to fish because it would be here 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.340
 very well light mint very fine material but 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.760
 I like to use this material a lot 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.080
 for the fishery slope and she is 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.789
 very good the guys also for 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.699
 squid fishery was waiting for the 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:35.199
 you have to have good sensitivity 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.110
 it also becomes excellent for 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:39.849
 Lula fishery is a little gallery, it was just 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.250
 this tip I wanted to give you if you want 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.169
 to do a small fishery is 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.310
 playing until the time of the fish 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.790
 for example fish 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.010
 personal exchange of bar hopping that is to fish 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.960
 I know there is a smell understood and milk is 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.360
 we have the fill of this little bigger 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.280
 He fought well but went to the 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.470
 But the arrival of small and raining 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.650
 it's raining it had a little too any 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:05.590
 small fish sedan you use the material is 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.020
 an ultralight of this here you go 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.360
 along in your fishing spoke galley 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.550
 so this is it I hope you have 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.290
 I liked this video more for who I was 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.720
 in the doubt of this windlass here I do not 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.690
 I do not know if they do not pay 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.150
 okay I understand that I found 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:24.190
 I think it's cool, it's cool, and it's cheap. 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:28.420
 until cute, right but I do not know if 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:31.270
 providing we will test it lends 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.430
 ok now for sure is his material is 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.810
 more sensitive without being careful 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.270
 larger with parts of it for example 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.190
 You have to wash it, get the parts. 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:43.240
 have to be washed and club stay to 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:46.540
 avoid corrosion that is not here with 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.240
 roy is very easy but we can have 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.040
 A lot of time is if we take care of 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.230
 You sure have an optimum windlass. 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.420
 years and has a limit and so 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.730
 I'll say more homeless too years 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:02.230
 Well, who cares, it's okay. 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:06.400
 So this is here for those who asked the 

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:09.310
 such as the one that appeared and did not 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.110
 I know if you do not know your brand 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.180
 Let's find out later if not 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:20.350
 give testimony and speak of the law 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:22.150
 so click the thumbs down click 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.970
 I liked that it will be helping a lot 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:27.970
 in the video and automatically 

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:30.250
 the video reaches out to more people who want 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:33.670
 learn more about fishing 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:36.070
 have sit - ins and also sign up 

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:38.790
 on the channel there for those who are not yet written 

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:41.710
 here on the channel techniques and tips galera 

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:44.140
 thanks again for your attention 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.710
 A big hug until the next 

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.710
 thanks
