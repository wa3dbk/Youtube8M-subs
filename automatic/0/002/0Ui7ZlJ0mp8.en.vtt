00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
to the breakdown these two bolt actions

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.230 
to the breakdown these two bolt actions
are<00:00:22.500> probably<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.250> two<00:00:23.279> most<00:00:23.460> used<00:00:23.880> snipers

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
are probably the two most used snipers

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.759 
are probably the two most used snipers
in<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.449> game<00:00:24.630> now<00:00:24.869> I'm<00:00:25.170> sure<00:00:25.320> most<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.680> you

called duty things is better so today
I'm<00:00:30.840> gonna<00:00:30.960> be<00:00:31.320> going<00:00:31.500> over<00:00:31.619> some<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
I'm gonna be going over some of the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.920 
I'm gonna be going over some of the
stats<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.579> really<00:00:32.850> see<00:00:33.090> what<00:00:33.120> makes<00:00:33.480> one<00:00:33.660> gun

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
stats and really see what makes one gun

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.660 
stats and really see what makes one gun
better<00:00:34.170> than<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.440> other<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.280> just<00:00:35.460> starting

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
better than the other so just starting

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.430 
better than the other so just starting
off<00:00:35.730> with<00:00:35.850> some<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.149> basic<00:00:36.570> stats<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.050> DSR

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
off with some of the basic stats the DSR

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.020 
off with some of the basic stats the DSR
sitting<00:00:37.800> with<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> five-round<00:00:38.550> standard

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
sitting with the five-round standard

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.639 
sitting with the five-round standard
clip<00:00:39.300> which<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.960> smallest<00:00:40.079> out<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.530> all

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
clip which is the smallest out of all

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.930 
clip which is the smallest out of all
the<00:00:40.770> snipers<00:00:41.190> while<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.550> ballista<00:00:41.879> is

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
the snipers while the ballista is

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.280 
the snipers while the ballista is
rocking<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.329> seven-round<00:00:42.690> standard<00:00:43.110> clip

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
rocking a seven-round standard clip

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.410 
rocking a seven-round standard clip
which<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.860> just<00:00:43.980> nearly<00:00:44.280> average<00:00:44.760> both<00:00:45.270> of

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
which is just nearly average both of

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.119 
which is just nearly average both of
these<00:00:45.510> guns<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.960> fiery<00:00:46.200> 250<00:00:46.710> rounds<00:00:46.829> per

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
these guns have a fiery 250 rounds per

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.830 
these guns have a fiery 250 rounds per
minute<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.789> basically<00:00:47.910> equals<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.539> shot

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
minute so that basically equals a shot

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.590 
minute so that basically equals a shot
every<00:00:49.289> 1.2<00:00:49.980> seconds<00:00:50.370> or<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.640> however<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.480> do

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
every 1.2 seconds or so however you do

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.299 
every 1.2 seconds or so however you do
have<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.840> factor<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.350> reloading<00:00:52.829> time<00:00:52.860> so

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
have to factor in the reloading time so

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.889 
have to factor in the reloading time so
you<00:00:53.370> don't<00:00:53.489> actually<00:00:53.789> get<00:00:54.030> 50<00:00:54.390> rounds<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.780> a

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
you don't actually get 50 rounds in a

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.450 
you don't actually get 50 rounds in a
minute<00:00:55.170> but<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.590> want<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.829> be<00:00:55.920> too<00:00:56.100> concerned

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
minute but I want to be too concerned

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.770 
minute but I want to be too concerned
with<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.879> because<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.360> know<00:00:57.390> they<00:00:57.629> are

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
with that because you know they are

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.779 
with that because you know they are
bolt-action<00:00:58.199> sniper<00:00:58.440> rifles<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
bolt-action sniper rifles with the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.549 
bolt-action sniper rifles with the
reload<00:01:00.059> times<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.449> bust<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.780> at<00:01:00.989> just<00:01:01.350> about

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
reload times the bust is at just about

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.380 
reload times the bust is at just about
three<00:01:01.859> seconds<00:01:02.219> while<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> DSR<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> little

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
three seconds while the DSR is a little

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.299 
three seconds while the DSR is a little
over<00:01:03.600> three<00:01:03.780> seconds<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.350> with<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.830> small<00:01:05.100> five

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
over three seconds and with a small five

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.010 
over three seconds and with a small five
round<00:01:05.519> clip<00:01:05.760> with<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.150> long<00:01:06.420> reload<00:01:06.750> time

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
round clip with that long reload time

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.240 
round clip with that long reload time
you<00:01:07.260> know<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.500> may<00:01:07.650> cause<00:01:07.890> some<00:01:08.100> problems

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
you know that may cause some problems

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.010 
you know that may cause some problems
for<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.700> every<00:01:08.970> now<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:09.390> however<00:01:09.930> you

for you every now and then however you
can<00:01:10.049> always<00:01:10.350> speed<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.650> up<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.860> little<00:01:10.979> by<00:01:11.159> doing

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
can always speed it up a little by doing

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.490 
can always speed it up a little by doing

guys have all noticed that the SR takes
a<00:01:16.920> little<00:01:17.100> longer<00:01:17.340> than<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> ballista<00:01:18.119> it

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
a little longer than the ballista it

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.940 
a little longer than the ballista it
kind<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.780> has<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:18.960> weird<00:01:19.290> scoping<00:01:19.860> and

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
kind of has that weird scoping and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.530 
kind of has that weird scoping and
animation<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.640> at<00:01:20.729> first<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.240> was<00:01:21.330> throwing

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
animation and at first it was throwing

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.120 
animation and at first it was throwing
me<00:01:21.630> off<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> little<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.439> now<00:01:22.560> I'm<00:01:22.680> pretty<00:01:22.920> much

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
me off a little but now I'm pretty much

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.980 
me off a little but now I'm pretty much
used<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:23.790> quickly<00:01:24.450> all<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
used to it and just quickly all of the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.240 
used to it and just quickly all of the
snipers<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.590> ninety-five<00:01:26.040> percent

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
snipers have a ninety-five percent

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.800 
snipers have a ninety-five percent
movement<00:01:26.790> speed<00:01:26.970> which<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.210> comparable<00:01:27.570> to

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
movement speed which is comparable to

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.450 
movement speed which is comparable to
the<00:01:27.960> assault<00:01:28.170> rifles<00:01:28.590> now<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.189> might<00:01:29.340> have

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
the assault rifles now you might have

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.890 
the assault rifles now you might have
noticed<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.850> did<00:01:29.970> not<00:01:30.119> cover<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.420> damages

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
noticed that did not cover the damages

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.149 
noticed that did not cover the damages
and<00:01:31.110> that's<00:01:31.320> because<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> snipers<00:01:32.009> are<00:01:32.130> a

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
and that's because the snipers are a

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.440 
and that's because the snipers are a
little<00:01:32.310> different<00:01:32.490> than<00:01:32.880> they<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.210> been<00:01:33.390> in

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
little different than they have been in

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.569 
little different than they have been in
past<00:01:33.780> call<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.140> duties<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.860> black<00:01:35.070> ops<00:01:35.280> 2<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
past call of duties and black ops 2 the

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.830 
past call of duties and black ops 2 the
main<00:01:35.729> factor<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.180> determines<00:01:36.329> how<00:01:36.780> many

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
main factor that determines how many

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.240 
main factor that determines how many
shots<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.350> takes<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.619> kill<00:01:37.740> an<00:01:37.860> enemy<00:01:37.950> is

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
shots it takes to kill an enemy is

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.069 
shots it takes to kill an enemy is
exactly<00:01:39.060> where<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.420> hit<00:01:39.570> them<00:01:39.720> with<00:01:39.930> your

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
exactly where you hit them with your

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.630 
exactly where you hit them with your
bullet<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.650> that's<00:01:41.130> where<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.369> find<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
bullet and that's where you find the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.710 
bullet and that's where you find the
biggest<00:01:41.850> difference<00:01:42.060> between<00:01:42.299> these<00:01:42.659> two

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
biggest difference between these two

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.810 
biggest difference between these two
weapons<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.409> with<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.710> DSR<00:01:44.130> you're<00:01:44.549> able<00:01:44.729> to

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
weapons so with the DSR you're able to

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.399 
weapons so with the DSR you're able to
get<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> one<00:01:45.270> shot<00:01:45.450> kill<00:01:45.509> anywhere<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> body

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
get a one shot kill anywhere on the body

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.260 
get a one shot kill anywhere on the body
from<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.799> waist<00:01:47.070> up<00:01:47.280> even<00:01:47.880> including<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
from the waist up even including the

from the waist up even including the
arms<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:49.049> hit<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.259> tip<00:01:49.470> of

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
arms you can just hit the tip of

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.319 
arms you can just hit the tip of
someone's<00:01:49.920> elbow<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.340> get<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> kill<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.149> is

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
someone's elbow and get a kill it is

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.270 
someone's elbow and get a kill it is
absolutely<00:01:51.509> ridiculous<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:53.070> other<00:01:53.159> hand

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
absolutely ridiculous on the other hand

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.469 
absolutely ridiculous on the other hand
with<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.579> blister<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.030> need<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.240> hit<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
enemy from the chest up in order to get

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.679 
enemy from the chest up in order to get
that<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.369> shot<00:01:56.579> kill<00:01:56.790> which<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.329> why<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.509> get

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
that one shot kill which is why you get

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.389 
that one shot kill which is why you get
so<00:01:57.719> many<00:01:57.960> damn<00:01:58.200> hit<00:01:58.469> markers<00:01:58.799> with<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.189> gun

so many damn hit markers with this gun
from<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.000> alone<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.540> puts<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.810> DSR<00:02:01.170> on

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290

snipers I'm actually not sure why Chuck
would<00:02:05.280> make<00:02:05.430> one<00:02:05.670> sniper<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.450> incredibly

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
would make one sniper so incredibly
