two and a half inch it's a lot less than

that and four measurements and for

that and four measurements and for
practical<00:00:40.190> purposes<00:00:40.850> I<00:00:40.910> could<00:00:41.180> be<00:00:41.330> measure

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
practical purposes I could be measure

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.240 
practical purposes I could be measure
that<00:00:41.720> for<00:00:41.930> you<00:00:42.020> now<00:00:42.170> for<00:00:42.410> a<00:00:42.440> moment<00:00:42.770> okay

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
that for you now for a moment okay

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.360 
that for you now for a moment okay
you'll<00:00:43.820> find<00:00:44.210> that<00:00:44.600> it<00:00:44.750> is<00:00:44.960> a<00:00:44.990> back<00:00:45.530> set<00:00:45.890> or<00:00:46.190> the

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
you'll find that it is a back set or the

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.890 
you'll find that it is a back set or the
the<00:00:46.640> case<00:00:46.880> depth<00:00:47.210> is<00:00:47.420> 55<00:00:48.410> millimetres<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:49.900> it's

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
the case depth is 55 millimetres so it's

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.920 
the case depth is 55 millimetres so it's
significantly<00:00:51.710> shorter<00:00:52.370> than<00:00:52.970> that<00:00:53.720> most

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
significantly shorter than that most

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.600 
significantly shorter than that most

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
Laxus what were you calling industry a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.590 
Laxus what were you calling industry a
two<00:00:55.850> inch<00:00:56.030> lock<00:00:56.240> case<00:00:57.100> now<00:00:58.150> it<00:00:59.150> has<00:00:59.390> its

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
two inch lock case now it has its

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.380 
two inch lock case now it has its
applications<00:01:00.320> but<00:01:00.980> since<00:01:01.400> the<00:01:01.580> new<00:01:01.820> standards

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
applications but since the new standards

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.229 
applications but since the new standards
and<00:01:02.540> so<00:01:02.690> forth<00:01:02.960> have<00:01:03.110> been<00:01:03.140> out<00:01:03.790> it's<00:01:04.790> it's

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
and so forth have been out it's it's

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.300 
and so forth have been out it's it's
only<00:01:05.570> a<00:01:05.690> three<00:01:06.080> lever<00:01:06.320> lock<00:01:06.620> and<00:01:06.920> it's<00:01:07.070> not<00:01:07.280> a

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
only a three lever lock and it's not a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.180 
only a three lever lock and it's not a
five<00:01:07.670> level<00:01:07.970> lock<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:08.540> in<00:01:08.810> reality<00:01:09.710> it's<00:01:10.010> not

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
five level lock so in reality it's not

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.640 
five level lock so in reality it's not
really<00:01:10.520> designed<00:01:10.910> for<00:01:11.000> external<00:01:11.450> use<00:01:11.840> but<00:01:12.530> if

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
really designed for external use but if

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.620 
really designed for external use but if
you're<00:01:12.800> thinking<00:01:13.190> of<00:01:13.280> wanting<00:01:13.970> to<00:01:14.120> fit<00:01:14.300> a<00:01:14.330> lock

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
you're thinking of wanting to fit a lock

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.900 
you're thinking of wanting to fit a lock
internally<00:01:15.590> on<00:01:15.740> a<00:01:15.770> set<00:01:16.010> of<00:01:16.100> French<00:01:16.340> doors<00:01:16.430> or

internally on a set of French doors or
something<00:01:16.940> like<00:01:17.360> that<00:01:17.540> where<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:17.930> style<00:01:18.200> is

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
something like that where the style is

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.350 
something like that where the style is
quite<00:01:18.590> narrow<00:01:18.890> then<00:01:19.610> this<00:01:19.850> might<00:01:20.120> be<00:01:20.330> a

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
quite narrow then this might be a

this particular lock would be suitable
for<00:01:35.510> your<00:01:35.720> application<00:01:36.409> so<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.880> four<00:01:38.120> end

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
for your application so the four end

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.580 
for your application so the four end
width<00:01:38.600> is<00:01:39.190> 25<00:01:40.190> millimeters<00:01:40.940> that's<00:01:41.210> the

width is 25 millimeters that's the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.649 
width is 25 millimeters that's the

distance across the width there the four
end<00:01:44.900> Heights<00:01:45.260> and<00:01:45.530> we<00:01:45.590> get<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.860> measure<00:01:46.070> on

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
end Heights and we get the measure on

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.190 
end Heights and we get the measure on
the<00:01:46.280> forehand<00:01:46.610> height<00:01:46.909> it's<00:01:47.570> a<00:01:47.720> hundred<00:01:47.990> and

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
the forehand height it's a hundred and

with<00:02:51.379> two<00:02:52.099> keys<00:02:53.169> this<00:02:54.169> really<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:54.620> good

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
with two keys this really is a good

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.849 
with two keys this really is a good
quality<00:02:55.099> lock<00:02:55.519> I<00:02:56.079> think<00:02:57.079> since<00:02:57.650> the

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
quality lock I think since the

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.190 
quality lock I think since the
established<00:02:58.400> changes<00:02:58.849> etc<00:02:59.359> it<00:02:59.750> used<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.079> be

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
established changes etc it used to be

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.839 
established changes etc it used to be
the<00:03:00.530> minimum<00:03:00.919> security<00:03:01.069> you<00:03:01.459> could<00:03:01.639> get<00:03:01.760> away

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
the minimum security you could get away

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.819 
the minimum security you could get away
with<00:03:02.180> on<00:03:02.269> an<00:03:02.389> external<00:03:02.750> door<00:03:03.079> many<00:03:03.349> many<00:03:03.590> years

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
with on an external door many many years

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.649 
with on an external door many many years
ago<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.159> was<00:03:04.189> three<00:03:04.459> lever<00:03:04.669> and<00:03:04.939> this<00:03:05.359> really

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
ago it was three lever and this really

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.080 
ago it was three lever and this really
had<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:05.959> had<00:03:06.439> its<00:03:06.590> point<00:03:06.919> when<00:03:07.459> it<00:03:07.579> came<00:03:07.760> to

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
had a had its point when it came to

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.190 
had a had its point when it came to
French<00:03:08.840> style<00:03:09.200> patio<00:03:09.709> doors<00:03:10.120> so<00:03:11.120> it's<00:03:11.840> not<00:03:11.989> for

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
French style patio doors so it's not for

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.809 
French style patio doors so it's not for
me<00:03:12.319> to<00:03:12.469> recommend<00:03:12.799> this<00:03:13.159> lock<00:03:13.400> anymore

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
me to recommend this lock anymore

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.119 
me to recommend this lock anymore
because<00:03:14.150> this<00:03:14.540> industry<00:03:14.900> suggests<00:03:15.739> at<00:03:15.919> least

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
because this industry suggests at least

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.369 
because this industry suggests at least
five<00:03:16.370> lever<00:03:16.730> but<00:03:17.540> there's<00:03:17.690> not<00:03:17.810> many<00:03:17.989> five

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
five lever but there's not many five

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.680 
five lever but there's not many five
leaver<00:03:18.769> two-inch<00:03:19.129> locks<00:03:19.400> around<00:03:19.579> so<00:03:20.120> perhaps

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
leaver two-inch locks around so perhaps

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.030 
leaver two-inch locks around so perhaps
if<00:03:21.019> you're<00:03:21.169> thinking<00:03:21.500> of<00:03:21.590> putting<00:03:21.620> something

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
if you're thinking of putting something

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.800 
if you're thinking of putting something
like<00:03:22.190> this<00:03:22.489> on<00:03:22.699> you<00:03:22.849> might<00:03:23.060> want<00:03:23.299> to<00:03:23.359> increase

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
like this on you might want to increase

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.629 
like this on you might want to increase
the<00:03:24.049> security<00:03:24.290> by<00:03:24.650> putting<00:03:24.949> dead<00:03:25.129> bones<00:03:25.400> top

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
the security by putting dead bones top

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.580 
the security by putting dead bones top
bottom<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.150> so<00:03:26.659> forth<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:27.079> give<00:03:27.260> yourself

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
bottom and so forth to give yourself

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.860 
bottom and so forth to give yourself
some<00:03:27.650> really<00:03:28.069> good<00:03:28.190> security<00:03:28.659> so<00:03:29.659> there<00:03:29.810> you
