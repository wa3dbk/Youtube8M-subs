really<00:01:11.369> intriguing<00:01:12.330> really<00:01:12.869> dark<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.470> read<00:01:14.070> a

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
really intriguing really dark I read a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.859 
really intriguing really dark I read a
couple<00:01:14.310> pages<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.939> get<00:01:15.060> an<00:01:15.180> idea<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.630> style

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
couple pages to get an idea of the style

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.920 
couple pages to get an idea of the style
and<00:01:16.549> it<00:01:17.549> seems<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.210> little<00:01:18.360> stream<00:01:18.840> of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
and it seems a little stream of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.469 
and it seems a little stream of
consciousness<00:01:19.409> which<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.250> be<00:01:20.400> really<00:01:21.299> good

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
consciousness which can be really good

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.870 
consciousness which can be really good
and<00:01:21.810> really<00:01:21.840> bad<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.680> hopefully<00:01:23.250> I'll<00:01:23.549> find<00:01:23.580> it

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
and really bad so hopefully I'll find it

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.789 
and really bad so hopefully I'll find it
really<00:01:24.060> engaging<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.990> want<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> stick<00:01:25.770> with

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
really engaging and want to stick with

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.710 
really engaging and want to stick with
it<00:01:26.070> but<00:01:26.189> either<00:01:26.369> way<00:01:26.640> I've<00:01:27.119> got<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.330> read<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.570> in

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
