00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.270 
attempting to dart out in front of me
I'll<00:00:57.180> be<00:00:57.270> more<00:00:57.480> clear<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.989> second

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
I'll be more clear in a second

he's a little bit pushy he doesn't

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.349 
he's a little bit pushy he doesn't

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
really want to respect my personal space

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.350 
really want to respect my personal space
as<00:01:03.690> I'm<00:01:03.989> moving<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.979> his<00:01:05.129> direction<00:01:05.360> right

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
as I'm moving in his direction right

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.820 
as I'm moving in his direction right
here<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:06.750> see<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.960> very<00:01:06.990> clearly<00:01:07.290> and

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
here you can see it very clearly and

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.880 
here you can see it very clearly and
that's<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.700> sign<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:10.320> relationship

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
that's just a sign of the relationship

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.890 
that's just a sign of the relationship
imbalance<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.659> dog's

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
imbalance that is going on in this dog's

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.870 
imbalance that is going on in this dog's
mind<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.830> that's<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> importance<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
mind so that's the importance of the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.300 
mind so that's the importance of the
yield<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.299> me<00:01:15.509> portion<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:17.040> follow

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
yield to me portion of this the follow

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.649 
yield to me portion of this the follow
me<00:01:17.549> portion<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.030> going<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.210> happen<00:01:18.509> when<00:01:18.630> I

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
me portion is going to happen when I

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.749 
me portion is going to happen when I
move<00:01:18.900> away<00:01:19.049> from<00:01:19.320> him<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.130> used<00:01:20.430> leash

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
move away from him and I used leash

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.880 
move away from him and I used leash
pressure<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.540> teach<00:01:21.750> him<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.080> follow<00:01:22.320> my<00:01:22.590> lead

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
pressure to teach him to follow my lead

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.770 
pressure to teach him to follow my lead
so<00:01:23.220> when<00:01:23.369> he's<00:01:23.460> not<00:01:23.729> following<00:01:24.060> my<00:01:24.330> lead<00:01:24.479> he

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
so when he's not following my lead he

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.899 
so when he's not following my lead he
feels<00:01:25.020> pressure<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> leash<00:01:25.920> when<00:01:26.610> he<00:01:26.700> is

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
feels pressure on the leash when he is

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.670 
feels pressure on the leash when he is
following<00:01:27.360> my<00:01:27.509> lead<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:28.020> pressure<00:01:28.320> goes

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
following my lead that pressure goes

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.630 
following my lead that pressure goes
away<00:01:29.119> so<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.960> lot<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.560> patterns<00:01:32.430> in

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
away so this is a lot of patterns in

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.850 
away so this is a lot of patterns in
movement<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.180> every<00:01:33.570> movement<00:01:33.840> I'm<00:01:34.170> making<00:01:34.680> is

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
movement in every movement I'm making is

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.399 
movement in every movement I'm making is
in<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.100> response<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> dog<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.750> pusher<00:01:37.170> he's

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
in a response to the dog the pusher he's

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.770 
in a response to the dog the pusher he's
being<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.950> harder<00:01:38.549> I'm<00:01:38.729> gonna<00:01:38.939> cut<00:01:39.270> into<00:01:39.509> him

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
being the harder I'm gonna cut into him

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.840 
being the harder I'm gonna cut into him
on<00:01:39.930> his<00:01:40.079> left-hand<00:01:40.409> turns<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.640> more

on his left-hand turns and the more

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.109 
on his left-hand turns and the more
quickly<00:01:42.180> I'll<00:01:42.450> move<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.110> then<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:44.070> he's<00:01:44.460> kind

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
quickly I'll move and then as he's kind

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.539 
quickly I'll move and then as he's kind
of<00:01:45.210> surrenders<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.020> yields<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.439> me<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.770> release

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
of surrenders and yields to me I release

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.940 
of surrenders and yields to me I release
that<00:01:47.579> pressure<00:01:48.030> by<00:01:48.420> opening<00:01:49.020> up<00:01:49.170> my<00:01:49.380> movement

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
that pressure by opening up my movement

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.010 
that pressure by opening up my movement
and<00:01:50.220> moving<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.759> more<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.119> straight<00:01:51.180> line<00:01:51.509> or

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
and moving in more of a straight line or

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.100 
and moving in more of a straight line or
a<00:01:52.049> looser<00:01:52.500> curve<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.310> pressure<00:01:53.610> on

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
a looser curve so this is pressure on

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.370 
a looser curve so this is pressure on
pressure<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.640> pressure<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.509> then

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
pressure on pressure on and then

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.050 
pressure on pressure on and then
pressure<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.159> going<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.369> come<00:01:59.579> off<00:01:59.759> in<00:01:59.790> a

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
pressure is going to come off in a

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.270 
pressure is going to come off in a
moment<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:00.600> he<00:02:00.899> begins<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.350> yield<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.829> me<00:02:01.920> right

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
moment as he begins to yield to me right

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.760 
moment as he begins to yield to me right
there<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.909> loosen<00:02:03.810> up<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.110> pressure<00:02:04.320> comes<00:02:04.560> off

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
there I loosen up and pressure comes off

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.669 
there I loosen up and pressure comes off
on<00:02:05.040> again<00:02:05.729> off<00:02:06.270> again<00:02:07.459> so<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.720> exercise

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
on again off again so this is a exercise

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.830 
on again off again so this is a exercise
that<00:02:11.099> appears<00:02:11.520> very<00:02:11.670> simple<00:02:12.360> but<00:02:12.629> when<00:02:12.750> you

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
that appears very simple but when you

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.800 
that appears very simple but when you
start<00:02:13.080> putting<00:02:13.349> it<00:02:13.440> into

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
start putting it into

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.449 
start putting it into
application<00:02:14.319> you'll<00:02:14.440> see<00:02:14.500> it's<00:02:14.830> not<00:02:15.010> quite<00:02:15.310> as

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
application you'll see it's not quite as

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.000 
application you'll see it's not quite as
easy<00:02:15.489> as<00:02:15.880> it<00:02:16.030> looks<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:17.349> really<00:02:17.830> have<00:02:17.980> to

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
easy as it looks and you really have to

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.890 
easy as it looks and you really have to
be<00:02:18.220> reading<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.670> dog<00:02:18.880> at<00:02:19.090> every<00:02:19.390> moment<00:02:19.569> and

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
be reading the dog at every moment and

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.600 
be reading the dog at every moment and
listening<00:02:20.319> to<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.560> dog<00:02:20.709> at<00:02:20.890> every<00:02:21.099> moment<00:02:21.250> and

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
listening to the dog at every moment and

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.280 
listening to the dog at every moment and
responding<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.330> what<00:02:22.569> he's<00:02:22.660> telling<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:22.989> so

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
responding to what he's telling you so

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.410 
responding to what he's telling you so
he's<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.500> little<00:02:23.620> bit<00:02:23.800> pushy<00:02:23.980> right<00:02:24.280> now<00:02:24.430> you're

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
he's a little bit pushy right now you're

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.760 
he's a little bit pushy right now you're
going<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.599> see<00:02:25.750> in<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.930> moment<00:02:26.080> that<00:02:26.319> he<00:02:26.470> starts

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
going to see in a moment that he starts

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.770 
going to see in a moment that he starts
to<00:02:26.830> ease<00:02:27.010> up<00:02:27.209> again<00:02:28.209> still<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.540> little<00:02:28.630> bit

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
to ease up again still a little bit

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.050 
to ease up again still a little bit
pushy<00:02:28.989> this<00:02:29.319> is<00:02:29.440> pressure<00:02:29.739> on<00:02:32.790> pressure<00:02:33.790> on

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
pushy this is pressure on pressure on

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.800 
pushy this is pressure on pressure on
pressure<00:02:35.050> off<00:02:35.849> switching<00:02:36.849> over<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.150> following

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
pressure off switching over to following

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.160 
pressure off switching over to following
me<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:39.580> guys<00:02:39.730> can<00:02:39.910> follow<00:02:40.150> he<00:02:40.480> does<00:02:40.690> that<00:02:40.930> not

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
me you guys can follow he does that not

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.970 
me you guys can follow he does that not
not<00:02:41.590> too<00:02:41.890> bad<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:42.569> then<00:02:43.569> again<00:02:43.860> yielding<00:02:44.860> to

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
not too bad and then again yielding to

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.820 
not too bad and then again yielding to
me<00:02:45.010> he's<00:02:45.610> getting<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:45.970> little<00:02:46.180> bit<00:02:46.450> better<00:02:46.830> but

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
me he's getting a little bit better but

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.259 
me he's getting a little bit better but
he<00:02:47.920> still<00:02:48.130> needs<00:02:48.310> some<00:02:48.459> work<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:48.700> can<00:02:48.880> see<00:02:49.090> he

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
he still needs some work you can see he

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.970 
he still needs some work you can see he
doesn't<00:02:49.510> really<00:02:49.750> quite<00:02:50.140> want<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.470> get<00:02:50.650> out<00:02:50.830> of

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
doesn't really quite want to get out of

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.160 
doesn't really quite want to get out of
my<00:02:51.130> way<00:02:51.400> he<00:02:51.970> still<00:02:52.209> tries<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.660> just<00:02:52.840> keep<00:02:53.019> his

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
my way he still tries to just keep his

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.690 
my way he still tries to just keep his
body<00:02:53.440> in<00:02:53.650> front<00:02:53.680> of<00:02:53.980> me<00:02:54.040> it's<00:02:54.160> very<00:02:54.220> very

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
body in front of me it's very very

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.309 
body in front of me it's very very
subtle<00:02:54.970> stuff<00:02:55.420> but<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:55.840> does<00:02:55.989> make<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.230> huge

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
subtle stuff but it does make a huge

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.110 
subtle stuff but it does make a huge
difference<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.160> you're<00:02:57.549> going<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.700> see<00:02:57.940> in<00:02:58.060> a

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
difference and you're going to see in a

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.880 
difference and you're going to see in a
moment<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.630> change<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:59.170> occurs<00:02:59.470> when<00:02:59.769> he

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
moment the change that occurs when he

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:08.550 
moment the change that occurs when he
starts<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.340> get<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.580> right

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.170 

so<00:03:09.560> this<00:03:09.650> is<00:03:09.800> about<00:03:10.040> five<00:03:10.340> or<00:03:10.730> ten<00:03:10.880> minutes

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
so this is about five or ten minutes

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.030 
so this is about five or ten minutes
into<00:03:11.330> our<00:03:11.510> session<00:03:11.960> and<00:03:12.200> polo<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.740> really

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
into our session and polo is really

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.890 
into our session and polo is really
starting<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.550> get<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.910> he's<00:03:14.450> still<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.750> little

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
starting to get it he's still a little

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.750 
starting to get it he's still a little
bit<00:03:15.410> choppy<00:03:15.680> in<00:03:15.890> his<00:03:16.070> movement<00:03:16.490> it's<00:03:16.610> not

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
bit choppy in his movement it's not

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.640 
bit choppy in his movement it's not
quite<00:03:17.000> as<00:03:17.090> fluid<00:03:17.540> as<00:03:17.630> it's<00:03:17.840> going<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:18.020> be<00:03:18.200> once

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
quite as fluid as it's going to be once

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.650 
quite as fluid as it's going to be once
he<00:03:18.830> really<00:03:19.250> has<00:03:19.730> things<00:03:20.000> click<00:03:20.210> in<00:03:20.390> his<00:03:20.480> head

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
he really has things click in his head

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.630 
he really has things click in his head
but<00:03:21.290> you<00:03:21.440> can<00:03:21.590> see<00:03:21.860> he's<00:03:22.070> being<00:03:22.220> a<00:03:22.370> lot<00:03:22.610> more

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
but you can see he's being a lot more

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.420 
but you can see he's being a lot more
respectful<00:03:23.510> of<00:03:23.540> my<00:03:23.810> space<00:03:24.230> he's<00:03:24.890> making<00:03:25.250> a<00:03:25.310> lot

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
respectful of my space he's making a lot

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.130 
respectful of my space he's making a lot
of<00:03:25.490> eye<00:03:25.670> contact<00:03:26.210> with<00:03:26.390> me<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:26.690> actually<00:03:26.810> his

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
of eye contact with me and actually his

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.170 
of eye contact with me and actually his
attitude<00:03:27.710> is<00:03:27.890> changing<00:03:27.920> he<00:03:28.700> was<00:03:28.820> a<00:03:28.850> little<00:03:29.090> bit

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
attitude is changing he was a little bit

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.580 
attitude is changing he was a little bit

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
be behind you at all so here's another

dog<00:04:28.850> his<00:04:29.090> name's<00:04:29.270> Leroy<00:04:29.480> Leroy<00:04:30.320> has<00:04:30.650> done<00:04:30.860> this

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
dog his name's Leroy Leroy has done this

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.250 
dog his name's Leroy Leroy has done this
a<00:04:31.100> few<00:04:31.460> times<00:04:31.490> with<00:04:31.910> me<00:04:32.030> already<00:04:32.330> he's<00:04:32.870> been<00:04:33.140> in

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
a few times with me already he's been in

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.440 
a few times with me already he's been in
training<00:04:33.440> for<00:04:33.830> about<00:04:34.160> a<00:04:34.310> week<00:04:34.520> I've<00:04:35.180> done<00:04:35.360> this

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
training for about a week I've done this

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.870 
training for about a week I've done this
exercise<00:04:35.950> multiple<00:04:36.950> times<00:04:37.190> over<00:04:37.430> that<00:04:37.670> week

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
exercise multiple times over that week

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.880 
exercise multiple times over that week
so<00:04:38.090> he's<00:04:38.210> pretty<00:04:38.360> good<00:04:38.570> at<00:04:38.720> it<00:04:38.750> a<00:04:38.990> similar<00:04:39.650> type

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
so he's pretty good at it a similar type

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.100 
so he's pretty good at it a similar type
case<00:04:40.220> Leroy<00:04:40.670> has<00:04:40.940> attacked<00:04:41.360> both<00:04:41.720> of<00:04:41.990> his

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
case Leroy has attacked both of his

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.060 
case Leroy has attacked both of his
owners<00:04:42.500> before<00:04:43.630> over<00:04:44.630> being<00:04:45.230> possessive<00:04:45.770> over

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
owners before over being possessive over

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.380 
owners before over being possessive over
space<00:04:46.720> couches<00:04:47.720> beds<00:04:48.400> objects<00:04:49.400> things<00:04:50.120> like

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
space couches beds objects things like

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.410 
space couches beds objects things like
that<00:04:50.690> so<00:04:51.350> again<00:04:51.380> a<00:04:51.980> pretty<00:04:52.520> pretty<00:04:53.120> clear

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
that so again a pretty pretty clear

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.200 
that so again a pretty pretty clear
relationship<00:04:54.110> issue<00:04:54.320> with<00:04:54.680> his<00:04:54.830> owners<00:04:55.210> same

camera<00:05:08.990> so<00:05:09.110> he's<00:05:09.200> a<00:05:09.260> little<00:05:09.470> bit<00:05:09.590> distracted

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
camera so he's a little bit distracted

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.860 
camera so he's a little bit distracted
and<00:05:10.280> that's<00:05:10.430> perfectly<00:05:10.850> okay<00:05:10.940> we<00:05:11.510> would

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
and that's perfectly okay we would

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.230 
and that's perfectly okay we would
expect<00:05:12.170> that<00:05:12.290> a<00:05:12.440> little<00:05:12.680> bit<00:05:12.830> but<00:05:13.430> notice<00:05:13.820> he

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
expect that a little bit but notice he

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.510 
expect that a little bit but notice he
yields<00:05:14.750> space<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.230> me<00:05:15.350> very<00:05:16.040> very<00:05:16.250> well

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
yields space to me very very well

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.700 
yields space to me very very well
there's<00:05:17.390> a<00:05:17.479> little<00:05:17.780> cushion<00:05:18.020> of<00:05:18.260> air<00:05:18.380> between

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
there's a little cushion of air between

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.350 
there's a little cushion of air between
him<00:05:19.010> and<00:05:19.130> I<00:05:19.220> and<00:05:19.490> we<00:05:19.580> don't<00:05:19.729> really<00:05:19.880> want<00:05:20.000> that

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
him and I and we don't really want that

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.220 
him and I and we don't really want that
cushion<00:05:20.720> of<00:05:20.810> air

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
cushion of air

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.800 
cushion of air
laughs<00:05:21.440> so<00:05:22.190> we<00:05:22.610> want<00:05:22.880> him<00:05:22.970> to<00:05:23.060> always<00:05:23.300> give<00:05:23.660> us

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
laughs so we want him to always give us

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.900 
laughs so we want him to always give us
a<00:05:23.930> little<00:05:24.140> bit<00:05:24.380> of<00:05:24.500> clearance<00:05:24.860> there<00:05:25.130> he<00:05:25.790> was

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
a little bit of clearance there he was

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.370 
a little bit of clearance there he was
slightly<00:05:26.210> in<00:05:26.390> front<00:05:26.510> of<00:05:26.660> me<00:05:26.720> so<00:05:26.750> I<00:05:26.900> pushed<00:05:27.140> into

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
slightly in front of me so I pushed into

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.440 
slightly in front of me so I pushed into
him<00:05:27.560> a<00:05:27.620> little<00:05:27.830> bit<00:05:27.980> harder<00:05:28.370> again<00:05:29.240> that's

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
him a little bit harder again that's

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.940 
him a little bit harder again that's
just<00:05:29.660> a<00:05:29.810> way<00:05:29.930> to<00:05:29.960> increase<00:05:30.440> the<00:05:30.560> pressure

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
just a way to increase the pressure

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.800 
just a way to increase the pressure
we're<00:05:31.190> putting<00:05:31.430> on<00:05:31.550> him<00:05:31.730> and<00:05:31.880> then<00:05:32.300> I<00:05:32.330> soften

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
we're putting on him and then I soften

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.110 
we're putting on him and then I soften
up<00:05:32.960> and<00:05:33.230> release<00:05:33.650> that<00:05:33.830> pressure<00:05:34.100> so<00:05:34.970> this<00:05:35.060> is

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
up and release that pressure so this is

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.260 
up and release that pressure so this is
the<00:05:35.330> follow<00:05:35.600> me<00:05:35.870> portion<00:05:36.880> yield<00:05:37.880> to<00:05:38.120> me

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
the follow me portion yield to me

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:45.760 
the follow me portion yield to me
portion<00:05:40.060> shielding<00:05:41.060> nicely<00:05:44.440> I'll<00:05:45.440> switch

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
portion shielding nicely I'll switch

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.210 
portion shielding nicely I'll switch
back<00:05:45.980> to<00:05:46.010> follow<00:05:46.400> me<00:05:46.610> in<00:05:46.700> a<00:05:46.790> second

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
back to follow me in a second

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.500 
back to follow me in a second
again<00:05:49.220> notice<00:05:49.550> the<00:05:49.670> position<00:05:50.060> of<00:05:50.180> the<00:05:50.270> dog

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
again notice the position of the dog

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.470 
again notice the position of the dog
he's<00:05:51.140> walking<00:05:51.470> slightly<00:05:52.250> behind<00:05:52.460> my<00:05:53.000> hip<00:05:53.300> and

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
he's walking slightly behind my hip and

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.480 
he's walking slightly behind my hip and
that's<00:05:53.990> exactly<00:05:54.410> where<00:05:54.770> I<00:05:54.800> want<00:05:55.100> a<00:05:55.250> dog<00:05:55.460> to

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
that's exactly where I want a dog to

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.570 
that's exactly where I want a dog to
walk<00:05:55.910> for<00:05:56.810> proper<00:05:57.200> relationship<00:05:57.710> purposes<00:05:58.370> I

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
walk for proper relationship purposes I

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.000 
walk for proper relationship purposes I
wanted<00:05:58.880> to<00:05:59.000> stay<00:05:59.210> slightly<00:05:59.510> behind<00:06:00.140> where<00:06:00.800> he

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
wanted to stay slightly behind where he

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.820 
wanted to stay slightly behind where he
recognizes<00:06:01.700> me<00:06:01.970> as<00:06:02.210> the<00:06:02.540> leader<00:06:02.720> and<00:06:02.990> himself

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
recognizes me as the leader and himself
