in Canada I believe for $50 on contract
it'll<00:00:16.770> look<00:00:16.859> fairly<00:00:17.460> similar<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.000> the

there<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:26.100> basically<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.759> really

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
there but it's basically just a really

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.170 
there but it's basically just a really
slim<00:01:27.420> sliver<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.619> little<00:01:28.860> nub<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.759> between

fur pause/play there's also a

little<00:03:21.340> nitpick<00:03:21.730> that<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:21.940> had<00:03:22.120> had<00:03:22.330> with<00:03:22.510> the

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
little nitpick that I had had with the

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.080 
little nitpick that I had had with the
9850<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.260> 9860<00:03:23.620> was<00:03:24.040> that<00:03:24.220> just<00:03:24.730> above<00:03:24.910> this

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
9850 and 9860 was that just above this

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.320 
9850 and 9860 was that just above this
top<00:03:25.300> row<00:03:25.540> there<00:03:25.780> there<00:03:26.110> was<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.260> button<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:28.060> hide

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330

top row there there was a button to hide
the<00:03:28.480> whole<00:03:28.570> keyboard<00:03:29.050> so<00:03:29.290> sometimes<00:03:29.740> when<00:03:29.950> you

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
the whole keyboard so sometimes when you

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.530 
the whole keyboard so sometimes when you
type<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.490> would<00:03:30.610> accidentally<00:03:31.090> hide<00:03:31.390> the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
type you would accidentally hide the

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.540 
type you would accidentally hide the
keyboard<00:03:31.770> apparently<00:03:32.770> there's<00:03:33.160> an<00:03:33.280> option<00:03:33.490> to

keyboard apparently there's an option to

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.940 
keyboard apparently there's an option to
turn<00:03:33.670> that<00:03:33.850> off<00:03:34.030> so<00:03:34.270> that's<00:03:34.870> making<00:03:35.560> typing<00:03:35.920> a

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
turn that off so that's making typing a

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.190 
turn that off so that's making typing a
little<00:03:36.130> bit<00:03:36.250> better<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:37.840> show<00:03:38.020> you<00:03:38.080> how

that have plugged into that framework
there's<00:04:10.840> also<00:04:10.990> a<00:04:11.140> little<00:04:11.470> bit<00:04:11.560> of<00:04:11.710> voice

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
there's also a little bit of voice

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.670 
recognition here so Pizza Ottawa and I
find<00:04:19.150> hitting<00:04:19.420> done<00:04:19.690> isn't<00:04:20.109> particularly

find hitting done isn't particularly

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.290

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.630 
great because most the time I'm going to
be<00:04:22.360> doing<00:04:22.480> this<00:04:23.110> hands-free<00:04:23.590> but<00:04:23.860> it<00:04:24.430> does

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
be doing this hands-free but it does

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.250 
be doing this hands-free but it does
work<00:04:24.820> relatively<00:04:25.270> well

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
work relatively well

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
whole bunch of different things so one

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.670 
whole bunch of different things so one
thing<00:05:55.450> that<00:05:55.480> RIM<00:05:55.810> was<00:05:55.960> showing<00:05:56.260> off<00:05:56.410> recently

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
thing that RIM was showing off recently

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.870 
thing that RIM was showing off recently
was<00:05:57.160> blackberry<00:05:58.090> tag<00:05:58.450> so<00:05:58.840> basically<00:05:59.260> you<00:05:59.740> just

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
was blackberry tag so basically you just

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.510 
was blackberry tag so basically you just
bumped<00:06:00.880> the<00:06:00.970> back<00:06:01.330> of<00:06:01.360> to<00:06:02.080> black<00:06:02.350> of<00:06:02.830> 2<00:06:03.160> NFC

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
bumped the back of to black of 2 NFC

enabled<00:06:03.670> BlackBerry's<00:06:04.300> together<00:06:04.600> and<00:06:04.750> you

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
enabled BlackBerry's together and you

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.110 
enabled BlackBerry's together and you
could<00:06:04.930> transfer<00:06:05.410> contacts<00:06:06.370> pictures<00:06:09.120> digit

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
could transfer contacts pictures digit

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.450

just about anything documents and

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.770 
just about anything documents and
they're<00:06:12.820> also<00:06:12.940> going<00:06:13.210> to<00:06:13.300> allow<00:06:13.420> third-party

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
they're also going to allow third-party

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.830 
they're also going to allow third-party
applications<00:06:14.710> to<00:06:15.000> plug<00:06:16.000> in<00:06:16.150> there<00:06:16.330> too<00:06:16.540> so

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
applications to plug in there too so

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.370 
applications to plug in there too so
it's<00:06:17.800> a<00:06:18.040> it's<00:06:18.490> an<00:06:18.580> interesting<00:06:19.030> mechanism<00:06:19.810> if

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
it's a it's an interesting mechanism if

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.120 
it's a it's an interesting mechanism if
not<00:06:21.570> not<00:06:22.570> quite<00:06:22.810> fully<00:06:23.260> realized<00:06:23.740> just<00:06:23.920> yet

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
not not quite fully realized just yet

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.980 
not not quite fully realized just yet
contactless<00:06:25.000> payments<00:06:25.480> are<00:06:25.570> also<00:06:25.690> really

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
contactless payments are also really

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.290 
contactless payments are also really
huge<00:06:26.430> so<00:06:27.430> that<00:06:27.640> you'll<00:06:27.790> be<00:06:27.910> able<00:06:27.970> to<00:06:28.090> use<00:06:28.180> it

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
huge so that you'll be able to use it

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.610 
huge so that you'll be able to use it
and<00:06:28.450> stuff<00:06:28.780> like<00:06:28.900> pay<00:06:29.080> pass<00:06:29.290> when<00:06:29.470> you're
