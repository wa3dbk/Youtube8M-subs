very easy and for crossing settings I am

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.310 
very easy and for crossing settings I am
using<00:01:20.460> semi<00:01:20.729> assisted<00:01:21.420> which<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.049> very

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
using semi assisted which is very

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.570 
using semi assisted which is very
important<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.770> want<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.979> make<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.159> very<00:01:23.220> clear

important I want to make that very clear
because<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> point<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.170> perspective

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.039 
this tutorial I believe that semi

assisted is the default when you go to

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.410

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
wasn't sure if I wanted to include this

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.160 
wasn't sure if I wanted to include this
in<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.160> tutorial<00:02:23.880> however<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.630> just<00:02:24.900> wouldn't

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
in the tutorial however I just wouldn't

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
it wasn't a priority because it scored

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.430 
it wasn't a priority because it scored
oh<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.730> often<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:34.020> reason<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.320> this

oh so often and the reason that this

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.110 
oh so often and the reason that this
cross<00:02:34.710> is<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.070> effective<00:02:35.520> is<00:02:35.670> it's<00:02:35.820> just<00:02:35.880> the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
cross is so effective is it's just the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.730 
cross is so effective is it's just the
normal<00:02:36.480> early<00:02:36.750> cross<00:02:36.960> but<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.140> have<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.350> huge

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
normal early cross but you have a huge

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.740 
normal early cross but you have a huge
margin<00:02:38.160> for<00:02:38.520> error<00:02:38.730> there's<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.480> higher

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
margin for error there's a higher

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.680 
margin for error there's a higher
percentage<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.590> scoring<00:02:40.980> if<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.760> use<00:02:42.000> the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
percentage of you scoring if you use the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.840 
percentage of you scoring if you use the
cross<00:02:42.990> with<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.440> sweat<00:02:43.709> as<00:02:43.920> opposed<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:44.610> just

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
cross with the sweat as opposed to just

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.150 
cross with the sweat as opposed to just
passing<00:02:45.270> across<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.600> middle<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.410> box<00:02:46.620> the

we're talking about manual crosses we're
looking<00:02:59.550> at<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.730> down<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.209> line<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.810> as<00:03:01.470> you

progress farther down the line you no
longer<00:03:04.260> can<00:03:04.590> do<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.860> early<00:03:05.160> cross<00:03:05.400> it's<00:03:06.030> not

going<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.480> go<00:03:06.600> where<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.840> want<00:03:07.080> it<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.320> the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
going to go where you want it to the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.810 
going to go where you want it to the
keeper<00:03:07.770> is<00:03:07.830> going<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:08.010> come<00:03:08.160> out<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.400> block<00:03:08.580> it

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
keeper is going to come out and block it

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.640 
keeper is going to come out and block it
sometimes<00:03:09.510> it'll<00:03:09.690> go<00:03:09.780> out<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:10.050> play<00:03:10.230> entirely

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
sometimes it'll go out of play entirely

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.370 
sometimes it'll go out of play entirely
and<00:03:11.070> it's<00:03:11.190> just<00:03:11.520> not<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.760> consistent<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:12.780> it

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
and it's just not that consistent and it

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.660 
and it's just not that consistent and it
takes<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.620> little<00:03:13.739> bit<00:03:13.860> of<00:03:13.950> time<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.310> get<00:03:14.430> used

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
takes a little bit of time to get used

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.400 
takes a little bit of time to get used
to<00:03:14.820> whipping<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.360> crosses<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.020> having<00:03:16.290> the

it back you're using the left stick to
aim<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.970> you're<00:03:27.330> just<00:03:27.420> gonna<00:03:27.510> have<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.750> little

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
aim and you're just gonna have a little

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.110 
aim and you're just gonna have a little
bit<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.680> tad<00:03:29.010> of<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.370> cutback<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:29.970> has<00:03:30.090> a

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
bit of a tad of a cutback it has a

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.000 
bit of a tad of a cutback it has a
normal<00:03:30.630> in<00:03:30.810> swinger<00:03:31.200> so<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.680> don't<00:03:31.830> need<00:03:31.950> to

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
normal in swinger so you don't need to

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.440 
normal in swinger so you don't need to
do<00:03:32.160> too<00:03:32.370> much<00:03:32.580> it<00:03:32.820> takes<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:33.030> little<00:03:33.180> time<00:03:33.299> to

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
do too much it takes a little time to

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.850 
do too much it takes a little time to
get<00:03:33.660> used<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.170> look<00:03:34.260> at<00:03:34.350> these<00:03:34.410> finishes

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
get used to and look at these finishes

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.400 
get used to and look at these finishes
honda<00:03:35.250> makes<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.610> look<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:36.120> simple<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.840> the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
honda makes that look so simple and the

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.840 
honda makes that look so simple and the
idea<00:03:37.739> behind<00:03:37.890> going<00:03:38.340> down<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.670> line<00:03:38.790> and

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
idea behind going down the line and

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.250 
idea behind going down the line and
crossing<00:03:39.360> is<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.630> increases<00:03:40.230> your

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
crossing is it increases your

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.470 
crossing is it increases your
opportunity<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:40.950> score<00:03:41.160> goals<00:03:41.430> but<00:03:42.030> you<00:03:42.180> don't

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
opportunity to score goals but you don't

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.699 
opportunity to score goals but you don't
want<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.780> early<00:03:42.989> cross<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.260> got<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.440> switch<00:03:43.590> it

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
want to early cross you got to switch it
