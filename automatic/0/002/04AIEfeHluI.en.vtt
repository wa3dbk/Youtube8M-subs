00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.910
 about three hundred candidates candidacy of whom a site 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.770
 very important 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.869
 spend more time choosing the site 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:11.039
 what the amount to the team 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:12.609
 in this case 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:15.479
 as if the concentrations and was already defined 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:18.479
 you can be alert for there but the ideal would be 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.269
 devote a little time to look at the area 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.849
 and look for it 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:24.829
 place the province 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.979
 Once the most suitable site is chosen, we discuss the differences with other 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:30.140
 modalities 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.140
 given the size in stone that legislation allows 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.780
 i like fishing surabaya in which the rocks remain a long time of labor 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.450
 well, we need supports 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.560
 in this case the tripods allow to have the rocks in horizontal 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.560
 the best for fishing comfort 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.620
 salazar is that we use santafesino 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.579
 can do well of 3 90 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.330
 or of 13 santa 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.289
 yes 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.040
 and in Spain because of the fishing police 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.260
 frazier 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.320
 harder than in other countries 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.320
 We spent an entertaining afternoon celebrating half 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.900
 the lines that we usually use solense 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.100
 between a 0 38 and 40 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.980
 in this case and stretching 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.760
 a 0 30 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.700
 i 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.440
 a cargo terminal 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.070
 to withstand the stress of those that are 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.070
 that are generated upwards 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.350
 together with the tripods the reeds and the timid ones 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.530
 another one of the peculiarities of the taxi without it is the way in which the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.390
 baits in the base 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.620
 there are almost one hundred below 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.070
 above the average is only between eight centimeters about 20 centimeters 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.810
 to the one on the other side, alba josué hands over the terminal part 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.930
 will ponder village 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.130
 by cities as done the eight to ten centimeters of 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.280
 which can be either of airón 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.630
 d place current percent bond pressed 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.800
 is the typical bass of erc hobby 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.949
 in which he was flying 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.539
 it's not going to hook the people, it's going 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.539
 in a challenge of trading other material 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.929
 what it gives 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:22.699
 the grpn size of the hut I will choose to use 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:25.789
 that typical montage of cartes in 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:26.829
 Noelia 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.489
 what is the bait 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.469
 is not inside the hook 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.849
 it's as if they comment on san angel 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.679
 it was already prepared by a soul 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:39.129
 they have bits of vueling 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.669
 that this resulting montage would be this 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:42.859
 and nothing less than to advance
