Sun<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.200> normally<00:01:07.650> wouldn't<00:01:07.800> even<00:01:08.040> consider<00:01:08.700> a

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
Sun I normally wouldn't even consider a

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.270 
Sun I normally wouldn't even consider a
polarizer<00:01:09.390> but<00:01:09.600> we're<00:01:09.720> shooting<00:01:09.990> at<00:01:10.080> such<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
polarizer but we're shooting at such a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.650 
polarizer but we're shooting at such a
severe<00:01:11.280> upward<00:01:11.700> angle<00:01:11.850> I'm<00:01:12.420> going<00:01:12.539> to<00:01:12.600> check

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
severe upward angle I'm going to check

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.540 
severe upward angle I'm going to check
and<00:01:12.960> see<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:14.009> thing<00:01:14.160> actually<00:01:14.340> is

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
and see and this thing actually is

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.420 
and see and this thing actually is
having<00:01:15.000> an<00:01:15.090> effect<00:01:15.300> on<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.690> on<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.619> surface

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
having an effect on the on the surface

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.889 
having an effect on the on the surface
of<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.060> mountain<00:01:18.479> up<00:01:18.570> there<00:01:18.690> there's<00:01:18.869> a

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
of the mountain up there there's a

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:20.270 
of the mountain up there there's a
little<00:01:19.080> bit<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.200> glare<00:01:19.410> and<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.800> darkening

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
little bit of glare and it is darkening

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.920 
little bit of glare and it is darkening
the<00:01:20.399> sky<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.880> bit<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.570> getting<00:01:21.720> rid<00:01:21.840> of

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the sky a bit so it's getting rid of

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.840 
the sky a bit so it's getting rid of
some<00:01:22.110> reflections<00:01:22.590> one<00:01:23.399> of<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.550> things<00:01:23.700> that

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
some reflections one of the things that

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.770 
some reflections one of the things that
I<00:01:23.880> really<00:01:24.030> liked<00:01:24.270> about<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.600> particular

I really liked about this particular

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.170 
I really liked about this particular
view<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.710> El<00:01:25.830> Capitan<00:01:26.310> was<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.610> fact<00:01:26.789> that<00:01:26.940> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
view of El Capitan was the fact that the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.960 
view of El Capitan was the fact that the
cliff<00:01:27.960> was<00:01:28.259> mimicked<00:01:28.680> by<00:01:28.920> these<00:01:29.430> two<00:01:29.670> pine

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
cliff was mimicked by these two pine

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.639 
cliff was mimicked by these two pine
trees<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.390> either<00:01:30.539> side<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.050> face<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.440> it

shooting<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.890> runoff<00:02:03.280> in<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.729> stream<00:02:04.060> from<00:02:04.479> a

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
shooting the runoff in the stream from a

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.559 
shooting the runoff in the stream from a
bridge<00:02:08.670> one<00:02:09.670> of<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.819> nice<00:02:09.940> things<00:02:09.970> about<00:02:10.269> this

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
bridge one of the nice things about this

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.420 
bridge one of the nice things about this
particular<00:02:10.750> scene<00:02:11.319> is<00:02:11.530> that<00:02:11.709> there<00:02:12.099> were<00:02:12.220> so

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
particular scene is that there were so

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.640 
particular scene is that there were so
many<00:02:12.580> little<00:02:13.450> areas<00:02:13.870> that<00:02:14.050> had<00:02:14.200> nice

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
many little areas that had nice

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.259 
many little areas that had nice
compositions<00:02:15.370> that<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.519> was<00:02:15.670> able<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.970> get<00:02:16.090> not

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
compositions that I was able to get not

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.540 
compositions that I was able to get not
just<00:02:16.300> one<00:02:16.750> picture<00:02:17.170> but<00:02:17.620> several<00:02:17.890> pictures<00:02:18.280> by

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
just one picture but several pictures by

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.009 
just one picture but several pictures by
zooming<00:02:18.910> in<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.209> out<00:02:19.330> of<00:02:19.569> different<00:02:19.720> areas

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
zooming in and out of different areas

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.089 
zooming in and out of different areas
and<00:02:20.290> we<00:02:20.349> were<00:02:20.470> using<00:02:20.769> the<00:02:20.920> tamron<00:02:21.459> 28<00:02:21.880> 275<00:02:22.510> here

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
and we were using the tamron 28 275 here

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.740 
and we were using the tamron 28 275 here
it's<00:02:24.099> a<00:02:24.220> great<00:02:24.430> lens<00:02:24.610> it's<00:02:24.910> very<00:02:25.150> sharp<00:02:25.450> this

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
it's a great lens it's very sharp this

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.030 
it's a great lens it's very sharp this
is<00:02:25.810> actually<00:02:26.049> one<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.230> sharpest<00:02:26.620> lenses

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
is actually one of the sharpest lenses

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.800 
is actually one of the sharpest lenses
that<00:02:27.610> I've<00:02:27.730> ever<00:02:27.910> shot<00:02:27.970> with<00:02:29.640> as<00:02:30.640> we<00:02:31.510> look<00:02:31.690> over

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
that I've ever shot with as we look over

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.900 
that I've ever shot with as we look over
the<00:02:31.989> bridge<00:02:32.230> onto<00:02:32.590> this<00:02:33.010> scene<00:02:33.340> there's<00:02:33.819> a

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
the bridge onto this scene there's a

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.000 
the bridge onto this scene there's a
couple<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.599> perfectly<00:02:35.230> placed<00:02:35.470> leaves<00:02:35.799> would

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
couple of perfectly placed leaves would

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.009 
couple of perfectly placed leaves would
still<00:02:36.220> have<00:02:36.340> their<00:02:36.459> fall<00:02:36.640> color<00:02:36.880> so<00:02:37.870> we're

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
still have their fall color so we're

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.720 
still have their fall color so we're
able<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.290> incorporate<00:02:38.500> those<00:02:38.920> as<00:02:39.190> kind<00:02:39.549> of<00:02:39.610> an

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
able to incorporate those as kind of an

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.270 
able to incorporate those as kind of an
anchor<00:02:40.090> for<00:02:40.239> this<00:02:40.930> picture<00:02:41.500> which<00:02:41.680> has<00:02:41.830> really

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
anchor for this picture which has really

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.920 
anchor for this picture which has really
got<00:02:42.430> some<00:02:42.580> nice<00:02:42.730> compositional<00:02:43.420> strength<00:02:43.750> to

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
got some nice compositional strength to

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.690 
got some nice compositional strength to
it<00:02:44.049> it's<00:02:44.260> got<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.620> flowing<00:02:44.950> water<00:02:45.099> bleeding

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
it it's got the flowing water bleeding

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.610 
it it's got the flowing water bleeding
down<00:02:45.849> from<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.299> top<00:02:46.780> through<00:02:47.079> the<00:02:47.170> bottom<00:02:47.440> and

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
down from the top through the bottom and

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.250 
down from the top through the bottom and
we've<00:02:48.489> been<00:02:48.610> able<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.940> through<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.780> custom

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
we've been able to through a custom

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.199 
we've been able to through a custom
white<00:02:50.410> balance<00:02:50.440> eliminate<00:02:51.340> all<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.549> bluish

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
white balance eliminate all the bluish

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.150 
white balance eliminate all the bluish
color<00:02:52.390> cast<00:02:52.750> here<00:02:52.959> so<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.260> snow<00:02:53.530> looks

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
color cast here so the snow looks

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.670 
color cast here so the snow looks
pristine<00:02:54.510> leaves<00:02:55.510> look<00:02:55.780> perfect<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.319> with

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
pristine leaves look perfect and with

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.770 
pristine leaves look perfect and with
the<00:02:56.739> camera<00:02:57.040> here<00:02:57.220> on<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.459> tripod<00:02:57.780> the

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
the camera here on a tripod the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.780 
the camera here on a tripod the
five-second<00:02:59.350> exposure<00:02:59.680> is<00:02:59.980> recording

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
five-second exposure is recording

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.400 
five-second exposure is recording
everything<00:03:01.060> crisp<00:03:01.510> except<00:03:01.989> for<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.200> moving

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
everything crisp except for the moving

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.790 
everything crisp except for the moving
water

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.830 

there's<00:03:09.460> so<00:03:09.580> many<00:03:09.700> great<00:03:09.910> wide<00:03:10.300> angle<00:03:10.660> shots

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
there's so many great wide angle shots

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.450 
there's so many great wide angle shots
you<00:03:11.020> can<00:03:11.140> get<00:03:11.260> here<00:03:11.380> in<00:03:11.500> Yosemite<00:03:11.590> it's<00:03:12.250> nice

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
you can get here in Yosemite it's nice

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.770 
you can get here in Yosemite it's nice
to<00:03:12.700> have<00:03:12.940> a<00:03:13.030> little<00:03:13.090> change<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.570> pace<00:03:13.720> and

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
to have a little change of pace and

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.410 
to have a little change of pace and
concentrate<00:03:14.590> on<00:03:14.620> some<00:03:14.890> close-ups<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:15.880> one<00:03:16.390> of

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
concentrate on some close-ups so one of

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.460 
concentrate on some close-ups so one of
the<00:03:16.540> things<00:03:16.570> that<00:03:16.810> caught<00:03:17.140> my<00:03:17.290> eye<00:03:17.320> this

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
the things that caught my eye this

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.990 
the things that caught my eye this
morning<00:03:17.620> as<00:03:17.980> we're<00:03:18.130> walking<00:03:18.250> along<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.790> trail

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
morning as we're walking along the trail

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.060 
morning as we're walking along the trail
here<00:03:19.210> at<00:03:19.300> Bridal<00:03:19.600> Veil<00:03:19.690> Falls<00:03:19.750> was<00:03:20.290> some<00:03:20.980> of

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
here at Bridal Veil Falls was some of

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.430 
here at Bridal Veil Falls was some of
this<00:03:21.160> moss<00:03:21.400> growing<00:03:21.760> on<00:03:21.970> these<00:03:22.180> trees<00:03:22.540> the

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
this moss growing on these trees the

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.260 
this moss growing on these trees the
light<00:03:23.650> just<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:24.130> little<00:03:24.400> flat<00:03:24.700> today<00:03:24.940> there's

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
light just a little flat today there's

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.430 
light just a little flat today there's
nothing<00:03:25.480> wrong<00:03:25.570> with<00:03:25.630> soft<00:03:25.930> light<00:03:26.170> but<00:03:26.320> this

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
nothing wrong with soft light but this

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.780 
nothing wrong with soft light but this
is<00:03:26.560> just<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.860> little<00:03:27.130> flats<00:03:27.370> we're<00:03:27.610> going<00:03:27.730> to

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
is just a little flats we're going to

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.570 
is just a little flats we're going to
get<00:03:27.880> one<00:03:28.030> shot<00:03:28.240> of<00:03:28.390> this<00:03:28.450> here<00:03:28.720> first<00:03:29.710> I<00:03:30.010> think

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
get one shot of this here first I think

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
get one shot of this here first I think
I'm<00:03:30.730> probably<00:03:30.850> going<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.180> want<00:03:31.300> to<00:03:31.390> use<00:03:31.480> an

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
I'm probably going to want to use an

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.390 
I'm probably going to want to use an
off-camera<00:03:32.020> flash<00:03:32.320> to<00:03:32.530> add<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.040> little<00:03:33.220> bit<00:03:33.340> of

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
off-camera flash to add a little bit of

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.600 
off-camera flash to add a little bit of
contrast<00:03:34.360> yeah<00:03:34.630> that's<00:03:34.840> just<00:03:35.020> way<00:03:35.110> to<00:03:35.170> play

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
contrast yeah that's just way to play

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.280 
contrast yeah that's just way to play
this<00:03:36.610> is<00:03:36.790> actually<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.480> macro<00:03:37.780> shot<00:03:38.020> but<00:03:38.200> I'm

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
this is actually a macro shot but I'm

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.500 
this is actually a macro shot but I'm
not<00:03:38.410> using<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.890> macro<00:03:39.310> lens<00:03:39.550> specifically<00:03:40.390> i'm

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
not using a macro lens specifically i'm

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.350 
not using a macro lens specifically i'm
using<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.100> 2875<00:03:42.100> which<00:03:42.370> lets<00:03:42.730> me<00:03:42.820> focus<00:03:43.030> in

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
using the 2875 which lets me focus in

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.220 
using the 2875 which lets me focus in
really<00:03:43.960> close<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:45.190> we<00:03:45.280> got<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.550> flash<00:03:45.790> off

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
really close so we got the flash off

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.120 
really close so we got the flash off
camera<00:03:47.230> now<00:03:47.470> what<00:03:47.650> I'm<00:03:47.740> going<00:03:47.830> to<00:03:47.890> do<00:03:47.980> because

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
camera now what I'm going to do because

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.400 
camera now what I'm going to do because
I<00:03:48.220> don't<00:03:48.550> want<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:48.760> make<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.300> light<00:03:50.140> that<00:03:50.290> we

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
I don't want to make the light that we

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.040 
I don't want to make the light that we
add<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.770> this<00:03:50.890> two<00:03:51.160> contrasting<00:03:51.840> so<00:03:52.840> I'm<00:03:52.900> going

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
add to this two contrasting so I'm going

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.000 
add to this two contrasting so I'm going
to<00:03:53.080> use<00:03:53.140> a<00:03:53.610> soft<00:03:54.610> box<00:03:54.880> here<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.830> spread<00:03:56.830> out<00:03:56.980> the

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
to use a soft box here to spread out the

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.490 
to use a soft box here to spread out the
size<00:03:57.400> of<00:03:57.610> the<00:03:57.730> source<00:03:58.360> to<00:03:58.630> soften<00:03:59.290> it<00:03:59.410> to

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
size of the source to soften it to

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.410 
size of the source to soften it to
simulate<00:03:59.920> the<00:04:00.070> diffused<00:04:01.030> light<00:04:01.180> that<00:04:01.330> we

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
simulate the diffused light that we

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.660 
simulate the diffused light that we
already<00:04:01.570> have<00:04:01.720> here<00:04:02.080> but<00:04:02.380> it'll<00:04:02.620> allow<00:04:03.370> me<00:04:03.550> to

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
already have here but it'll allow me to

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.600 
already have here but it'll allow me to
control<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.840> angle<00:04:05.230> at<00:04:05.680> which<00:04:05.710> the<00:04:05.950> light

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
control the angle at which the light

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.130 
control the angle at which the light
comes<00:04:06.850> from<00:04:06.940> which<00:04:07.240> is<00:04:07.270> perfect<00:04:08.020> because

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
comes from which is perfect because

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.300 
comes from which is perfect because
right<00:04:08.440> now<00:04:08.470> it's<00:04:08.710> coming<00:04:08.950> from<00:04:09.010> everywhere

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
right now it's coming from everywhere

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.670 
right now it's coming from everywhere
and<00:04:09.610> there's<00:04:10.270> no<00:04:10.840> real<00:04:11.110> sense<00:04:11.350> of<00:04:11.500> any

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
and there's no real sense of any

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.650 
and there's no real sense of any
direction<00:04:12.100> to<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.460> light<00:04:12.610> so<00:04:13.330> it's<00:04:13.510> going<00:04:13.600> to

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
direction to the light so it's going to

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.020 
direction to the light so it's going to
be<00:04:13.750> coming<00:04:13.989> out<00:04:14.230> of<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.410> flash<00:04:14.650> as<00:04:14.890> wide<00:04:15.730> as<00:04:15.910> it

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
be coming out of the flash as wide as it

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.180 
be coming out of the flash as wide as it
can<00:04:16.239> to<00:04:16.390> hit<00:04:16.570> this<00:04:16.690> surface<00:04:17.049> inside<00:04:17.350> this<00:04:17.560> box

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
can to hit this surface inside this box

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.190 
can to hit this surface inside this box
and<00:04:18.370> you're<00:04:18.520> going<00:04:18.640> to<00:04:18.700> get<00:04:18.820> a<00:04:19.060> huge<00:04:19.959> light

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
and you're going to get a huge light

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.539 
and you're going to get a huge light
source<00:04:20.470> out<00:04:20.650> of<00:04:20.739> this<00:04:20.799> instead<00:04:21.100> of<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.310> little

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
source out of this instead of the little

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.340 
source out of this instead of the little
one<00:04:21.700> inch<00:04:21.850> by<00:04:22.000> 3<00:04:22.030> inch<00:04:22.390> strip<00:04:22.750> that<00:04:23.260> we

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
one inch by 3 inch strip that we

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.320 
one inch by 3 inch strip that we
normally<00:04:23.470> have<00:04:23.850> we're<00:04:24.850> going<00:04:24.940> to<00:04:25.000> end<00:04:25.180> up<00:04:25.270> with

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
normally have we're going to end up with

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.150 
normally have we're going to end up with
about<00:04:25.480> of<00:04:25.750> 8<00:04:25.900> by<00:04:26.050> 10<00:04:26.230> inch<00:04:26.440> light<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:26.950> I<00:04:26.980> can

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
about of 8 by 10 inch light and I can

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.710 
about of 8 by 10 inch light and I can
just<00:04:27.280> I<00:04:27.520> can<00:04:27.760> bring<00:04:27.940> this<00:04:28.060> in<00:04:28.240> from<00:04:28.390> anywhere<00:04:28.660> I

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
just I can bring this in from anywhere I

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.110 
just I can bring this in from anywhere I
want<00:04:28.930> to<00:04:29.050> so<00:04:29.260> I'm<00:04:29.919> going<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.130> replicate<00:04:30.940> the

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
want to so I'm going to replicate the

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.630 
want to so I'm going to replicate the
light<00:04:31.690> that's<00:04:31.870> actually<00:04:32.320> here<00:04:32.620> so<00:04:33.280> it<00:04:33.370> kind<00:04:33.580> of

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
light that's actually here so it kind of

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.430 
light that's actually here so it kind of
simulates<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.180> direction<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:35.020> light<00:04:35.050> really

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
simulates the direction the light really

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.750 
simulates the direction the light really
would<00:04:35.560> be<00:04:35.680> coming<00:04:35.919> from<00:04:36.070> and<00:04:36.340> it<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.520> closer

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
would be coming from and it the closer

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.120 
would be coming from and it the closer
and<00:04:37.000> I<00:04:37.030> get<00:04:37.210> it<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:37.450> the<00:04:37.570> tree<00:04:38.260> the<00:04:38.440> stronger

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
and I get it to the tree the stronger

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.620 
and I get it to the tree the stronger
the<00:04:39.220> contrast<00:04:39.700> is<00:04:39.850> going<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.030> be<00:04:40.120> so<00:04:40.330> let's<00:04:40.450> try

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
the contrast is going to be so let's try

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
the contrast is going to be so let's try
that<00:04:43.950> we<00:04:44.950> come<00:04:45.130> in<00:04:45.250> and<00:04:46.110> just<00:04:47.110> kind<00:04:47.350> of<00:04:47.410> back

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
that we come in and just kind of back

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.050 
that we come in and just kind of back
like<00:04:47.890> this<00:04:48.070> side<00:04:48.400> of<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.610> tree<00:04:48.820> where<00:04:48.970> the

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
like this side of the tree where the

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.120 
like this side of the tree where the
green<00:04:49.240> moss<00:04:49.510> kind<00:04:49.900> of<00:04:49.990> blends<00:04:50.740> right<00:04:50.950> into

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
green moss kind of blends right into

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.420 
green moss kind of blends right into
that<00:04:51.310> reddish<00:04:51.820> reddish<00:04:52.330> part<00:04:52.600> of<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:52.810> trunk

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
that reddish reddish part of the trunk

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.740 
that reddish reddish part of the trunk
to<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.460> further<00:04:54.820> I<00:04:54.940> put<00:04:55.120> it<00:04:55.210> back<00:04:55.390> there<00:04:55.570> the

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
to the further I put it back there the

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.200 
to the further I put it back there the
more<00:04:55.900> chance<00:04:56.410> I've<00:04:56.650> got<00:04:56.680> of<00:04:56.890> getting<00:04:57.880> lens

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
more chance I've got of getting lens

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.909 
more chance I've got of getting lens
flare<00:04:58.510> but<00:04:58.720> with<00:04:58.840> the<00:04:58.930> splint<00:04:59.350> sheet<00:04:59.590> on<00:04:59.740> here

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
flare but with the splint sheet on here

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.710 
flare but with the splint sheet on here
out<00:05:00.610> as<00:05:01.200> far<00:05:02.200> as<00:05:02.320> it<00:05:02.440> can<00:05:02.500> go<00:05:03.540> and<00:05:04.540> you<00:05:04.660> know

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
out as far as it can go and you know

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.680 
out as far as it can go and you know
pretty<00:05:05.110> much<00:05:05.169> eliminate<00:05:05.680> that<00:05:06.270> the<00:05:07.270> contrast

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
pretty much eliminate that the contrast

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.110 
pretty much eliminate that the contrast
is<00:05:07.840> much<00:05:07.990> better<00:05:08.200> I<00:05:08.410> mean<00:05:08.560> we've<00:05:08.710> been<00:05:08.830> able<00:05:08.919> to

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
is much better I mean we've been able to

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.290 
is much better I mean we've been able to
get<00:05:10.120> some<00:05:10.300> direction<00:05:10.660> to<00:05:10.720> that<00:05:10.750> light<00:05:11.020> and<00:05:12.300> see

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
get some direction to that light and see

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.240 
get some direction to that light and see
a<00:05:13.330> lot<00:05:13.600> more<00:05:13.630> detail<00:05:14.169> in<00:05:14.380> the<00:05:14.470> moss<00:05:14.620> and<00:05:14.950> detail

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
a lot more detail in the moss and detail

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.610 
a lot more detail in the moss and detail
in<00:05:15.400> that<00:05:15.660> surface<00:05:16.660> texture<00:05:17.050> that<00:05:17.169> tree<00:05:17.380> trunk

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
in that surface texture that tree trunk

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.260 
in that surface texture that tree trunk
so<00:05:17.770> it's<00:05:18.100> very<00:05:18.220> nice

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.490 

just<00:05:22.270> as<00:05:22.389> we<00:05:22.510> were<00:05:22.600> getting<00:05:22.690> ready<00:05:22.840> to<00:05:23.080> move<00:05:23.290> to

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
just as we were getting ready to move to

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.469 
just as we were getting ready to move to
another<00:05:23.680> location<00:05:23.800> I<00:05:24.430> noticed<00:05:24.970> this<00:05:25.060> raven

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
another location I noticed this raven

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.469 
another location I noticed this raven
right<00:05:25.780> near<00:05:26.020> my<00:05:26.139> SUV<00:05:26.470> I<00:05:27.090> knew<00:05:28.090> I<00:05:28.120> wanted<00:05:28.419> to

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
right near my SUV I knew I wanted to

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:29.939 
right near my SUV I knew I wanted to
shoot<00:05:28.720> it<00:05:28.840> as<00:05:28.930> tight<00:05:29.199> as<00:05:29.350> possible<00:05:29.380> without

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
shoot it as tight as possible without

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.340 
shoot it as tight as possible without
getting<00:05:30.340> into<00:05:30.490> close<00:05:30.930> so<00:05:31.930> the<00:05:32.020> only<00:05:32.169> solution

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
getting into close so the only solution

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.350 
getting into close so the only solution
was<00:05:32.650> to<00:05:32.770> switch<00:05:33.070> to<00:05:33.280> a<00:05:33.310> longer<00:05:33.669> lens<00:05:33.940> than<00:05:34.180> here

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
was to switch to a longer lens than here

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:44.850 
was to switch to a longer lens than here
i<00:05:34.389> used<00:05:34.660> the<00:05:34.810> tamron<00:05:35.199> 200<00:05:35.680> to<00:05:35.740> 500<00:05:43.590> at<00:05:44.590> 500

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
i used the tamron 200 to 500 at 500

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.770 
i used the tamron 200 to 500 at 500
millimeters<00:05:45.490> I<00:05:45.610> can<00:05:45.760> get<00:05:45.880> a<00:05:45.910> very<00:05:46.210> tight<00:05:46.479> shot

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
millimeters I can get a very tight shot

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.050 
millimeters I can get a very tight shot
of<00:05:46.810> just<00:05:47.290> his<00:05:47.440> head<00:05:47.650> and<00:05:47.830> then<00:05:48.639> zooming<00:05:48.940> back

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
of just his head and then zooming back

00:05:49.060 --> 00:06:00.730 
of just his head and then zooming back
to<00:05:49.270> 200<00:05:49.780> I<00:05:49.840> can<00:05:50.020> see<00:05:50.169> the<00:05:50.260> whole<00:05:50.350> bird

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.530 

the<00:06:01.740> Ravens<00:06:02.070> feathers<00:06:02.460> have<00:06:02.610> this<00:06:02.759> deep<00:06:03.000> kind

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
the Ravens feathers have this deep kind

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.510 
the Ravens feathers have this deep kind
of<00:06:03.600> a<00:06:03.690> purplish<00:06:04.139> sheen<00:06:04.530> to<00:06:04.560> them<00:06:04.770> that's<00:06:05.100> very

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
of a purplish sheen to them that's very

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.120 
of a purplish sheen to them that's very
dark<00:06:05.790> and<00:06:06.050> in<00:06:07.050> this<00:06:07.350> flat<00:06:07.650> lighting<00:06:08.039> it

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
dark and in this flat lighting it

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.710 
dark and in this flat lighting it
becomes<00:06:08.400> very<00:06:08.490> difficult<00:06:08.669> to<00:06:09.120> see<00:06:09.270> the<00:06:09.389> detail

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
becomes very difficult to see the detail

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.939 
becomes very difficult to see the detail
I<00:06:11.449> knew<00:06:12.449> that<00:06:12.479> by<00:06:12.690> using<00:06:12.840> a<00:06:13.050> flash<00:06:13.320> I'd<00:06:13.650> be<00:06:13.830> able

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
I knew that by using a flash I'd be able

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:16.010 
I knew that by using a flash I'd be able
to<00:06:14.070> put<00:06:14.520> more<00:06:14.639> light<00:06:14.880> onto<00:06:15.150> this<00:06:15.509> dark<00:06:15.750> subject

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
to put more light onto this dark subject

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.689 
to put more light onto this dark subject
and<00:06:16.320> reveal<00:06:16.650> some<00:06:16.889> more<00:06:17.039> detail<00:06:17.400> that<00:06:17.610> was

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 
and reveal some more detail that was

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:20.600 
and reveal some more detail that was
there<00:06:17.880> but<00:06:18.419> the<00:06:18.479> low<00:06:19.440> power<00:06:19.710> of<00:06:19.979> my<00:06:20.100> on<00:06:20.250> camera

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
there but the low power of my on camera

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.340 
there but the low power of my on camera
flash<00:06:20.820> wasn't<00:06:21.210> sufficient<00:06:21.720> to<00:06:21.840> throw<00:06:22.199> this

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350 
flash wasn't sufficient to throw this

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.379 
flash wasn't sufficient to throw this
distance<00:06:22.770> and<00:06:22.919> to<00:06:23.520> light<00:06:23.729> up<00:06:23.880> such<00:06:24.090> a<00:06:24.120> dark

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:24.389 
distance and to light up such a dark

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:26.170 
distance and to light up such a dark
bird<00:06:24.600> so<00:06:24.900> I'm<00:06:24.990> using<00:06:25.169> a<00:06:25.259> flash<00:06:25.470> extender<00:06:25.979> which

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
bird so I'm using a flash extender which

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.340 
bird so I'm using a flash extender which
concentrates<00:06:27.180> the<00:06:27.300> beam<00:06:27.570> and<00:06:27.810> throws<00:06:28.110> a<00:06:28.169> lot

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
concentrates the beam and throws a lot

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.450 
concentrates the beam and throws a lot
more<00:06:28.560> light<00:06:28.740> out<00:06:28.770> there<00:06:29.070> and<00:06:29.160> that<00:06:29.250> way<00:06:29.340> it's

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
more light out there and that way it's

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.100 
more light out there and that way it's
going<00:06:29.580> to<00:06:29.669> be<00:06:29.850> able<00:06:30.030> to<00:06:30.120> light<00:06:30.750> him<00:06:30.900> up<00:06:30.990> and

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
going to be able to light him up and
