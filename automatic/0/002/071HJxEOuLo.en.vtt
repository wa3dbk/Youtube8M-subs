00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.420
 this morning the architects of the sixth 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.400
 Fiery championship trained 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.320
 open door so he had the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.480
 opportunity to reconnect with your 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.039
 hobby who filled it with ovations and 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.170
 screams especially at players like 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.869
 Matías Britos Mauro Boselli and himself 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.940
 Captain Rafael Marquez but to practice 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.830
 the defense nacho gonzález and johnny 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.810
 magallón spoke precisely of what 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.910
 is the achievement obtained the season 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.320
 previous and what will come for the team 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.809
 of the lion emeralds in this 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.910
 closing 2014 where they accept that 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.010
 they will have a short preseason but that 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.170
 it will not be a pretext to give a good 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.730
 championship and endorse what is the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.890
 title listen to the words of the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.739
 lion players and well he's going to 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.300
 have a greater responsibility we know 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.660
 that the Leonese team is a team of 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.489
 great and as good as 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.149
 we repositioned where it should have always been 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.129
 and that's a major commitment since 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.140
 is a big team physically the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.890
 team 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.830
 no no there is no pretext for 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.440
 nothing I think the holidays were 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.780
 to rest were few days like 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.090
 to lose so much in so little time already 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.340
 in your mind in having the bicampeonato if 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.490
 sure you have to think big you have to 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.090
 go thinking step by step obviously but 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.960
 we must respect the condition that we are 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.520
 the champions one year one year than what 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.009
 the player wants is the constancy and 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.770
 thank God I had it 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.479
 it is not easy the best to see having 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.670
 so many minutes and more than anything because one 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.190
 is exposed to take citation to give a 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.680
 lesson some tactical change what is 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.410
 may require but hey that's still 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.270
 a personal satisfaction plus the joined 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.179
 to which we get everything as 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.390
 team for m dot com.mx francisco 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.390
