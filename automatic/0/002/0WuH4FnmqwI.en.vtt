00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
today is right underneath the scalp so

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.740 
today is right underneath the scalp so
when<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:37.580> push<00:01:37.760> on<00:01:37.909> it<00:01:38.060> crosses<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.540> all<00:01:38.659> the

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
when you push on it crosses to all the

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.670 
when you push on it crosses to all the
suture<00:01:38.960> lines<00:01:39.110> you<00:01:39.170> can<00:01:39.200> actually<00:01:39.380> move<00:01:39.590> it

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
suture lines you can actually move it

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.740 
suture lines you can actually move it
around<00:01:39.770> move<00:01:40.580> it<00:01:40.729> around<00:01:40.850> that's<00:01:41.540> how<00:01:41.690> you

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
around move it around that's how you

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.120 
around move it around that's how you
know<00:01:41.990> it's<00:01:42.320> right<00:01:42.530> underneath<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:42.860> scalp

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
know it's right underneath the scalp

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.400 
know it's right underneath the scalp
simply<00:01:44.030> hematomas<00:01:44.510> are<00:01:44.600> underneath<00:01:44.870> the<00:01:44.930> bone

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
simply hematomas are underneath the bone

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.930 
simply hematomas are underneath the bone
so<00:01:46.040> that's<00:01:46.160> why<00:01:46.250> I<00:01:46.280> cannot<00:01:46.520> cross<00:01:46.760> through

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
so that's why I cannot cross through

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.910 
so that's why I cannot cross through
July<00:01:47.210> because<00:01:47.900> I<00:01:48.050> bones<00:01:48.229> all<00:01:48.410> right<00:01:48.560> over<00:01:48.800> each

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
July because I bones all right over each

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.210 
July because I bones all right over each
other<00:01:50.050> again<00:01:51.050> they'll<00:01:51.229> describe<00:01:51.590> it<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.100> got

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
other again they'll describe it you got

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.560 
other again they'll describe it you got
to<00:01:52.310> know<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:52.490> diagnosis<00:01:53.150> but<00:01:53.300> you<00:01:53.420> got<00:01:53.540> to

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
to know the diagnosis but you got to

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.969 
to know the diagnosis but you got to
know<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:53.810> Lupe's<00:01:54.170> information<00:01:54.619> separates

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
know the Lupe's information separates

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.710 
know the Lupe's information separates
the<00:01:55.040> two<00:01:55.100> them<00:01:55.310> out<00:01:55.430> because<00:01:56.150> otherwise<00:01:56.450> they

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
the two them out because otherwise they

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.270 
the two them out because otherwise they
look<00:01:56.900> alike<00:01:57.140> when<00:01:57.350> you<00:01:57.440> see<00:01:57.650> look<00:01:57.950> at<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:58.130> head

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
look alike when you see look at the head

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.520

syphilis so if you see this nasal bone
is<00:02:33.950> gone<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.430> it<00:02:34.520> looks<00:02:34.670> like<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.790> saddle

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
is gone and it looks like a saddle

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.200 
is gone and it looks like a saddle
that's<00:02:37.010> what<00:02:37.190> they<00:02:37.280> mean<00:02:37.370> us<00:02:37.550> out<00:02:37.850> of<00:02:38.000> nose

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
that's what they mean us out of nose

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.640 
that's what they mean us out of nose
then<00:02:38.570> you<00:02:38.660> gotta<00:02:38.840> think<00:02:38.900> about<00:02:39.050> neonatal

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
then you gotta think about neonatal

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.410 
then you gotta think about neonatal
syphilis<00:02:40.150> okay<00:02:42.580> then<00:02:43.580> you<00:02:43.730> take<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:43.970> look<00:02:44.240> at

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
syphilis okay then you take a look at

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:52.900 
syphilis okay then you take a look at
the<00:02:44.630> maxilla<00:02:45.320> cleft<00:02:46.310> lip<00:02:46.520> and<00:02:46.550> palate<00:02:51.910> they'd

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
the maxilla cleft lip and palate they'd

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.860 
the maxilla cleft lip and palate they'd
love<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.120> make<00:02:53.360> these<00:02:53.570> embryo<00:02:54.080> questions<00:02:54.710> okay

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
love to make these embryo questions okay

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.020 
love to make these embryo questions okay
cleft<00:02:56.870> palate<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.920> means<00:02:58.190> he<00:02:58.670> open<00:02:58.880> up<00:02:58.940> your

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
cleft palate it means he open up your

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.610 
cleft palate it means he open up your
mouth<00:02:59.150> look<00:02:59.390> all<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.600> way<00:02:59.630> back<00:02:59.840> because<00:03:00.500> it

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
mouth look all the way back because it

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.380 
mouth look all the way back because it
could<00:03:00.710> be<00:03:00.740> mild<00:03:00.980> way<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.220> back<00:03:01.460> is<00:03:01.640> when<00:03:02.270> the

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
could be mild way to back is when the

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.010 
could be mild way to back is when the
maxilla<00:03:02.810> shelves<00:03:03.470> did<00:03:04.160> not<00:03:04.400> fuse<00:03:05.020> cleft

otherwise remember did not grow can go

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.450 
otherwise remember did not grow can go
with<00:04:49.990> any<00:04:50.080> chromosome<00:04:50.650> problem<00:04:51.010> so<00:04:51.190> it's

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
with any chromosome problem so it's

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.550 
with any chromosome problem so it's
those<00:04:52.060> combinations<00:04:52.540> that<00:04:52.900> can<00:04:53.050> be<00:04:53.290> helpful

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
those combinations that can be helpful

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.490 
those combinations that can be helpful

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
but cleft lip palate by themselves are

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.930 
but cleft lip palate by themselves are
usually<00:04:56.710> just<00:04:56.830> sporadic<00:04:57.310> mutations<00:04:59.940> yeah

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
usually just sporadic mutations yeah

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.450 
usually just sporadic mutations yeah
yeah<00:05:01.840> yeah<00:05:02.140> it's<00:05:02.290> multifactorial<00:05:02.830> it<00:05:03.280> just

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
yeah yeah it's multifactorial it just

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.030 
yeah yeah it's multifactorial it just
happens<00:05:03.790> piranha<00:05:04.150> CLE<00:05:04.390> alright<00:05:05.320> so<00:05:05.620> to
