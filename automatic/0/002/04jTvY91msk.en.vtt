00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.390 
section of your router and you're one to
board<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.370> pores<00:02:31.870> 8602<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.380> make<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:33.830> protocol

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
board the pores 8602 and make a protocol

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.820 
board the pores 8602 and make a protocol
UDP<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:37.010> want<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.250> forward<00:02:37.489> it<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:38.830> your

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
UDP and you want to forward it to your

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.050 
UDP and you want to forward it to your
ipv4<00:02:40.450> address<00:02:42.040> so<00:02:43.040> forward<00:02:43.519> it<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:43.670> your<00:02:43.730> ipv4

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
ipv4 address so forward it to your ipv4

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.790 
ipv4 address so forward it to your ipv4
address<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.050> then<00:02:45.380> you're<00:02:45.500> going<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.650> make

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
address and then you're going to make

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.729 
address and then you're going to make
another<00:02:46.100> pull<00:02:46.400> forward<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:47.390> 86<00:02:47.930> or<00:02:48.050> two<00:02:48.200> again

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
another pull forward to 86 or two again

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:56.309 
another pull forward to 86 or two again
and<00:02:49.989> I'm<00:02:50.989> this<00:02:51.590> time<00:02:51.860> make<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.910> protocol<00:02:54.550> tcp

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
and I'm this time make the protocol tcp

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.160 
and I'm this time make the protocol tcp
again<00:02:57.319> your<00:02:57.530> ipv4<00:02:57.830> address<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:59.170> that's

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
again your ipv4 address and that's

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.530 
again your ipv4 address and that's
basically<00:03:00.500> it<00:03:00.920> how<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.430> setup<00:03:01.730> xbc<00:03:02.300> and

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
basically it how to setup xbc and

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.930 
basically it how to setup xbc and
forward<00:03:02.840> your<00:03:02.870> ports<00:03:03.260> so<00:03:03.860> i<00:03:04.160> hope<00:03:04.519> this<00:03:04.730> video

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
forward your ports so i hope this video

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:13.840 
forward your ports so i hope this video
helped<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:06.459> see<00:03:07.459> your<00:03:07.610> peace
