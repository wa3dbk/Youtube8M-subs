bump<00:00:18.359> they've<00:00:18.840> added<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.350> force<00:00:19.650> touch

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
bump they've added a force touch

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.620 
bump they've added a force touch
trackpad<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.580> they've<00:00:21.119> changed<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
trackpad and they've changed the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.840 
trackpad and they've changed the
manufacturer<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.769> dedicated<00:00:23.250> video<00:00:23.580> card

so because it's not a major overhaul of
the<00:00:26.580> system<00:00:26.730> I'm<00:00:27.300> not<00:00:27.660> going<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.840> do<00:00:27.900> one<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.080> my

standard<00:00:54.090> stuff<00:00:55.760> when<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.789> first<00:00:57.030> looked<00:00:57.239> into

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
standard stuff when I first looked into

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.849 
standard stuff when I first looked into
picking<00:00:57.690> up<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.020> retina<00:00:58.320> MacBooks

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
picking up one of the retina MacBooks

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.830 
picking up one of the retina MacBooks
the<00:00:59.280> form<00:00:59.550> factor<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> 13-inch<00:01:00.570> was

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
the form factor of the 13-inch was

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.599 
the form factor of the 13-inch was
really<00:01:01.170> appealing<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.800> 15-inch<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.399> quite<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
really appealing the 15-inch is quite a

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.130 
really appealing the 15-inch is quite a
bit<00:01:02.760> bigger<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.570> obviously<00:01:03.899> more

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
bit bigger and it's obviously more

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.050 
bit bigger and it's obviously more
expensive<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.769> if<00:01:05.339> you're<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> student<00:01:05.760> or

expensive and if you're a student or

someone who brings their notebook around
a<00:01:07.470> lot<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.890> know<00:01:08.010> different<00:01:08.430> places<00:01:08.490> each

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
a lot so you know different places each

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.820 
a lot so you know different places each
day<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.119> use<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.869> 15-inch<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.530> be<00:01:10.619> kind<00:01:10.799> of

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
day to use the 15-inch can be kind of

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.200 
day to use the 15-inch can be kind of
daunting<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.460> really<00:01:11.729> wanted<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.000> stay

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
daunting and I really wanted to stay

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.820 
daunting and I really wanted to stay
away<00:01:12.390> from<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.320> other<00:01:13.439> thing<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.799> that

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
away from it the other thing is that

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.440 
away from it the other thing is that
when<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.130> hold<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.490> 13-inch<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.060> one<00:01:15.180> hand

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
when you hold the 13-inch in one hand

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.510 
when you hold the 13-inch in one hand
and<00:01:15.720> like<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.170> side<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:17.009> doesn't<00:01:17.250> feel

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
and like on one side it doesn't feel

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.920 
and like on one side it doesn't feel
like<00:01:17.640> I'm<00:01:17.759> putting<00:01:18.030> stress<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.750> notebook

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
like I'm putting stress on the notebook

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.840 
like I'm putting stress on the notebook
casing<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.860> feels<00:01:20.009> pretty<00:01:20.280> balanced<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.790> you

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
casing it feels pretty balanced and you

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.980 
casing it feels pretty balanced and you
can<00:01:20.970> kind<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.210> sling<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.540> around<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.930> a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
can kind of sling it around like a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.170 
can kind of sling it around like a
textbook<00:01:22.380> but<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> 15-inch<00:01:23.700> because<00:01:24.090> of

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
textbook but on the 15-inch because of

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.060 
textbook but on the 15-inch because of
its<00:01:24.330> extra<00:01:24.630> weight<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.840> extra<00:01:25.290> length<00:01:25.530> it

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
its extra weight and extra length it

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.440 
its extra weight and extra length it
feels<00:01:26.369> like<00:01:26.549> you're<00:01:26.670> putting<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.180> bit<00:01:27.360> of

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
feels like you're putting a bit of

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.390 
feels like you're putting a bit of
pressure<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:28.049> bit<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.560> uncomfortable<00:01:29.220> pressure

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
pressure a bit of uncomfortable pressure

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.460 
pressure a bit of uncomfortable pressure
on<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.909> bottom<00:01:30.090> casing<00:01:30.570> now<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.140> concerned

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
on the bottom casing now is concerned

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.740 
on the bottom casing now is concerned
about<00:01:31.619> damaging<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:33.060> fragility

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
about damaging it and just fragility

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.880 
about damaging it and just fragility
isn't<00:01:34.140> something<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.500> want<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.710> deal<00:01:34.860> with

isn't something you want to deal with
for<00:01:35.460> your<00:01:35.520> daily<00:01:35.820> driver<00:01:36.030> but<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.930> end<00:01:37.079> I

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
for your daily driver but in the end I

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.140 
for your daily driver but in the end I
went<00:01:37.560> with<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> 15-inch<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:39.000> been

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
went with the 15-inch and it's been

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.580 
went with the 15-inch and it's been
through<00:01:39.390> some<00:01:39.689> bumps<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.079> bangs<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.500> I've

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
through some bumps and bangs and I've

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.140 
through some bumps and bangs and I've
even<00:01:40.680> dropped<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.189> couple<00:01:41.400> times<00:01:41.610> with<00:01:41.909> no

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
even dropped it a couple times with no

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.120 
even dropped it a couple times with no
issues<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.810> just<00:01:43.350> from<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> perspective<00:01:44.040> of

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
issues so just from the perspective of

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.219 
issues so just from the perspective of
the<00:01:44.280> size<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.759> notebooks<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.600> 15-inch<00:01:46.049> is

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
the size of the notebooks the 15-inch is

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.109 
the size of the notebooks the 15-inch is
probably<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:46.860> as<00:01:47.009> robust<00:01:47.340> as<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.700> 13-inch

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
probably just as robust as the 13-inch

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.510 
probably just as robust as the 13-inch
and<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.750> personally<00:01:49.439> quickly<00:01:49.950> got<00:01:50.070> used<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.369> its

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
and I personally quickly got used to its

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.200 
and I personally quickly got used to its
size<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:50.790> weight<00:01:51.119> for<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:53.159> mid-2015<00:01:53.640> lineup

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
the 15-inch processor speeds have been

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.980 
the 15-inch processor speeds have been
bumped<00:01:56.250> up<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.430> bit<00:01:56.579> drive<00:01:57.210> speeds<00:01:57.479> are<00:01:57.600> faster

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
bumped up a bit drive speeds are faster

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.749 
bumped up a bit drive speeds are faster
but<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.500> headliner<00:01:58.799> features<00:01:59.189> are<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.549> for

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
but the headliner features are the for

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.520 
but the headliner features are the for
such<00:02:00.000> trackpad<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.840> new<00:02:01.020> discreet

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.260 
such trackpad and a new discreet
graphics<00:02:01.710> card<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.640> let's<00:02:02.670> take<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> look<00:02:03.119> at

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
graphics card so let's take a look at

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.969 
graphics card so let's take a look at
the<00:02:03.360> drive<00:02:03.600> speeds<00:02:03.899> here<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.409> mid-2014

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
the drive speeds here the mid-2014

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.039 
the drive speeds here the mid-2014
models<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.759> left

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
models on the left

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.510 
models on the left
and<00:02:06.140> you<00:02:06.409> can<00:02:06.530> see<00:02:06.710> that<00:02:06.920> it's<00:02:07.070> coming<00:02:07.340> around

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
and you can see that it's coming around

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.279 
and you can see that it's coming around
like<00:02:07.759> six<00:02:08.060> seven<00:02:08.330> hundred<00:02:08.450> read<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.110> write

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
like six seven hundred read and write

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.860 
like six seven hundred read and write
and<00:02:09.470> that's<00:02:10.099> pretty<00:02:10.220> fast<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:11.300> mid-2015

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
and that's pretty fast and the mid-2015

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.509 
and that's pretty fast and the mid-2015
versions<00:02:12.470> on<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.620> right<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.250> can<00:02:13.370> see

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
versions on the right and you can see

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:14.650 
versions on the right and you can see
that<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.730> read<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:13.940> write<00:02:14.209> speeds<00:02:14.360> are

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
that the read and write speeds are

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.540 
that the read and write speeds are
around<00:02:14.900> fifteen<00:02:15.290> hundred<00:02:15.319> so<00:02:16.040> that's<00:02:16.220> really

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
around fifteen hundred so that's really

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.820 
around fifteen hundred so that's really
fast<00:02:16.879> but<00:02:17.660> I<00:02:17.870> have<00:02:18.050> an<00:02:18.140> example<00:02:18.440> here<00:02:18.709> with

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
fast but I have an example here with

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.500 
fast but I have an example here with
multiple<00:02:19.310> layers<00:02:19.459> of<00:02:19.640> video<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.239> scrub

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
multiple layers of video to scrub

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.330 
multiple layers of video to scrub
through<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:20.840> this<00:02:21.260> is<00:02:21.440> very<00:02:21.680> dependent<00:02:22.010> on

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
through and this is very dependent on

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.059 
through and this is very dependent on
drive<00:02:22.640> speeds<00:02:22.940> on<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.510> 2014<00:02:24.200> MacBook<00:02:24.379> with

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
drive speeds on the 2014 MacBook with

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.619 
drive speeds on the 2014 MacBook with
the<00:02:25.190> slower<00:02:25.430> drive<00:02:25.730> speeds<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.239> can<00:02:26.269> see<00:02:26.540> I'm

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
the slower drive speeds you can see I'm

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.809 
the slower drive speeds you can see I'm
dropping<00:02:27.019> frames<00:02:27.290> but<00:02:27.830> on<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.040> 2015<00:02:28.489> version

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
dropping frames but on the 2015 version

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.789 
dropping frames but on the 2015 version
with<00:02:29.150> faster<00:02:29.540> drive<00:02:29.780> speeds<00:02:30.049> I'm<00:02:30.290> still

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
with faster drive speeds I'm still

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.410 
with faster drive speeds I'm still
dropping<00:02:31.099> frames<00:02:31.400> it's<00:02:31.760> not<00:02:31.940> because<00:02:32.239> of<00:02:32.330> the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
dropping frames it's not because of the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.150 
dropping frames it's not because of the
drive<00:02:32.660> speed<00:02:32.959> though<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.379> processing<00:02:33.950> just

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
drive speed though the processing just

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.920 
drive speed though the processing just
can't<00:02:34.340> keep<00:02:34.519> up<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.330> it's<00:02:35.480> nice<00:02:35.629> to<00:02:35.690> have

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
can't keep up so it's nice to have

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.750 
can't keep up so it's nice to have
faster<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:36.650> faster<00:02:36.799> drive<00:02:37.220> speeds<00:02:37.549> but

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
faster and faster drive speeds but

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.580 
faster and faster drive speeds but
there's<00:02:37.970> very<00:02:38.209> few<00:02:38.360> applications<00:02:39.290> that<00:02:39.440> can

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
there's very few applications that can

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.110 
there's very few applications that can
really<00:02:39.860> take<00:02:40.099> advantage<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:40.700> something<00:02:40.910> like

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
really take advantage of something like

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.120 
really take advantage of something like
this<00:02:41.239> on<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.510> notebook<00:02:41.750> boot<00:02:42.650> times<00:02:42.890> are<00:02:43.010> also

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
this on a notebook boot times are also

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.339 
this on a notebook boot times are also
pretty<00:02:43.489> similar<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:43.880> 2015<00:02:44.780> version<00:02:44.989> is

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
pretty similar the 2015 version is

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.500 
pretty similar the 2015 version is
slightly<00:02:45.650> faster<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:50.030> force<00:02:50.239> touch<00:02:50.450> trackpad

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
slightly faster the force touch trackpad

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.420 
slightly faster the force touch trackpad
is<00:02:51.140> pretty<00:02:51.410> solid<00:02:51.590> I've<00:02:51.799> been<00:02:51.920> using<00:02:52.069> it<00:02:52.250> for<00:02:52.280> a

the<00:03:08.660> more<00:03:08.870> interesting<00:03:09.290> change<00:03:09.530> though<00:03:09.709> is

the more interesting change though is

the new discreet video card this year
it's<00:03:12.019> an<00:03:12.109> AMD<00:03:12.380> M<00:03:12.680> 370<00:03:13.459> X<00:03:13.609> which<00:03:14.000> can<00:03:14.030> push<00:03:14.389> out

5k<00:03:15.109> resolution<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:15.889> is<00:03:16.040> presumably<00:03:16.579> a<00:03:16.670> better

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
depending on the game it's like a 10-15

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.349 
depending on the game it's like a 10-15
percent<00:04:20.010> improvement<00:04:20.400> in<00:04:20.730> frame<00:04:20.970> rates<00:04:21.150> and

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
percent improvement in frame rates and

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.360 
percent improvement in frame rates and
in<00:04:21.450> some<00:04:21.660> games<00:04:21.930> it's<00:04:22.169> less<00:04:22.440> than<00:04:22.620> 5%<00:04:22.830> it's

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
in some games it's less than 5% it's

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.190 
in some games it's less than 5% it's
certainly<00:04:23.669> not<00:04:23.820> a<00:04:23.880> big<00:04:24.210> improvement<00:04:24.540> so<00:04:24.930> when

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
certainly not a big improvement so when

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.629 
certainly not a big improvement so when
you<00:04:25.260> kind<00:04:25.380> of<00:04:25.500> look<00:04:25.560> only<00:04:25.919> at<00:04:26.310> gaming

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740

more<00:04:39.780> boring<00:04:40.050> graphs<00:04:40.320> so<00:04:40.530> this<00:04:40.710> time<00:04:40.979> shorter

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
more boring graphs so this time shorter

is<00:04:41.610> better<00:04:41.820> because<00:04:42.000> we're<00:04:42.300> measuring<00:04:42.450> time

expecting<00:05:50.370> the<00:05:50.400> same<00:05:50.610> here<00:05:50.970> but<00:05:51.180> on<00:05:51.419> the<00:05:51.540> 15

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870

longer<00:05:53.760> I<00:05:53.850> got<00:05:54.030> about<00:05:54.120> eight<00:05:54.389> and<00:05:54.419> a<00:05:54.570> half

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
longer I got about eight and a half

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.570

I<00:06:12.150> was<00:06:12.330> expecting<00:06:12.900> the<00:06:13.080> m3<00:06:13.590> 70<00:06:13.919> X<00:06:14.100> to<00:06:14.340> run<00:06:14.520> a

I was expecting the m3 70 X to run a

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.900 
little hot because it's based on older

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.620 

unlike<00:06:25.740> the<00:06:25.889> 13-inch<00:06:26.310> MacBook<00:06:26.550> the<00:06:27.120> fan<00:06:27.419> noise

unlike the 13-inch MacBook the fan noise

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.330 
unlike the 13-inch MacBook the fan noise
is<00:06:27.840> pretty<00:06:28.050> similar<00:06:28.289> between<00:06:28.500> the<00:06:28.800> base<00:06:28.979> model

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
is pretty similar between the base model

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.340 
is pretty similar between the base model
and<00:06:29.520> one<00:06:29.880> with<00:06:30.000> discrete<00:06:30.360> graphics<00:06:30.539> it's<00:06:31.229> a

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
and one with discrete graphics it's a

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.779 
and one with discrete graphics it's a
little<00:06:31.560> bit<00:06:31.650> louder<00:06:31.830> than<00:06:31.949> the<00:06:32.160> fans<00:06:32.430> from<00:06:32.639> the

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789 
little bit louder than the fans from the

little bit louder than the fans from the
2014<00:06:33.389> models<00:06:33.690> but<00:06:33.900> overall<00:06:34.260> they're<00:06:34.440> not<00:06:34.560> bad

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
2014 models but overall they're not bad

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.330 
2014 models but overall they're not bad
I've<00:06:36.810> always<00:06:37.110> felt<00:06:37.289> that<00:06:37.440> the<00:06:37.740> 13-inch

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
I've always felt that the 13-inch

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.219 
I've always felt that the 13-inch
MacBook<00:06:38.520> Pros<00:06:39.000> were<00:06:39.180> reasonably<00:06:39.780> priced<00:06:40.050> I

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:40.229 
MacBook Pros were reasonably priced I

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:41.719 
MacBook Pros were reasonably priced I
mean<00:06:40.350> they<00:06:40.470> started<00:06:40.830> 1,300<00:06:41.400> bucks

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729 
mean they started 1,300 bucks

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:43.310 
mean they started 1,300 bucks
and<00:06:41.850> you<00:06:42.030> can<00:06:42.150> get<00:06:42.270> some<00:06:42.419> good<00:06:42.630> tech<00:06:42.900> in<00:06:43.139> an

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
and you can get some good tech in an

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.170 
and you can get some good tech in an
incredibly<00:06:43.800> well-built<00:06:44.190> package<00:06:44.729> but

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
incredibly well-built package but

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.120 
incredibly well-built package but
there's<00:06:45.330> a<00:06:45.389> big<00:06:45.720> drop<00:06:45.960> in<00:06:46.020> value<00:06:46.320> going<00:06:46.740> up<00:06:47.010> to

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
there's a big drop in value going up to

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.250 
there's a big drop in value going up to
the<00:06:47.220> 15-inch<00:06:47.669> it<00:06:47.910> starts<00:06:48.210> at<00:06:48.330> $2,000<00:06:49.020> for<00:06:49.199> the

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:11.820 
base models are pretty good so the

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.670 
base models are pretty good so the
15-inch<00:07:12.240> MacBook<00:07:12.360> Pro<00:07:12.930> is<00:07:13.110> a<00:07:13.139> device<00:07:13.410> that's

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 
15-inch MacBook Pro is a device that's

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.350 
15-inch MacBook Pro is a device that's
obviously<00:07:14.070> not<00:07:14.310> for<00:07:14.490> everyone<00:07:14.880> the<00:07:15.120> base

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 
obviously not for everyone the base

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.210 
obviously not for everyone the base
model<00:07:15.750> is<00:07:15.780> expensive<00:07:16.289> and<00:07:16.440> once<00:07:16.919> you<00:07:17.039> upgrade

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 
model is expensive and once you upgrade

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.250 
model is expensive and once you upgrade
it<00:07:17.520> it's<00:07:17.669> very<00:07:18.030> expensive<00:07:18.630> but<00:07:19.050> if<00:07:19.169> you're

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.260 
it it's very expensive but if you're

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.659 
it it's very expensive but if you're
really<00:07:19.470> intent<00:07:19.800> on<00:07:19.919> getting<00:07:20.190> this<00:07:20.310> I<00:07:20.490> would

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:20.669 
really intent on getting this I would

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:22.580 
really intent on getting this I would
take<00:07:20.820> a<00:07:20.849> look<00:07:21.030> at<00:07:21.210> the<00:07:21.330> 2014<00:07:22.020> edition<00:07:22.139> because

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:22.590 
take a look at the 2014 edition because

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.920 
take a look at the 2014 edition because
it's<00:07:23.400> significantly<00:07:24.030> cheaper<00:07:24.270> right<00:07:24.539> now<00:07:24.720> and

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:24.930 
it's significantly cheaper right now and

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.960 
it's significantly cheaper right now and
has<00:07:25.289> very<00:07:25.530> similar<00:07:25.830> performance<00:07:26.070> but<00:07:26.820> that's

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:26.970 
has very similar performance but that's

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:27.890 
has very similar performance but that's
the<00:07:27.060> end<00:07:27.150> of<00:07:27.210> the<00:07:27.270> review<00:07:27.360> I<00:07:27.479> hope<00:07:27.630> you<00:07:27.780> guys
