00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
thing is with these types is I gotta be

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.680 
thing is with these types is I gotta be
spearhead<00:00:51.809> okay<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:53.070> got<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> spearhead

spearhead okay so that got a spearhead

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.990 
spearhead okay so that got a spearhead
so<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.649> mean<00:00:56.070> if<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.430> use<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.789> to

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
so that I mean if you use this to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.119 
so that I mean if you use this to
regular<00:00:57.329> tip<00:00:57.510> darts<00:00:57.840> there's<00:00:58.649> just<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
regular tip darts there's just a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.410 
regular tip darts there's just a
circular<00:00:59.730> cylinder<00:01:00.180> type<00:01:02.120> then<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.149> slide

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
circular cylinder type then we slide

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.640 
circular cylinder type then we slide
right<00:01:03.629> back<00:01:03.660> out<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.110> fish<00:01:04.260> after<00:01:04.470> you

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
right back out of the fish after you

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.800 
right back out of the fish after you
shoot<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.450> you're<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.659> need

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
shoot it so you're going to need

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.380 
shoot it so you're going to need
spearheads<00:01:07.200> um<00:01:07.490> you<00:01:08.490> also<00:01:08.700> need<00:01:09.000> superglue

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
spearheads um you also need superglue

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.580 
spearheads um you also need superglue
that's<00:01:10.020> probably<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.990> most<00:01:13.140> needed<00:01:13.380> thing

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
that's probably the most needed thing

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.870 
that's probably the most needed thing
and<00:01:15.229> like<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.380> said<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.920> don't<00:01:17.340> think<00:01:17.490> super<00:01:17.759> glue

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
and like I said I don't think super glue

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.719 
and like I said I don't think super glue
would<00:01:17.939> be<00:01:18.119> able<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.360> hold<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.570> back<00:01:18.659> so

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
would be able to hold it back so

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.440 
would be able to hold it back so
probably<00:01:20.729> going<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.000> want<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.180> stick<00:01:21.390> with

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
probably going to want to stick with

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.350 
probably going to want to stick with
shooting<00:01:21.810> blue<00:01:22.049> gum<00:01:22.259> stuff<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.549> mean<00:01:24.299> these

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
shooting blue gum stuff so I mean these

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.690 
shooting blue gum stuff so I mean these
are<00:01:24.509> really<00:01:24.810> really<00:01:25.200> easy<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.590> make<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:26.009> you

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
are really really easy to make I you

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.170 

that's<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.979> one<00:01:41.189> little<00:01:41.400> drop<00:01:41.640> right<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
top so I need and then find that hole

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.510 
top so I need and then find that hole
that<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:48.439> push<00:01:49.439> down<00:01:49.470> there<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.100> go<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.430> like

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520

side by side um yep maybe that's your

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:58.290 
side by side um yep maybe that's your
dart<00:06:55.869> for<00:06:56.050> you<00:06:56.520> just<00:06:57.520> got<00:06:57.639> to<00:06:57.729> superglue<00:06:57.999> and

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:58.300 
dart for you just got to superglue and

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.450 
dart for you just got to superglue and
then<00:06:58.479> tie<00:06:58.719> it<00:06:58.749> on<00:06:58.990> there<00:06:59.199> whatever<00:07:00.159> not<00:07:00.339> you

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:00.460 
then tie it on there whatever not you

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.429 
then tie it on there whatever not you
guys<00:07:00.639> would<00:07:00.819> like<00:07:00.999> make<00:07:01.809> sure<00:07:01.959> you<00:07:02.020> tie<00:07:02.379> it

00:07:02.429 --> 00:07:02.439 
guys would like make sure you tie it

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:05.959 
guys would like make sure you tie it
down<00:07:02.949> there<00:07:03.669> not<00:07:04.360> way<00:07:04.629> down<00:07:04.659> here<00:07:05.199> around<00:07:05.379> this

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:05.969 
down there not way down here around this

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:08.119 
down there not way down here around this
thing<00:07:06.969> you<00:07:07.149> don't<00:07:07.270> know<00:07:07.419> what<00:07:07.539> it's<00:07:07.689> called

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:08.129 
thing you don't know what it's called

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:12.600 
thing you don't know what it's called
cuz<00:07:09.129> then<00:07:09.339> these<00:07:09.819> things<00:07:10.059> fold<00:07:10.689> back<00:07:10.930> and<00:07:11.610> it

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:12.610 
cuz then these things fold back and it

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.619 
cuz then these things fold back and it
could<00:07:12.789> come<00:07:12.999> off<00:07:14.189> so<00:07:15.189> tie<00:07:16.059> it<00:07:16.119> right<00:07:16.330> here

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:16.629 
could come off so tie it right here

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:18.529 
could come off so tie it right here
unless<00:07:16.869> like<00:07:17.050> superglue<00:07:17.409> is<00:07:17.499> there<00:07:17.649> so<00:07:17.800> this

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 
unless like superglue is there so this

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:20.519 
unless like superglue is there so this
piece<00:07:19.539> right<00:07:19.719> here<00:07:19.779> I<00:07:19.930> don't<00:07:20.050> know<00:07:20.259> what<00:07:20.409> it's

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:20.529 
piece right here I don't know what it's

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:22.980 
piece right here I don't know what it's
called<00:07:21.270> fletching<00:07:22.270> I<00:07:22.360> guess<00:07:22.569> that's<00:07:22.749> what<00:07:22.869> you

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990 
called fletching I guess that's what you

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.839 
called fletching I guess that's what you
call<00:07:23.169> an<00:07:23.259> arrow<00:07:23.499> with<00:07:23.770> that's<00:07:24.459> what<00:07:24.580> you<00:07:24.699> would

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:24.849 
call an arrow with that's what you would

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:26.129 
call an arrow with that's what you would
call<00:07:24.969> the<00:07:25.029> feathers<00:07:25.360> over<00:07:25.479> here<00:07:25.689> I<00:07:25.779> guess<00:07:25.990> this

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:26.139 
call the feathers over here I guess this

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:28.980 
call the feathers over here I guess this
is<00:07:26.259> the<00:07:26.379> feathers<00:07:26.680> on<00:07:26.800> the<00:07:26.889> dart<00:07:27.449> so<00:07:28.449> that

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:28.990 
is the feathers on the dart so that

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.959 
is the feathers on the dart so that
doesn't<00:07:29.229> come<00:07:29.469> off<00:07:29.619> alright<00:07:30.339> that's<00:07:30.669> all<00:07:30.849> you

doesn't come off alright that's all you
need<00:07:31.119> to<00:07:31.180> superglue<00:07:31.479> for<00:07:31.830> very<00:07:32.830> easy<00:07:32.889> to<00:07:33.249> make

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:33.959 
need to superglue for very easy to make

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:36.600 
need to superglue for very easy to make
