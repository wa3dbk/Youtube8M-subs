00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.520
 the primary colors are those that 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.759
 you can not get it with the mixture of 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.939
 no color traditionally red 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.949
 yellow and blue are considered as 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.739
 primary colors and we can 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:39.190
 recognize in nature for example 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.350
 in flowers or animals for 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.949
 understand how colors are produced 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.870
 we will make a chromatic rose first 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.120
 you have to make a circle 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.150
 you can use something from your house as a 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.760
 dish to do it then divide it into 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.479
 six equal parts and pints 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.989
 intercalary a red triangle another 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:04.170
 yellow and the last blue I eat 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.510
 we said are the primary colors 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.330
 then you have to mix blue and 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.270
 yellow in equal proportions and 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.640
 you will thus obtain the green color with which 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.680
 you have to paint the space in between 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.020
 of blue and yellow 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.570
 you have to do the same with red and 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.270
 yellow to get the orange and 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.440
 finally the red with the blue for 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.350
 get the purple 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.410
 we have seen then as the red 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.420
 yellow and blue drift into the rest of 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.230
 the colors of the mixture of two 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.050
 primary we get a secondary now 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.210
 let's see how with the continuous mixing of 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.060
 the three primary colors will go 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.020
 appearing the range of colors in a 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.330
 circle we put blue yellow and red and 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.360
 we are mixing the 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.210
 in this way the rest are appearing 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.030
 of the range of colors we can also 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.820
 account for almost one half of the circle 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.250
 we have the cold colors and towards the 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.850
 another half appear warm colors 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.400
 if we mix the three primary colors 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.850
 these will result in black 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.700
 which is the absence of light in practice 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.460
 and without measuring instruments we will 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.580
 give a very dark color that does not reach 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.490
 be black the dutch artist piet 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.730
 Mondrian based his work on the use of 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.120
 most basic elements the straight line and 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.819
 the primary colors 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.420
 these elements were the essence of the 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:44.489
 nature a different example would be the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.650
 of the French paul paul bogan born in 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.080
 1848 who used the primary colors 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.230
 as opposed to the colors 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.739
 the side which together 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.440
 enhance its intensity thus achieved 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:02.680
 represent the colorful forts of the 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.900
 exotic landscapes that he painted we can 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.959
 see clearly the color that is 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.629
 produces by putting the green grass next to 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.480
 red river colors found 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:17.040
 opposites in our chromatic rose and that 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:21.670
 we will call complementary red and green 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.370
 blue and orange and yellow and violet in 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.459
 the gauguin paintings we can see how 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.530
 they always combine to know the 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.930
 working of the colors is going to 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.030
 help to work with them you 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.829
 We recommend doing the exercise of 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.829
 chromatic rose by itself
