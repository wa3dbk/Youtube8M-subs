so<00:00:12.780> what<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.200> audio<00:00:13.950> clarity<00:00:14.360> idea<00:00:15.360> clarity<00:00:15.809> is

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
so what is audio clarity idea clarity is

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.410 
so what is audio clarity idea clarity is
a<00:00:16.049> liquid<00:00:16.980> that's<00:00:17.340> derived<00:00:17.670> from<00:00:17.940> volcanic

the<00:00:39.360> water<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.320> ever<00:00:40.469> heard<00:00:40.710> about<00:00:41.510> emo<00:00:42.510> toes

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
the water so ever heard about emo toes

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.380 
the water so ever heard about emo toes
of<00:00:43.110> research<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.950> water<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.850> hex<00:00:45.180> and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
of research and water on the hex and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.930 
of research and water on the hex and
hexagonal<00:00:46.079> shape<00:00:46.410> crystal<00:00:47.129> that's<00:00:47.640> what<00:00:47.820> it

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
hexagonal shape crystal that's what it

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.099 
hexagonal shape crystal that's what it
creates<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:49.079> water

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.740 

so<00:00:57.109> how<00:00:57.350> do<00:00:57.410> you<00:00:57.559> actually<00:00:57.710> use<00:00:58.309> idea<00:00:59.300> clarity

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
so how do you actually use idea clarity

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.490 
so how do you actually use idea clarity
