performing robotic surgery I discovered

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.740 
performing robotic surgery I discovered
recently<00:01:01.800> what<00:01:02.670> property<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> clot<00:01:03.510> which

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
recently what property of the clot which

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.020 
recently what property of the clot which
stops<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> bleeding<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.700> very

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
stops the bleeding and this is very

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.109 
stops the bleeding and this is very
exciting<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.930> love<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.560> use<00:01:08.189> artificial<00:01:08.760> heart

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
exciting I love I use artificial heart

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.880 
exciting I love I use artificial heart

of life this is a complete arterial
simulator<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.670> did<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> case<00:01:15.210> where<00:01:15.689> we

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
simulator we just did a case where we

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.080 
simulator we just did a case where we
did<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.590> procedure<00:01:16.770> before<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.790> was<00:01:17.909> done

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
did the procedure before it was done

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.789 
did the procedure before it was done
really<00:01:18.479> under<00:01:18.720> patient<00:01:19.110> things<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.500> we<00:01:19.590> do

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
really under patient things that we do

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.920 
really under patient things that we do
at<00:01:20.040> engineering<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.850> biology<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.750> can

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
at engineering in biology we can

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.600 
at engineering in biology we can
immediately<00:01:22.140> connect<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.280> school<00:01:23.580> of

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
immediately connect to the school of

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.969 
immediately connect to the school of
medicine<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> hospital<00:01:25.409> itself<00:01:25.770> I

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
medicine and to the hospital itself I

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.230 
medicine and to the hospital itself I
think<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.490> something<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.790> everybody

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
think this is something that everybody

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.609 
think this is something that everybody
wants<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.049> if<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.229> look<00:01:28.350> at<00:01:28.500> other

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
wants to do so if you look at other

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.810 
wants to do so if you look at other
centers<00:01:28.829> they<00:01:29.130> want<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.460> do

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
centers they want to do

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.070 
centers they want to do
but<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.060> don't<00:01:30.270> really<00:01:30.480> think<00:01:30.630> they<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:31.050> the

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
but I don't really think they have the

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.320 
but I don't really think they have the
human<00:01:31.500> capital<00:01:32.010> to<00:01:32.100> get<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.370> done<00:01:32.550> this<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.120> an

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
human capital to get it done this is an

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.960 
human capital to get it done this is an
incredibly<00:01:33.990> interactive<00:01:34.920> environment<00:01:35.760> you

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
incredibly interactive environment you

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.100 
incredibly interactive environment you
have<00:01:36.000> something<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.510> learn<00:01:36.630> from<00:01:36.690> all<00:01:37.080> of

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
have something to learn from all of

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.810 
have something to learn from all of
these<00:01:37.320> people<00:01:37.710> that's<00:01:38.160> what's<00:01:38.400> really<00:01:38.550> cool

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
these people that's what's really cool

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.420 
these people that's what's really cool
we're<00:01:39.510> here<00:01:39.810> really<00:01:40.290> trying<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.680> improve<00:01:41.100> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
we're here really trying to improve the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.340 
we're here really trying to improve the
practice<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.910> medicine<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.750> opportunity

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
practice of medicine the opportunity

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.370 
practice of medicine the opportunity
here<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.590> endless<00:01:44.010> I<00:01:44.280> really<00:01:45.180> feel<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.780> we

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
here is endless I really feel that we

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.380 
here is endless I really feel that we
make<00:01:47.160> a<00:01:47.190> difference<00:01:47.610> there's<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.060> sense<00:01:48.270> of

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
make a difference there's a sense of

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.600 
make a difference there's a sense of
excitement<00:01:48.720> here<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.470> think<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.979> be<00:01:50.130> cutting

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
excitement here I think to be cutting

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.640 
excitement here I think to be cutting
edge<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.150> need<00:01:51.300> to<00:01:51.450> be<00:01:51.570> learning<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.320> need<00:01:52.500> to

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
edge you need to be learning you need to
