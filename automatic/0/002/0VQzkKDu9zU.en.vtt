00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
okay guys out in the shop here showing

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.310 
okay guys out in the shop here showing
the<00:00:05.359> vector<00:00:06.359> z<00:00:06.899> VG<00:00:07.519> a<00:00:08.519> phony<00:00:09.150> quantum<00:00:09.929> machine

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
the vector z VG a phony quantum machine

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.089 
the vector z VG a phony quantum machine
we<00:00:11.160> started<00:00:11.490> out<00:00:11.610> with<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:12.230> gravatar<00:00:13.230> cabinet

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
we started out with a gravatar cabinet

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.849 
we started out with a gravatar cabinet
that<00:00:14.700> was<00:00:14.849> gutted<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:16.080> someone<00:00:16.619> has<00:00:16.710> already

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
that was gutted and someone has already

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.939 
that was gutted and someone has already
taken<00:00:17.190> all<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.720> stuff<00:00:18.720> out<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.439> so

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
taken all the stuff out of it and so

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.279 
taken all the stuff out of it and so
thanks<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.400> guys<00:00:21.150> who<00:00:21.420> reproduced<00:00:21.840> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
thanks to guys who reproduced the

thing<00:00:30.240> holds<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> glass<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.890> can<00:00:32.250> make

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
thing holds the glass we can make

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.330 
thing holds the glass we can make
ourselves<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:33.270> little<00:00:33.440> bit<00:00:34.440> quantum<00:00:34.890> going<00:00:35.160> on

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
ourselves a little bit quantum going on

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.970 
ourselves a little bit quantum going on
here<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.329> come<00:00:36.750> around<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.079> back<00:00:37.260> kind<00:00:37.920> of

door<00:00:45.379> zvg<00:00:46.820> luckily<00:00:47.820> i<00:00:47.910> had<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> spare<00:00:48.660> vector

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
door zvg luckily i had a spare vector

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.240 
door zvg luckily i had a spare vector
power<00:00:49.710> brick<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.460> then<00:00:50.489> we've<00:00:51.449> got<00:00:51.480> our

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
power brick and then we've got our

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.220 
power brick and then we've got our
crappy<00:00:53.250> old<00:00:53.370> laptop<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.270> runs<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.079> whole

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
crappy old laptop that runs the whole

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.930 
crappy old laptop that runs the whole
thing<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.989> windows<00:00:57.989> version<00:00:58.620> of

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
thing and this is the windows version of

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:10.720 
thing and this is the windows version of
vector<00:00:59.940> main

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.790 

so<00:01:11.730> let's<00:01:12.120> let's<00:01:12.810> turn<00:01:13.080> off<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.410> light<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
so let's let's turn off the light and

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:21.350 
so let's let's turn off the light and
see<00:01:14.220> how<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.550> please<00:01:19.910> one<00:01:20.910> thing<00:01:21.150> you'll

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
see how it please one thing you'll

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.930 
see how it please one thing you'll
notice<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:22.170> flickers<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.800> bit<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.520> I'm<00:01:23.610> trying

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
notice it flickers a bit so I'm trying

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.690 
notice it flickers a bit so I'm trying
to<00:01:24.090> figure<00:01:24.330> out<00:01:24.570> what's<00:01:24.780> going<00:01:24.870> on<00:01:25.200> there<00:01:25.700> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
to figure out what's going on there the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.520 
to figure out what's going on there the
busier<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.210> screen<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.840> more<00:01:28.050> flickering

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
busier the screen the more flickering

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.670 
busier the screen the more flickering
hit<00:01:28.740> you'll<00:01:29.490> see<00:01:29.760> it<00:01:29.880> mostly<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.350> high

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
hit you'll see it mostly in the high

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:47.010 
hit you'll see it mostly in the high
schooler<00:01:32.100> screen

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.080 

so<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.649> game<00:01:47.799> plays<00:01:48.100> nice<00:01:48.460> and<00:01:48.729> smooth<00:01:48.939> I've

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
so the game plays nice and smooth I've

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.200 
so the game plays nice and smooth I've
actually<00:01:49.270> sped<00:01:49.840> it<00:01:49.960> up<00:01:50.079> to<00:01:50.409> 2x<00:01:51.280> speed<00:01:51.549> and<00:01:52.000> it

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
actually sped it up to 2x speed and it

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.450 
actually sped it up to 2x speed and it
still<00:01:52.479> worked<00:01:52.810> just<00:01:53.079> fine<00:01:53.369> actually<00:01:54.369> the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
still worked just fine actually the

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.300 
still worked just fine actually the
flicker<00:01:54.729> was<00:01:55.000> a<00:01:55.030> little<00:01:55.360> less<00:01:55.990> then<00:01:56.409> so<00:01:56.770> trying

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
flicker was a little less then so trying

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.300 
flicker was a little less then so trying
to<00:01:57.340> figure<00:01:57.640> out<00:01:57.700> what<00:01:57.850> that's<00:01:58.060> all<00:01:58.240> about

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
to figure out what that's all about

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.919 
to figure out what that's all about
hopefully<00:02:00.310> this<00:02:00.460> video<00:02:00.640> can<00:02:01.240> show<00:02:01.509> this<00:02:01.780> is

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
hopefully this video can show this is

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.350 
hopefully this video can show this is
probably<00:02:02.170> about<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.619> worst<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.939> screen

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
probably about the worst that screen

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.180 
probably about the worst that screen
right<00:02:04.569> there<00:02:04.600> so<00:02:05.200> let's<00:02:05.590> play<00:02:07.860> I'll<00:02:08.860> go<00:02:09.640> to

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
right there so let's play I'll go to

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.920 
right there so let's play I'll go to
further<00:02:12.190> screens<00:02:12.819> a<00:02:13.060> lot<00:02:13.269> of<00:02:13.390> stuff<00:02:13.660> on<00:02:13.900> this

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
further screens a lot of stuff on this

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:28.810 
further screens a lot of stuff on this
and<00:02:14.650> see<00:02:14.860> how<00:02:14.890> it's<00:02:15.280> out<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.670> place

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:03:06.260 

I'm<00:02:29.820> making<00:02:30.030> my<00:02:30.560> sector<00:02:31.560> zbg<00:02:33.200> video

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:42.650 

Oh

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:04:00.290 

Oh

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:43.890 

Oh

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.300 

and<00:04:44.900> there<00:04:45.050> you<00:04:45.140> go<00:04:45.200> I<00:04:45.500> don't<00:04:45.920> think<00:04:46.100> there's<00:04:46.250> a

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
and there you go I don't think there's a

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.890 
and there you go I don't think there's a
lot<00:04:46.430> of<00:04:46.460> these<00:04:46.610> things<00:04:46.670> out<00:04:47.270> there<00:04:47.540> actually

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
lot of these things out there actually

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.300 
lot of these things out there actually
working<00:04:48.500> so<00:04:48.710> figured<00:04:49.670> I'd<00:04:49.850> show<00:04:50.000> you<00:04:50.030> mine
