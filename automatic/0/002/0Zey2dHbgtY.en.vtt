hey god get it this channel here ah

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.910 
hey god get it this channel here ah
today<00:00:03.270> we're<00:00:03.510> going<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.659> be<00:00:03.780> testing<00:00:04.230> your<00:00:04.380> ph

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
today we're going to be testing your ph

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.190 
today we're going to be testing your ph
and<00:00:05.569> ammonia<00:00:06.569> water<00:00:07.080> levels<00:00:08.030> so<00:00:09.030> first<00:00:10.019> you

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
and ammonia water levels so first you

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.400 
and ammonia water levels so first you
need<00:00:10.469> an<00:00:10.830> API<00:00:11.190> master<00:00:11.730> test<00:00:11.969> kit<00:00:12.269> or<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.259> can

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
need an API master test kit or you can

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.010 
need an API master test kit or you can
buy<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.620> separate<00:00:14.340> boxes<00:00:14.820> at<00:00:15.269> any<00:00:15.599> pistol

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
buy the separate boxes at any pistol

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:53.779 
buy the separate boxes at any pistol
pretty<00:00:16.320> much<00:00:18.980> everything<00:00:50.629> okay<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:53.190> here's

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
pretty much everything okay so here's

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:03.200 
pretty much everything okay so here's
the<00:00:53.850> pH<00:00:55.309> go<00:00:56.309> 6.0<00:00:57.590> 6.4<00:00:58.789> 2.6<00:00:59.789> all<00:01:00.059> F<00:01:00.239> 7.6<00:01:02.210> mounting

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the pH go 6.0 6.4 2.6 all F 7.6 mounting

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.510 
the pH go 6.0 6.4 2.6 all F 7.6 mounting
it<00:01:03.270> goes<00:01:03.480> up<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.840> 8.0<00:01:04.530> way<00:01:05.250> too<00:01:05.309> much<00:01:06.110> so<00:01:07.520> you

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
it goes up to 8.0 way too much so you

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.640 
it goes up to 8.0 way too much so you
want<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.820> open<00:01:09.030> your<00:01:09.210> fish<00:01:09.420> tank<00:01:11.510> the<00:01:12.510> pH<00:01:12.840> you

want to open your fish tank the pH you
pretty<00:01:13.890> much<00:01:14.600> want<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.689> take<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.990> test<00:01:16.170> tube

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
pretty much want to take the test tube

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.390 
pretty much want to take the test tube
get<00:01:17.369> through<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.640> off<00:01:18.530> what<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.890> I'll

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
to add three drops of the pH test

00:01:51.040 --> 00:02:06.330 
to add three drops of the pH test
solution

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.119 

put<00:02:06.789> the<00:02:06.880> cap<00:02:07.060> back<00:02:07.090> on<00:02:07.709> and<00:02:08.789> shake<00:02:09.789> it<00:02:11.129> shake

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
put the cap back on and shake it shake

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:31.790 
put the cap back on and shake it shake
it<00:02:12.190> for<00:02:12.400> about<00:02:12.629> 10-20<00:02:13.629> second

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.320 

and<00:02:32.970> here<00:02:33.970> we<00:02:34.120> are<00:02:35.340> first<00:02:36.340> let<00:02:36.520> it<00:02:36.610> sit<00:02:36.910> about<00:02:37.300> a

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
and here we are first let it sit about a

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:49.980 
and here we are first let it sit about a
minute<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:40.690> i'll<00:02:40.810> just<00:02:40.840> let<00:02:41.080> us<00:02:41.200> hear

7.4 oz endpoint pigs and you want to
take<00:03:15.130> what's<00:03:15.880> in<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.570> test<00:03:16.780> tube<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:21.060> might

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
take what's in the test tube I might

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.760 
take what's in the test tube I might
dump<00:03:22.270> it<00:03:22.450> out<00:03:22.570> do<00:03:22.840> not<00:03:23.020> let<00:03:23.170> this<00:03:23.350> touch<00:03:23.560> your

hands at all and you don't bh now pretty

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.300 
hands at all and you don't bh now pretty
much<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:56.320> same<00:03:56.410> thing<00:03:58.530> let's<00:03:59.530> then<00:03:59.830> test<00:04:00.070> tube

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
much the same thing let's then test tube

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:18.810 
much the same thing let's then test tube
or<00:04:01.590> underwater

first<00:05:43.800> of<00:05:43.889> all<00:05:43.919> to<00:05:44.009> sit<00:05:44.189> for<00:05:44.219> five<00:05:44.520> minutes<00:05:46.849> and

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:48.379 
first of all to sit for five minutes and

first of all to sit for five minutes and
already<00:05:49.379> fit<00:05:50.219> five<00:05:50.490> minutes<00:05:53.210> okay<00:05:54.210> spend<00:05:54.810> five

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
already fit five minutes okay spend five

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.670 
already fit five minutes okay spend five
minutes

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:08.890 

let's<00:05:59.680> compare

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:15.110 

so<00:06:09.440> that's<00:06:09.560> about

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.280 

0<00:06:15.990> 2<00:06:16.650> 5<00:06:17.190> or<00:06:17.580> 0<00:06:17.610> it<00:06:18.270> looks<00:06:18.419> like<00:06:18.570> it's<00:06:18.690> 02<00:06:19.139> me<00:06:19.260> I

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
0 2 5 or 0 it looks like it's 02 me I

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24.890 
0 2 5 or 0 it looks like it's 02 me I
can't<00:06:19.650> retail<00:06:22.790> that's<00:06:23.790> it<00:06:23.940> looks<00:06:24.120> like<00:06:24.330> so
