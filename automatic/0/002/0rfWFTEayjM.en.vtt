00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.140
 The people today Thursday are here. 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.990
 for another safari channel program 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.580
 with my sister here in the marsh I'm 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.950
 l is with the point coordinator biologist and 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.900
 of the project a safari that we are 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.250
 here under the famous tree of the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.560
 hope this area is well known magri 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.990
 our social media was still the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.180
 enough on our channel 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.220
 facebook on our blog and now let's go 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.399
 make a program here on our channel on 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.980
 youtube he that you can speak of this 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.260
 tree then it's about love blindness in 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.420
 her backpacker she is a tree 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.940
 well old jazz as you can see the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.460
 her caliber is very thick is very high 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.200
 so she is not a young tree and she 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.079
 Provides shade for all the bicharada 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.170
 here in the woods then when there 's a sun 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.120
 very very violent in middle sun nuke 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.039
 We have closed the day. 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.859
 using this parasol that delicious 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.420
 and take advantage of the substrate in the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.969
 shade that it produces 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.670
 we also got to see that it is very 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.909
 good 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.820
 I love you, I cut the detail, I do not know the reason. 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.650
 But she knows it's all legal. 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.350
 people it is known that once the 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.479
 people were looking for the hope that 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.970
 It's a dance first time I started to 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.500
 work on the safari project and we 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.030
 I was walking around here not 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.610
 I managed to find her suddenly someone 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.420
 He looked up and saw that she was 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.490
 lying down, looking at us, it is 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.210
 a very interesting fact that told me 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.890
 nobody knows why they are young in the tree 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.470
 we had to try to compare one 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.929
 little with the leopard that is a bug 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.860
 a similar service is not a movie 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:43.960
 of africa 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.479
 only that my party has reasons to 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.280
 left on the tree to take the prey 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.860
 He stripped the born it has several 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.750
 competitors such as lyon hyenas who 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.270
 would steal a nightmare 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.819
 have any theory of it because it rises in 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.920
 tree farm 11 does not have 50 editors 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.170
 so I wanted an apparent reason for 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.580
 up or that there are some theories to 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.520
 first of all she just feels so 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.869
 pleasure finding it loud then instead of it 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.280
 relaxing in the lower part of it 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.010
 simply choose a trunk that 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.900
 hold weight 0 and stay relaxed 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.440
 there is another theory that says that in 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.450
 what mosquitoes they have down there and this 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.920
 this first galaxy where there is only one sleeps 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.260
 It's about ten feet from 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.359
 then there is this theory that 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.040
 the mosquitoes of a very uncomfortable 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:29.290
 I could not even sleep. 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.970
 quiet without bothering to native tab 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.630
 just in time 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.100
 The water then they have this theory, right? 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.130
 incidentally is pretty comfortable already emerged 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.320
 several times in this area is one of the few 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.010
 They are very comfortable for the other. 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.470
 to relax 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.100
 We have a 24-hour camera in this 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.810
 this tree has seen several bugs using 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.390
 this same key as only a few examples 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.520
 We bunch of animals. We have the ounce. 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.220
 painted with three ounces 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.140
 invest here hope nature tronche 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.910
 do not see picture of some candles 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.580
 lately has appeared much more 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.450
 time has but it appears that everything looks like a 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.580
 monkey nail strip many birds and everything 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.520
 Visiting world knows of its smell 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.500
 there and they miss the glands and leave 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.630
 a smell of smoke and here comes the jaguar and 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.260
 let her smell is not good either 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.670
 cool 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.190
 cool this here was a great find 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.320
 Oz project for people has discovered 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.580
 several things in terms of behavior 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.800
 we 've already had sightings here 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.040
 in this tree of hope ounce 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.440
 especially so it is a place that the 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.300
 people like rather try to bring is the 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.540
