really<00:00:43.350> cool<00:00:43.590> except<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.460> one<00:00:44.640> actually<00:00:44.730> has

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
really cool except this one actually has

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.459 
really cool except this one actually has
two<00:00:45.180> spikes<00:00:45.539> rather<00:00:45.840> than<00:00:45.930> breaking<00:00:46.230> apart

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
two spikes rather than breaking apart

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.200 
two spikes rather than breaking apart
and<00:00:46.890> they<00:00:47.190> might<00:00:47.340> be<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> reason<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> two

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
and they might be a reason for the two

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.900 
and they might be a reason for the two
spikes<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.719> don't<00:00:49.289> know<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:49.620> basically<00:00:50.100> this

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
spikes I don't know but basically this

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.189 
spikes I don't know but basically this
source<00:00:51.210> actually<00:00:51.539> comes<00:00:51.690> from<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.989> website

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
source actually comes from a website

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.229 
source actually comes from a website
called<00:00:52.620> kotak<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.460> don't<00:00:53.699> actually<00:00:53.879> know<00:00:54.210> I

haven't<00:00:55.500> used<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.710> website<00:00:56.160> before<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:57.120> I

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
haven't used this website before but I

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.760 
haven't used this website before but I
viewed<00:00:57.360> as<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.570> really<00:00:57.809> big<00:00:57.930> gaming<00:00:58.289> website<00:00:58.620> so

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
viewed as a really big gaming website so

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.349 
viewed as a really big gaming website so
most<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.129> probably<00:00:59.190> heard<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.940> anyway

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
most of you probably heard of it anyway

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.970 
most of you probably heard of it anyway
so<00:01:00.750> basically<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.260> website<00:01:01.590> has<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.770> lot<00:01:01.949> of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
so basically on the website has a lot of

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.470 
so basically on the website has a lot of
screenshots<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.850> game<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.300> lot<00:01:03.420> of

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
screenshots of this game and a lot of

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.210 
screenshots of this game and a lot of
information<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> game<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.799> obviously<00:01:05.159> a

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
information on the game so obviously a

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.200 
information on the game so obviously a
link<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.580> will<00:01:05.790> be<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> description

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
link to that will be in the description

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.410 
link to that will be in the description
below<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> article<00:01:08.729> actually<00:01:08.820> goes<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.270> to

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
below so the article actually goes on to

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.060 
below so the article actually goes on to
say<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.869> game<00:01:10.080> will<00:01:10.260> probably<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.830> set
