um but we knew use the shooter who can
get<00:00:58.920> hot<00:00:59.070> going<00:00:59.370> into<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.579> game<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.199> you<00:01:01.199> know

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
get hot going into the game so you know

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.340 
get hot going into the game so you know
that's<00:01:02.039> that's<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.430> us<00:01:02.690> how<00:01:03.690> discouraging<00:01:04.199> is

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
that's that's on us how discouraging is

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.719 
that's that's on us how discouraging is
it<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.589> lose<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> next<00:01:05.309> twice<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.700> think

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
it to lose to the next twice I think

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.310 
it to lose to the next twice I think
fifteen<00:01:06.299> percent<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.750> their<00:01:06.840> wins<00:01:07.080> are

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
fifteen percent of their wins are

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.429 
fifteen percent of their wins are
against<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.680> guys<00:01:08.600> uh<00:01:09.600> when<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.140> put<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.409> like

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
against you guys uh when you put it like

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.460 
against you guys uh when you put it like

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
that it's not the most encouraging stat
