 2 2 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.390
 does not mean 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.779
 the 3 4 

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.779
 3 and 4 this is dry it was without effect 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:14.459
 remembered for example that losing 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.459
 life now 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.710
 these ailments 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.470
 tarantini 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
 look 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.020
 does not exist 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.020
 since 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.720
 about if that 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.620
 now 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.310
 nothing else every day 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.630
 ayala 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.980
 until 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:14.899
 protest quintana 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:16.509
 nor lack at the end 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:19.129
 try to unify fantastic jocay 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.699
 for this term 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:24.379
 still missing the adventures of a year later 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.779
 this mess 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:32.650
 before I got too much that point that was wrong to track you had a 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:34.779
 new way 1 5 zp 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.779
 and that was because the track was not hand 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:40.269
 opencor 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.150
 this all you want to buy something because I think you should be welcome 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.859
 academy 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:49.419
 after giving thanks for not being loved and dresses for management 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:50.830
 fernandez February 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.249
 I am happy happy to light the twins t 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:59.359
 but they did not achieve the ninth london it was not revealed that since 2009 they have become 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.260
 on stage we do not want anything gray 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.359
 because but now he has done a good job outside his territory 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:09.200
 that detail is very bad this but good no matter what else was very 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:13.469
 well with force a moment are they detect that and the look the movement and to ask 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:14.880
 the other teachers but 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.870
 I do not think that 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.239
 You go with everything 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.629
 you go with everything, do not hesitate and if you make a mistake, do not take it from us, you know that the only thing 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.819
 you know the montage here of this is you and me 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.039
 the only two other teachers do not know what to ask 

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:31.069
 if you're wrong about something if you spend at the concert any 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.420
 after the season full of explosives killed a month 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.080
 with pleasure but there are in the concert do not do it because the portentosos the 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.399
 stay not everyone here I was wrong 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:45.829
 and nobody had noticed 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.859
 but I like what I'm good 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:50.460
 Flowers commented to football 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.540
 isea berton 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.810
 I really like to see you I congratulate you with all my heart I really like your voice I like it 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.840
 see I like what you're doing the box the truth that that from here to 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.479
 ahead 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:03.709
 what we are 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.249
 starting to know that we had not seen 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:09.249
 yesterday he touched him through an 8 I knew there was something there 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.309
 very good and now we are seeing brazil 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:16.549
 I'm going to live a little bit of the teachers 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.519
 because as I have always said, in terms of tastes, genres are broken 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.849
 your voice is very fine your technique is very good 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.849
 sofi nation is very good from my point of view what I heard 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.360
 but to me yes I stayed to duty in terms of kicks or have 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.590
 maybe I think that the measure 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.370
 in which one can convince more people because it could be treated not 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.770
 if many millions of people with and without breaching is a 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.770
 a great singer as the seer in this field with 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.569
 I encourage that the deductions in terms of transmission 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.550
 I repeat efe ayÃ³n advances and of course there is 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.029
 but I still missed the subject 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:06.019
 we do not have a little problem with the track because good because that was evident 

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:08.679
 then you delay the second pass
