00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.070
 sometimes you will run into situations of 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.260
 less usual handling deep sand 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.420
 dry river bed or crossing of 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.710
 creek with muddy bottom all 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.050
 these situations require techniques 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.050
 specials and precautions let's see the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.700
 carefully when approaching the point of 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.040
 entrance if you have four-wheel drive 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.190
 wheels put it and change to the minimum 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.420
 speed advancing at a steady pace 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.670
 moving faster is the key to 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.950
 soft soils rather than stir and 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.960
 probably get stuck change 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.970
 March on soft sand sometimes causes 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.050
 a rapid loss of traction and ends 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.050
 sinking the vehicle 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.770
 if it gets stuck in reverse gear if it's 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.660
 possible and try again or 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.820
 select a short gear and advance to 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.080
 slower step up the revolutions and 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.060
 spin the wheels is 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.420
 counterproductive it is most likely that 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.770
 sink more 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.600
 driving in the dunes is usually 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.120
 prohibited the damage to vegetation 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.430
 they create instability and they can have 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.710
 Negative consequences nevertheless 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.290
 could be going through dunes where yes 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.270
 is allowed this requires strong 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.930
 security measures because the dunes 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.100
 they change continuously in shape and size 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.170
 probably the area that went through without 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.490
 problems last week or even 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.409
 yesterday can be dangerous today 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.420
 some doubts like the parabolic ones 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.950
 they have a gentle slope to one side 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.950
 but on the other side there is a precipice 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.509
 If you drive in areas of dunes, have a lot 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:56.009
 Care reduce speed and drive 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.009
 within the visibility limit 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.510
 if you have to cross a river do not fan 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.670
 nothing more like that can be much more 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.160
 deeper than it looks and a bed 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.649
 very soft first drive with extreme 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.319
 walk carefully if necessary when 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.180
 go through do it with caution look 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.850
 a crossing point established as a 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.500
 ford or overpass but if there is nothing 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.860
 try to plan the best way to 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.860
 Cross 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.960
 consider the depth of the water 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.480
 how fast the condition of the 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.520
 bed is full of holes stones 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.380
 large sunken logs loose rocks 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.390
 mud or soft sand 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.520
 I also observed the entry points and 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.360
 output are very steep they are 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.340
 slippery 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.530
 in other words, do your evaluation 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.340
 on the ground once inside will be 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.340
 too late 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.250
 Go shifting your weight is the key to 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.530
 maintain balance and greater 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.660
 traction for example I would need to shake 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.900
 the atv from side to side to get it out of a 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.900
 hole 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.280
 well we have reviewed almost all notions 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:13.439
 Basics you should know and practice 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.000
 if you want to drive safely naturally 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.250
 that's not all but many things 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.170
 they belong to common sense like no 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.090
 carry passengers respect the rights 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.920
 of the owner of the land take care of the 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.930
 environment and not driving under the effects 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.939
 of alcohol or drugs 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.859
 despite the jokes that the atv are 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.689
 toys for large children are not 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.579
 can be a valuable instrument of 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.890
 work or an inexhaustible source of 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.140
 fun but ignorance lack of 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.060
 care and abuse of the ATV or of their own 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.670
 capacity could cause you many 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.349
 headaches to finish if you 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.549
 he wants to make the most of his a tve 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.439
 there is only one way to go 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.439
 intelligent handling safe handling
