00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.089
 hello then today I wanted to give you the 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.730
 reviewed the review of the dyed background 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:11.280
 revlon color stay you had me 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.230
 really recommended in the hundreds 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.670
 our joking 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.789
 every time I talked to you about mine 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.460
 skin in is a bit so problematic 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.260
 that really shines quickly 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.650
 meanwhile you advised me thief 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.570
 6 I bought it around mid-February 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.500
 I would say yes mid-February and I'm using it 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.030
 daily exactly since I have it 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 purchased then a month has never passed 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.030
 and a half 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.340
 and yet you sincerely have inside 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.460
 I don't know how much because I can't 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.290
 understand it yet if it has anyway 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.200
 I think about two months with one 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.020
 small bottle of the genus containing 30 ml 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.610
 so it can't last me an eternity 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.860
 considered closed every day then 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.010
 meanwhile I bought it from water and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.960
 I paid 15 euros for soap and 95 then 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.370
 16 euros but in all places 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.609
 I have seen it around 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.460
 that figure 15 16 17 euros no more 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:10.409
 I took it in the shade 180 that yes 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.330
 call sand birch and I have to say yes 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.630
 really fits in well with mine 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.100
 embodied even if in any case not 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.320
 I could have taken a color 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.320
 different because from me of course 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.939
 I reiterate the 180 and the more tone from me 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.259
 clear then all the others I have 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.030
 tried however they were darker and 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.290
 so I had to make do for 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.060
 have this that has no longer clear and 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.329
 fortunately it looks a lot like mine 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.400
 sung then at this time I do not have 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.689
 my neck stay on because i am 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.040
 rigged only to make videos e 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.780
 since I consider it a very foundation 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.780
 good I really didn't want to 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.820
 waste it to touch then remove make-up between 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.619
 half an hour when I'm done then I have it 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.070
 used another however I tell you the 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.549
 durability is really exceptional like everyone 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.390
 they say it is seriously you know that mine 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.180
 skin 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.659
 in two and a half hours maximum 3 hours 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.280
 begins to manifest lucidity on everything 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.990
 face our own canton to 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.470
 an active thing on the cheeks 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.140
 absurd 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.470
 with this foundation I came to 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.070
 six hours is such hours as the ace 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.970
 indicative of time but anyway 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.830
 indeed there are days in 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.020
 school that does not aim even the 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.760
 face powder and in any case I arrive at three o'clock 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.290
 in the afternoon that I am still 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.239
 watchable so I tell you six hours with me 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.780
 average time and indicative time anyway 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:37.650
 not less than six hours but still from 6 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.750
 at 8 hours I do it without problems 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.700
 then okay if I want to be perfect if 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.010
 take pictures of me like that 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.840
 touch up the area t even if I have this 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.400
 foundation however I have to say that it is 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.860
 really an excellent result 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.290
 especially for those like me who always have 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.600
 always had this problem with all 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.269
 foundation spend this foundation is 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.840
 truly a pleasure extends 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.670
 beautifully covers instantly 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:07.170
 a lot like 60 percent of the 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.329
 problems already helps you to cover them precisely 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.870
 makes a really natural effect 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:15.780
 despite having this blanket indeed 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.280
 excellent I tell you as soon as you apply it to me 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.700
 looks like a foundation like all the 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.980
 other tall slightly light that makes 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.200
 hard to soak in reality if 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.780
 wait about a minute makes you own 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.329
 perfect skin effect 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.459
 obviously perfect in quotes though 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.989
 understand that beautiful effect that 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.500
 all we would like from a foundation no 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.750
 so really great 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.910
 it is not too dense so it faces it 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.430
 creamy and own liquid is a liquid 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.519
 just so not too watery but 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.460
 not too full-bodied is too much 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.550
 hard 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.070
 to work is obviously adjustable as 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.010
 lends the duration in the tents room 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:01.290
 to become heavy after so many hours 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.290
 that you have it on as normal as it is 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.140
 and so I also found myself 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.780
 really by God is certainly going to go to 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.820
 just buy this story again 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.780
 to finish so this was mine 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:16.090
 absolutely positive opinion there 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:20.790
 I advise if you have any serious problems 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:23.560
 skin problems shining by 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:27.040
 imperfections that you never ever get to 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.230
 cover this obviously is the one for 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.440
 I don't think there was any combination or fatty skin 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.600
 even I need to clarify it myself 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.250
 I really recommend it to you too 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.680
 as early as anyway 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.300
 acceptable above all for the fact that 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.070
 it's really good 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.760
 so I hope I told you everything 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.100
 what was there to say if you have any 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.760
 questions I recommend let me below 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.040
 in the comments 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.970
 I'll send a big kiss see you at 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.970
 next hello
