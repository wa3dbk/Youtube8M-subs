00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.710
 Day Yeah example is such a thing 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:17.390
 It is for those of today another table should be 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:20.240
 I think that I have put out a table called body language 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:26.119
 Po teagan Gage is human 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:28.000
 I do not know whether it somehow takes less than your Zonchi emotion of the body will come out to the body 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.900
 It means that 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.440
 Because you know well of course everyone's general it ends with nikko it 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:39.260
 Hey will come fun 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.219
 In a this way , if you find Ina like this , your uneasy partner is angry and threatened 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.430
 Rutsu 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:50.520
 I think that you understand that etc. generally Run from the body even in a state not well known 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.610
 Is that had you'll This is the table'm no body 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.790
 For example , I'm scratching my head 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:05.030
 What not to like this Fu I is not it written that Gaia recovery 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:07.780
 This is or are first thought to speak to the next or has been put out requests that the hand is in 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.780
 Note 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:20.210
 The fact that you are anxious now can lead to something like this 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:24.770
 So there are other things that say something on the axis as well 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.480
 It is a shame that you are moving while scratching your head 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.700
 I'm talking 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.250
 This partner will you because you supposed to be Tteyuu is Fu that another Do this story'm nasty 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.790
 It will be 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:41.909
 And I'm happy and I do not want to see the other person 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.590
 I understand this naturally and 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.440
 I try to listen as much as possible to the words of the other party while I speak, but this is also true 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:54.630
 I will lean forward 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.940
 It is a pose that you are happy or interested in this person 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.960
 And 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:04.070
 It slowly falls behind while being convinced 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:09.470
 I say this because I feel relieved 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.700
 Still a that aligned baggage is Dee language and the body language separately from the table 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.120
 Will be at hand 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:18.819
 Schedule of Villa is Shimojo table 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:23.739
 When this and edition will combine the world go by combining the I putty-axis is the vertical axis Ah is this person 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:28.890
 I understand that I am doing this kind of emotional expression 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.890
 Please use this to live a fun life for everyone
