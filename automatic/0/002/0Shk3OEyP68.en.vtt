 Go around 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.870

 How about it is cherry blossoms 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.790
 The name of such a flower may be written 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.740
 that is 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.329

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.510
 Go station 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.480
 It means that 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.880
 In the university world 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.540
 Speaking of the body of one melody that plays an instrument 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.399
 I am doing this 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.250
 In other words, this first time 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.680
 It's not going to gradually 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.880
 Gradually come and use 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.880
 It means that we will continue to play 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.990
 Then that point is 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.120
 Yes, it is said that the Ministry of Defense has been put together 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.090
 Various of that rule 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.380
 m expecting the damper to be covered, but here it is 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.340
 For example, Shiroi meat I mentioned Sakyo-ku is 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.340
 It is such unknown 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.320
 In this way this cardboard is known 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.930
 In the screen 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.730
 Looking for a signature and reviewing it 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.020
 Apply to the side of the narrative 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.749
 It will be said 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:11.749
 And one song is made 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.899
 The song on the list is for everyone 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:20.369
 Each song is about 30 minutes long 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:22.769
 Therefore 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.059
 Mr. Nazuka 42 when playing 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:30.710
 And while follicular food Nikkei is happy 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.629

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.629
 It becomes complicated very much 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:38.109
 Possible from Ebetsu 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.010
 this 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.129
 I thought that I would try again 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.230
 The teacher who taught me modern Miyao 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:48.719

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:51.850
 Stage heights that I was swimming 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.069

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.069
 Yes I made this eight year 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.109

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.549
 In reference to the upper house election 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.439
 Identify the cause and identify and write Yoshi Ito 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:12.910
 Writing a hand of love between Eric Stocker 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.910
 It is a new school style 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.509
 It's here if you say last night 

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:25.509
 There is a camellia 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:30.900
 Mr. Nagaseki 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.159
 However, I write the hand of love during 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.099
 Three pains in the pain 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.539
 Just 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:43.889
 Can hear 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.949
 If you write the expected cannon vertically, write along with the text 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.029
 Because I can put it 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.449
 very convenient 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.649
 Ashida city line rewrites such a screen and 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:58.979
 To May 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.799
 We support you 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.020
 This one is 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.869
 Station effectively 

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:06.749
