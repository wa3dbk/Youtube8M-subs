00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.720
 The editor said that we need to 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.350
 illustrators only have a face there in the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.460

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.880
 little room asked when you 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.510

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:58.440
 I thought it was very high and he said so 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.910

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.909

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.909

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:31.170
 so experience of apartment was 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:35.010

 Your mÃ¡rio I used his figure to 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.070
 I think it was also the first time 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.880
 I used a real person to create a 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.250
 character so the trustee that I created 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.080
 clearly inspired him if he wore it 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.200
 sunglasses on any occasion 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:54.730
 inside the house on the street as 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.520
 always wearing sunglasses and he will love you 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.790
 suplicy he was private investigator 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:06.220

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:09.040
 know that figure figure and it was in that 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.830

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.780
