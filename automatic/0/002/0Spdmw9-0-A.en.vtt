what do you think caused the tape to be
arranged<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.300> think<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:33.750> even<00:01:34.230> tear<00:01:34.620> your

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
arranged I think you just even tear your

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:43.100 
arranged I think you just even tear your
eyes<00:01:35.960> but<00:01:36.960> they<00:01:37.110> did<00:01:37.320> not<00:01:37.500> want<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.970> also<00:01:42.870> for

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
eyes but they did not want and also for

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.320 
eyes but they did not want and also for
Andre<00:01:43.620> it<00:01:43.830> was<00:01:44.010> true<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.730> was<00:01:44.940> the<00:01:45.090> night

Andre it was true this was the night

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.390 
Andre it was true this was the night
because<00:01:46.260> they<00:01:46.440> could<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:46.830> that

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
because they could do that

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.730 
because they could do that
