00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
it's built around a retracted that I

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.610 
it's built around a retracted that I
ordered<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.210> here<00:00:33.449> last<00:00:33.839> couple<00:00:34.170> days<00:00:34.350> it

doesn't rotate itself sore didn't have
to<00:00:36.989> modify<00:00:37.290> anything<00:00:37.680> they're<00:00:38.040> just<00:00:38.250> added<00:00:38.790> a

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
to modify anything they're just added a

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.460 
to modify anything they're just added a
couple<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.300> linkages<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.809> should<00:00:40.080> help<00:00:40.199> take

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
couple of linkages that should help take

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.869 
couple of linkages that should help take
pressure<00:00:40.769> off<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.309> main<00:00:41.460> when<00:00:41.730> its

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
pressure off of the main when its

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.500 
pressure off of the main when its
landing<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:45.290> just<00:00:46.290> basically<00:00:46.769> getting<00:00:47.190> my

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
landing and just basically getting my

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.340 
landing and just basically getting my
measurements<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.570> everything<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.140> when

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
measurements and everything so that when

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.710 
measurements and everything so that when
I<00:00:49.379> go<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.739> build<00:00:49.949> the<00:00:50.220> actual<00:00:51.119> landing<00:00:51.479> gear

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
I go and build the actual landing gear

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.840 
I go and build the actual landing gear
for<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.019> bird<00:00:52.580> we're<00:00:53.580> going<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.760> be<00:00:53.820> using

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
for the bird we're going to be using

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.820 
for the bird we're going to be using
functional<00:00:54.420> óleo<00:00:54.720> sprout<00:00:55.080> up<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.409> big<00:00:55.589> tire

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
functional óleo sprout up the big tire

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.619 
functional óleo sprout up the big tire
and<00:00:56.430> once<00:00:56.580> they<00:00:56.699> actually<00:00:56.970> you<00:00:57.210> know<00:00:57.299> measure

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
and once they actually you know measure

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.539 
and once they actually you know measure
everything<00:00:57.930> put<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.409> in<00:00:58.500> there<00:00:58.710> hopefully

00:00:59.539 --> 00:00:59.549 
everything put it in there hopefully

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:01.009 
everything put it in there hopefully
it'll<00:00:59.699> fit<00:00:59.939> and<00:01:00.059> it'll<00:01:00.269> all<00:01:00.330> work<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.869> as

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
it'll fit and it'll all work just as

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:06.469 
it'll fit and it'll all work just as
smoothly<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.710> does<00:01:01.860> out<00:01:02.070> here<00:01:05.180> get<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.210> shot

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
smoothly as it does out here get a shot

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.020 
smoothly as it does out here get a shot
of<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.750> working<00:01:07.110> with<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.760> landing<00:01:08.760> gear<00:01:08.909> in

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
of it working with the landing gear in

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:18.140 
of it working with the landing gear in
the<00:01:09.119> appropriate<00:01:09.420> position<00:01:10.140> here<00:01:12.619> we<00:01:13.619> go<00:01:17.150> nice

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
the appropriate position here we go nice

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.120 
the appropriate position here we go nice
about<00:01:18.390> these<00:01:18.540> approaches<00:01:18.780> there<00:01:19.170> he<00:01:19.500> retracts

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
about these approaches there he retracts

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.680 
about these approaches there he retracts
knees<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> little<00:01:20.580> bit<00:01:20.760> of<00:01:20.970> adjustment<00:01:21.450> to

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
knees a little bit of adjustment to

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.200 
knees a little bit of adjustment to
actually<00:01:22.050> rotate<00:01:22.500> up<00:01:22.620> the<00:01:23.040> full<00:01:23.370> 90<00:01:23.730> degrees

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
actually rotate up the full 90 degrees

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.540 
actually rotate up the full 90 degrees
like<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.290> should<00:01:25.500> see<00:01:25.680> where<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.950> wasn't

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
like I should see where it wasn't

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.330 
like I should see where it wasn't
machine<00:01:27.300> perfectly<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.260> to<00:01:28.740> be<00:01:28.890> honest<00:01:29.190> to

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
machine perfectly but to be honest to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.960 
machine perfectly but to be honest to
begin<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.850> close<00:01:30.380> it'll<00:01:31.490> show<00:01:32.490> me<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
begin to that close it'll show me the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.240 
begin to that close it'll show me the
door<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.510> f-14<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.380> will<00:01:34.500> be<00:01:34.650> it

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
door for this f-14 and it will be it

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.750 
door for this f-14 and it will be it
should<00:01:35.460> be<00:01:35.490> jealous<00:01:35.760> ponch<00:01:40.280> of<00:01:41.280> course<00:01:41.580> I've

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
should be jealous ponch of course I've

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.160 
should be jealous ponch of course I've
got<00:01:42.000> here<00:01:42.180> for<00:01:42.390> about<00:01:42.510> half<00:01:42.750> an<00:01:42.870> hour's

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
got here for about half an hour's

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.719 
got here for about half an hour's
watching<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.800> here<00:01:43.950> go<00:01:44.100> up<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.400> down<00:01:44.580> I<00:01:46.729> think

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
watching the here go up and down I think

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.310 
watching the here go up and down I think
it<00:01:47.820> should<00:01:47.940> hold<00:01:48.120> up<00:01:48.270> pretty<00:01:48.390> well<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.200> we'll

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
it should hold up pretty well so we'll

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.110 
it should hold up pretty well so we'll
get<00:01:49.440> you<00:01:49.560> guys<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> closer<00:01:49.950> shot<00:01:50.190> okay<00:01:50.790> here's<00:01:51.030> a

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
get you guys a closer shot okay here's a

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.260 
get you guys a closer shot okay here's a
close-up<00:01:51.390> shot<00:01:54.049> can<00:01:55.049> see<00:01:55.320> we've<00:01:55.500> got<00:01:56.270> there's

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
close-up shot can see we've got there's

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.320 
close-up shot can see we've got there's
that<00:01:57.450> retract<00:01:58.049> just<00:01:58.860> use<00:01:58.979> some<00:01:59.120> aluminum<00:02:00.120> tube

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
that retract just use some aluminum tube

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.570 
that retract just use some aluminum tube
that<00:02:00.510> I<00:02:00.630> had<00:02:00.840> handy<00:02:01.260> and<00:02:01.470> just<00:02:01.650> a<00:02:01.799> depron<00:02:02.280> wheel

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
that I had handy and just a depron wheel

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.270 
that I had handy and just a depron wheel
just<00:02:03.240> glued<00:02:03.510> on<00:02:03.659> there<00:02:03.690> for<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.770> side<00:02:04.950> i'm

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
just glued on there for for the side i'm

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.950 
just glued on there for for the side i'm
actually<00:02:05.460> going<00:02:05.700> about<00:02:05.970> fifteen<00:02:06.570> percent

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
actually going about fifteen percent

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.680 
actually going about fifteen percent
larger<00:02:07.290> than<00:02:07.770> what<00:02:08.009> would<00:02:08.190> be<00:02:08.250> scaled<00:02:08.909> for<00:02:09.539> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
larger than what would be scaled for the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.830 
larger than what would be scaled for the
19<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:11.340> that's<00:02:11.459> about<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.760> for<00:02:12.150> something<00:02:12.659> inch

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
19 so that's about a for something inch

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.890 
19 so that's about a for something inch
wheel<00:02:13.819> reason<00:02:14.819> being<00:02:14.849> that<00:02:15.150> i<00:02:15.330> want<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.659> make

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
wheel reason being that i want to make

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.449 
wheel reason being that i want to make
sure<00:02:15.930> since<00:02:16.379> i'm<00:02:16.470> going<00:02:16.709> pusher<00:02:16.950> prop<00:02:17.159> i<00:02:17.310> want

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
sure since i'm going pusher prop i want

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.350 
sure since i'm going pusher prop i want
to<00:02:17.519> make<00:02:17.610> sure<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.790> i'm<00:02:18.000> going<00:02:18.180> to

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
to make sure that i'm going to

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.540 
to make sure that i'm going to
the<00:02:18.570> ground<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:19.290> can<00:02:19.410> see<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.710> linkages<00:02:20.190> here

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
the ground you can see the linkages here

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.280 
the ground you can see the linkages here
right<00:02:21.000> now<00:02:21.270> they're<00:02:21.540> just<00:02:21.750> made<00:02:21.930> out<00:02:22.080> of

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
right now they're just made out of

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.090 
right now they're just made out of
threaded<00:02:23.100> rod<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.750> in<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.290> little<00:02:25.680> ball

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
threaded rod and in just the little ball

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.450 
threaded rod and in just the little ball
link<00:02:26.400> connectors<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:28.440> whole<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.650> will

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
link connectors the whole I will

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.130 
link connectors the whole I will
probably<00:02:29.970> do<00:02:30.210> basically<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.870> same<00:02:31.080> thing

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
probably do basically the same thing

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.780 
probably do basically the same thing
they<00:02:31.560> even<00:02:31.710> put<00:02:31.800> some<00:02:31.980> carbon-fiber<00:02:32.370> or

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
they even put some carbon-fiber or

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.130 
they even put some carbon-fiber or
decorate<00:02:33.240> them<00:02:33.390> up<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.600> little<00:02:33.810> bit<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.020> they

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
decorate them up a little bit so they

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.800 
decorate them up a little bit so they
look<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.410> little<00:02:34.590> bit<00:02:34.800> cooler<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.820> this<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.720> the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
look a little bit cooler but this is the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.360 
look a little bit cooler but this is the
idea<00:02:37.140> we're<00:02:37.410> just<00:02:37.560> going<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.710> have<00:02:37.920> this<00:02:38.130> main

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
idea we're just going to have this main

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.060 
idea we're just going to have this main
linkage<00:02:38.790> here<00:02:39.050> that<00:02:40.050> runs<00:02:40.350> back<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.710> will

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
linkage here that runs back and will

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.870 
linkage here that runs back and will
connect<00:02:41.430> into<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.760> fuselage<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:43.880> obviously

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
connect into the fuselage and obviously

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.060 
connect into the fuselage and obviously
the<00:02:45.030> air<00:02:46.020> in<00:02:46.110> front<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.440> airplane<00:02:46.560> is<00:02:46.860> that

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
the air in front of the airplane is that

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.520 
the air in front of the airplane is that
direction<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.120> as<00:02:48.510> its<00:02:48.750> landing

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
direction so that as its landing

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.380 
direction so that as its landing
beauties<00:02:49.920> will<00:02:50.130> actually<00:02:50.459> pull<00:02:50.700> tight<00:02:51.030> and

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
beauties will actually pull tight and

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.120 
beauties will actually pull tight and
keep<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.750> landing<00:02:52.440> gear<00:02:52.590> stress<00:02:52.950> from

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
keep the landing gear stress from

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.610 
keep the landing gear stress from
bending<00:02:53.550> backward<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.240> like<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:54.959> said<00:02:55.170> in<00:02:55.590> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
bending backward and like I said in the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.900 
bending backward and like I said in the
beginning<00:02:56.160> we're<00:02:56.489> going<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.670> be<00:02:56.760> using

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
beginning we're going to be using

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.140 
beginning we're going to be using
functional<00:02:57.390> óleo<00:02:57.690> struts<00:02:58.080> from<00:02:58.500> robart<00:02:59.150> just

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
functional óleo struts from robart just

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.090 
functional óleo struts from robart just
very<00:03:00.810> similar<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.260> ones<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:01.770> put<00:03:01.980> in

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
very similar to the ones that I put in

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.310 
very similar to the ones that I put in
the<00:03:02.220> in<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.610> front<00:03:02.970> they<00:03:03.570> won't<00:03:03.750> be<00:03:03.900> scale

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
the in the front they won't be scale

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.470 
the in the front they won't be scale
width<00:03:05.250> but<00:03:05.610> they'll<00:03:05.790> should<00:03:06.239> look<00:03:06.450> pretty

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
width but they'll should look pretty

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.320 
width but they'll should look pretty
good<00:03:06.989> so<00:03:07.590> let's<00:03:07.800> hit<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.190> hit<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.090> switch

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
good so let's hit the hit the switch

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:35.630 
good so let's hit the hit the switch
here

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.700
