I don't know name smc is the best gun in

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.100 
I don't know name smc is the best gun in
the<00:00:53.460> game<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.910> would<00:00:54.120> say<00:00:54.329> make<00:00:54.539> sure<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.809> try<00:00:55.050> it

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
the game I would say make sure to try it

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.799 
the game I would say make sure to try it
out<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:56.640> that's<00:00:56.820> what<00:00:57.030> i<00:00:57.059> was<00:00:57.210> using<00:00:57.449> facts

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
out and so that's what i was using facts

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.660 
out and so that's what i was using facts
matic<00:00:58.170> silencer<00:00:58.710> i<00:00:58.739> still<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.160> sim<00:00:59.370> text

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
matic silencer i still the sim text

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.040 
matic silencer i still the sim text
because<00:00:59.910> I<00:00:59.969> didn't<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> c-4<00:01:00.750> unlocked

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
because I didn't have the c-4 unlocked

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.709 
because I didn't have the c-4 unlocked
yet<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:02.219> that's<00:01:02.489> why<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.789> was<00:01:02.969> using<00:01:03.180> all<00:01:03.480> that

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
yet but that's why I was using all that

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.719 
yet but that's why I was using all that
and<00:01:04.670> so<00:01:05.670> what<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.570> want<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.990> talk<00:01:07.260> about<00:01:07.580> for<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
and so what I want to talk about for the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.640 
and so what I want to talk about for the
very<00:01:08.939> beginning<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:11.600> what<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.810> guys<00:01:12.990> think

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
very beginning is what you guys think

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.510 
very beginning is what you guys think
the<00:01:14.369> best<00:01:14.610> gun<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> game<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.450> now<00:01:16.520> because

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the best gun in the game is now because

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.520 
the best gun in the game is now because
I<00:01:18.030> don't<00:01:18.990> know<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.500> changed<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.280> lot<00:01:20.549> recently

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
I don't know it's changed a lot recently

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.859 
I don't know it's changed a lot recently
after<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> patch<00:01:22.799> basically<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:24.330> what<00:01:24.570> I

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
after the patch basically to what I

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.570 
after the patch basically to what I
believe<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> best<00:01:25.590> gun<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.369> why<00:01:26.549> i

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
believe is the best gun and why i

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.410 
believe is the best gun and why i
believe<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:28.290> MSMC<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.909> gun<00:01:30.210> that's

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
believe the MSMC is the gun that's

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.340 
believe the MSMC is the gun that's
reigning<00:01:30.840> supreme<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.500> far<00:01:31.939> and<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.570> yeah

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
reigning supreme so far and so yeah

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.020 
reigning supreme so far and so yeah
let's<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:34.710> get<00:01:34.860> into<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:36.090> PDW<00:01:37.079> it

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
let's just get into that the PDW it

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.429 
let's just get into that the PDW it
almost<00:01:39.030> feels<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.450> they<00:01:39.869> said<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.290> they

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
almost feels like they said that they

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.649 
almost feels like they said that they
reduced<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.310> made<00:01:41.610> all<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.210> machine<00:01:42.509> guns

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
reduced and made all the so machine guns

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.710 
reduced and made all the so machine guns
worse<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.470> almost<00:01:43.740> feels<00:01:44.070> like<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:45.060> MSMC<00:01:45.479> is

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
worse it almost feels like the MSMC is

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.240 
worse it almost feels like the MSMC is
better<00:01:45.990> now<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.610> PDW<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.450> worse<00:01:48.890> like<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
better now and the PDW is worse like the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.600 
better now and the PDW is worse like the
MSMC<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.850> feel<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.570> accuracy<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.340> much

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
MSMC I feel like the accuracy is so much

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.050 
MSMC I feel like the accuracy is so much
better<00:01:53.850> now<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.860> damage<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.579> pretty<00:01:56.729> good

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
better now and the damage is pretty good

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.539 
better now and the damage is pretty good
the<00:01:57.810> clip<00:01:58.200> doesn't<00:01:58.560> seem<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.920> run<00:01:59.130> out<00:01:59.369> as

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
the clip doesn't seem to run out as

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.050 
the clip doesn't seem to run out as
quick<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.240> don't<00:02:00.990> know<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.409> just<00:02:01.469> I'm<00:02:02.340> really

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
quick I don't know I just I'm really

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.789 
quick I don't know I just I'm really
feeling<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.450> gun<00:02:03.689> right<00:02:03.899> now<00:02:03.930> I've<00:02:04.380> been

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
feeling this gun right now I've been

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.770 
feeling this gun right now I've been
using<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.250> mp7<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.880> little<00:02:06.119> bit<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.479> feels<00:02:06.509> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
using the mp7 a little bit it feels the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.609 
using the mp7 a little bit it feels the
same<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.259> me<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:08.340> PDW<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.270> feels<00:02:09.479> worse

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
same to me the PDW just feels worse

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.490 
same to me the PDW just feels worse
and<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:11.400> actually<00:02:12.330> found<00:02:12.629> out<00:02:12.810> today<00:02:12.989> from<00:02:13.349> a

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
and I actually found out today from a

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.440 
and I actually found out today from a
friend<00:02:13.799> I'm<00:02:13.980> not<00:02:14.159> sure<00:02:14.220> if<00:02:14.459> this<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.640> true<00:02:15.150> this

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
friend I'm not sure if this is true this

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.170 
friend I'm not sure if this is true this
is<00:02:15.629> just<00:02:15.870> from<00:02:16.110> what<00:02:16.319> he<00:02:16.530> said<00:02:16.799> and<00:02:17.010> he<00:02:17.180> said

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
is just from what he said and he said

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.369 
is just from what he said and he said
that<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.580> Peacekeeper<00:02:20.580> actually<00:02:21.000> has<00:02:21.209> a

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
that that the Peacekeeper actually has a

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.670 
that that the Peacekeeper actually has a
hundred<00:02:22.379> fire<00:02:22.739> rate<00:02:23.069> less<00:02:23.580> than<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.690> PDW<00:02:25.440> and

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
hundred fire rate less than the PDW and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.770 
hundred fire rate less than the PDW and
so<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.610> think<00:02:26.849> it<00:02:27.060> will<00:02:27.150> be<00:02:27.209> interesting<00:02:27.510> to

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
so I think it will be interesting to

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.600 
so I think it will be interesting to
actually<00:02:27.989> see<00:02:28.409> how<00:02:28.620> good<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:28.950> Peacekeeper<00:02:29.489> is

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
actually see how good the Peacekeeper is

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.690 
actually see how good the Peacekeeper is
if<00:02:29.760> that's<00:02:29.970> true<00:02:30.239> because<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:31.140> PDW<00:02:32.010> does<00:02:32.370> seem

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
if that's true because the PDW does seem

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.839 
if that's true because the PDW does seem
to<00:02:32.849> kill<00:02:33.060> slow<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:35.340> only<00:02:35.489> good<00:02:35.819> part

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
to kill slow and the only good part

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.759 
to kill slow and the only good part
about<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.329> Peacekeeper<00:02:36.900> if<00:02:36.959> that's<00:02:37.140> true<00:02:37.530> and

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
about the Peacekeeper if that's true and

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.630 
about the Peacekeeper if that's true and
the<00:02:38.250> accuracy<00:02:38.549> is<00:02:38.849> good<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.500> it<00:02:40.500> has<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.650> 30<00:02:41.069> on

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
the accuracy is good is it has a 30 on

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.319 
the accuracy is good is it has a 30 on
clip<00:02:42.420> size<00:02:42.720> 30<00:02:43.470> bullet<00:02:43.829> clip<00:02:44.040> size<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.609> so

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
clip size 30 bullet clip size and so

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.050 
clip size 30 bullet clip size and so
that<00:02:45.510> would<00:02:45.629> be<00:02:45.750> pretty<00:02:45.959> good<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:47.190> once<00:02:47.970> this

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
that would be pretty good and once this

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.550 
that would be pretty good and once this
round<00:02:48.329> ends<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:48.629> a<00:02:48.720> second<00:02:49.079> actually<00:02:49.319> end<00:02:49.500> up

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
round ends in a second actually end up

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.860 
round ends in a second actually end up
picking<00:02:49.739> up<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.069> lodestar<00:02:50.579> before<00:02:51.540> this<00:02:51.660> round

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
picking up a lodestar before this round

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.390 
picking up a lodestar before this round
ends<00:02:52.319> but<00:02:53.129> I<00:02:53.579> actually<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:55.170> just<00:02:55.890> cut<00:02:56.099> out<00:02:56.250> the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
ends but I actually I just cut out the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.819 
ends but I actually I just cut out the
very<00:02:56.579> beginning<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.180> second<00:02:57.540> round<00:02:57.659> and<00:02:58.019> I

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
very beginning in the second round and I

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.470 
very beginning in the second round and I
just<00:02:59.040> cut<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.430> out<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.760> where<00:02:59.909> I'm<00:03:00.000> actually<00:03:00.180> in

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
just cut it out to where I'm actually in

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.000 
just cut it out to where I'm actually in
the<00:03:00.599> lodestar<00:03:01.049> getting<00:03:01.319> killed<00:03:01.530> so<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:01.829> just

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
the lodestar getting killed so I just

wanted<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.280> tell<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.579> that<00:03:02.879> and<00:03:03.299> right<00:03:03.569> here

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
here where I just switched to the

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.970 
here where I just switched to the
lodestar<00:03:25.669> but<00:03:26.900> yeah<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:27.930> know<00:03:28.230> my<00:03:28.470> last<00:03:28.620> video

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
lodestar but yeah I know my last video

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.729 
lodestar but yeah I know my last video
is<00:03:29.069> about<00:03:29.190> patches<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.329> how<00:03:31.200> it<00:03:31.349> affects

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
is about patches and how it affects

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.259 
is about patches and how it affects
stuff<00:03:32.160> other<00:03:32.849> than<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.389> PDW<00:03:34.379> I<00:03:34.970> feel<00:03:35.970> like<00:03:36.090> it

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
stuff other than the PDW I feel like it

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.589 
stuff other than the PDW I feel like it
hasn't<00:03:36.450> really<00:03:36.660> impacted<00:03:37.590> anything<00:03:38.389> like<00:03:39.389> I

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
hasn't really impacted anything like I

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.349 
hasn't really impacted anything like I
don't<00:03:39.870> feel<00:03:40.049> like<00:03:40.199> the<00:03:40.349> m27<00:03:41.099> has<00:03:41.519> actually

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
don't feel like the m27 has actually

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.569 
don't feel like the m27 has actually
become<00:03:42.810> better<00:03:43.199> even<00:03:43.620> though<00:03:43.769> it's<00:03:44.160> supposed

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
become better even though it's supposed

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.809 
become better even though it's supposed
to<00:03:44.730> I<00:03:45.260> don't<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.560> don't<00:03:46.859> know<00:03:47.250> why<00:03:47.400> I<00:03:47.430> feel<00:03:47.669> that

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
to I don't I don't know why I feel that
