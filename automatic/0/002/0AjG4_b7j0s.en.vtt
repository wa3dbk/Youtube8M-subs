 good morning and then found on the kitchen 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:11.850

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.840

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.500
 ingredients for this recipe are 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.929
 traces of flour of which a pound and of 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.220
 manitoba and duets are of 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:26.619
 durum wheat then re-milled here in this 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.279
 emphasizes I put in half a teaspoon 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:34.690
 of salt and but bicarbonate courgettes of 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:37.530
 sodium a man a net of butter a 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.530
 room temperature 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:45.699
 then we have two and become sugar 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:51.789
 granulated and an organic lemon and ambush 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:01:01.870
 well first start by reaching 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:01:04.360
 the lemon 1 I wrote www.zero grater 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.990
 and turn the lemon so as not to take 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:13.230
 the white face that is bitter but of 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.230
 just take the yellow 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:35.220
 here I clean what's left one 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:40.680
 grater then other lemon first juice 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:45.690
 always above the sugar as a seed 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:49.500
 take the seeds off your hand and the dough 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.500
 with another 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.740
 here it is 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.430
 I add the butter and passed to the robot from 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.759
 kitchen 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:11.110
 I put the grated lemon sugar on 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:16.709
 lemon squeezed all the butter 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.709
 inside the bubble in our mixer 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.319
 and with the help of the sweet whisk 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.319
 mix and work for a while 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.050
 while our mixer works and creates the 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.099
 our first sugar and butter 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.519
 I add that salt bicarbonate to 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.519
 flour 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.379
 Trigger does 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.790
 added the man 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.810
 and let it pass for some more 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.880
 minute 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.060
 the cream must become soft and 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.060
 fluffy 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:47.239
 perhaps I add the flour with the 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:47.239
 bicarbonate the salt and let it knead 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.400
 I would say that the dough is ready 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.940
 and now I'm going to form the biscuit victims 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.419
 I take the non-stick baking paper 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:30.310
 or a normal paper- covered one 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:38.090
 oven I make more or less balls 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:42.530
 big so I show where 7 then there 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.389
 crushes and I get a diskette of 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.280
 pasta of this size obviously 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:51.560
 then grow because they grow 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:58.509
 let's put a certain distance in ours 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.509
 45cm baking sheet 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:05.559
 rich fact 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:15.469
 and keep it up until they have done 

00:05:13.299 --> 00:05:20.869
 usually I can fill two pans 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:23.949
 with this mixture as I told you are 

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:27.349
 two perfect teams and biscuits took place 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:32.959
 now possible to bake at 180 degrees 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:36.469
 for 13 minutes already hot oven here 

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:39.259
 our biscuits are very fragrant and 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:43.089
 yummy I had a good appetite 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.089
