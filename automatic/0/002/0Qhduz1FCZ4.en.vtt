00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.020
 one 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.950
 friends hello frame black 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.260
 package from china in this package 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.930
 there is a processor for 775 socket 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.880
 sending me we suddenly very long before 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.029
 terrorized why because it was going 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.919
 very, very well, as long accustomed already 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.060
 to the fact that the parcels go fast now 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:32.210
 especially and registered almost 30 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:35.150
 days somewhere she went walked aki 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.690
 it was not heard 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.710
 come on come on come on constantly 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:46.430
 comrade let's see what we have here 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:50.810
 it came and so everything is as always in the pimple 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:56.790
 the processor so what did the processor say 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:59.610
 for 775 socket more precisely processor 771 juice 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.020
 so outside under 775 it's like very 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.810
 a good option simply 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.190
 resuscitation or 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:10.980
 second wind for socket processors 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:16.400
 why because you watch it with us 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:21.210
 it turns out the server processor focus 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:25.040
 server processor intel xeon e5 453 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:32.550
 gigahertz 12 megabytes cache 133 ga 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:36.150
 focus return to the place that is for such 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.520
 money for socket data is very hard that 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.650
 find this processor cost about 35 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.500
 dollars this is a penny on the very 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.530
 to reanimate 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.450
 computer 4 cores here's the salt look 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.150
 here we have something now 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:57.300
 I will take what you will 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:02:01.290
 show yourself see here she is a client 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.530
 adapter adapter just changes two 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:09.390
 contract in some places and accordingly 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:15.450
 processor server on 771 juice it starts 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:19.140
 suitable for 775 socket 4 core trigger 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.960
 hertz plus to this everything is very good 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.730
 process accelerates here with us 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:29.130
 It turns out with LDPM review 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.040
 at the same time it is easy to chase the processor without 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.770
 any problems so us check 5 s 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.360
 the focus of the form easily accelerates the processor 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.420
 plus the everything that is 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.690
 There are several variants of this Ilya 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.700
 and X-El is a little powerful processors 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.540
 xeon ovsky intel xeon 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.640
 and this is average power and x is the most 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.130
 high power but again considering 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.130
 the fact that or are considered cold 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.020
 processors and are considered average 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.360
 x temperatures are considered hot 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.959
 processor accordingly if you 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.430
 want to order a processor x data thoughts 3 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.080
 16 33 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.460
 herzen indra you will need to change 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.210
 computer cooling system on this 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.430
 the processor will not need to change anything 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:21.270
 that is, it must be cooled perfectly 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.520
 Intel's normal standard blasphemed 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.610
 but more on that a bit later 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.390
 there will be a video about installing this processor 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.680
 about the nuances of installing these processors 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.070
 what you need to what you need to be 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.740
 ready and what can be encountered 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:41.700
 Just go there video process in 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.380
 okay come here still have a little bit 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.820
 a little bit a bit thermal paste 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:52.610
 Thermal grease I do not know what kind of firm in 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.930
 king kane in some kind of incomprehensible to the bottom 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.470
 we already have thermal grease 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.470
 remember 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:05.900
 gd900 we order with you so we will 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.120
 hope that we will manage so wait 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.240
 The video link will be in the description for 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.650
 this seller with aliexpress but to whom 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.190
 like put likes subscribe 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.020
 On the channel there will be a video on the installation 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.910
 this processor all the nuances so 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.910
 so far, bye tibet
