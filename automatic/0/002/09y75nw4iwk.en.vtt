00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.810
 summary made by me but you also have 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.070
 a summary an official website of riot in the 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.920

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.820
 you have a vote to get 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.560
 those three extra icons had to be one 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.270

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.280

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.759
 You can see how to get the icons 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.299
 normal those we are looking down to 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.490

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.890
 I leave you there the link in the description 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.870
 so you can be good then investigate 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.910
 you and see how they are taken out is very 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.920
 most are playing games not you 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.110
 they say they do not even win the so 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.490
 also tell you that you have a question 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.400
 and answers if you have any questions 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.900
 that you can consult there and also 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.580
 tell you not to worry if you take 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.700
 in receiving the icons because always 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.040
 It usually takes a little bit also this in 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.440
 this delight we are going to have that several 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.470
 packs that you can see in the store about 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.150
 an important pack of the other year 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.860
 when it came out in the corners of 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.480
 lunar festival we can recover the 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.010
 we can buy back the ones that are already 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.990
 they could but we do not have them organized 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.030
 in a pack that maybe if we have the 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.460
 Champions, so let's go a little bit more 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.320
 cheap if you're interested in those skins facts 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.800
 and here we have good because the three skins 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.620
 the trim dahmer and target and the 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.600
 guardians of this year 2014 year 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.090
 of the horse because we have the banner 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.500
 with the horse and we have the gong with the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.880
 horse also the previous year was the 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.280
 year of the snake as we can see 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.260
 also those of 2013 are available 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.120
 so well this is a short summary 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.280
 you can go telling me what you 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.020
 it seems this lunar festival if you like to 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.180
 I liked it more the other year although it is 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.410
 true that we were 5 or 6 skins many 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.210
 bases that I think could have been 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.300
 upset 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.220
 and have done other skins that I think 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.520
 that it would be nice to always see 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.340
 porrÃ³n of new skins and that's good 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.890
 let's go straight to see the news 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.870
 of the new guardian of the new skin and 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.180
 nothing of the said thing to review a little the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.250
 web that is amazing and we will see the 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.350
 good guard here we are with the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.240
 valentine guardian the new skin 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.150
 you know that for valentine they have 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.670
 almost always removed a skin as it could 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.770
 be the one of jean gallardo and the one of see 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.350
 heartbreaker two years ago the previous 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.180
 year was that of keys there is gallant man 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.530
 and good this year let's hope to see if 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.030
 we have some corner they have put nothing 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.520
 still on the server provides nothing more 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.020
 that the guard skin not so 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.880
 we will be aware as you know 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.080
 Any news I will inform you in 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.140
 Tell me what you think of the guard 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.120
 sincerely for neither half and FA 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.760
 to deceive ourselves that it is true that 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.680
 it costs 640 riot point somewhat exaggerated 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.840
 I suppose that during Valentine's Day 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.700
 freely available, you do not know no 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.350
 I know but it is true that I 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.720
 it seems exaggerated as I always say the 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.750
 price because they set the 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.750
 guardians of vision to the skins go 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.460
 but good the river marks the prices the 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.050
 people then decide if they buy them or 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.820
 shopping I honestly am not going to 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.770
 buy it as much as I like 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.440
 or as much as it catches my attention 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.480
 but honestly apart from that I do not 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.400
 Nor is it striking 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.440
 would buy for that price so good 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.900
 tell you that nothing I'm still waiting for 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.280
 I suppose like all 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.610
 if there is any new news about 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.810
 champions about skins and nothing I have 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.160
 said I hope you liked it and we 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.160
 we see in the next video bye bye
