00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
expecting him to use a k7 so I gotta

recoil<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.240> little<00:01:18.450> bit<00:01:18.570> too

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
recoil is just a little bit too

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.630

unpredictable<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:20.009> kind<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.250> goes<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.430> little

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
unpredictable it kind of goes a little

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.460 
unpredictable it kind of goes a little
bit<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.939> everywhere<00:01:21.240> but<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.200> know<00:01:22.320> he

these<00:01:51.210> camels<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.799> was<00:01:53.549> actually<00:01:53.759> very

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
these camels so I was actually very

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.300 
these camels so I was actually very
disappointed<00:01:54.869> with<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.140> camo<00:01:55.439> pack<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.009> mean

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
disappointed with this camo pack I mean

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.249 
disappointed with this camo pack I mean
for<00:01:56.340> one<00:01:56.670> thing<00:01:56.700> they're<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:57.750> pumping<00:01:58.110> them

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
for one thing they're just pumping them

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.469 
for one thing they're just pumping them
out<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.979> rapidly<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.909> seems<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.270> they're

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
out so rapidly and it seems like they're

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.090 
out so rapidly and it seems like they're
putting<00:02:00.750> no<00:02:00.960> effort<00:02:00.990> into<00:02:01.649> them<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:01.950> they

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
putting no effort into them like they

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.130 
putting no effort into them like they
didn't<00:02:02.340> do<00:02:02.399> any<00:02:02.640> advertising<00:02:03.210> for<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.719> it

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
didn't do any advertising for this it

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.749 
didn't do any advertising for this it
just<00:02:04.170> kind<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.649> brought<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:04.979> up<00:02:05.219> nobody<00:02:05.579> even

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
just kind of brought it up nobody even

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.490 
just kind of brought it up nobody even
knew<00:02:05.939> camels<00:02:06.360> were<00:02:06.479> coming<00:02:06.780> out<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.110> then

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
knew camels were coming out and then

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.229 
knew camels were coming out and then
they<00:02:07.619> bring<00:02:07.799> us<00:02:07.950> these<00:02:08.129> crappy<00:02:08.459> camos<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.149> it

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
they bring us these crappy camos and it

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.880 
they bring us these crappy camos and it
seems<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.569> they're<00:02:09.810> literally<00:02:10.080> putting<00:02:10.470> no

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
seems like they're literally putting no

not even trying and it's just really

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.150

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
frustrating I mean the only camel that

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.800 
frustrating I mean the only camel that
they've<00:02:26.490> made<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:26.940> I've<00:02:27.060> actually<00:02:27.210> like<00:02:27.570> is

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
they've made that I've actually like is

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.750 
they've made that I've actually like is
the<00:02:27.990> spectrum<00:02:28.440> camo<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.040> that's<00:02:29.490> not<00:02:29.610> even

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
the spectrum camo and that's not even

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.430 
the spectrum camo and that's not even
available<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.540> public<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:31.110> don't<00:02:31.320> even

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
available to the public I don't even

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.860 
available to the public I don't even
have<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:31.770> camo<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.510> just<00:02:33.660> kind<00:02:33.690> of

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
have that camo so that just kind of

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.210 
have that camo so that just kind of
frustrates<00:02:34.350> me<00:02:34.500> how<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.770> seems<00:02:34.980> like<00:02:35.100> they're

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
frustrates me how it seems like they're

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.680 
frustrates me how it seems like they're
putting<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.580> little<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:36.000> no<00:02:36.120> effort<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.570> the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
putting a little to no effort in the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.930 
putting a little to no effort in the
camos<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.620> just<00:02:37.890> seems<00:02:38.130> like<00:02:38.220> all<00:02:38.550> they<00:02:38.700> want

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
camos it just seems like all they want

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.180 
camos it just seems like all they want
now<00:02:39.120> is<00:02:39.330> your<00:02:39.840> money<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.260> know<00:02:40.380> pay<00:02:40.620> up<00:02:40.830> we'll

give you some decent camos and then go

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.449 
give you some decent camos and then go
away<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.410> seems<00:02:43.530> like<00:02:43.709> they<00:02:43.830> don't<00:02:44.010> even<00:02:44.100> care

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
away it seems like they don't even care

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.670 
away it seems like they don't even care
about<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.730> community<00:02:44.820> anymore<00:02:45.300> but<00:02:46.260> anyways
