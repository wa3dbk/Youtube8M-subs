this<00:00:32.369> technique<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.829> screw<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:34.860> back

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
this technique this is a screw on back

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.069 
this technique this is a screw on back
and<00:00:37.520> the<00:00:38.520> first<00:00:38.790> thing<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.210> try<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.450> do<00:00:39.719> if<00:00:39.960> you

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
and the first thing you try to do if you

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.850 
and the first thing you try to do if you
look<00:00:40.260> at<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.700> you<00:00:41.700> want<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.260> try<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.320> pry<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.710> up

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
look at it you want to try to pry it up

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.260 
look at it you want to try to pry it up
well<00:00:44.160> that's<00:00:44.399> obviously<00:00:44.700> not<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.940> thing<00:00:45.149> to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
well that's obviously not the thing to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.520 
well that's obviously not the thing to
do

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
do

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.260 
do
these<00:00:46.829> are<00:00:46.980> screw<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.550> backs<00:00:47.940> they're

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
these are screw on backs they're

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.299 
these are screw on backs they're
actually<00:00:48.660> little<00:00:48.930> grooves<00:00:49.260> once<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.100> get<00:00:50.219> it

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
actually little grooves once you get it

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.080 
actually little grooves once you get it
up<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:51.260> normally<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.620> buy<00:00:53.010> this

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
up and normally you have to buy this

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.850 
up and normally you have to buy this
little<00:00:54.090> key<00:00:54.329> tool<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.629> kind<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.230> latches<00:00:55.680> on

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
little key tool that kind of latches on

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.349 
little key tool that kind of latches on
and<00:00:56.629> twists<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.460> Breitling<00:00:59.460> now<00:00:59.640> if<00:01:00.149> you

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
and twists and Breitling now if you

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.000 
and twists and Breitling now if you
watch<00:01:00.750> their<00:01:01.050> YouTube<00:01:01.079> video<00:01:01.649> they<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:01.920> this

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
watch their YouTube video they have this

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.860 
watch their YouTube video they have this
like<00:01:02.160> high-tech<00:01:02.730> machine<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.390> comes<00:01:03.600> down

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
like high-tech machine that comes down

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.280 
like high-tech machine that comes down
it<00:01:04.799> goes<00:01:05.150> and<00:01:06.150> then<00:01:06.299> screws<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.810> off<00:01:06.960> well

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
it goes and then screws it off well

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.810 
it goes and then screws it off well
after<00:01:08.159> watching<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.760> another<00:01:09.299> video<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.820> didn't

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
after watching a another video I didn't

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.580 
after watching a another video I didn't
think<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.030> was<00:01:12.090> possible<00:01:12.299> but<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:13.170> guy<00:01:13.350> actually

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
think it was possible but a guy actually

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.170 
think it was possible but a guy actually
used<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.490> rubber<00:01:15.060> child<00:01:15.630> ball<00:01:16.159> squeezed<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.430> so

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
used a rubber child ball squeezed it so

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.940 
used a rubber child ball squeezed it so
it<00:01:18.240> kind<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.450> pinches<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.049> metal<00:01:19.619> right<00:01:19.890> here

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
it kind of pinches the metal right here

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.830 
it kind of pinches the metal right here
and<00:01:20.400> then<00:01:20.880> he<00:01:20.970> just<00:01:21.180> turned<00:01:21.659> it

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and then he just turned it

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.410 
and then he just turned it
counterclockwise<00:01:22.380> obviously<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.369> open<00:01:24.270> back

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
counterclockwise obviously and open back

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.840 
counterclockwise obviously and open back
up<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.439> opened<00:01:25.680> up<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.670> was

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
up and it opened up and I was

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.490 
up and it opened up and I was
flabbergasted<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.659> said<00:01:27.869> there's<00:01:28.049> no<00:01:28.170> way<00:01:28.350> is

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
flabbergasted I said there's no way is

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.289 
flabbergasted I said there's no way is
that<00:01:28.530> possible<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.820> looked<00:01:30.060> around<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
that possible so I looked around the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.109 
that possible so I looked around the
house<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.750> didn't<00:01:30.990> have<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.110> rubber<00:01:31.350> ball<00:01:31.590> at<00:01:31.799> all

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
house I didn't have a rubber ball at all

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.090 
house I didn't have a rubber ball at all
so<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.780> kind<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:33.990> came<00:01:34.170> up<00:01:34.229> with<00:01:34.530> anything

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
so I just kind of came up with anything

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.249 
so I just kind of came up with anything
I<00:01:35.340> come<00:01:35.610> up<00:01:35.729> with<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.270> was<00:01:36.509> you're<00:01:37.140> going

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
I come up with and that was you're going

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.770 
I come up with and that was you're going
to<00:01:37.320> laugh<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:37.799> don't<00:01:38.100> because<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.549> worked<00:01:38.780> I

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
to laugh but don't because it worked I

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.490 
to laugh but don't because it worked I
came<00:01:40.380> up<00:01:40.470> with<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.619> hacky<00:01:40.799> sack<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:42.500> that

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
came up with a hacky sack and that

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.380 
came up with a hacky sack and that
obviously<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.220> bat<00:01:44.430> material<00:01:44.939> won't<00:01:45.119> latch

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
obviously the bat material won't latch

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.780 
obviously the bat material won't latch
on<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:45.990> needed<00:01:46.320> now<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.979> needed<00:01:47.280> some<00:01:47.610> like

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
on so I needed now I needed some like

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.210 
on so I needed now I needed some like
kind<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.060> sticky<00:01:48.570> rubber<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:49.320> grip<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
kind of sticky rubber to grip on in the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.460 
kind of sticky rubber to grip on in the
middle<00:01:50.460> well<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.329> was<00:01:51.509> looking<00:01:51.659> around<00:01:51.869> for

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
middle well I was looking around for

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.819 
middle well I was looking around for
something<00:01:53.090> of<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.270> sorts<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.079> really<00:01:55.710> had

tricks<00:02:02.670> where<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:02.969> shove<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> handkerchief<00:02:03.719> in

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
tricks where you shove a handkerchief in

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.080

and then you know you disappears type
thing<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.570> anyway<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:08.209> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
thing like that anyway so the

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.490 
thing like that anyway so the
combination<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.899> this

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
combination of this

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.560 
combination of this
and<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:11.160> actually<00:02:11.820> worked<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.240> let<00:02:12.360> me<00:02:12.450> show

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570

want to do is you want to kind of pinch

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.980 
want to do is you want to kind of pinch
in<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.680> hacky<00:02:29.130> sack<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.480> looks<00:02:30.660> like<00:02:30.810> this

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
in the hacky sack so it looks like this

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.790 
in the hacky sack so it looks like this
put<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.040> top<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:32.810> again<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.840> dry<00:02:34.230> palm<00:02:34.500> is

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
put it on top and again a dry palm is

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.370 
put it on top and again a dry palm is
definitely<00:02:35.310> works<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.760> lot<00:02:35.940> better<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.450> then

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
definitely works a lot better and then

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.580 
definitely works a lot better and then
put<00:02:37.830> some<00:02:37.980> strength<00:02:38.310> into<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:40.080> then<00:02:40.230> twist

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
put some strength into it and then twist

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.580 
put some strength into it and then twist
and<00:02:41.270> you<00:02:42.270> just<00:02:42.450> want<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.780> loosen<00:02:43.110> it<00:02:43.230> up<00:02:43.320> just

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
and you just want to loosen it up just

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.449 
and you just want to loosen it up just
enough<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.510> then<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.540> might<00:02:46.080> be<00:02:46.200> able<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.470> you

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
enough and then you might be able to you

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.580 
enough and then you might be able to you
might<00:02:47.640> be<00:02:47.730> able<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.910> get<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:49.170> rest<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.500> the

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
might be able to get it the rest of the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.449 
might be able to get it the rest of the
way<00:02:51.080> there<00:02:52.080> we<00:02:52.170> go<00:02:52.970> rest<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.090> way<00:02:54.180> by<00:02:54.390> fingers

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
way there we go rest the way by fingers

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.520 
way there we go rest the way by fingers
so<00:02:57.410> let's<00:02:58.410> go<00:02:58.530> ahead<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.770> get<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.040> on<00:02:59.430> up<00:02:59.820> and

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
so let's go ahead and get that on up and

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.070 
kind of like a LIVESTRONG band let's see
if<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.900> works<00:03:29.030> so<00:03:30.030> we're<00:03:30.480> going<00:03:30.570> to<00:03:30.630> do<00:03:30.780> here<00:03:30.989> is
