 when autumn begins it is very likely that you will experience an increase 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.800
 of hair loss which can be worrisome and is reason for a 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.599
 increase of medical consultations on this aspect 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.680
 although in most cases neither the person nor the center is made 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.690
 suitable 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.030
 dermatologists emphasize that it is important not to confuse the fall of 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.960
 hair with alopecia since it is only part of the hair's life cycle 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.880
 that balances with the rise of the new hair 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.350
 but there is no doubt that due to different external aggressions there are stages in the 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.720
 that hair loss accelerates 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.130
 for example in the poplar has giving in the shower in the cn 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.880
 sing to the goal in a week excess fat or even core hunters 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.670
 all of them are symptoms that are already announcing that the family imposes 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.560
 the number of bars we have daily stihl around 80 to 100 but 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.580
 in these months 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.910
 hair that during the whole summer has been subjected to heat and 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.430
 Ultraviolet radiation accelerates its growth cycle and therefore grows very 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.160
 quickly and also falls massively which is alarming for 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.120
 large amount of the population 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.550
 therefore the most effective measure to prevent premature hair loss 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.230
 is to perform a capillary test as soon as possible to detect possible problems 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.630

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.110

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.509
 Each client applies a specific treatment for both men and women 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.810
 women and has the most advanced methods and techniques 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.400
 in the census before press media written solutions depending on 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.210
 each case 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.370
 was presented to us in the person who comes with hair loss who is 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.760
 starting with that hair task that are done are treatments to prevent 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.860

 the professionals are only tease that alopecia is not a disease 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.560
 concrete but can be presented in different ways 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.810
 and part of different processes sometimes an exhaustive analysis of the
