heart<00:00:44.700> we<00:00:45.700> take<00:00:46.030> it<00:00:46.150> fast<00:00:46.420> or<00:00:47.200> really<00:00:47.530> slow<00:00:48.340> but

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
heart we take it fast or really slow but

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.380 
heart we take it fast or really slow but
we<00:00:49.360> can't<00:00:49.600> always<00:00:49.870> see<00:00:50.379> where<00:00:51.100> we'll<00:00:51.340> go

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
we can't always see where we'll go

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.530 
we can't always see where we'll go
if<00:00:53.379> it<00:00:53.500> first<00:00:53.739> we<00:00:53.949> don't<00:00:54.250> see<00:00:54.580> will<00:00:55.210> try<00:00:55.480> two

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
if it first we don't see will try two

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.950 
if it first we don't see will try two
more<00:00:56.110> times<00:00:56.680> so<00:00:57.160> our<00:00:57.550> failures<00:00:58.000> has<00:00:58.480> to<00:00:58.720> be

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
more times so our failures has to be

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.890 
more times so our failures has to be
significant<00:00:59.530> try<00:01:00.840> like<00:01:02.070> equation

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.070 

me<00:01:07.900> too<00:01:08.410> bad

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.880 

this<00:01:12.770> is<00:01:13.070> your<00:01:13.310> sightless<00:01:14.030> song

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
this is your sightless song

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.860 
this is your sightless song
a<00:01:15.920> place<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.670> start<00:01:17.060> I<00:01:17.390> can't<00:01:18.200> come

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
a place to start I can't come

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.960 
a place to start I can't come
I<00:01:20.430> research<00:01:21.430> in<00:01:21.670> there

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
I research in there

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.660 
I research in there
we<00:01:23.690> can<00:01:23.960> write<00:01:24.230> the<00:01:24.950> conclusion<00:01:26.050> together

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
we can write the conclusion together

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.890 
we can write the conclusion together
just<00:01:28.670> like<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:29.120> movies

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
just like the movies

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.640 
just like the movies
I'd<00:01:29.960> feel<00:01:30.530> your<00:01:31.040> heart<00:01:31.780> but<00:01:32.780> then<00:01:32.990> you<00:01:33.170> die<00:01:33.350> so

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
I'd feel your heart but then you die so

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.940 
I'd feel your heart but then you die so
I<00:01:33.680> won't<00:01:34.010> do<00:01:34.250> that<00:01:36.340> if<00:01:37.340> we<00:01:37.640> broke<00:01:37.820> up<00:01:38.030> I<00:01:38.320> mean<00:01:39.320> no

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
I won't do that if we broke up I mean no

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.300 
I won't do that if we broke up I mean no
more<00:01:40.370> I'd<00:01:41.360> give<00:01:41.810> up<00:01:41.990> page<00:01:42.260> 204<00:01:43.190> h2so4<00:01:45.310> take

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
more I'd give up page 204 h2so4 take

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.470 
more I'd give up page 204 h2so4 take
away<00:01:46.640> gravity<00:01:46.910> I'd<00:01:47.690> still<00:01:48.530> fall<00:01:48.830> for<00:01:48.860> you

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480
