card<00:02:59.900> but<00:03:00.080> i<00:03:00.110> think<00:03:00.320> you<00:03:00.380> know<00:03:00.410> informed<00:03:01.100> card

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.280 
card but i think you know informed card
is<00:03:01.580> obviously<00:03:02.180> nicer<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.750> look<00:03:02.780> at<00:03:03.050> so<00:03:03.200> I've

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
is obviously nicer to look at so I've

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.130 
is obviously nicer to look at so I've
put<00:03:03.500> him<00:03:03.650> in<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:04.070> left<00:03:04.280> wing<00:03:04.489> /<00:03:05.390> left<00:03:05.690> mid<00:03:05.930> roll

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
put him in the left wing / left mid roll

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.050

a<00:03:26.510> really<00:03:26.690> cheap<00:03:26.959> card<00:03:27.170> as<00:03:27.290> well<00:03:27.350> back<00:03:27.590> in<00:03:27.739> the

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
a really cheap card as well back in the

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.110 
a really cheap card as well back in the
day<00:03:27.980> but<00:03:28.040> you<00:03:28.310> know<00:03:28.340> of<00:03:28.459> course<00:03:28.519> coins<00:03:28.940> were

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
day but you know of course coins were

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.330 
day but you know of course coins were
much<00:03:29.330> harder<00:03:29.660> to<00:03:29.780> obtain<00:03:29.870> back<00:03:30.320> then<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:30.680> but

with<00:04:49.820> a<00:04:49.850> man<00:04:50.120> united's<00:04:50.510> records<00:04:50.960> were

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
with a man united's records were

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.370

regarded as incredibly good back then I

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.920 
regarded as incredibly good back then I
think<00:04:54.740> Dimitar<00:04:55.160> Berbatov<00:04:55.190> was<00:04:55.700> even<00:04:56.180> 88<00:04:56.630> rated
