00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
which is pretty annoying the way stuff

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.570 
which is pretty annoying the way stuff
like<00:03:49.110> that's<00:03:49.290> getting<00:03:49.530> released<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:50.130> it's

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
like that's getting released and it's

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
lousy delaying holy skate and release

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.410 
lousy delaying holy skate and release
which<00:03:52.980> is<00:03:53.100> a<00:03:53.130> lot<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.519> like<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:53.940> main<00:03:54.150> thing

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
which is a lot of like the main thing

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.660 
which is a lot of like the main thing
that<00:03:54.450> people<00:03:54.780> want<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.769> I<00:03:55.860> think<00:03:56.130> ice<00:03:56.400> could

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
that people want and I think ice could

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.100 
that people want and I think ice could
be<00:03:56.790> a<00:03:56.820> little<00:03:57.030> bit<00:03:57.150> of<00:03:57.209> a<00:03:57.269> letdown<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:57.870> reckon

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110
