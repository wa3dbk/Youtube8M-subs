with the advertising out of the way

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.859 
with the advertising out of the way
let's<00:00:25.410> get<00:00:25.859> started<00:00:26.340> what<00:00:27.300> we're<00:00:27.449> doing<00:00:27.689> today

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
let's get started what we're doing today

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.470 
let's get started what we're doing today
I'm<00:00:28.289> using<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:29.039> exact<00:00:29.400> same<00:00:29.640> electrolyte<00:00:30.269> as

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
I'm using the exact same electrolyte as

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.530 
I'm using the exact same electrolyte as
we<00:00:30.869> use<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.320> our<00:00:31.380> previous<00:00:31.650> tests<00:00:32.510> for<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
we use in our previous tests for the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.850 
we use in our previous tests for the
vortex<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:35.120> we're<00:00:36.320> instead<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.469> using<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
vortex and we're instead of using the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.280 
vortex and we're instead of using the
vortex<00:00:38.399> cell<00:00:39.149> i'm<00:00:39.450> using<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.960> big<00:00:40.110> kahuna

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
vortex cell i'm using the big kahuna

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.560 
vortex cell i'm using the big kahuna
cell<00:00:41.030> it's<00:00:42.030> actually<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:44.570> 3-cell<00:00:45.570> unit<00:00:46.200> with<00:00:46.590> a

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
cell it's actually a 3-cell unit with a

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.380 
cell it's actually a 3-cell unit with a
two<00:00:48.570> positives<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.550> a<00:00:50.550> negative<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.090> them<00:00:51.239> in

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
two positives and a negative in them in

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.700 
two positives and a negative in them in
the<00:00:51.600> center<00:00:53.600> okay<00:00:54.890> has<00:00:55.890> great<00:00:56.430> output<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.710> we

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the center okay has great output and we

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.689 
the center okay has great output and we
will<00:00:58.890> see<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.550> second<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.480> mix<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.699> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
will see that in a second the mix is the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.119 
will see that in a second the mix is the
same<00:01:03.059> as<00:01:03.390> using<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.170> vortex<00:01:04.650> which<00:01:04.860> was

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
same as using the vortex which was

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.300 
same as using the vortex which was
running<00:01:05.460> at<00:01:05.580> one<00:01:05.909> amp<00:01:06.240> or<00:01:06.450> less<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.310> having

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
running at one amp or less and having

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.090 
running at one amp or less and having
good<00:01:08.460> output<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:10.020> we're<00:01:10.439> going<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.710> try<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
good output so we're going to try the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.990 
good output so we're going to try the
same<00:01:11.580> exact<00:01:12.210> electrolyte<00:01:12.869> except<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.520> was

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
same exact electrolyte except that I was

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.990 
same exact electrolyte except that I was
forced<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.570> add<00:01:15.750> two<00:01:16.619> cups<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.189> hydrogen

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
forced to add two cups of hydrogen

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.530 
forced to add two cups of hydrogen
peroxide<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:20.009> amps<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.549> went<00:01:20.729> wait<00:01:20.970> up<00:01:21.180> and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
peroxide the amps just went wait up and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.840 
peroxide the amps just went wait up and
blew<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.439> fuse<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.950> hopefully<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.700> won't

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
blew the fuse and hopefully we won't

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.749 
blew the fuse and hopefully we won't
blow<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.119> fuse<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.979> let's<00:01:25.979> see<00:01:26.250> what<00:01:26.280> happens

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
blow a fuse so let's see what happens

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.920 
blow a fuse so let's see what happens
when<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.810> plug<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:29.450> okay<00:01:30.450> fresh<00:01:30.780> battery

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
when we plug this in okay fresh battery

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.899 
when we plug this in okay fresh battery
put<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.079> positive<00:01:34.710> lips<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.460> always<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:35.880> to

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
put the positive lips I always like to

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.460 
put the positive lips I always like to
start<00:01:36.240> with<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.390> negative<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:37.020> don't<00:01:37.259> know<00:01:37.320> if<00:01:37.380> it

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
start with a negative I don't know if it

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:46.940 
start with a negative I don't know if it
makes<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.680> difference<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:42.630> negative<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:45.950> with

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
makes a difference the negative on with

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.200 
makes a difference the negative on with
the<00:01:47.070> positive<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.240> watch<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.479> output

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.830 

as<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:54.020> can<00:01:54.110> see<00:01:54.430> really<00:01:55.430> goes<00:01:55.700> crazy<00:01:56.090> we're

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
as you can see really goes crazy we're

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.289 
as you can see really goes crazy we're
looking<00:01:57.080> at<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.320> amps<00:01:57.650> it's<00:01:57.799> over<00:01:58.190> 32<00:01:58.760> all<00:01:59.030> I

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
looking at the amps it's over 32 all I

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.300 
looking at the amps it's over 32 all I
have<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.570> disconnect<00:02:00.020> because<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:03.310> yep

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
have to disconnect because the yep

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.999 
have to disconnect because the yep
because<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.790> fuse<00:02:05.090> is<00:02:05.270> only<00:02:05.479> a<00:02:05.600> 30<00:02:05.960> amp<00:02:06.409> fuse

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
because the fuse is only a 30 amp fuse

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.530 
because the fuse is only a 30 amp fuse
and<00:02:08.560> I've<00:02:09.560> blown<00:02:09.860> three<00:02:10.220> fuses<00:02:10.640> today<00:02:10.940> so<00:02:11.000> far

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
and I've blown three fuses today so far

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.770 
and I've blown three fuses today so far
so<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:13.310> can<00:02:13.459> see<00:02:13.640> we<00:02:13.850> had<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.030> lot<00:02:14.270> of<00:02:14.300> output

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
so you can see we had a lot of output

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.970 
so you can see we had a lot of output
completely<00:02:15.470> filled<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:17.260> container<00:02:18.260> with

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
completely filled the container with

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.130 
completely filled the container with
hydrogen<00:02:19.489> foam<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.230> oxygen<00:02:21.520> so<00:02:22.520> h<00:02:22.970> HH<00:02:23.600> o<00:02:23.870> is

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
hydrogen foam and oxygen so h HH o is

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.550 
hydrogen foam and oxygen so h HH o is
just<00:02:24.500> basically<00:02:24.800> foamed<00:02:25.220> up<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.610> gave<00:02:25.760> us<00:02:25.910> a

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
just basically foamed up and gave us a

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.960 
just basically foamed up and gave us a
tremendous<00:02:27.560> output<00:02:28.630> so<00:02:29.630> obviously<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:31.670> wasn't

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
tremendous output so obviously it wasn't

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.470 
tremendous output so obviously it wasn't
the<00:02:32.180> electrolyte<00:02:32.750> it<00:02:33.709> must<00:02:34.040> been<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.970> cell

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
the electrolyte it must been the cell

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.710 
the electrolyte it must been the cell
itself<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:36.650> either<00:02:36.920> got<00:02:37.190> charged<00:02:38.560> and

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
itself that either got charged and

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.460 
itself that either got charged and
trained<00:02:42.310> don't<00:02:43.310> really<00:02:43.610> know<00:02:43.760> exactly<00:02:44.470> why

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
trained don't really know exactly why

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.380 
trained don't really know exactly why
the<00:02:45.530> high<00:02:45.920> fusion<00:02:46.340> cell<00:02:46.519> was<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:46.940> efficient

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
the high fusion cell was so efficient

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.780 
the high fusion cell was so efficient
working<00:02:47.840> with<00:02:48.320> his<00:02:48.470> exact<00:02:48.980> almost<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.489> exact

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
working with his exact almost the exact

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.759 
working with his exact almost the exact
same<00:02:49.820> electrolyte<00:02:50.540> this<00:02:51.019> is<00:02:51.170> actually<00:02:51.560> more

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
same electrolyte this is actually more

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.540 
same electrolyte this is actually more
to<00:02:51.920> loot<00:02:52.190> then<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:54.160> electrolyte<00:02:55.160> we<00:02:55.310> used

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
to loot then the electrolyte we used

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:04.060 
to loot then the electrolyte we used
with<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:58.570> vortex<00:02:59.570> cell<00:03:00.320> so<00:03:02.380> we<00:03:03.380> will<00:03:03.560> have<00:03:03.620> to

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
with the vortex cell so we will have to

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.319 
with the vortex cell so we will have to
go<00:03:04.190> back<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.519> drawing<00:03:04.760> board<00:03:04.910> what<00:03:05.299> i

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
go back to the drawing board what i

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:11.920 
go back to the drawing board what i
think<00:03:05.660> i<00:03:05.780> will<00:03:05.840> do<00:03:06.140> is<00:03:07.180> add<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.860> word<00:03:10.720> exactly<00:03:11.720> as

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
think i will do is add a word exactly as

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.280 
think i will do is add a word exactly as
before<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:13.790> vortex<00:03:14.390> unit<00:03:14.690> was<00:03:14.840> labeled

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
before the vortex unit was labeled

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.400 
before the vortex unit was labeled
energy<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:16.450> that<00:03:17.450> sounds<00:03:17.810> corny<00:03:18.140> but<00:03:18.170> we're

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
energy and that sounds corny but we're

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.250 
energy and that sounds corny but we're
going<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.560> try<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.950> well<00:03:19.489> test<00:03:19.790> it<00:03:19.940> so<00:03:20.690> next

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
going to try it well test it so next

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.710 
going to try it well test it so next
time<00:03:21.530> I'll<00:03:21.920> have<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.519> word<00:03:22.670> energy<00:03:23.090> on<00:03:23.450> this

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
time I'll have the word energy on this

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.949 
time I'll have the word energy on this
and<00:03:24.019> it<00:03:24.680> will<00:03:24.850> be<00:03:25.850> on<00:03:26.030> overnight<00:03:26.570> and<00:03:26.810> then

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
and it will be on overnight and then

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.900 
and it will be on overnight and then
we'll<00:03:27.140> test<00:03:27.350> it<00:03:27.470> tomorrow<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:28.130> see<00:03:28.790> if<00:03:28.880> that

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
we'll test it tomorrow and see if that

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.050 
we'll test it tomorrow and see if that
made<00:03:29.150> any<00:03:29.180> difference<00:03:29.660> at<00:03:29.989> all<00:03:30.610> ok<00:03:31.610> y'all<00:03:31.880> have

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
made any difference at all ok y'all have

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.890 
made any difference at all ok y'all have
a<00:03:32.090> great<00:03:32.360> day<00:03:32.780> thanks<00:03:33.440> for<00:03:33.560> watching
