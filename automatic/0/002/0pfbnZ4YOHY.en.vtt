00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
percent drop on campus overall so they

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.599 
percent drop on campus overall so they

are a significant user of water they

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.069 
are a significant user of water they
don't<00:00:55.819> know<00:00:55.940> how<00:00:56.149> much<00:00:56.300> more<00:00:56.359> they<00:00:56.749> can<00:00:56.780> drop

don't<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.439> show<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.429> here<00:01:56.670> we've<00:01:56.850> got

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
don't I show you so in here we've got

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.179 
don't I show you so in here we've got
our<00:01:57.030> edible<00:01:57.359> fish<00:01:57.689> species<00:01:57.959> which<00:01:58.709> is<00:01:58.859> Nile

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
our edible fish species which is Nile

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.069 
our edible fish species which is Nile
tilapia<00:01:59.340> they're<00:02:00.270> naturally<00:02:00.659> giving<00:02:00.929> off

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
tilapia they're naturally giving off

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.919 
tilapia they're naturally giving off
their<00:02:01.640> ammonia<00:02:02.640> which<00:02:02.789> is<00:02:02.909> their<00:02:03.060> waste<00:02:03.299> they

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
their ammonia which is their waste they

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.309 
their ammonia which is their waste they
pump<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.380> fish<00:02:04.590> water<00:02:05.239> into<00:02:06.239> a<00:02:06.569> solid<00:02:07.049> waste

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
pump the fish water into a solid waste

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.919 
pump the fish water into a solid waste
filter<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.459> then<00:02:08.940> into<00:02:09.179> netting<00:02:09.509> this

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
filter and then into netting this

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.509 
filter and then into netting this
netting<00:02:10.229> has<00:02:10.319> lots<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.619> bacteria<00:02:11.130> in<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.340> and

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
netting has lots of bacteria in it and

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.520 
netting has lots of bacteria in it and
the<00:02:11.610> bacteria<00:02:11.819> break<00:02:12.390> down<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.870> ammonia<00:02:13.290> into

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
the bacteria break down the ammonia into

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.009 
the bacteria break down the ammonia into
usable<00:02:14.250> nitrogen<00:02:14.700> compounds<00:02:15.299> nitrite<00:02:15.810> and

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
usable nitrogen compounds nitrite and

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.770 
usable nitrogen compounds nitrite and
nitrate<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:17.130> plants<00:02:17.519> can<00:02:17.549> use<00:02:17.849> so<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.239> pump

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
nitrate that plants can use so I pump

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.280 
nitrate that plants can use so I pump
the<00:02:18.959> water<00:02:18.989> up<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.739> into<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.370> tube<00:02:20.700> system

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
the water up and into a tube system

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.410 
the water up and into a tube system
aquaponics<00:02:22.290> produces<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:23.099> lot<00:02:23.579> of<00:02:23.610> plant

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
aquaponics produces a lot of plant

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.930 
aquaponics produces a lot of plant
matter<00:02:24.569> in<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.959> very<00:02:25.140> short<00:02:25.200> amount<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.829> time

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
matter in a very short amount of time

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.270 
matter in a very short amount of time
after<00:02:26.940> flows<00:02:27.690> through<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.049> plants<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:29.010> gets

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
after flows through the plants it gets

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.460 
after flows through the plants it gets
fed<00:02:29.519> back

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
fed back

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.790 
fed back
and<00:02:31.590> into<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.970> fish<00:02:33.120> tank<00:02:33.150> again<00:02:33.630> weird<00:02:34.410> reuse

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
and into the fish tank again weird reuse

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.250 
and into the fish tank again weird reuse
so<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.520> recirculating<00:02:36.270> system<00:02:36.630> is<00:02:36.780> water<00:02:37.080> is

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
so the recirculating system is water is

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.320 
so the recirculating system is water is
constantly<00:02:37.470> being<00:02:37.830> recycled<00:02:38.340> which<00:02:39.060> means

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
constantly being recycled which means

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.230 
constantly being recycled which means
that<00:02:39.480> aquaponics<00:02:40.440> uses<00:02:41.010> ninety<00:02:41.520> percent<00:02:41.700> less

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
that aquaponics uses ninety percent less

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.240 
that aquaponics uses ninety percent less
water<00:02:42.630> than<00:02:43.190> agricultural<00:02:44.190> practices<00:02:44.640> today

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
water than agricultural practices today

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.340 
water than agricultural practices today
quite<00:02:47.250> well<00:02:47.490> for<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.910> little<00:02:48.060> hobby<00:02:48.360> system<00:02:48.900> but

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
quite well for a little hobby system but

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.440 
quite well for a little hobby system but
ultimately<00:02:49.920> what<00:02:50.130> we<00:02:50.250> need<00:02:50.460> is<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.850> pilot<00:02:51.360> study

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
ultimately what we need is a pilot study

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.240 
ultimately what we need is a pilot study
to<00:02:51.780> look<00:02:51.870> into<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.440> future<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.800> act<00:02:52.980> upon
