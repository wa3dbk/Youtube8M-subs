interesting point if they're kickers do
go<00:02:32.090> left<00:02:32.360> it's<00:02:32.690> always<00:02:33.320> short<00:02:33.740> never<00:02:34.430> long

opposite<00:02:41.530> 40%<00:02:42.530> go<00:02:42.710> long<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.070> left

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.540 

40%<00:02:48.860> goes<00:02:49.160> straight<00:02:49.490> down<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.880> middle

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890

and on the rare occasion they go right
it's<00:02:56.370> always<00:02:56.730> short<00:02:59.270> so<00:03:00.270> there<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.690> have<00:03:00.720> it

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
it's always short so there you have it

it's always short so there you have it
that<00:03:01.260> all<00:03:01.470> backs<00:03:01.710> are<00:03:01.890> predictable<00:03:02.820> and<00:03:03.000> what
