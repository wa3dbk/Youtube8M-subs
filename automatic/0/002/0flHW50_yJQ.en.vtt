00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.490 

it'll<00:02:56.760> look<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:57.000> little<00:02:57.150> streaky<00:02:57.810> sometimes

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
it'll look a little streaky sometimes

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.640 
it'll look a little streaky sometimes
sometimes<00:02:59.340> but<00:03:02.780> that's<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:04.290> will<00:03:04.440> naturally

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
sometimes but that's that will naturally

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.470 
sometimes but that's that will naturally
happen<00:03:05.130> because<00:03:05.460> that<00:03:05.610> nail-polish<00:03:06.120> is

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
happen because that nail-polish is

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.290 
happen because that nail-polish is
mixing<00:03:07.020> with<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.230> activator<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.150> can

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
mixing with the activator and you can

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.330 
mixing with the activator and you can
come<00:03:09.510> back<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.930> do<00:03:10.170> another<00:03:10.200> coat<00:03:10.800> since<00:03:11.220> I

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
come back and do another coat since I

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.740
