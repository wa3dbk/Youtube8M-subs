00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.650
 beauty talks to you 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.750
 today show a recipe of 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.030
 chicken with sweet potato I use as 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.810
 alternative in my diets 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.550
 here is 150 grams of chicken 150 grams 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.660
 of validators that would be one of my 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.690
 meals garlic onion and garlic 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.550
 I still use it to season oregano and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.670
 also a little salt of mine 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.500
 almaty 50% reduction of sodium then 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.329
 Meal would be more or less is this 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.480
 What I'm going to do I'm going to make one 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.890
 cookie or a croquette accompany the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.880
 process all to do this so I 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.890
 I'll use a food processor 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.630
 to shred well to return well to 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.840
 to make the cookie to do what the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.390
 I will not put the 150 grams of 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.820
 sweet potato 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:19.710
 I'll put the chicken 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.630
 the ideal is to put it all in pieces 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.310
 remembering that the swimmer if the chicken 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.979
 they are already cooked 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.190
 Sometimes I'm doing something with the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.009
 chicken also included and cooked in the oven 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.780
 I'd rather do it and be cooked 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.550
 chicken is struggling but it will take 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.110
 less time in the oven 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.130
 Now I'm going to put a little piece of 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:51.060
 there 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:02:02.420
 to and you will see a little oÃ© and to 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:02.420
 to haiti it's just a magic ball then 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.130
 people after processing it stays 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.890
 so all together with regard to 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.930
 seasonings you can also use the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.300
 rocket that's going to taste like 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.599
 each as you prefer 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.130
 so there now make the balls and the 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.130
 corsets and this now 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.160
 there you hand her the way you prefer 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.910
 This is the way the ball is a 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.910
 chicken potato sweet potato 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.310
 after all ready 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.900
 separate that I have two meals is 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.530
 put it in the oven as it is already 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.820
 ready everything cooked 20 minutes of oven 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.360
 is ready 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.360
 Let's wait 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.360
 remembering that the oven is already 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.090
 warm now just wait 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:23.760
 earned good guys time to take then 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:25.440
 oven and see how good it was 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.570
 just to talk then about 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.880
 maximum oven temperature 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.620
 to take less time to help 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.470
 golden as I said that everything was already 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.710
 cooked both sweet potato chicken and this 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.170
 result is the sum of champions and 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.600
