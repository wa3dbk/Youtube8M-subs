00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
you do you know voice acting versus the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.630 
you do you know voice acting versus the
live<00:00:24.510> acting<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.439> films<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.099> don't<00:00:26.400> know<00:00:26.490> that

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
live acting the films I don't know that

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.070 
live acting the films I don't know that
it's<00:00:26.789> necessarily<00:00:27.300> as<00:00:27.449> different<00:00:27.840> for<00:00:28.050> us

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
it's necessarily as different for us

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.779 
it's necessarily as different for us
because<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.650> still<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.099> prepare<00:00:29.250> you

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
because you still have to prepare you

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.519 
because you still have to prepare you
still<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.300> find<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.599> character<00:00:31.140> give

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
still have to find the character give

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.440 
still have to find the character give
yourself<00:00:31.830> over<00:00:31.980> do<00:00:32.430> all<00:00:32.550> those<00:00:32.669> things<00:00:32.880> but<00:00:33.360> I

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
yourself over do all those things but I

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.580 
yourself over do all those things but I
think<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:33.719> different<00:00:33.870> for<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.200> audience

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
think it's different for the audience

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.530 
think it's different for the audience
you<00:00:34.890> know<00:00:36.620> maybe<00:00:37.620> if<00:00:37.860> they<00:00:38.399> get<00:00:38.670> used<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.390> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
you know maybe if they get used to the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.119 
you know maybe if they get used to the
way<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.719> look<00:00:40.079> they<00:00:40.290> don't<00:00:40.410> get<00:00:40.620> distracted
