00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:03.829
 hello all welcome to post a comment union fnv allies 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.139
 i got two i dont like your homeland 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:10.869
 and a landslide 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:15.929
 I the first one to buy as a pietsie variant in Iraq said Kate's Good Cube 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.929
 he turned his 7 10 percent on 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:21.089
 of course not 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.179
 with a fight with fc twente and 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.230
 when i got it so you see but talking to anointed with 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.419
 do not know what was going on but not what every kind of sounding attacks 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.540
 to commit with your fingers tonight so no one stayed that way but afterwards 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.690
 pulled away anyway but I wouldn't let it fall away now 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.150
 in addition one out of two others we notice that they manufacture 55 hectares 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.870
 one of the four kilos and then of course 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.240
 the citizens do not paint the first 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.500
 produce 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.940
 and that appearance after a good 55 makes it 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.910
 I don't know anything about the club 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.350
 in addition, there is also a fourth time and that claim and the best 50 one of the 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.280
 made the world 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.260
 I don't know the details about it either 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.470
 I think I think your purchase is good 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.710
 whichever you notice you all the same way 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.980
 and they are all from the same corner 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.370
 there are 9 center blocks per side 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.370
 so most crisis 54 percent of the job 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.600
 the Republic 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.760
 In addition, there are also want 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.760
 can cubes per 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.399
 and can block three times 12 plus 36 for the whole can 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.720
 and in addition there are also 8 always 8 how cubes over the entire job 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.580
 so a lot of milk can be subdivided into categories 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.580
 I are the downtown of Lochristi are not fun at all but also can 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.650
 in addition, you also have the 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.600
 the center side dolls dwm they have to stand on the edge of the center 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.800
 In addition, you also have cent from Google 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.080
 so to speak 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.020
 one of the centers on the corner 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.050
 You can also place the cookies on number one, which means that you can have the outermost 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.050
 blocks you have the inner can grab 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:16.509
 before you start solving the fact that he perfectly rubiks cube 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:18.269
 you must in any case 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.759
 the three weekends 4 can resolve through the head again 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:25.149
 55 ushered in the same notation elsevier way here 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.409
 because we are not running the middle car 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.929
 as of the fourth final with 2 3 two sides simultaneously 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.399
 and then we indicate that with an asterisk and 8 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:40.479
 he stands here doing 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:43.479
 but the north does not bid exactly the same for an asterisk 8 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.049
 and that is almost impossible who closes the list of the OECD country 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.079
 a place in the stand on the file 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.020
 m 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.099
 didn't rename them either 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.099
 We are certain things that you do not necessarily know 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.009
 like most perry algorithms of the fourth 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:06.189
 cavities this can already be saved by psv camp locked up click here 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.519
 you should know that well because they must also be used on the 50m but all 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.639
 other core algorithms are not required 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.089
 on the facts 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:16.609
 use one in five and fifteen 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.369
 extra already hit by a car also very long 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:22.369
 but they are also doing well, so no other option 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:26.329
 Well having said that pieces still start solving the 50 free 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.029
 to be able to give 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:29.370
 and then I am referring to the flock of sheep
