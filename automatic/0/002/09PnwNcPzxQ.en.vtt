00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.660 
the nine tails like gonna happen not to
I<00:01:36.479> was<00:01:36.990> like<00:01:37.170> wait<00:01:37.530> didn't<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.009> got<00:01:38.189> much<00:01:38.430> more

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670

than that

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.800 
than that
I<00:01:39.270> thought<00:01:39.750> he<00:01:39.869> had<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.560> have<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:40.979> in

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
cocky but no year at the ninetails - so

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.330 
cocky but no year at the ninetails - so
that<00:01:44.930> means<00:01:45.110> mountain<00:01:45.619> will<00:01:45.770> be<00:01:45.890> like<00:01:46.070> don't
