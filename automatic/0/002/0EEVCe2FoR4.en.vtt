00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:17.080
 Let's knitting the second stage in the continuation of the frame knitting 8 stitches knitting placed in Hano 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:21.680
 In this basic edition, we will knit up to the 5th level 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:26.210
 If it rains that much, you will be able to get used to the basic knitting method 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:31.850
 I There is a sign unfamiliar look to display the knitting diagram of a two-stage 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.750
 However cogitate that there is no sense to say that this is put knitting it into the frame knitting in the same eye 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:38.460
 is 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:42.710
 There is no difference in how to weave only by repeating fine knitting twice 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:47.470
 Let's actually weave the end of the first step 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:51.210
 It is in the state of drawing the draw-knit on the first step fine-knit 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.210
 First, the rise of the chain stitch 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:04.940
 Next , we will put the top knitting into the top, so it won't count as the first one, so it's one step 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:08.380
 Put a key on the crochet head of your eyes again 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.380
 Masu Ten'ami the frame knitting 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.720
 People also quit 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.799
 And once more put the writing needle in the same place 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.799
 We knit top knitting 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.530
 We were able to now put knitting it into the frame knitting 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:46.040
 If you arrange it here, the needle on the head of the first step of the first step is drawn once when drawing out. 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.040
 Stab 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.970
 Across the chain stitch of rising 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.970
 Once at the first command 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.810
 In addition Hosoami once more 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:20.099
 You will have pierced a total of three times 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:26.909
 We put the two mesh in the second stage in the place was one of the network in the first stage 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:29.710
 So is easy to those of increase first to say to you personally good eyes and increase this, but in the book 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:35.260
 It is often better that says the widening stitch 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:39.660
 By the way, you may write this kind of sign to put on this crochet 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.660
 In this course I will use the letter v 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:49.459
 Then the woman after this will repeat the same thing according to the knitting pattern. 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.459
 The same eye stitches twice 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.630
 i 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.070
 2nd floor 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.250
 Once 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.910
 Second floor 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.980
 It has been repeated once, and the number has reached sixteen. 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.600

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:10.840
 234 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:14.060
 56 out of 789 out of 1 in 2 3 4

 1516 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.510
 And please be careful as it is easy to make mistakes from here 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:30.030
 Is not the future knit pull-out knitting 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:33.550
 Pull-out knitting and stand-up knitting are not counted as one person, so they can be skipped to make a second step 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:38.950
 Stitch a key needle and pull it out 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:44.340
 Inadvertently also in the eyes of the pull-out knitting will find or have become the Dan is in 18 people 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.340
 Be careful because it tends to pull out and knit in the eyes of a face-knit 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:52.560
 Silk flag and Mito 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:56.090
 Skip the knitting and put the needle in the second step. 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.090
 And it is a plucking knitting 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:06.980
 The second stage ends now With this condition Let's advance to the third stage next time 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.980
 I was tired customers
