00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
cost more when really in actuality they

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.130 
cost more when really in actuality they
don't<00:02:25.590> cost<00:02:25.920> more<00:02:26.280> because<00:02:27.060> whenever<00:02:27.750> you're

but<00:02:32.040> buying<00:02:32.579> uniforms<00:02:33.239> made<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.660> that

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
but buying uniforms made you that

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.539 
but buying uniforms made you that
someone's<00:02:34.079> going<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.260> wear<00:02:34.410> two<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:35.220> four

years in advance

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.910 
years in advance
I<00:02:36.840> mean<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.709> cost<00:02:38.010> for<00:02:38.459> uniforms<00:02:38.940> is<00:02:39.060> way<00:02:39.299> less

I mean the cost for uniforms is way less
another<00:02:40.920> point<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.280> people<00:02:41.430> make<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:41.940> that

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
another point that people make is that

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.990 
another point that people make is that
if<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:43.380> school<00:02:43.620> switches<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.220> wearing<00:02:44.459> uniforms

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
conclusion I just want to say that I

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.340 
conclusion I just want to say that I
believe<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:41.820> uniforms<00:03:42.270> are<00:03:42.420> beneficial<00:03:43.080> for

students whether they really believe it
or<00:03:45.030> not<00:03:45.180> because<00:03:45.540> that's<00:03:45.660> what<00:03:45.870> happened<00:03:46.170> to

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
or not because that's what happened to

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.560 
or not because that's what happened to
me<00:03:46.380> when<00:03:46.800> I<00:03:46.860> came<00:03:46.980> out<00:03:47.400> of<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.640> school<00:03:47.940> that
