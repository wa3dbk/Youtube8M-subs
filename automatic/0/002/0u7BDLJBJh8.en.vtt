started<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.680> video<00:01:12.799> this<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.369> TIE

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
started with this video this is a TIE

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.910 
started with this video this is a TIE
fighter<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.810> as<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.079> can<00:01:16.200> probably<00:01:16.259> already

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
fighter and as you can probably already

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.450 
fighter and as you can probably already
tell<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.880> TIE<00:01:18.090> fighter<00:01:18.359> is<00:01:18.600> much<00:01:19.159> larger<00:01:20.159> than

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
tell the TIE fighter is much larger than

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.179 
tell the TIE fighter is much larger than
an<00:01:20.759> actual<00:01:21.240> scale<00:01:21.630> model<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.740> TIE<00:01:22.979> fighter

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
an actual scale model of the TIE fighter

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.830 
an actual scale model of the TIE fighter
it<00:01:23.340> should<00:01:23.520> actually<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:23.880> smaller<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.810> I

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
it should actually be smaller but I

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.810 
it should actually be smaller but I
wanted<00:01:25.109> to<00:01:25.170> make<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.560> larger<00:01:26.009> version<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.640> eh

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
wanted to make a larger version of it eh

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.039 
wanted to make a larger version of it eh
because<00:01:27.630> minecraft<00:01:28.320> using<00:01:28.950> blocks<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:30.810> Lord

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
because minecraft using blocks the Lord

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.959 
because minecraft using blocks the Lord
the<00:01:31.229> bigger<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.679> more<00:01:32.189> detail<00:01:32.759> that's

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
the bigger it is the more detail that's

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:34.849 
the bigger it is the more detail that's
going<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.299> be<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.439> would<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.649> made<00:01:34.710> it

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
going to be and if I would have made it

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.169 
going to be and if I would have made it
smaller<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.369> would<00:01:35.429> have<00:01:35.549> been<00:01:35.670> thick<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.030> would

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
smaller it would have been thick I would

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.340 
smaller it would have been thick I would
have<00:01:36.270> taken<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.479> lot<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.630> detail<00:01:36.960> out<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.259> and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
have taken a lot of detail out of it and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.499 
have taken a lot of detail out of it and
I<00:01:37.380> wanted<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.619> put<00:01:37.799> as<00:01:37.859> much<00:01:37.979> detail<00:01:38.189> into<00:01:38.640> it

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
I wanted to put as much detail into it

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.660 
I wanted to put as much detail into it
as<00:01:39.750> possible<00:01:40.289> because<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:41.070> wanted<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.549> look

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
as possible because I wanted it to look

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.480 
as possible because I wanted it to look
the<00:01:41.820> best<00:01:41.969> that<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.240> could<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.990> um<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.859> also<00:01:44.159> did

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.060 
the inside of it and I will take you
into<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.219> towards<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.939> end<00:01:48.090> if<00:01:48.929> right<00:01:49.890> so

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
into it towards the end if right so

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.859 
into it towards the end if right so
right<00:01:50.280> now<00:01:50.429> it's<00:01:50.700> designed<00:01:51.179> so<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.539> it<00:01:51.749> you

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
right now it's designed so that it you

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.779 
right now it's designed so that it you
can<00:01:52.049> actually<00:01:52.289> write<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.009> like<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.700> know

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
can actually write in it like you know

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.520 
can actually write in it like you know
so<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.179> the<00:01:54.479> pilot<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.929> actually<00:01:55.320> drive

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
so that the pilot can actually drive

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.440 
so that the pilot can actually drive
around<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:55.979> TIE<00:01:56.100> fighter<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:56.579> since<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
around in the TIE fighter but since the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.639 
around in the TIE fighter but since the
TIE<00:01:57.600> fighter<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.990> bigger<00:01:58.200> than<00:01:58.409> what<00:01:58.560> it

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
TIE fighter is bigger than what it

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.249 
TIE fighter is bigger than what it
should<00:01:58.679> be<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.219> am<00:01:59.759> considering<00:02:00.659> maybe<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.170> a

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
should be I am considering maybe in a

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.469 
should be I am considering maybe in a
later<00:02:01.439> video<00:02:01.670> redoing<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.850> inside<00:02:03.179> and

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
later video redoing the inside and

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.840 
later video redoing the inside and
making<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.929> into<00:02:04.079> like<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.590> house<00:02:04.859> so<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:05.759> a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
making it into like a house so it's a

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.370 
making it into like a house so it's a
house<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.299> looks<00:02:06.509> like<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.899> Thai<00:02:07.109> fighter

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
house that looks like a Thai fighter

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.710 
house that looks like a Thai fighter
ship<00:02:07.799> but<00:02:08.490> you<00:02:08.610> actually<00:02:08.820> can<00:02:09.120> live<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.540> and

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
ship but you actually can live in it and

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.470 
ship but you actually can live in it and
then<00:02:10.229> your<00:02:10.470> your<00:02:10.710> front<00:02:11.040> window<00:02:11.490> or<00:02:12.210> whatever

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
then your your front window or whatever

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.610 
then your your front window or whatever
would<00:02:12.630> be<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.620> front<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.190> the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
would be the front of the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.660 
would be the front of the
fighter<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.010> could<00:02:15.129> look<00:02:15.250> out<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.459> you'd

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
and your two controls and left and right

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.390 
and your two controls and left and right
and<00:03:43.569> boom<00:03:44.169> you're<00:03:44.410> looking<00:03:44.709> out<00:03:44.859> and<00:03:45.099> you're

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
and boom you're looking out and you're

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.640 
and boom you're looking out and you're
driving<00:03:45.730> so<00:03:46.150> this<00:03:46.269> is<00:03:46.359> where<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.599> pilot<00:03:46.959> would

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
driving so this is where the pilot would

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.030 
driving so this is where the pilot would
be<00:03:47.799> sitting<00:03:48.010> where<00:03:48.160> I'm<00:03:48.280> at<00:03:48.430> right<00:03:48.459> now<00:03:48.639> so

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
be sitting where I'm at right now so

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.770 
be sitting where I'm at right now so
obviously<00:03:51.040> this<00:03:51.220> is<00:03:51.280> all<00:03:51.519> there<00:03:51.639> is<00:03:51.669> just<00:03:52.660> a

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
obviously this is all there is just a

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.839 
obviously this is all there is just a
window<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.379> the<00:03:53.440> seat<00:03:53.650> but<00:03:54.310> there's<00:03:54.669> actually

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
window and the seat but there's actually

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.970 
window and the seat but there's actually
more<00:03:55.269> space<00:03:55.599> in<00:03:55.780> here<00:03:55.900> I<00:03:55.959> just<00:03:56.019> filled<00:03:56.500> it<00:03:56.650> up

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
more space in here I just filled it up

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.559 
more space in here I just filled it up
because<00:03:57.370> I<00:03:57.400> didn't<00:03:57.760> want<00:03:57.910> there<00:03:58.180> to<00:03:58.209> be<00:03:58.299> that

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
because I didn't want there to be that

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.839 
because I didn't want there to be that
much<00:03:58.810> space<00:03:59.169> in<00:03:59.470> this<00:03:59.650> so<00:04:00.129> what<00:04:00.280> I<00:04:00.310> can<00:04:00.430> do<00:04:00.639> is<00:04:00.760> I

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
much space in this so what I can do is I

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.610 
much space in this so what I can do is I
can<00:04:00.910> actually<00:04:01.150> get<00:04:01.480> rid<00:04:01.599> of<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.810> floor<00:04:02.049> and

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
can actually get rid of the floor and

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.229 
can actually get rid of the floor and
get<00:04:02.799> rid<00:04:02.949> of<00:04:02.980> all<00:04:03.250> these<00:04:03.459> sidewalls<00:04:04.030> and

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
get rid of all these sidewalls and

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.610 
get rid of all these sidewalls and
expand<00:04:04.690> it<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:04.870> little<00:04:05.019> bit<00:04:05.169> and<00:04:05.230> actually<00:04:05.349> make

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
expand it a little bit and actually make

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.559 
expand it a little bit and actually make
a<00:04:05.650> house<00:04:05.859> out<00:04:06.069> of<00:04:06.099> it<00:04:06.280> but<00:04:06.790> that<00:04:06.940> is<00:04:07.090> a<00:04:07.120> that's
