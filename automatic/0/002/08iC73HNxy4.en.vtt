think is the best place to show tropical
Skyrim<00:00:16.619> because<00:00:16.890> it's<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.310> south<00:00:17.520> and

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
Skyrim because it's in the south and

Skyrim because it's in the south and
it's<00:00:17.880> already<00:00:18.180> very<00:00:18.270> dense<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.810> forest<00:00:19.230> next

density and it fits well with tropical

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.690
