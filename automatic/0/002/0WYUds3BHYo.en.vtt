00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
of room in this area and so I just

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.639 
of room in this area and so I just
decided<00:01:42.850> to<00:01:43.299> try<00:01:43.570> these<00:01:43.630> out<00:01:43.990> I<00:01:44.259> know<00:01:44.350> they're

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
decided to try these out I know they're

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:45.630 
decided to try these out I know they're
not<00:01:44.680> high<00:01:45.039> tops

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
not high tops

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.090 
not high tops
um<00:01:45.820> yeah<00:01:46.780> they're<00:01:47.020> low<00:01:47.259> tops<00:01:47.560> which<00:01:47.950> is

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
um yeah they're low tops which is

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.249 
um yeah they're low tops which is
totally<00:01:48.490> fine<00:01:48.520> but<00:01:49.420> they<00:01:49.539> do<00:01:49.600> have<00:01:49.869> a<00:01:49.899> lot<00:01:50.229> of

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
totally fine but they do have a lot of

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.730 
totally fine but they do have a lot of
room<00:01:50.649> like<00:01:51.130> up<00:01:51.369> in<00:01:51.640> here<00:01:52.060> so<00:01:52.719> that's<00:01:53.020> good<00:01:53.409> and

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
room like up in here so that's good and

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.190 
room like up in here so that's good and
then<00:01:54.729> I<00:01:54.939> think<00:01:55.180> that's<00:01:55.359> going<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.689> help<00:01:55.899> to

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
then I think that's going to help to

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.980 
then I think that's going to help to
heal<00:01:57.070> up<00:01:57.340> this<00:01:57.520> pinched<00:01:57.850> nerve<00:01:58.210> really<00:01:58.630> fast

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
heal up this pinched nerve really fast

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.319 
heal up this pinched nerve really fast
because<00:01:59.859> basically<00:02:00.100> what<00:02:00.520> happens<00:02:00.909> is<00:02:01.060> I<00:02:01.149> go

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
because basically what happens is I go

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.779 
because basically what happens is I go
to<00:02:01.359> skate<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.020> those<00:02:02.740> those<00:02:03.280> two<00:02:03.520> bones

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
to skate and those those two bones

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.149 
to skate and those those two bones
basically<00:02:04.390> collapse<00:02:04.810> together<00:02:05.020> hit<00:02:05.950> that

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
basically collapse together hit that

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.950 
basically collapse together hit that
pinched<00:02:06.460> nerve<00:02:06.759> and<00:02:07.000> then<00:02:07.090> that's<00:02:07.329> that's

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
pinched nerve and then that's that's

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.749 
pinched nerve and then that's that's
pain<00:02:08.320> that<00:02:08.710> hurts<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.190> then<00:02:09.280> I<00:02:09.399> can't<00:02:09.640> really

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
pain that hurts and then I can't really

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.360 
pain that hurts and then I can't really
skate<00:02:10.149> very<00:02:10.390> well<00:02:10.630> so<00:02:11.170> yeah<00:02:11.740> just<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.070> give<00:02:12.250> you

a little background that's

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.570 
a little background that's
the<00:02:13.849> reason<00:02:14.810> for<00:02:14.989> this<00:02:15.170> switch<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:15.950> yeah<00:02:16.370> I've

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
the reason for this switch and yeah I've

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.789 
the reason for this switch and yeah I've
always<00:02:16.849> wanted<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.330> try<00:02:17.569> Nikes<00:02:18.049> obviously

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
always wanted to try Nikes obviously

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.640 
always wanted to try Nikes obviously

a couple thing about these shoes that I

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.170 
a couple thing about these shoes that I
really<00:02:33.110> like<00:02:33.349> is<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.769> tongue<00:02:34.069> is<00:02:34.340> like

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
really like is the tongue is like

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.150 
really like is the tongue is like
extremely<00:02:35.720> connected<00:02:36.379> to<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.680> rest<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:37.069> the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
extremely connected to the rest of the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.800 
extremely connected to the rest of the
shoe<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.700> know<00:02:37.910> that<00:02:38.150> sounds<00:02:38.480> kind<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:38.750> weird

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
shoe I know that sounds kind of weird

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.650 
shoe I know that sounds kind of weird
but<00:02:39.319> it's<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.739> little<00:02:40.040> it's<00:02:40.730> more<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:41.269> than<00:02:41.510> any

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
but it's a little it's more so than any

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.449 
but it's a little it's more so than any
other<00:02:41.900> shoe<00:02:42.200> I've<00:02:42.349> really<00:02:42.650> skated<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.159> think

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
other shoe I've really skated I think

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.449 
other shoe I've really skated I think
and<00:02:44.000> it<00:02:44.299> just<00:02:44.510> forms<00:02:45.230> really<00:02:45.650> well<00:02:46.069> to<00:02:46.340> the

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
and it just forms really well to the

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.580 
and it just forms really well to the
rest<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:46.970> shoe<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:47.930> I<00:02:47.959> feel<00:02:48.230> like<00:02:48.260> that's

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
rest of the shoe so I feel like that's

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.030 
rest of the shoe so I feel like that's
going<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:48.950> give<00:02:49.160> me<00:02:49.190> some<00:02:49.849> nice<00:02:50.090> like<00:02:50.769> just<00:02:51.769> I

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
going to give me some nice like just I

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.770 
going to give me some nice like just I
don't<00:02:52.640> know<00:02:52.790> I<00:02:53.060> don't<00:02:53.150> know<00:02:53.239> how<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.450> describe

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
don't know I don't know how to describe

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.360 
don't know I don't know how to describe
it<00:02:53.900> exactly<00:02:54.049> but<00:02:54.470> your<00:02:54.590> foot<00:02:54.799> goes<00:02:55.010> in<00:02:55.190> there

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
it exactly but your foot goes in there

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.039 
it exactly but your foot goes in there
and<00:02:55.579> it's<00:02:55.790> like<00:02:55.849> your<00:02:56.090> foots<00:02:56.329> not<00:02:56.510> coming<00:02:56.930> out

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
and it's like your foots not coming out

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.130 
and it's like your foots not coming out
so<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.560> lot<00:02:57.739> of<00:02:57.890> support<00:02:58.400> in<00:02:58.609> terms<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.599> that<00:02:59.810> and

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
so a lot of support in terms of that and

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.930 
so a lot of support in terms of that and
then<00:03:00.650> other<00:03:00.829> than<00:03:00.890> that<00:03:01.190> I<00:03:01.430> mean<00:03:01.730> they're

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:35.289 
you land the first kickflip then the
shoes<00:03:29.840> are<00:03:29.989> going<00:03:30.139> to<00:03:30.200> skate<00:03:30.470> well<00:03:34.090> let's<00:03:35.090> say

shoes are going to skate well let's say

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.640 
shoes are going to skate well let's say
a<00:03:35.329> warm<00:03:36.109> up

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
a warm up

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.640 
a warm up
kickflip<00:03:37.489> challenge<00:03:38.030> after<00:03:38.349> getting<00:03:39.349> over<00:03:39.470> a

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
kickflip challenge after getting over a

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.839 
kickflip challenge after getting over a
pinched<00:03:40.190> nerve<00:03:40.280> kickflip<00:03:42.280> but<00:03:43.280> I<00:03:43.310> landed<00:03:43.730> it

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
pinched nerve kickflip but I landed it

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.170 
pinched nerve kickflip but I landed it
landed<00:03:43.970> two<00:03:44.359> in<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.540> row<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:46.400> real<00:03:46.579> test<00:03:46.910> here<00:03:47.150> I

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
landed two in a row the real test here I

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:54.970 
landed two in a row the real test here I
guess<00:03:47.450> is<00:03:47.480> double<00:03:47.989> flip<00:03:53.470> pretty<00:03:54.470> close<00:03:54.650> close

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
guess is double flip pretty close close

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.129 
guess is double flip pretty close close
