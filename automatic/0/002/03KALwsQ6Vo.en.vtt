what<00:00:00.539> do<00:00:00.719> we<00:00:00.840> think<00:00:00.870> we've<00:00:01.709> got<00:00:01.949> blue<00:00:02.370> so<00:00:03.149> we

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
what do we think we've got blue so we

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.210 
what do we think we've got blue so we
can<00:00:03.449> choose<00:00:03.689> something<00:00:04.020> like<00:00:04.319> orange<00:00:04.890> or

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
can choose something like orange or

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.639 
can choose something like orange or
beige<00:00:05.460> which<00:00:05.879> is<00:00:06.029> complementary<00:00:06.330> it<00:00:07.020> is<00:00:07.620> a

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
beige which is complementary it is a

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.520 
beige which is complementary it is a
fundamental<00:00:08.550> rule<00:00:08.820> when<00:00:09.330> painting<00:00:09.660> because

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
fundamental rule when painting because

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.070 
fundamental rule when painting because
there<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.830> nothing<00:00:11.130> more<00:00:11.639> unnerving<00:00:12.389> than

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
there is nothing more unnerving than

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.839 
there is nothing more unnerving than
having<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.469> white<00:00:13.710> canvas<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.370> not<00:00:14.610> knowing

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
having a white canvas and not knowing

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:29.890 
having a white canvas and not knowing
where<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.299> start

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.679 

I<00:00:29.960> start<00:00:30.830> by<00:00:31.039> putting<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:31.670> darkest<00:00:32.210> shadows

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
I start by putting the darkest shadows

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.840 
I start by putting the darkest shadows
and<00:00:32.930> the<00:00:32.989> lightest<00:00:33.470> highlights<00:00:33.950> in<00:00:34.190> first

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:45.400 

approximate<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.000> position<00:00:38.030> of<00:00:38.510> objects<00:00:44.410> work

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
approximate the position of objects work

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.470 
approximate the position of objects work
on<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:45.770> painting<00:00:46.190> as<00:00:46.370> a<00:00:46.400> whole<00:00:46.730> as<00:00:47.000> much<00:00:47.300> as

on the painting as a whole as much as

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:56.530 
on the painting as a whole as much as
possible<00:00:54.460> now<00:00:55.460> we're<00:00:55.640> dividing<00:00:55.910> the<00:00:56.180> painting

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
possible now we're dividing the painting

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.619 
possible now we're dividing the painting
into<00:00:56.809> its<00:00:56.960> sections<00:00:57.470> a<00:00:58.089> band<00:00:59.089> of<00:00:59.269> highlight

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
into its sections a band of highlight

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.460 
into its sections a band of highlight
across<00:00:59.870> there<00:01:00.320> and<00:01:00.350> across<00:01:00.710> there<00:01:02.290> we've<00:01:03.290> got

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
across there and across there we've got

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.439 
across there and across there we've got
it<00:01:03.559> set<00:01:03.589> we<00:01:04.070> have<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:04.280> foreground<00:01:04.790> mid-ground

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
it set we have the foreground mid-ground

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:16.300 
it set we have the foreground mid-ground
and<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.530> distance

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.620 

use<00:01:17.310> your<00:01:17.460> hands<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.969> feet<00:01:18.329> if<00:01:18.570> necessary<00:01:20.630> we

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
use your hands and feet if necessary we

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:49.240 
use your hands and feet if necessary we
work<00:01:21.840> as<00:01:22.049> fast<00:01:22.289> as<00:01:22.649> possible
