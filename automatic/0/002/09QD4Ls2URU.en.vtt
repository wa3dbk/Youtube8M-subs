about<00:02:22.410> 10<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.070> 12<00:02:23.510> scoops<00:02:24.510> into<00:02:25.320> your<00:02:26.310> 22

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
about 10 to 12 scoops into your 22

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.390 
about 10 to 12 scoops into your 22
ounces<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:29.370> roughly<00:02:30.000> comes<00:02:30.780> out<00:02:30.959> to

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
ounces and that roughly comes out to

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.780 
ounces and that roughly comes out to
about<00:02:32.400> 1,400<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.600> 1600<00:02:34.170> calories<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:34.920> you'll

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
about 1,400 to 1600 calories and you'll

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.250 
about 1,400 to 1600 calories and you'll
get<00:02:35.880> something<00:02:36.090> that's<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.600> is<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.900> radius

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
get something that's this is it radius

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.720 
get something that's this is it radius
the<00:02:37.500> finalized<00:02:37.920> product<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.520> I<00:02:38.550> made

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
the finalized product that I made

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.380 
the finalized product that I made
already<00:02:38.910> but<00:02:39.690> this<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:40.190> about<00:02:41.190> 15<00:02:41.760> 600

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
already but this is about 15 600

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.750 
already but this is about 15 600
calories<00:02:42.980> maybe<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.100> little<00:02:44.250> bit<00:02:44.430> more<00:02:44.640> because

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
calories maybe a little bit more because

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.020 
calories maybe a little bit more because
I<00:02:44.970> put<00:02:45.150> about<00:02:45.360> 12<00:02:45.660> scoops<00:02:45.989> in<00:02:46.170> there<00:02:46.880> but<00:02:47.880> you

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
I put about 12 scoops in there but you

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.340 
I put about 12 scoops in there but you
want<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.180> make<00:02:48.270> it<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.480> little<00:02:48.630> less<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:49.170> little

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
want to make it a little less a little

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.850 
want to make it a little less a little
bit<00:02:50.010> less<00:02:50.190> thick<00:02:50.550> some<00:02:51.390> people<00:02:51.660> like<00:02:51.810> then<00:02:52.500> you

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
bit less thick some people like then you

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.470 
bit less thick some people like then you
can<00:02:53.010> probably<00:02:53.250> get<00:02:53.580> about<00:02:54.950> two<00:02:56.180> scoops<00:02:57.180> of

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
can probably get about two scoops of

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.630 
can probably get about two scoops of
opportunity<00:02:58.230> calories<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.130> get<00:02:59.400> 10

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
opportunity calories and you get 10

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.150 
opportunity calories and you get 10
scooped<00:02:59.910> without<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.239> 1,400<00:03:00.810> calories<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.440> a

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
scooped without the 1,400 calories and a

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.060 
scooped without the 1,400 calories and a
22<00:03:02.459> ounce<00:03:02.730> bottle<00:03:03.300> as<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.470> can<00:03:04.530> see<00:03:04.709> here<00:03:04.920> with

22 ounce bottle as you can see here with

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.550 
22 ounce bottle as you can see here with
my<00:03:05.220> mini<00:03:05.640> math<00:03:05.880> so<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.780> can<00:03:06.959> take<00:03:07.110> that<00:03:07.260> and

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
my mini math so you can take that and

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.190 
my mini math so you can take that and
put<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:08.190> with<00:03:08.790> about<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.090> quarter<00:03:09.330> of<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.660> 25

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
put it with about a quarter of that 25

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.810 
put it with about a quarter of that 25
ounces<00:03:10.410> into<00:03:10.680> your<00:03:10.769> five<00:03:10.980> ounce<00:03:11.220> gel<00:03:11.489> flask

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
ounces into your five ounce gel flask

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.000 
ounces into your five ounce gel flask
which<00:03:12.120> seems<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.450> be<00:03:12.510> about<00:03:12.720> standard<00:03:13.260> for

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
which seems to be about standard for

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.229 
which seems to be about standard for
jelf<00:03:14.220> last<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.790> that's<00:03:14.970> equals<00:03:15.330> like<00:03:16.049> 400

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
jelf last and that's equals like 400

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.430 
jelf last and that's equals like 400
calories<00:03:18.239> they<00:03:18.360> make<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.540> little<00:03:18.750> thicker<00:03:18.989> then

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
calories they make a little thicker then

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.440 
calories they make a little thicker then
you're<00:03:19.620> going<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.769> get<00:03:19.920> like<00:03:20.130> 500<00:03:20.880> calories<00:03:21.299> or

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
you're going to get like 500 calories or

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.050 
you're going to get like 500 calories or
a<00:03:21.720> little<00:03:21.989> bit<00:03:22.080> more<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.410> then<00:03:22.880> that<00:03:23.880> comes

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
a little bit more and then that comes

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.940 
a little bit more and then that comes
out<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.360> about<00:03:26.930> 100<00:03:27.930> calories<00:03:28.049> eating

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
out to about 100 calories eating

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.000 
out to about 100 calories eating
equaling<00:03:29.670> about<00:03:30.000> one<00:03:30.450> ounce<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.709> it's<00:03:31.920> about

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
equaling about one ounce so it's about

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.820 
equaling about one ounce so it's about
it<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.580> same<00:03:32.730> as<00:03:32.790> what<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.030> get<00:03:33.350> in<00:03:34.350> any<00:03:34.560> gel

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
it the same as what you get in any gel

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.460 
it the same as what you get in any gel
that<00:03:34.860> you<00:03:35.100> buy<00:03:35.670> anywhere<00:03:36.120> but<00:03:36.900> in<00:03:37.170> this<00:03:37.290> case

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
that you buy anywhere but in this case

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.949 
that you buy anywhere but in this case
you<00:03:37.620> make<00:03:37.769> it<00:03:37.890> by<00:03:37.980> yourself<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.780> makes<00:03:39.780> you

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
you make it by yourself and makes you

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.620 
you make it by yourself and makes you
race<00:03:40.380> better<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:40.920> it's<00:03:41.340> exactly<00:03:42.030> cheap<00:03:42.480> or

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
race better and it's exactly cheap or

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.450 
race better and it's exactly cheap or
two<00:03:42.750> so<00:03:44.000> hope<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.060> enjoyed<00:03:45.420> it
