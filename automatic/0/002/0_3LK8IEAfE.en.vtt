this for God freeze it would actually

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.380 
this for God freeze it would actually
pay<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> bit<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.890> homage<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.579> GT<00:00:57.000> cannon

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
pay a bit of homage to the GT cannon

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.830 
pay a bit of homage to the GT cannon
which<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.780> now<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.109> course<00:00:58.289> been<00:00:59.070> left<00:00:59.370> behind

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
which is now of course been left behind

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.599 
which is now of course been left behind
this<00:01:00.840> one's<00:01:01.079> pretty<00:01:01.289> cool<00:01:01.530> too<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:02.370> less

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
this one's pretty cool too it's less

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.609 
this one's pretty cool too it's less
exaggerated<00:01:03.329> than<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> last<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.320> like<00:01:04.470> it

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
exaggerated than the last and I like it

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.620 
exaggerated than the last and I like it
a<00:01:04.650> lot<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:05.070> do<00:01:05.400> tend<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.880> think<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.240> freezes

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
a lot I do tend to think that freezes

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.960 
a lot I do tend to think that freezes
smaller<00:01:06.990> forms<00:01:07.470> are<00:01:07.710> usually<00:01:08.430> cooler<00:01:08.790> than

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
smaller forms are usually cooler than

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.820 
smaller forms are usually cooler than
the<00:01:09.060> large<00:01:09.270> ones<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.380> actually<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the large ones so this is actually a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.530 
the large ones so this is actually a
good<00:01:11.040> way<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.280> make<00:01:11.549> them<00:01:11.700> stay<00:01:11.970> small<00:01:12.299> but

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
good way to make them stay small but

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.560 
good way to make them stay small but
still<00:01:12.780> look<00:01:12.960> powerful<00:01:13.549> this<00:01:14.549> one's<00:01:14.880> very<00:01:15.000> cool

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
still look powerful this one's very cool

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.960 
still look powerful this one's very cool
it<00:01:16.140> reminds<00:01:16.530> me<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.710> coolers<00:01:17.189> final<00:01:17.549> form<00:01:17.759> and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
it reminds me of coolers final form and

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.940 
it reminds me of coolers final form and
I<00:01:18.720> think<00:01:18.930> something<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.530> would<00:01:19.740> pay

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
I think something like this would pay

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.520 
I think something like this would pay
homage<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.729> non-canonical<00:01:21.360> DBZ<00:01:22.200> cooler

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
homage to the non-canonical DBZ cooler

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.130 
homage to the non-canonical DBZ cooler
movies<00:01:22.799> which<00:01:23.369> while<00:01:23.640> aren't<00:01:24.090> canonical<00:01:24.720> are

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
movies which while aren't canonical are

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.130 
movies which while aren't canonical are
still<00:01:25.500> super<00:01:26.130> awesome<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.360> looks<00:01:27.600> pure

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
still super awesome this one looks pure

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.590 
still super awesome this one looks pure
evil<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:29.100> love<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.610> Frieza<00:01:30.240> doesn't

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
evil and I love it Frieza doesn't

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.510 
evil and I love it Frieza doesn't
usually<00:01:30.960> look<00:01:31.170> as<00:01:31.380> evil<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.860> menacing<00:01:32.280> as<00:01:32.400> he

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
usually look as evil and menacing as he

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.580 
usually look as evil and menacing as he
really<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.810> design<00:01:34.140> does<00:01:34.380> him

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
really is but this design does him

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.490 
really is but this design does him
justice<00:01:35.329> while<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.360> only<00:01:36.630> find<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.110> design<00:01:37.350> of
