set up it does take quite some time but
okay<00:01:05.210> so<00:01:05.299> the<00:01:05.479> first<00:01:05.659> thing<00:01:05.810> that<00:01:05.840> watch<00:01:06.200> is

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
okay so the first thing that watch is

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.170

asking<00:01:06.740> me<00:01:06.860> is<00:01:06.920> which<00:01:07.159> language<00:01:07.549> do<00:01:07.700> I<00:01:07.759> want<00:01:08.000> so

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
asking me is which language do I want so

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.249 
asking me is which language do I want so
obviously<00:01:08.570> I'm<00:01:08.689> going<00:01:08.780> to<00:01:08.869> choose<00:01:09.049> English

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
obviously I'm going to choose English

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.380 
obviously I'm going to choose English
and<00:01:09.650> so<00:01:09.860> now<00:01:10.159> it<00:01:10.340> says<00:01:10.520> open<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.970> Apple<00:01:11.270> watch

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
and so now it says open the Apple watch

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.870 
and so now it says open the Apple watch
app<00:01:11.720> on<00:01:11.930> your<00:01:12.140> iPhone<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:12.770> tap<00:01:13.040> start<00:01:13.430> pairing

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.090 
app on your iPhone and tap start pairing
so<00:01:14.240> when<00:01:14.659> I<00:01:14.689> come<00:01:14.929> to<00:01:15.020> my<00:01:15.109> iPhone<00:01:15.259> open<00:01:15.890> up<00:01:15.979> the

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
so when I come to my iPhone open up the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.910

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:26.359 
pair the device know there's a bit of

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:27.969 
pair the device know there's a bit of
reflection<00:01:26.600> from<00:01:26.929> the<00:01:27.109> lights<00:01:27.289> but<00:01:27.560> let's<00:01:27.799> go

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
reflection from the lights but let's go

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.359 
reflection from the lights but let's go
ahead<00:01:28.189> and<00:01:28.369> give<00:01:29.060> this<00:01:29.240> a<00:01:29.420> shot<00:01:30.109> alright<00:01:30.920> let's

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
ahead and give this a shot alright let's

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.730 
ahead and give this a shot alright let's
do<00:01:31.549> it<00:01:32.200> let's<00:01:33.200> see<00:01:33.409> how<00:01:33.530> this<00:01:33.649> works<00:01:33.920> okay<00:01:35.740> so

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
do it let's see how this works okay so

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.550 
do it let's see how this works okay so
it<00:01:36.799> says<00:01:36.979> your<00:01:37.130> Apple<00:01:37.549> watch<00:01:37.579> is<00:01:37.999> paired<00:01:38.560> but

thinking<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.230> can<00:02:18.290> just<00:02:18.530> use<00:02:18.650> your<00:02:18.800> iPhone<00:02:19.100> as

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
thinking you can just use your iPhone as

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.410 
thinking you can just use your iPhone as
you<00:02:19.310> normally<00:02:19.460> want<00:02:19.820> just<00:02:20.000> click<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.300> home

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.480 
you normally want just click the home
button<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.780> exit<00:02:21.050> Apple<00:02:21.380> watch<00:02:21.560> setup<00:02:21.980> so

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
button to exit Apple watch setup so

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.020 
button to exit Apple watch setup so

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
that's it

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.370 
that's it
so<00:02:23.420> now<00:02:23.540> it's<00:02:23.660> just<00:02:23.720> thinking<00:02:24.110> at<00:02:24.200> this<00:02:24.290> point

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
so now it's just thinking at this point

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.580 
so now it's just thinking at this point
I<00:02:24.710> figure<00:02:24.980> go<00:02:25.430> on<00:02:25.670> restore<00:02:26.420> pairing<00:02:26.720> but

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
I figure go on restore pairing but

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.810 
I figure go on restore pairing but
basically<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.100> I<00:02:28.130> could<00:02:28.310> just<00:02:28.460> go<00:02:28.610> about<00:02:28.700> my

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
basically so I could just go about my

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.000 
basically so I could just go about my
day<00:02:28.970> on<00:02:29.120> my<00:02:29.390> phone<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:29.900> my<00:02:30.320> Apple<00:02:30.650> watch<00:02:30.800> is

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
day on my phone and my Apple watch is

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.350 
day on my phone and my Apple watch is
setting<00:02:31.250> itself<00:02:31.490> up<00:02:31.670> as<00:02:31.850> you<00:02:31.940> can<00:02:32.060> see<00:02:32.180> there's

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
setting itself up as you can see there's

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.910 
setting itself up as you can see there's
a<00:02:32.390> little<00:02:32.510> loading<00:02:32.840> screen<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.320> don't<00:02:33.530> know<00:02:33.740> how

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
a little loading screen I don't know how

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.320 
a little loading screen I don't know how
long<00:02:34.130> this<00:02:34.340> is<00:02:34.370> going<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.640> take<00:02:34.790> hopefully<00:02:35.180> not

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
long this is going to take hopefully not

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.730 
long this is going to take hopefully not
too<00:02:35.510> long<00:02:35.720> as<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:36.200> can<00:02:36.350> see<00:02:36.470> on<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.620> little

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
too long as you can see on the little

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.640 
too long as you can see on the little
dim<00:02:37.070> progress<00:02:37.610> circle<00:02:38.270> not<00:02:38.480> progress<00:02:38.750> bar<00:02:39.140> we

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
dim progress circle not progress bar we

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.140 
dim progress circle not progress bar we
are<00:02:39.800> making<00:02:39.980> progress<00:02:40.190> or<00:02:40.580> about<00:02:40.730> halfway

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
are making progress or about halfway

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.500 
are making progress or about halfway
there<00:02:41.360> so<00:02:41.600> I<00:02:42.080> just<00:02:42.170> continue<00:02:42.740> to<00:02:42.800> wait<00:02:42.980> about

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
there so I just continue to wait about

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.030 
there so I just continue to wait about
75%<00:02:44.510> of<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.810> way<00:02:44.900> there<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:45.380> alright<00:02:45.860> we're

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
75% of the way there and alright we're

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.260 
75% of the way there and alright we're
just<00:02:46.070> at<00:02:46.400> about<00:02:46.490> a<00:02:46.610> hundred<00:02:46.730> percent<00:02:47.150> I

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
just at about a hundred percent I

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.360 
just at about a hundred percent I
believe<00:02:47.360> we<00:02:47.720> are<00:02:47.750> at<00:02:47.960> a<00:02:47.990> hundred<00:02:48.140> percent

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
believe we are at a hundred percent
