00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
I tell the secret of making it a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.109 
I tell the secret of making it a
consummate<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.500> having<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.890> super<00:01:26.280> strong<00:01:26.670> stop

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
consummate is having a super strong stop

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.880 
consummate is having a super strong stop
so<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.660> reduce<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.200> we<00:01:28.440> have<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> very

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
so we reduce this we have a very

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.200 
so we reduce this we have a very
nice-looking<00:01:29.210> roasted<00:01:30.210> chicken<00:01:30.450> stock

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
nice-looking roasted chicken stock

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.660 
nice-looking roasted chicken stock
reduce<00:01:32.720> it<00:01:32.870> down<00:01:32.900> to<00:01:33.080> concentrated

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
reduce it down to concentrated

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.880 
reduce it down to concentrated
and<00:01:35.030> they<00:01:35.150> made<00:01:35.300> it<00:01:35.330> clear<00:01:35.420> clear<00:01:36.080> me<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:36.800> a

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
and they made it clear clear me and a

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.820 
and they made it clear clear me and a
clear<00:01:37.100> meat<00:01:37.280> is<00:01:37.550> beef<00:01:38.060> broth<00:01:38.600> chicken<00:01:38.659> or<00:01:39.440> any

clear meat is beef broth chicken or any
kind<00:01:40.100> of<00:01:40.159> protein<00:01:40.940> that<00:01:41.120> you're<00:01:41.270> going<00:01:41.420> to<00:01:41.510> use

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
kind of protein that you're going to use

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.530 
kind of protein that you're going to use
that<00:01:42.110> mimics<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:42.860> flavor<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.310> stock<00:01:43.550> smear

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
that mimics the flavor the stock smear

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.870 
that mimics the flavor the stock smear
fall<00:01:44.840> heat<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.680> ratio<00:01:46.040> system<00:01:46.400> a<00:01:46.430> one<00:01:46.670> pound

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
fall heat the ratio system a one pound

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.600 
fall heat the ratio system a one pound
per<00:01:47.600> gallon<00:01:47.960> all<00:01:48.860> these<00:01:49.040> things<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:49.490> then

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
per gallon all these things and then

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.240 
per gallon all these things and then
five<00:01:49.940> eight<00:01:50.300> White's<00:01:50.600> for<00:01:51.020> Ellen<00:01:51.320> as<00:01:51.410> well<00:01:51.619> so

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
five eight White's for Ellen as well so

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.430 
five eight White's for Ellen as well so
we<00:01:52.310> have<00:01:52.460> about<00:01:52.670> three<00:01:53.150> gallons<00:01:53.300> of<00:01:53.660> liquid<00:01:54.670> 15

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
we have about three gallons of liquid 15

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.910 
we have about three gallons of liquid 15
egg<00:01:57.440> whites

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
egg whites

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.040 
egg whites
so<00:01:59.400> what<00:01:59.850> we're<00:02:00.030> gonna<00:02:00.120> do<00:02:00.330> is<00:02:00.570> get<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.900> bring

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
so what we're gonna do is get it bring

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.570 
so what we're gonna do is get it bring
this<00:02:01.140> up<00:02:01.290> very<00:02:01.530> slowly<00:02:01.830> we're<00:02:02.490> gonna

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
this up very slowly we're gonna

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.250 
this up very slowly we're gonna
continually<00:02:03.180> want<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.930> bottom

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
continually want it to the bottom

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.040 
continually want it to the bottom
because<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.680> completes<00:02:05.040> us<00:02:05.220> let's<00:02:05.460> see

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
because that completes us let's see

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.999 
because that completes us let's see
eventually<00:02:07.050> it'll<00:02:07.200> flow<00:02:07.440> because<00:02:07.800> if<00:02:07.920> they

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
eventually it'll flow because if they

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.809 
eventually it'll flow because if they
hate<00:02:08.190> whites

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
hate whites

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.600 
hate whites
okay<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.780> what<00:02:09.899> we're<00:02:10.020> doing<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.380> were

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
okay so what we're doing this were

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.520 
okay so what we're doing this were
essentially<00:02:11.610> making<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.120> magnet<00:02:12.630> take<00:02:13.080> all<00:02:13.319> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
essentially making a magnet take all the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.360 
essentially making a magnet take all the
way<00:02:13.680> all<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:15.050> precipitated<00:02:16.050> products<00:02:16.650> that

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
way all the precipitated products that

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.830 
way all the precipitated products that
are<00:02:17.490> exploding<00:02:17.880> around<00:02:18.120> we're<00:02:18.660> going<00:02:18.750> to

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
are exploding around we're going to

simmer<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:26.090> could<00:02:26.660> stir<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:26.989> around<00:02:27.080> once<00:02:28.040> it

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
simmer you could stir it around once it

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.449 
simmer you could stir it around once it
does<00:02:28.400> come<00:02:28.849> to<00:02:29.629> a<00:02:29.660> temperature<00:02:30.440> 180<00:02:31.010> degrees

does come to a temperature 180 degrees
you<00:02:32.150> want<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.420> stop<00:02:32.690> stirring<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:33.379> let<00:02:33.560> that

you want to stop stirring and let that

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.220 
you want to stop stirring and let that
crap<00:02:34.129> solidify<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.269> then<00:02:35.930> it's<00:02:36.080> going<00:02:36.170> to

start with okay then you probably add a
little<00:03:51.230> gelatin<00:03:51.739> and<00:03:52.190> you'll<00:03:52.340> have<00:03:52.489> some

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
little gelatin and you'll have some

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.539 
little gelatin and you'll have some
coating<00:03:53.000> liquid<00:03:53.690> cold<00:03:54.680> okay

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549
