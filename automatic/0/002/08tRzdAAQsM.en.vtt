00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
the cord to install an original jack at

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.080 
the cord to install an original jack at
the<00:00:40.380> end<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.650> go<00:00:40.739> into<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.040> port<00:00:41.309> instead<00:00:41.940> of

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
the end to go into the port instead of

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.690 
the end to go into the port instead of
the<00:00:42.330> one<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.570> came<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.580> controller<00:00:44.580> I

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
the one that came on this controller I

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.010 
the one that came on this controller I
used<00:00:45.320> TTX<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.590> controller<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.720> jacks

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
used TTX that controller the the jacks

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.729 
used TTX that controller the the jacks
on<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.550> they<00:00:50.550> work<00:00:50.730> fine<00:00:51.350> but<00:00:52.350> they<00:00:52.500> just

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
on this they work fine but they just

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.790 
on this they work fine but they just
don't<00:00:52.920> come<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.309> out<00:00:53.370> easy<00:00:53.580> enough<00:00:54.800> this

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
don't come in and out easy enough this

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.880 
don't come in and out easy enough this
is<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.160> black<00:00:56.720> controllers<00:00:57.720> jack<00:00:58.650> and

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
is the black controllers jack and

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.140 
is the black controllers jack and
they're<00:00:59.220> not<00:00:59.339> easy<00:00:59.550> that's<00:00:59.790> an<00:00:59.970> original

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
they're not easy that's an original

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.600 
they're not easy that's an original
controller<00:01:00.980> this<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.040> the<00:01:02.659> jack<00:01:03.659> or<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.580> one<00:01:05.580> I

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
controller this is the jack or the one I

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.550 
controller this is the jack or the one I
made<00:01:07.100> goes<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.400> out

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
made goes in and out

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.819 
made goes in and out
easily<00:01:10.130> well<00:01:10.670> and<00:01:11.200> this<00:01:12.200> is<00:01:12.259> the<00:01:12.530> one<00:01:12.740> that

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829 
easily well and this is the one that

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.620 
easily well and this is the one that
came<00:01:13.070> on<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:13.250> TTX<00:01:13.759> Tech<00:01:14.000> controller<00:01:14.979> which

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
came on the TTX Tech controller which

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.789 
came on the TTX Tech controller which
wants<00:01:17.630> you<00:01:17.750> to<00:01:17.840> break<00:01:18.049> your<00:01:18.079> motherboard<00:01:18.500> and

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
wants you to break your motherboard and

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.880 
wants you to break your motherboard and
you<00:01:18.920> try<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:19.250> wiggle<00:01:19.399> it<00:01:19.610> in<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:19.970> out<00:01:20.060> I

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
you try and wiggle it in and out I

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.920 
you try and wiggle it in and out I
didn't<00:01:21.890> like<00:01:22.009> that<00:01:22.250> probably<00:01:23.240> never<00:01:23.659> end<00:01:23.869> up

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
didn't like that probably never end up

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.780 
didn't like that probably never end up
using<00:01:24.460> these<00:01:25.460> ever

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
using these ever

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.450 
using these ever
okay<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.740> look<00:01:28.740> at<00:01:28.890> our<00:01:29.010> new<00:01:29.130> controller<00:01:30.380> and

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
okay so look at our new controller and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:40.870 
okay so look at our new controller and
start<00:01:32.460> off<00:01:32.910> with<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:34.430> little<00:01:35.430> Rogue<00:01:35.820> Squadron

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.220 

I'll<00:01:41.880> try<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.150> fast-forward<00:01:42.840> through<00:01:43.020> all<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
I'll try it fast-forward through all the

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.190 
I'll try it fast-forward through all the
opening<00:01:43.590> screens<00:01:43.980> because<00:01:44.840> even<00:01:45.840> just<00:01:45.870> to<00:01:46.080> get

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
opening screens because even just to get

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.020 
opening screens because even just to get
into<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.440> gameplay<00:01:46.620> in<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.070> game<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.729> can<00:01:47.880> be

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
into the gameplay in this game it can be

00:01:48.030 --> 00:02:04.760 
into the gameplay in this game it can be
an<00:01:48.210> ordeal<00:01:49.190> start<00:01:50.190> button<00:01:50.460> works<00:02:03.590> okay<00:02:04.590> here

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
an ordeal start button works okay here

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.410 
an ordeal start button works okay here
we<00:02:04.860> go

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
we go

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.260 
we go
we'll<00:02:06.420> start<00:02:06.630> off<00:02:06.750> at<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.020> shoulder<00:02:07.229> buttons

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
we'll start off at the shoulder buttons

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.910 
we'll start off at the shoulder buttons
there<00:02:09.270> left<00:02:09.509> changes<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.380> view<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:11.009> working

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.450 

and<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.120> right<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.660> little<00:02:17.530> more<00:02:17.680> subtle<00:02:17.920> gives
