00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the ninja that's basically like the one

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.070 
the ninja that's basically like the one
I<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:02.449> so<00:01:03.449> we're<00:01:04.199> gonna<00:01:04.350> roll<00:01:04.650> two<00:01:04.979> heroes

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
I like so we're gonna roll two heroes

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.770 
I like so we're gonna roll two heroes
with<00:01:07.080> gems<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:08.150> hopefully<00:01:09.150> we<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.360> something

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
with gems and hopefully we get something

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.649 
with gems and hopefully we get something
good<00:01:11.180> but<00:01:13.040> execution<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.159> execution<00:01:15.150> or<00:01:15.420> lab

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
good but execution is execution or lab

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.890 
good but execution is execution or lab
they're<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.890> crappy<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:17.850> anyways<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.240> think

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
they're so crappy but anyways I think

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.850 
they're so crappy but anyways I think
that<00:01:19.259> maybe<00:01:20.750> we<00:01:21.750> should<00:01:21.930> start<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.350> rolling

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
that maybe we should start like rolling

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.490 
that maybe we should start like rolling
