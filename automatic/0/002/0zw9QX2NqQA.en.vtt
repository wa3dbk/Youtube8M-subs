00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.349
 hi welcome to make braids i go 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.340
 your today goes logical with it 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:22.329
 show you a lay and I go for it 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.369
 is catching the hair back and that 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:27.460
 divide her in two 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.529
 so what I'm going to do now 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.019
 start something from one side then grab 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.989
 from the side as much as possible 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:39.670
 a tuft from the left 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:41.800
 bye bye easier to it quickly 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.570
 in the middle and then I take the right one 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.340
 can also be a tuft as far as possible 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:51.640
 aside and I go under the middle one 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.820
 pluck your noise 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.660
 so now does the same from the other 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.359
 side 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.780
 I'm going to get kidney tuft there 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:04.360
 backwards towards the middle 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.310
 stuck here then i pick up again from the 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:14.069
 left side a place that goes up again 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:17.709
 100 tuft from below weave through like this 

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:19.149
 once more done now than see 

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:21.009
 it look like this 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:25.390
 i start on the left i grab one 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.979
 had a small tuft of hair behind 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.590
 the pick where the today comes to it 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.030
 in the middle now I pick from the 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.030
 right side learn a little tuft 

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:40.619
 that is about the picking but tonight no 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:40.619
 under tuft of what I had been apart 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:47.640
 well take a cloth on this side 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:51.190
 lay backwards hold in the middle 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.690
 of right tuft at the top 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.690
 and the tape underneath tuft 

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:59.849
 then it already looks like this on yale two 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.849
 succeeded 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.700
 it's not more it's just constant 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.409
 tuft from the side to the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.610
 put in the middle 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.620
 other side by layer and below by that 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.030
 from this side again a little tuft 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.520
 to grab 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.630
 hold to the left a tuft of suits 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.630
 lars and underneath 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.190
 heedless 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:37.640
 along the front right along this cat 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.640
 along a link again nice along 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.930
 slightly backwards again 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.570
 about for dance 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.670
 and so you make braid to the end and 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.360
 you have a very special fish bone braid 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.160
 with us in the middle you put the live 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.840
 I have to think carefully 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.360
 sometimes I pick it was from wrong side 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.830
 a game twice in succession 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.209
 pattern no longer you must be good 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.530
 Think where you are the last four 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.530
 just started from behind 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:22.380
 if you consistently order an order 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:29.030
 keep doing then you will get the most fun 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.030
 and separate creation 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:56.010
 so it's actually continuous 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:58.650
 behind fear and the other side causing van 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.370
 on the other side 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.370
 from the right side 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.370
 underneath 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:13.790
 finer and thinner you take the puppies 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.790
 nice braid will eventually look like 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.010
 fill the day 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.380
 and you put him up at the end with a 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.380
 piece 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.560
 gotta be a nice tan i got you one 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.150
 whole box for sale so when you get there 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.140
 interested in it you need vw 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.140
 braids make point nl 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.310
 then I secure it with a rubber band 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:45.130
 then you have where the sheep 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.200
 fishbone braid with a small lay your 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.180
 have done the link to vote well 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.290
 then you have a lateral 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.290
 fish bone pattern 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.710
 this place can of course in the tail 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.450
 so if I have done it now or you can 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.030
 just make a half tail and in it 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.040
 but this is in any case 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.910
 the final result 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.910
 good luck with it
