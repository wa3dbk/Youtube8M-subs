00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 went to produce quality 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.540
 repair gear can choose the weather 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.120
 -100 to give on the table and then 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:27.900
 take now how much will prove that on 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:32.460
 minus well chased 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.309
 100 hello yes don't take me down 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.010
 so we have two gearbox 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:44.570
 helmsman from 124 mercedes that's under repair 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:49.820
 we didn't take anything so when changing 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:53.489
 Seals bipod and steering shaft worm 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.670
 no information so nothing yet 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.379
 tell you here I want to tell what 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.280
 nuances may occur when setting 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.890
 gearbox 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.989
 but in remove everything is just there I think any 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.150
 figure out how to remove but to 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.840
 put already may have some 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.110
 the question is so the first is the alignment 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.430
 helmsman's bipod see here label 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.360
 so there you see it you can see here 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:26.270
 now take off so fast 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.270
 Sasha already rented give 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.390
 This nut is always supposed to be a nut. 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:36.950
 new put it self-locking at 10 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.310
 a little pressed here remove the bipod here 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.260
 look here here this label should 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.330
 look at the slot which you have 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.510
 in the middle will be here in this 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.260
 slot here I specifically marked here 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:54.380
 paint to see the principle here 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.420
 there is nothing so complicated if you yourself 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.780
 to me unscrew this cover from 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.140
 just a quick look and just 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.840
 he knocks out principle you can pull out 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.820
 nine even through the top of only weeds 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.040
 these 10 retaining ring pull out 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.290
 you can try through but hardly 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.080
 Of course, so we turned out 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:20.090
 fully reducer here what else nuance 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:23.630
 When we install already Sasha we put 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.170
 this snap ring is put on principle 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.290
 easy 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.780
 here even with my hands this bolt 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.230
 we tighten on the spot already 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.190
 when do we put intermediate traction here and 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.530
 steering left traction here because to us 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.239
 down you have to let him go 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.220
 the book is written that does not drag on 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.989
 Immediately so further so that 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.790
 center steering gear here 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:54.260
 there is a label on the case you see and 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:58.340
 on the shaft there is a label that's more 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.709
 the nuance of what is about to combine them 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:07.480
 must be exactly the speed of one 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.480
 side to another here we read one turn 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.159
 but it's shorter in the middle we put in 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:21.360
 here we put in the middle 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:25.620
 we consider one turnover 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:30.450
 flew well and a half there a little more 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:33.840
 one of the family the other side here these 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.310
 half a turn we cranked on this 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.760
 pay attention to me so for myself 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:44.099
 put it 5 jumped flying that's it 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:50.750
 the other side is just a glove 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:53.389
 can't see one turn half all 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.760
 half 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:04:00.060
 one turn here is another nuance 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.400
 gearbox 90 from cars 92 years old this one 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.310
 reducer from the car in '97 see 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.349
 there are no tags here so keep in mind 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.879
 you might not be here either, but here 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.310
 don't confuse anything anyway 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.470
 try to just make this slot but 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.479
 he was in the middle otherwise you are not a bolt 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:20.849
 paste which already drains and 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.139
 here still see the label you will see i am not 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:27.770
 I know or wo n't see her here 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:30.060
 very very small and here it is visible and lay down 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.650
 here is this label that is here it is 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.060
 It is here in the middle of them and 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:40.430
 here it is already down here on 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:45.030
 of this groove, so we combine them 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:48.210
 all here bolt do not tighten this one 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:53.520
 Now it's sleeve they bezraznitsy 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:56.159
 equally at all years probably we 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.000
 we put on the shaft here we have the steering shaft 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:01.800
 Here we put when the steering wheel right here, he does not 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.419
 so set not vertically and so here 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:09.060
 horizontally set the scale when you 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.810
 that's down the bolt we mean we will be below 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.800
 spin 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.800
 we put on 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:20.730
 and up to the top of its whisk gear 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.800
 we donâ€™t have a bolt down below 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.100
 insert it more precisely you need not to insert 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:30.500
 otherwise pull it down then do not lower 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:34.770
 and already gearbox centered 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:37.250
 neatly put the drive as well 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:40.850
 show to be seen so that it is clear 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:43.320
 here is the gearbox is assigned here and so 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:47.010
 here and so it costs us to the spar 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:51.140
 screwed here and here we stand 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:54.030
 shaft example here it turns out the distance 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.310
 because we clutch up shift up 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:00.570
 maximum and tighten the three bolts 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:02.280
 fasteners here and again , we need a label 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.460
 look so that she does not go astray she is like 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.350
 times we get the bottom and here and on 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.440
 this row which is below and on the second 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.750
 gearbox also below everything is fine means 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.360
 here and now neatly 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.730
 this clutch down they for screwdriver there 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.460
 you can adapt somehow or 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.740
 we mount some downward ourselves 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.720
 and it turns out neatly on the slots 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.450
 we are , of course, maybe there 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.480
 will shift to there by 2 slots I think from 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:34.350
 nothing terrible will be from this here in 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:37.770
 principle, the whole centering on later 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.050
 versions there until the 90th year written to mars 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:44.720
 there is a book 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:44.720
 reboot centering bolt durable god 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:48.039
 and 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:59.669
 Spaniards here is this centering bolt 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:07:02.370
 we have such a gear is not so 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:04.499
 what about it if it's nothing for you 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:10.129
 but the principle can be about the label also 

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:10.129
 the book says nothing complicated there 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:16.120
 I can still be semen when we will 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:19.960
 We already have to set everything up 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:22.810
 In principle, there are no more nuances 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:25.600
 only alignment issues arise when 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:28.570
 installation all thank you all put 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.960
 husky go fuck go let's tea 

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.960
 skeleton
