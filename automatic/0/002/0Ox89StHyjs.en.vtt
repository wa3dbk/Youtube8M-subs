00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.490 
over so they are a little bit more

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.640 
over so they are a little bit more
difficult<00:06:49.760> than<00:06:50.240> the<00:06:50.360> average<00:06:50.690> enemy<00:06:51.020> but<00:06:51.500> not

difficult than the average enemy but not

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.770 
difficult than the average enemy but not
by<00:06:51.830> much<00:06:52.070> if<00:06:52.370> you<00:06:52.700> have<00:06:52.880> pixel<00:06:53.270> perfect<00:06:53.450> aim

feet<00:06:56.240> and<00:06:56.480> they'll<00:06:56.660> blow<00:06:56.900> up<00:06:57.050> and<00:06:57.230> die<00:06:57.380> you'll

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
feet and they'll blow up and die you'll

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.890

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490 
can just run away from them like I do

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.490 
can just run away from them like I do
because<00:07:02.000> they<00:07:02.690> only<00:07:02.900> give<00:07:03.110> you<00:07:03.140> about<00:07:03.440> five

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:03.500 
because they only give you about five

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.850 
because they only give you about five
hundred<00:07:03.890> points<00:07:04.160> and<00:07:04.400> they're<00:07:04.490> really<00:07:04.640> not
