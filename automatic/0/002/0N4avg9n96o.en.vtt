 say on the brazilian picking u 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:25.940
 We are wheels here 18 size that, in principle 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.730
 not found standard trim levels 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.350

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.340
 everyone became everything else is the same 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.340
 I repeat that this is a comfort look 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.100
 try to remember 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.530

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.280
 scroll back and see it like this 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.920
 Little first seat adjustment here 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.610
 mechanical cups that 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.869
 driver's that passenger upholstery 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:05.630
 interior of these doors 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:09.200
 here goes the fabric well and 2 then we 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.780
 look at the complete set of Brazilian 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:18.140
 configuration here is the memory settings 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:23.530
 adjusting the seat with the war itself so 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:26.810
 but in this configuration we have air conditioning 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:32.989
 normal steering wheel with radio control and 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.489
 onboard computer ordinary mirror in 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.930
 bundling brazilian here we have 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:42.560
 rain sensor is provided but it 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.540
 picking on our machine we see 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.310
 what 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.830
 seat heating fabric upholstery 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:55.790
 cloth upholstery again seats 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:59.450
 Well, in principle, yes pay attention to 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.730
 plastic here it is plastic let's say so without 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.610
 textures yes he is so gray but without 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.110
 textures 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.880
 as for rear passengers all 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.469
 identical well, well let's go 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.150
 watch 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:17.150
 publish choose vs picking 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:29.069
 drives principle 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:32.280
 nameplate important role compensation 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:39.780
 whether it is necessary to count the discs 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:43.170
 the first drives on 18 about what I said bad 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.030
 equipment seat adjustment 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.340
 and driver and passenger 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:52.440
 plus there is power seat 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.250
 lumbar support and driver and 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.730
 passenger 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.010
 and just say here at the door yes only 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.890
 don't get and 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.750
 there is a memory management settings 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:07.790
 driver's seat 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:10.859
 Well, the seat itself became the seats they all 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.519
 combination of natural and artificial 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:18.229
 skin and plus to everything they are 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:22.940
 perforated perforated leather 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:25.849
 revenue passes seat ventilation 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.810
 cool that very very nice it 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:32.960
 at the expense of probably 4 disks 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:41.539
 powered memory ideas up to 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:41.539
 skin ventilation further in the cabin 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:50.070
 Well then we have a 2-zone 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:53.180
 climate control with control on 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:57.960
 center console usually control 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:00.479
 we see that there is already bluetooth with 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.760
 voice recognition features it all on 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.639
 steering wheel 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.930

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.919
 cruise control with speed limiter 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.810
 again very comfortable on the steering wheel 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:18.300
 switch seat ventilation 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:21.599

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.349
 driver's seat three modes now 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:28.010
 the machine is not turned on they switch 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.010
 further rain sensor 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:35.970
 and mirror dimming mirror 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:39.009
 Well, we do this so that if the rear 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:43.060
 the driver who blinds you from behind and 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:44.889
 the mirror itself is obscured again that in 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.750
 Cabinet combination of natural and 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:50.440
 artificial leather in the seat trim and 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.840

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:00.039
 faux leather 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:02.259
 that's about plastic plastic and plastic here 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.240
 no longer just gray and it is made in such a 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:07.120
 frosted visible 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.020
 visible texture should be closer as it is under 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.020
 aluminum is made 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:26.080
 it is made of aluminum, perhaps all 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:28.889
 if we forgot we will add me to the video 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:33.539
