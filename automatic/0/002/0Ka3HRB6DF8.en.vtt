00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.089
 tha 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.830
 a dovetail groove is realized 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.360
 quickly and accurately 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.220
 using a dovetail cutter 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.349
 a ripper team and a ring of 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.140
 copying 30 mm in diameter and two 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.360
 rules of assembly guidance note that at 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.800
 one end there is no game for 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.720
 ring between the two rules then 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.080
 it has a clearance of about 2 mm 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.080
 to the other 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.559
 using these joined set the rules 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:48.210
 guide on the workpiece place 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.350
 the part without guiding game to 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.350
 the back of the workpiece 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.190
 the dovetail groove that we 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.080
 let's go to factories and not being transverse 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.640
 between fixed and a stop stop at 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.640
 the end of guiding rules 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.600
 then set the milling depth to 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:25.000
 one third of the thickness of your piece 9 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:27.040
 mm in my case you are ready to machine 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.770
 place it on the rulers 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.450
 guide down the strawberry is guided the 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.940
 machine first along the left field 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.500
 until reaching the stop stop then 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.370
 then along the right field for 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.370
 return to the starting point 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.840
 the result is a tail groove 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.510
 slightly wider dovetail early 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.950
 machining only at the end and which you 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.280
 all you have left is slightly 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.280
 the fields 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.920
 the tongue is dovetailed 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:28.129
 corresponding will be carried out at the 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.230
 smashing under table to get settled 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.060
 the milling height about a half 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.659
 millimeter less than the depth of 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.090
 the groove setting up a guide 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:42.620
 of continuity will allow the piece of 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.450
 remain always supported one 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.430
 I made myself just get caught 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.930
 between the cheeks of the parallel guide without 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.500
 have to set up these joined 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.500
 additional 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.590
 so that the language is either machined with 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.530
 the same widening as the groove 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.510
 attach a piece of veneer 1 mm 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.730
 thick on each side of one of the 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.849
 ends of the piece using ribbon 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.849
 adhesive 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.610
 this one millimeter offset will produce 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.200
 ultimately a larger tab 2 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.200
 mm at one end to the other 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.920
 be careful not to exercise 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.720
 pressure against the guide that 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.990
 ends of the room and not at 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.990
 middle 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.330
 me 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.420
 you get so a language is in 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.750
 dovetail perfectly suited to the 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.750
 groove 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.360
 before inserting the language is in the 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:23.250
 groove cut off its most 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.250
 narrow on 7 to 8 mm 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.180
 this will hide the end of 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.180
 the groove 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.129
 plan enough play between 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.810
 ends of the tongue and that of 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.050
 the groove so that the panel can 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.050
 to work 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:51.090
 finally insert the language is in the 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.530
 groove you can use a 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.199
 hammer or mallet for them 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.940
 last centimeters the language she will be 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.949
 so firmly fixed in the groove 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.220
 and will prevent any warping of the 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.220
 sign
