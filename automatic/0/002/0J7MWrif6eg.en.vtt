of lines that are important in the image
our<00:00:17.260> algorithm<00:00:17.800> Maps<00:00:18.010> these<00:00:18.280> end<00:00:18.520> points<00:00:18.730> to

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
our algorithm Maps these end points to

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.700 
our algorithm Maps these end points to
the<00:00:19.270> sphere<00:00:19.539> then<00:00:19.720> computes<00:00:20.110> great<00:00:20.320> circles

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
the sphere then computes great circles

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.590 
the sphere then computes great circles
between<00:00:21.039> the<00:00:21.160> end<00:00:21.280> points<00:00:21.580> and<00:00:21.730> the<00:00:22.150> plots<00:00:22.420> was

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:22.600 
between the end points and the plots was

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.090 
between the end points and the plots was
great<00:00:22.750> circles<00:00:23.140> back<00:00:23.289> into<00:00:23.590> the<00:00:23.680> input<00:00:23.800> image

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
great circles back into the input image

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.150 
great circles back into the input image
which<00:00:24.880> is<00:00:25.029> why<00:00:25.180> the<00:00:25.869> plotted<00:00:26.199> lines<00:00:26.410> match<00:00:26.740> the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
which is why the plotted lines match the

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:35.520 
which is why the plotted lines match the
input<00:00:27.970> ones<00:00:33.569> when<00:00:34.569> we<00:00:34.719> draw<00:00:34.960> this<00:00:35.140> line<00:00:35.199> we

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
input ones when we draw this line we

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.139 
input ones when we draw this line we
notice<00:00:35.800> it<00:00:35.890> it<00:00:35.979> doesn't<00:00:36.219> exactly<00:00:36.489> match<00:00:36.850> up

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
notice it it doesn't exactly match up

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.180 
notice it it doesn't exactly match up
with<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.629> line<00:00:37.780> in<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.019> image<00:00:38.260> so<00:00:38.890> the<00:00:39.069> user

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
with the line in the image so the user

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.189 
with the line in the image so the user
just<00:00:39.550> adjusts<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.269> field<00:00:40.780> of<00:00:40.899> view<00:00:40.989> the

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
just adjusts the field of view the

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:42.689 
just adjusts the field of view the
single<00:00:41.469> parameter<00:00:41.620> that<00:00:42.010> just<00:00:42.219> their<00:00:42.489> maps

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
single parameter that just their maps

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.849 
single parameter that just their maps
this<00:00:42.969> fish<00:00:43.210> I<00:00:43.389> to<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.139> great<00:00:44.289> sphere<00:00:44.530> so<00:00:44.739> that

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
this fish I to the great sphere so that

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.149 
this fish I to the great sphere so that
it<00:00:44.949> lines<00:00:45.069> up<00:00:45.309> well<00:00:46.589> the<00:00:47.589> ability<00:00:47.799> to<00:00:48.039> adjust

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159 
it lines up well the ability to adjust

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:49.770 
it lines up well the ability to adjust
the<00:00:48.370> field<00:00:48.609> of<00:00:48.729> view<00:00:48.819> is<00:00:48.940> a<00:00:48.969> nice<00:00:49.179> feature<00:00:49.659> of

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
the field of view is a nice feature of

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.989 
the field of view is a nice feature of
our<00:00:49.899> interface<00:00:50.260> because<00:00:50.979> we<00:00:51.100> can<00:00:51.249> take<00:00:51.429> images

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:51.999 
our interface because we can take images

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:53.549 
our interface because we can take images
that<00:00:52.269> were<00:00:52.329> captured<00:00:52.719> with<00:00:52.839> unknown<00:00:53.199> fisheye

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
that were captured with unknown fisheye

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.219 
that were captured with unknown fisheye
lenses<00:00:53.920> and<00:00:54.789> usually<00:00:55.179> we<00:00:55.329> can<00:00:55.510> map<00:00:55.839> them<00:00:56.019> to

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:56.229 
lenses and usually we can map them to

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:57.750 
lenses and usually we can map them to
the<00:00:56.350> sphere<00:00:56.679> just<00:00:56.979> by<00:00:57.069> adjusting<00:00:57.219> that<00:00:57.579> one

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
the sphere just by adjusting that one

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:05.760 
the sphere just by adjusting that one
parameter<00:00:57.969> using<00:00:58.539> the<00:00:58.629> arrow<00:00:58.780> keys<00:01:04.620> the<00:01:05.620> user

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
parameter using the arrow keys the user

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.640 
parameter using the arrow keys the user
draws<00:01:06.040> a<00:01:06.070> few<00:01:06.280> more<00:01:06.340> lines<00:01:06.580> and<00:01:07.170> then<00:01:08.170> computes

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
draws a few more lines and then computes

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.650 
draws a few more lines and then computes
an<00:01:08.740> initial<00:01:09.100> result<00:01:09.400> we've<00:01:10.240> gone<00:01:10.420> ahead<00:01:10.540> and

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
an initial result we've gone ahead and

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.330 
an initial result we've gone ahead and
cut<00:01:10.960> out<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:11.110> computation<00:01:11.890> phase<00:01:12.070> of<00:01:12.250> this

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
cut out the computation phase of this

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.770 
cut out the computation phase of this
video<00:01:12.580> so<00:01:12.850> that's<00:01:13.030> about<00:01:13.210> a<00:01:13.240> minute<00:01:13.600> long

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
video so that's about a minute long

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:21.880 
video so that's about a minute long
we've<00:01:14.710> cut<00:01:14.920> it<00:01:15.040> from<00:01:15.160> this<00:01:15.280> video

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.160 

the<00:01:22.760> user<00:01:22.940> then<00:01:23.120> views<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.510> result<00:01:23.840> it's

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
the user then views the result it's

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.840 
the user then views the result it's
pretty<00:01:24.409> good<00:01:24.590> but<00:01:25.100> we<00:01:25.190> see<00:01:25.340> that<00:01:25.490> things<00:01:25.729> that

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
pretty good but we see that things that

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.180 
pretty good but we see that things that
the<00:01:26.120> wall<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.540> far<00:01:26.960> left<00:01:27.320> is<00:01:27.680> a<00:01:27.979> bit

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
the wall and the far left is a bit

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.070 
the wall and the far left is a bit
tilted<00:01:28.430> so<00:01:29.300> the<00:01:29.390> user<00:01:29.510> is<00:01:29.659> going<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:29.900> iterate

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
tilted so the user is going to iterate

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.149 
tilted so the user is going to iterate
and<00:01:30.530> improve<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:31.070> result<00:01:32.740> first<00:01:33.740> step<00:01:33.979> is<00:01:34.130> to

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
and improve the result first step is to

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.730 
and improve the result first step is to
specify<00:01:35.000> that<00:01:35.420> some<00:01:35.600> of<00:01:35.690> the<00:01:35.750> lines<00:01:35.960> in<00:01:36.350> the

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
specify that some of the lines in the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.469 
specify that some of the lines in the
input<00:01:37.130> should<00:01:37.310> be<00:01:37.400> vertical<00:01:37.910> on<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.150> output

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
input should be vertical on the output

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.749 
input should be vertical on the output
that's<00:01:39.440> signified<00:01:39.890> in<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:40.100> UI<00:01:40.250> here<00:01:40.640> by

that's signified in the UI here by

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.960 
that's signified in the UI here by
turning<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.119> lines<00:01:41.330> purple<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:45.790> we<00:01:46.790> add<00:01:46.940> a

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
turning the lines purple and we add a

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.780 
turning the lines purple and we add a
few<00:01:47.210> lines<00:01:47.450> as<00:01:47.600> well<00:01:48.520> we're<00:01:49.520> going<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:49.670> make

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
few lines as well we're going to make

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.149 
few lines as well we're going to make
the<00:01:49.940> bottom<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.479> couch<00:01:50.860> linear<00:01:51.860> and

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
the bottom of the couch linear and

00:01:52.159 --> 00:02:00.850 
the bottom of the couch linear and
horizontal

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.740 

we<00:02:01.430> then<00:02:01.610> go<00:02:01.730> ahead<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.090> compute<00:02:02.270> our<00:02:02.390> second

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
we then go ahead and compute our second

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.660 
we then go ahead and compute our second
result<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.260> again<00:02:03.860> we<00:02:04.010> cut<00:02:04.220> out<00:02:04.370> the

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
result and again we cut out the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:12.030 
result and again we cut out the
computation<00:02:05.240> time

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.789 

and<00:02:12.370> here<00:02:12.849> we<00:02:12.939> see<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.810> final<00:02:14.379> mapped<00:02:14.560> image

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
and here we see the final mapped image

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.569 
and here we see the final mapped image
now<00:02:15.430> we<00:02:16.239> just<00:02:16.420> go<00:02:16.510> ahead<00:02:16.629> and<00:02:16.750> crop<00:02:17.219> this<00:02:18.219> fish

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
now we just go ahead and crop this fish

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.490 
now we just go ahead and crop this fish
out<00:02:18.730> this<00:02:19.180> result<00:02:19.510> you'll<00:02:20.019> notice<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.349> field

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
out this result you'll notice the field
