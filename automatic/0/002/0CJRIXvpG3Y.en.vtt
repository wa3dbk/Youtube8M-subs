00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.270
 good afternoon my compañeras and I are 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.029
 chemistry students phenomena 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.070
 group one transportation in the afternoon of 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.490
 today we are going to explain the experience of 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:32.119
 the speed of different fluids 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.380
 this experience aims 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.680
 and compare the viscosity 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.150
 the list came and the water then the 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.700
 starting materials as we can see 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.860
 they are the two fluids 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.900
 and some test tubes to see the 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.840
 behavior of these two fluids 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.320
 we are going to make it 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.530
 by two parts the first is with a 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.790
 willis pure flour and the second is with 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:06.880
 a mixture of glycerin and water with more 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:11.220
 serve amount of water and another mixture of 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.220
 and glycerin with more water 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.140
 my name 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.330
 viscosity is a physical property of 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.190
 the first 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.040
 in reference to the resistance of this 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.110
 to flow those liquids those 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.600
 fluids that have a more viscosity 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.370
 low they are known as as thick and 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.620
 those that have higher viscosity are 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.720
 they recognize as thick 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.760
 viscosity is a property that is 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.030
 it owes to the friction between the molecules 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.820
 of the liquid the basic implements of 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.760
 viscosity compares the viscosity is of 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.130
 the different shapes of the drops of 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.890
 the different liquids that this 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.770
 garbage in different thicknesses 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.380
 they also study the effect of 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.210
 temperature in the viscosity those 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.880
 experiments that want to issue the 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.760
 relative viscosity then they involve 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.370
 measure the time of fall of the liquid to 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.840
 through a liquid cylinder in our 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.250
 food us 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.930
 we use water whose viscosity is 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.280
 1.5 minutes seconds square meters 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.480
 and 1 for 10 at least three minutes 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.590
 seconds per meter squared 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.560
 respectively 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.170
 let's see how the phenomenon happens 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.780
 when we drop both liquids at 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.620
 same time then let's see how 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.069
 was how you observe the viscosity of 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.069
 these 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.450
 well my name monica bellucci am 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.150
 student of the transport phenomenon 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.980
 the viscosity and a property that 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.810
 characterized by showing the shape of the 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.060
 drop in fluids is where it 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.000
 present this and it is said that liquids 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.740
 which has a higher viscosity has a 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.660
 more elongated drop while the 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.480
 liquids with less than they see us cooked 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.060
 they have a pretty small drop to 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.830
 then I'm going to show you two 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.630
 experiments where I'm going to make a 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.060
 mixture of glycerin and water at different 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.750
 concentrations to see which one presents 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.750
 a higher viscosity 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.720
 here we have the two samples of 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.850
 glycerin with water this earth the 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.890
 four milliliters of water with a 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.900
 milliliter of flour belvís and this 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.549
 has 4000 liters of glycerin with a 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.640
 milliliter of water now let's 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.850
 demonstrate squares has a greater 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.850
 viscosity 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.950
 as we could observe the one that has more 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.610
 amount of glycerin is the one that flows 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.610
 at a lower speed 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.240
 games get to use our experience 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.850
 that the glycerin in panticosa that 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.270
 wash the eggs see through the 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:56.120
 practice in pure glycerin and water 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.790
 pure or also is that of the consultations 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.130
 those of the two mixed solutions that 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.250
 was that it resulted in the 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:08.510
 solution that had more misery was more 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:10.460
 viscose it is also worth mentioning that the 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.300
 density is not related to the 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:17.120
 viscosity many people tend to think 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.400
 that a more viscous than the liquid 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.560
 another because its density is greater is just 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.030
 in true we have the case of the 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.850
 glycerin water and oil 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.010
 we know that glycerin have a 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.720
 higher density than water but the 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.020
 oil has a lower density than 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:36.380
 water and these two liquids are obtained 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.170
 a higher viscosity and therefore 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.770
 density and viscosity are not 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.770
 related
