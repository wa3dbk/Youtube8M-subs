you guys had a gay teammate how would

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.700 
you guys had a gay teammate how would
your<00:00:50.489> teammates<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.270> got<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:52.020> he<00:00:52.140> said<00:00:52.440> at

your teammates we got and he said at

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.470 
your teammates we got and he said at
first<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.280> think<00:00:53.579> there<00:00:53.789> would<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:53.969> been<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
first I think there would have been a

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.680 
first I think there would have been a
little<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.739> know<00:00:55.800> off<00:00:56.190> guard<00:00:56.550> but<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.149> think

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
little you know off guard but I think

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.970 
little you know off guard but I think
they<00:00:57.840> would<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.079> gotten<00:00:58.379> used<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.890> and

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
they would have gotten used to it and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.990 
they would have gotten used to it and
they<00:00:59.039> would<00:00:59.190> have<00:00:59.309> gotten<00:00:59.430> accustomed<00:00:59.879> and

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
they would have gotten accustomed and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.430 
they would have gotten accustomed and
accepting<00:01:00.449> him<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:01.079> brother

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
accepting him as a brother

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.920 
accepting him as a brother
yeah<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:01.980> sure<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.460> think<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.940> know<00:01:05.600> if<00:01:06.600> that

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
yeah for sure I think you know if that

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.270 
yeah for sure I think you know if that
would<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.229> happened<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.680> our<00:01:07.799> locker<00:01:08.130> room

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
would have happened in our locker room

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.190 
would have happened in our locker room
will<00:01:08.580> probably<00:01:08.970> be<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.210> same<00:01:09.240> reaction<00:01:10.020> or

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
will probably be the same reaction or

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.960 
will probably be the same reaction or
the<00:01:10.229> definitely<00:01:10.680> caught<00:01:10.890> us<00:01:11.010> off<00:01:11.490> guard<00:01:11.520> or

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the definitely caught us off guard or

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.850 
the definitely caught us off guard or
whatnot<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.810> at<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.960> same<00:01:13.110> time<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.740> would

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
whatnot but at the same time we would

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.340 
whatnot but at the same time we would
respect<00:01:14.430> his<00:01:14.580> decision<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.509> will<00:01:15.689> support

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
respect his decision and we will support

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.179 
respect his decision and we will support
him<00:01:16.500> at<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> same<00:01:16.950> time<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.409> I<00:01:19.409> think<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.040> NBA

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
him at the same time so I think the NBA

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.580 
him at the same time so I think the NBA
is<00:01:20.490> very<00:01:20.729> supportive<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.840> obviously

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
is very supportive of that and obviously

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.289
