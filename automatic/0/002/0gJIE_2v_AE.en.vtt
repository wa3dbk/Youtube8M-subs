00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
you're gonna need like a combination of

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:52.020 
you're gonna need like a combination of
files<00:01:44.579> razor<00:01:45.579> blades<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:50.549> lot<00:01:51.549> of<00:01:51.670> different

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:58.629 
corner in the inside of the razor blade

00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:01.289 
corner in the inside of the razor blade
you<00:01:59.020> can't<00:01:59.409> get<00:01:59.590> it<00:01:59.709> perfectly<00:02:00.099> flat<00:02:00.399> and<00:02:01.149> the

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
you can't get it perfectly flat and the

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.469 
you can't get it perfectly flat and the
tip<00:02:01.509> of<00:02:01.659> the<00:02:01.719> coroner<00:02:02.079> still<00:02:02.319> tipping<00:02:02.709> up<00:02:03.479> you

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
tip of the coroner still tipping up you

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.240 
tip of the coroner still tipping up you
still<00:02:04.719> got<00:02:04.840> a<00:02:04.869> curve<00:02:05.200> on<00:02:05.409> the<00:02:05.530> inside<00:02:05.950> of<00:02:05.979> here

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
still got a curve on the inside of here

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.859 
still got a curve on the inside of here
and<00:02:06.399> inside<00:02:06.729> of<00:02:06.789> here<00:02:07.000> is<00:02:07.060> normally<00:02:07.390> perfectly

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
and inside of here is normally perfectly

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.800 
and inside of here is normally perfectly
flat<00:02:08.399> then<00:02:09.399> you<00:02:09.549> can<00:02:09.670> use<00:02:09.789> an<00:02:09.940> acetone<00:02:10.450> to

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
flat then you can use an acetone to

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.440 
flat then you can use an acetone to
remove<00:02:11.079> the<00:02:11.410> glue<00:02:11.970> but<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.060> can't<00:02:13.299> get

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
remove the glue but you can't get

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.509 
remove the glue but you can't get
acetone<00:02:13.959> on<00:02:14.140> anything<00:02:14.590> else<00:02:14.769> the<00:02:15.160> speaker

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
acetone on anything else the speaker

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.300 
acetone on anything else the speaker
here<00:02:15.730> any<00:02:16.120> of<00:02:16.209> its<00:02:16.329> parts<00:02:16.660> are<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:18.040> breaking

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
here any of its parts are you breaking

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.720 
here any of its parts are you breaking
it<00:02:18.519> that's<00:02:18.970> sometimes<00:02:19.150> real<00:02:19.450> nasty<00:02:19.720> but

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
it that's sometimes real nasty but

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.009 
it that's sometimes real nasty but
alcohol<00:02:22.410> acetone<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.799> will<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:24.780> that's<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.900> way

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
alcohol acetone the will so that's a way

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:33.240 
alcohol acetone the will so that's a way
more<00:02:26.260> advanced<00:02:27.060> fixing<00:02:28.060> corner<00:02:28.390> solution<00:02:32.250> you

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
more advanced fixing corner solution you

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.559 
more advanced fixing corner solution you
don't<00:02:33.310> have<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:33.579> take<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.880> speaker<00:02:34.239> out<00:02:34.329> you

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
don't have to take the speaker out you

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.410 
don't have to take the speaker out you
can<00:02:34.720> use<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.900> little<00:02:35.200> screwdriver<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:36.420> little

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
can use a little screwdriver a little

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.520 
can use a little screwdriver a little
micro<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:39.180> get<00:02:40.180> an<00:02:40.389> array<00:02:40.569> in<00:02:40.989> there<00:02:41.200> with<00:02:41.440> the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
micro and get an array in there with the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.500 
micro and get an array in there with the
aluminum<00:02:41.980> rail<00:02:42.160> stops<00:02:42.579> again<00:02:43.209> underneath

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
aluminum rail stops again underneath

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.089 
aluminum rail stops again underneath
there<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:43.959> use<00:02:44.109> that<00:02:44.349> area<00:02:44.829> to<00:02:45.069> pop<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.489> up<00:02:45.579> and

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
there and use that area to pop it up and

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.270 
there and use that area to pop it up and
yeah<00:02:49.349> it's<00:02:50.349> it's<00:02:50.829> fun
