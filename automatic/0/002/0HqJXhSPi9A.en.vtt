00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.240 
written in the language I understand I
have<00:02:26.450> used<00:02:26.690> Google<00:02:26.930> Translate<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.470> get<00:02:28.040> most

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
have used Google Translate to get most

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.210 
have used Google Translate to get most
of<00:02:28.460> it<00:02:29.020> but<00:02:30.020> it<00:02:30.170> looks<00:02:30.380> like<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.800> contains

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
of it but it looks like it contains

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.390 
of it but it looks like it contains
actual<00:02:32.180> fruit<00:02:32.720> juice<00:02:32.990> this<00:02:33.770> is<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.010> only<00:02:34.250> one

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
actual fruit juice this is the only one

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.100 
actual fruit juice this is the only one
of<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.580> three<00:02:34.820> that<00:02:35.150> contains<00:02:35.540> fruit<00:02:35.870> juice

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
of the three that contains fruit juice

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.650 
of the three that contains fruit juice
which<00:02:36.980> is<00:02:37.250> another<00:02:37.520> reason<00:02:37.850> why<00:02:37.880> it's<00:02:38.360> colored

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
which is another reason why it's colored

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.420 
which is another reason why it's colored
that<00:02:38.810> way<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.709> main<00:02:39.890> reason<00:02:40.250> why<00:02:40.370> is

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
that way and the main reason why is

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.550 
that way and the main reason why is
because<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:41.000> dies<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.570> think<00:02:42.260> they're<00:02:42.410> not

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
because it dies I think they're not

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.890 
because it dies I think they're not
allowed<00:02:42.740> to<00:02:42.770> use<00:02:42.920> certain<00:02:43.280> dies<00:02:43.610> in<00:02:44.060> sodas

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
allowed to use certain dies in sodas

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.780 
allowed to use certain dies in sodas
that<00:02:45.470> we<00:02:45.860> are<00:02:46.040> in<00:02:46.220> America<00:02:46.700> so<00:02:48.550> don't<00:02:49.550> ask<00:02:49.670> me

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
that we are in America so don't ask me

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.690 
that we are in America so don't ask me
why<00:02:50.030> I<00:02:50.390> don't<00:02:51.320> know<00:02:51.440> if<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.430> was<00:02:52.580> that

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
why I don't know if it was that

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.880 
why I don't know if it was that
unhealthy<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.720> hate<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.050> think<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.380> America

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
unhealthy and hate to think that America

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.520 
unhealthy and hate to think that America
is<00:02:55.130> allowing<00:02:55.970> them<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.450> these<00:02:57.080> countries

is allowing them and these countries

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.240 
is allowing them and these countries
aren't<00:02:57.770> but<00:02:58.520> I<00:02:58.850> hope<00:02:59.270> that's<00:02:59.480> not<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.660> case

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
aren't but I hope that's not the case

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.000 
aren't but I hope that's not the case
but<00:03:01.250> this<00:03:01.760> one<00:03:02.060> also<00:03:02.270> contains<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.950> contains

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010

but this one also contains it contains
water<00:03:04.700> sugar<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:05.840> fructose<00:03:06.770> corn<00:03:06.980> syrup<00:03:07.240> so

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
water sugar and fructose corn syrup so

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.240 
water sugar and fructose corn syrup so
this<00:03:08.840> contains<00:03:09.320> a<00:03:09.470> little<00:03:09.620> bit<00:03:09.709> of<00:03:09.800> everything

this contains a little bit of everything

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.650 
this contains a little bit of everything
so<00:03:10.760> we're<00:03:10.910> going<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.090> do<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.239> little<00:03:11.450> quick

one does this one it's not near sweet

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.270

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
because it contains actual orange juice

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.820 
because it contains actual orange juice
in<00:06:01.810> but<00:06:02.810> that<00:06:02.990> doesn't<00:06:03.320> make<00:06:03.410> it<00:06:03.470> worse

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
in but that doesn't make it worse

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.650
