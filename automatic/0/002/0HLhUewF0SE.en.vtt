all<00:00:02.580> right<00:00:02.760> over<00:00:03.060> here<00:00:03.270> we<00:00:03.450> have<00:00:03.630> the

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
all right over here we have the

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.340 
all right over here we have the
frameless<00:00:05.330> sliding<00:00:06.330> door<00:00:06.540> corner<00:00:07.020> shower

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
frameless sliding door corner shower

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.949 
frameless sliding door corner shower
screen<00:00:07.820> now<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:08.969> one<00:00:09.209> comes<00:00:09.660> in<00:00:09.839> different

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:09.959 
screen now this one comes in different

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:13.159 
screen now this one comes in different
sizes<00:00:10.610> the<00:00:11.610> sliding<00:00:11.999> doors<00:00:12.179> on<00:00:12.419> the<00:00:12.539> is<00:00:12.749> on<00:00:13.019> the

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:13.169 
sizes the sliding doors on the is on the

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.339 
sizes the sliding doors on the is on the
longer<00:00:13.469> side<00:00:13.639> so<00:00:14.639> i<00:00:15.209> think<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.809> minimum<00:00:16.170> is

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:16.349 
longer side so i think the minimum is

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.790 
longer side so i think the minimum is
1200<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.420> the<00:00:18.420> door<00:00:18.630> pad<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.199> Dorsai<00:00:19.589> can

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
1200 and the door pad and the Dorsai can

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.159 
1200 and the door pad and the Dorsai can
go<00:00:19.949> up<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.220> 1800<00:00:22.460> so<00:00:23.460> as<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.699> can<00:00:23.759> see<00:00:23.970> here<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:25.169 
go up to 1800 so as you can see here the

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:26.950 
go up to 1800 so as you can see here the
fixed<00:00:25.650> panels<00:00:25.980> got<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> thin<00:00:26.490> aluminium

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
fixed panels got a thin aluminium

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.329 
fixed panels got a thin aluminium
channel<00:00:27.960> at<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.259> bottom<00:00:28.560> which<00:00:28.769> sits<00:00:29.070> on<00:00:29.249> to

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:29.339 
channel at the bottom which sits on to

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:35.660 
channel at the bottom which sits on to
your<00:00:29.460> tiles<00:00:29.699> or<00:00:29.970> she'll<00:00:30.210> base<00:00:30.419> and<00:00:34.520> along<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
your tiles or she'll base and along the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.700 
your tiles or she'll base and along the
edge<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> glass<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.540> also<00:00:36.900> a<00:00:36.930> thin<00:00:37.290> channel

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
edge of the glass is also a thin channel

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.810 
edge of the glass is also a thin channel
which<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.700> rapid<00:00:39.060> about<00:00:39.210> 20<00:00:39.510> mil<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.820> that

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
which is rapid about 20 mil so that

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.730 
which is rapid about 20 mil so that
channel<00:00:42.150> gets<00:00:42.360> screwed<00:00:42.540> onto<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.170> wall<00:00:43.380> and

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
channel gets screwed onto the wall and

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.010 
channel gets screwed onto the wall and
then<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.130> rest<00:00:44.310> of<00:00:44.400> the<00:00:44.490> shower<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.660> risk<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
then the rest of the shower the risk the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.520 
then the rest of the shower the risk the
glass<00:00:46.230> just<00:00:46.470> pushes<00:00:46.800> into<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:48.080> that<00:00:49.080> 20<00:00:49.380> ml

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
glass just pushes into it that 20 ml

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.160 
glass just pushes into it that 20 ml
tolerance<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.190> there<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.390> your<00:00:51.540> war<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.960> out<00:00:52.140> of

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
tolerance is there if your war is out of

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.260 
tolerance is there if your war is out of
line<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.250> could<00:00:53.640> play<00:00:53.670> around<00:00:54.060> with<00:00:54.240> it

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
line so you could play around with it

can come in either 800 850 or 900 same
same<00:01:07.950> scenario<00:01:08.130> here<00:01:08.460> you've<00:01:08.850> got<00:01:09.380> 20<00:01:10.380> ml<00:01:10.530> to

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
same scenario here you've got 20 ml to

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.850 
same scenario here you've got 20 ml to
play<00:01:10.980> with<00:01:11.190> as<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.940> can<00:01:12.000> see<00:01:12.210> here<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.690> can<00:01:13.650> push

play with as you can see here I can push

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.149 
play with as you can see here I can push
it<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.220> or<00:01:14.460> pull<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.730> out<00:01:15.860> so<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.890> could<00:01:17.010> do

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
it in or pull it out so you could do

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.220 
it in or pull it out so you could do
that<00:01:17.310> too<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:18.270> get<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.480> line<00:01:18.920> with<00:01:19.920> your<00:01:20.040> wall

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.190 

let's<00:01:25.230> look<00:01:25.470> at<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> rail<00:01:25.890> at<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> top<00:01:27.200> so

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
let's look at the rail at the top so

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.850 
let's look at the rail at the top so
this<00:01:28.560> rail<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.100> made<00:01:29.460> out<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.760> stainless<00:01:30.150> steel

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
this rail is made out of stainless steel

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.730 
this rail is made out of stainless steel
as<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.100> see<00:01:32.250> here<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.990> these<00:01:34.200> are<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.440> big

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
as you can see here so these are the big

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.080 
as you can see here so these are the big
chrome<00:01:35.040> rollers<00:01:35.930> one<00:01:36.930> here<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.850> there's<00:01:38.850> one

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
chrome rollers one here and there's one

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.120 
chrome rollers one here and there's one
over<00:01:39.240> here<00:01:39.360> as<00:01:39.600> well

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:53.109 

slides<00:01:43.909> very<00:01:44.149> smoothly<00:01:47.140> and<00:01:51.039> that's<00:01:52.119> the

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
slides very smoothly and that's the

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.380 
slides very smoothly and that's the
stainless<00:01:53.509> steel<00:01:53.720> rail<00:01:54.020> gets<00:01:54.470> attached<00:01:55.390> it

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
stainless steel rail gets attached it

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.380 
stainless steel rail gets attached it
gets<00:01:56.570> fixed<00:01:56.840> onto<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.670> onto<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.789> glass<00:01:59.000> panel

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
gets fixed onto the onto the glass panel

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.960 
gets fixed onto the onto the glass panel
here<00:01:59.600> and<00:01:59.950> over<00:02:00.950> here<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.310> all<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.610> way<00:02:01.789> is

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
here and over here so all the way is

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.580 
here and over here so all the way is
transferred<00:02:02.450> onto<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.810> glass<00:02:02.990> down<00:02:03.319> to<00:02:03.500> the

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
transferred onto the glass down to the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.499 
transferred onto the glass down to the
floor<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:05.950> over<00:02:06.950> here<00:02:07.130> you've<00:02:07.460> got<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:08.060> door

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
floor and over here you've got the door

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.089 
floor and over here you've got the door
stopper<00:02:08.959> so<00:02:09.140> there<00:02:09.259> should<00:02:09.410> be<00:02:09.500> one<00:02:09.649> here<00:02:09.950> and

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
stopper so there should be one here and

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.710 
stopper so there should be one here and
one<00:02:10.160> on<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:11.300> side<00:02:11.330> as<00:02:11.750> well<00:02:13.599> there<00:02:14.599> you<00:02:14.690> have

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
one on that side as well there you have

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.870 
one on that side as well there you have
it
