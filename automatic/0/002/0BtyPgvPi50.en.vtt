00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 and the next question is maria dnipropetrovsk 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.600
 asks what to do if in the plane 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.059
 lays ears well, as I understand it 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.009
 question to the rebbe about the child first 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.880
 the simplest if you are faced with 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.490
 this plane and did not think it in advance 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.310
 give the child either some candy or 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.660
 try asking him to yawn 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.910
 just yawn to 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.670
 equal the internal pressure inside 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.980
 inner ear and respectively 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.990
 pressure inside the plane besides that 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.130
 try to swallow or 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:45.580
 chewing movements but apart from that 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.350
 you can give a child a grab 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.150
 necessarily a water bottle so he 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.520
 could just drink water 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:58.300
 then due to these movements 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:02.650
 pressure levels up to here except 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.050
 It is not recommended that the child 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.330
 fell asleep during takeoff and landing 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.570
 because he is at this moment just not 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.330
 swallowing it just breathes and wakes up 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.810
 from the fact that the eardrums are strong 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.290
 dented or vice versa 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.119
 the pressure increased and the child 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.119
 uncomfortable he wakes up crying and already 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.740
 then it is difficult to explain a crying child 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.590
 what exactly needs to be done if you have 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.750
 long flight of more than two s 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.820
 half a hour it is desirable i am a child 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.220
 wake up ordinary kids before boarding 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.050
 fall asleep by this time wake up before 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:48.640
 landing then you will be spared from 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.640
 the fact that the child wakes up crying 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.050
 But in some online stores or 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.090
 at foreign airports there are special 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.390
 earplugs are those rates higher which 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.670
 allows you to equalize the pressure here and 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.810
 the name is just used during the landing 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.709
 and flight so if you have time 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.100
 You can order 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:16.750
 it's in online stores and 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:19.750
 take advantage of them for your child 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.750
 the following
