00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.320 
the difference that I baited people's
lives<00:00:14.870> no<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:16.320> think<00:00:17.010> about<00:00:17.430> baseball<00:00:17.670> all<00:00:18.180> of

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330

that's it you know hit the baseball
going<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.529> catching<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.300> playing<00:00:27.300> against

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
going to catching it playing against

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.870 
going to catching it playing against
another<00:00:27.750> team<00:00:28.400> playing<00:00:29.400> against<00:00:29.670> other
