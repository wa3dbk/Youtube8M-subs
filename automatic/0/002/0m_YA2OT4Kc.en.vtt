in all it's pretty good I guess you know

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.330 
in all it's pretty good I guess you know
to<00:01:51.710> compare<00:01:52.220> to<00:01:52.580> something<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.390> mean<00:01:53.570> look<00:01:54.050> at

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
to compare to something I mean look at

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.210 
to compare to something I mean look at
look<00:01:55.340> at<00:01:55.460> how<00:01:55.550> big<00:01:55.759> it<00:01:55.940> is<00:01:55.970> you<00:01:56.360> know<00:01:57.220> pretty

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.170 
look at how big it is you know pretty
big<00:01:59.710> um<00:02:00.710> I<00:02:00.770> guess<00:02:01.190> I'll<00:02:01.220> just<00:02:01.520> have<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:01.940> look

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
big um I guess I'll just have to look

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.490 
big um I guess I'll just have to look
for<00:02:02.390> another<00:02:02.420> wheel<00:02:03.170> but<00:02:03.650> that's<00:02:04.400> about<00:02:04.610> it<00:02:04.670> I

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
for another wheel but that's about it I

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.650 
for another wheel but that's about it I
mean<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.650> caïds<00:02:06.920> itself<00:02:07.490> is<00:02:07.759> just<00:02:08.119> pretty

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
mean the caïds itself is just pretty

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.540 
mean the caïds itself is just pretty
awesome<00:02:09.459> and<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:11.920> water<00:02:12.920> bottle<00:02:13.280> is<00:02:13.370> in<00:02:13.459> the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
awesome and the water bottle is in the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.760 
awesome and the water bottle is in the
back<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.360> this<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:14.840> what<00:02:15.020> I've<00:02:15.140> done<00:02:15.380> but<00:02:16.180> this

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.830 

I<00:02:19.830> mean<00:02:20.490> I'll<00:02:20.580> probably<00:02:20.760> expect<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.570> later<00:02:21.750> on

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
I mean I'll probably expect it later on

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.310 
I mean I'll probably expect it later on
but<00:02:22.440> for<00:02:22.800> now<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.670> what<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:23.970> happened<00:02:24.320> so

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
but for now this is what I happened so

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.160 
but for now this is what I happened so
that's<00:02:25.920> about<00:02:26.040> it
