00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 before changed wide the animations 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.560
 consume a lot of memory and that is yes 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.480
 clear, as you know 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.790
 the alternative is called cut out 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.950
 animations- and today we look 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.400
 three tools for such animations once 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.400
 more exactly 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.739
 hello my name is tom noddy 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.140
 programmer a game 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.269
 this is a straight animation of 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.670
 Designer had to do every single frame 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:37.100
 even draw quickly in a row 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.890
 played, the impression of one arises 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.769
 right movement that's the way to go 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.620
 example with the super nintendo made with 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.809
 Increasing 3d technology was also the 2d 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.760
 Technology was getting better and so you could 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.460
 new possibilities of animation 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.949
 so for example develop the map the 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.070
 nation or siegenthaler 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.260
 animations 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.659
 you simply draw the individual 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.030
 body parts of the object to be animated 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:05.239
 These are then keyframed in 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.479
 their main positions are shown and 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.640
 the calculator then calculates all between 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.500
 images automatically one should only 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.140
 connect the framerate of the project 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.640
 that does not change anything because of the change 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.950
 between images that are automatically yes 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.640
 calculated and not like the street 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.009
 animation redrawn and one such 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.350
 skeleton animation usually looks in 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.979
 high framerate also much more fluid 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.539
 So you save a lot of memory then yes 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.789
 not every single frame anymore 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.310
 must save but as a graphic the 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.590
 individual body parts and as text or 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.560
 the information the individual positions 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.990
 at certain times this body part 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.530
 the disadvantage of such an animation until 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.329
 not so much picture variety but one 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.560
 clever entertainer can already there 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.479
 the whole lot of tricks 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.219
 but what do you actually create now 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.499
 such animations 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.389
 There are various tools for this 

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:01.670
 facilitate work and three of them 

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:04.149
 Let's take a look today 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.149
 closer to 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.600
 dragon balls is an extension for 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.080
 So do not flash this flash now 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.600
 player but this flash animation 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.280
 sector program which then files 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.670
 creates the one displayed in the flash player 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.440
 become 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.210
 so who's already with flash a little bit 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.230
 knows about this has a relatively easy 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.140
 Started 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.090
 Nevertheless, it is a bit 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.930
 Found around the animation reasonable 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.560
 hinzubekommen 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.600
 besides rain is complete with us 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.560
 free only for flash you have to stop 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.900
 a bit of advice 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.580
 The disadvantage with dragon is that 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.760
 you do not really many 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.190
 has options and that 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.930
 the plug in for example under mac 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.700
 bit packed and that by 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.390
 much less 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.100
 Settings options are 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.530
 however, a big advantage is 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.720
 that you can flash his animation in this 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.450
 can export vector format and 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.700
 thus saves even more size 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.420
 although the graphics are indeed arbitrary 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.420
 are scalable 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.160
 2 at kickstarter project which is 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.050
 really great popularity pleased 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.300
 it is about wine 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.860
 most versatile and comprehensive 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.500
 animation tool which I here you 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.420
 imagine silly is only that one in the 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.030
 save trial again 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.620
 can export or things if you 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.230
 the test version but you can like 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.770
 Get a basic version for $ 69 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.390
 pick up 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.800
 that's a lot 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:33.650
 feasible and who is ready even 289 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.900
 dollar entertainment program he spend 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.200
 also gets mesh 3d lattice 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.209
 deformations and inverter magix with 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.940
 a mesh deformation will see your two 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.680
 already almost as if it were in 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.840
 3ds truth already 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.440
 It must be clear to you from the outset that 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:55.150
 leg is clearly a high level and top 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.150
 level development tool is 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.180
 with sprite I'll put you another 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.879
 kickstarter project before that too 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:07.650
 is relatively popular when dragon with us 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:11.099
 somewhere is here and on the disease 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:15.629
 scale is about here then it is wider 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:17.970
 So it's pretty close 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.799
 kassa shit boy and the good 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.419
 wider is with the free version 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.180
 can you already a lot 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.900
 start for the complete scope of 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.770
 later so much pro version you have 59 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.720
 pay dollars 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.820
 Steam recently even had one 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.400
 small discount and there was that 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.270
 whole country already for under 15 euro 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.560
 and it's really worth it 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.080
 Do you even have a free one 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.870
 versions invest kids maddox features 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.729
 that means you take the hand and 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.310
 position you and the rest of the body 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.289
 will continue to be positioned automatically 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.699
 is just this 3d match deformations 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:57.440
 in development and will be the pro version 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.440
 also added in future 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.870
 All three tools work well for cut 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.510
 out sessions in front of white wine and wider 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.970
 like a big and similar one 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.750
 variety of additional possibilities 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.360
 present 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.570
 But how is it now at the end? 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.060
 the performance of the question is if 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.900
 me from an animation 30 instances 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.420
 abspiele 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.760
 how high is then the framerate 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.850
 a maximum frame rate of 60 frames 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.450
 per second funnily enough in ours 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:32.240
 profi tool here a bit off 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.130
 whereas later so the semi profi 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.530
 tool or at least the profi tool with 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.840
 lower costs the full 60 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.550
 create pictures per second and yourself 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.830
 the completely free dragon 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.380
 Farmers still a passable 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:49.460
 mean was tested on one 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.950
 iphone 4s on the desktop create all 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.060
 three tools the full bandwidth of 60 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.170
 frames per second 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.820
 I actually used to 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.920
 exclusively with dragon balls 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.410
 worked that was because it firstly 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.030
 is free and secondly with us 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.200
 were still in the starting blocks wider 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.180
 and therefore not available yet 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.980
 For example, all were 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.050
 Animations at Candy Away with Dragon 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.230
 balls created for my new project 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.430
 however, I get on fighters to as 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.380
 here simply the price and 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.050
 much better 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.580
 which tool are for you now that 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.590
 right is that had to be based on yours 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.110
 set your own criteria 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.940
 if you like unity user of the da 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.190
 There is already an animation school 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.110
 So you can actually use that 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.600
 Nevertheless, there are possibilities like you 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.520
 Use all three tools in the motive as well 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.860
 So you can already have four 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.690
 various possibilities 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.130
 whether now one of these three tools for 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.870
 you and your way of working yours 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.030
 programming language or for yours 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.800
 framework are suitable because you are asking 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.750
 best this google 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.130
 that could be for example on the 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.720
 manufacturer pages which I all below 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:54.830
 linked you will find enough 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:57.520
 information and otherwise tip 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:00.620
 Tip google programming language plugin 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.850
 Blablabla usually works for me 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.260
 is now interested in which of the three 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.940
 tools is interesting for you or 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.370
 Which of these do you have with which 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.480
 experience already used in 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.840
 this sense 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:14.390
 until next time dad dad head off 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.760
 which also ask her to the game program 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:18.980
 many people i mention that in almost 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.450
 every speed coding but not everybody 

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:24.020
 watch each video the 

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:24.860
 snooty neckline that's right 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.110
 I program with the 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.030
 programming language actionscript 3 the 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.190
 is also used in flash games to 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:34.130
 program and as ati I use the 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:38.230
 flash builder this is one of adobe 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.230
 a modified eclipse form with
