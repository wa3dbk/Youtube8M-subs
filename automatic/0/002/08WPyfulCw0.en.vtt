00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.530
 friends from above my people have passed them 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.530
 once you are eating 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.540
 very happily and suddenly part of the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.359
 food that you are eating if it falls 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.250
 and stain part of her skirt or part of her 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.769
 blouse because today we are going to know 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.080
 how to get the grease stain on our 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.580
 garment in four basic steps are very 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.640
 easy in which you are going to 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.640
 learn how to get thank you spots 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.570
 one 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.149
 well we have here this shirt where 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.340
 if you have a very visible grease stain 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.070
 and what we are going to do first is 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.309
 grab the part where it is stained 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.649
 then we grabbed the tackle soap what 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.910
 we apply directly on the stain 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.520
 a very good amount 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.800
 we grab the brush that has to have 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.230
 the very hard bristles and then we started to 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.550
 brush in this way 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:11.710
 we strongly brush the garment 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.260
 in all the area where you have the fat 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.030
 until it does quite as well as what 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.100
 are you watching with enough foam 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:24.630
 is what is needed approximately what 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.630
 we do for about two minutes 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.219
 and if the garment is greasy by all 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.939
 sides you can use a brush 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:36.090
 much bigger and doing it in the row of 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.130
 his house in this case because the pledge does not 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.079
 it is very stained and it is done 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.079
 precisely in the thing 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.979
 she does not like to work what she 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.500
 like is dancing by moving the hips 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.660
 he always goes with his bed 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.220
 let it act approximately 2 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.220
 minutes to 5 minutes 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.710
 then we are going to introduce the garment already 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.410
 with the soap in the water where it is 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.750
 completely hot very hot and 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.640
 we have to stop acting we have to 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.040
 let act at least a few 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.110
 minutes and that way it's going to go 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.780
 tearing off little by little the fat that is 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.660
 inside our good shirt is already 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.849
 ready our garment and we remove the fat 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.709
 then we add a little water 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.209
 clarifying our pledge and this 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.220
 so as you can introduce 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.709
 the washing machine or you can also wash it 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.350
 hand and is ready nothing else has to 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.150
 dry it after outdoors and this 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.430
 way you have your garment ready 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.709
 no grease stains with these images 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.069
 we return to the studies above 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.069
 digital 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.200
 with his bed
