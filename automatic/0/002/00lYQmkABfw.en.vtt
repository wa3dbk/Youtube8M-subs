shortly<00:00:26.660> i'm<00:00:27.500> using<00:00:28.100> the<00:00:28.359> mp5<00:00:29.359> with<00:00:29.779> a<00:00:29.810> red<00:00:30.080> dot

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
shortly i'm using the mp5 with a red dot

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.979 
shortly i'm using the mp5 with a red dot
and<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:31.400> proficiency<00:00:32.149> kick<00:00:32.390> i<00:00:32.539> think<00:00:32.780> so<00:00:32.930> i'll

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
and the proficiency kick i think so i'll

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.250 
and the proficiency kick i think so i'll
be<00:00:33.140> the<00:00:33.320> reduced<00:00:33.920> recoil<00:00:34.190> one<00:00:34.699> and<00:00:34.940> i'm<00:00:35.899> not

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
be the reduced recoil one and i'm not

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.020 
be the reduced recoil one and i'm not
quite<00:00:36.499> sure<00:00:36.530> my<00:00:36.859> perks<00:00:37.100> actually<00:00:37.609> might<00:00:37.999> be

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
quite sure my perks actually might be

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.569 
quite sure my perks actually might be
slight<00:00:38.390> of<00:00:38.539> hand<00:00:38.589> last<00:00:39.969> perk<00:00:40.969> thing<00:00:41.690> and

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
slight of hand last perk thing and

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.610 
slight of hand last perk thing and
marksman<00:00:43.579> no<00:00:44.210> stalker<00:00:44.870> the<00:00:45.229> one<00:00:45.379> where<00:00:45.530> you

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
marksman no stalker the one where you

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.979 
marksman no stalker the one where you
aim<00:00:45.769> down<00:00:45.800> sight<00:00:46.190> and<00:00:46.339> you<00:00:46.399> walk<00:00:46.760> faster<00:00:47.210> but

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
aim down sight and you walk faster but

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.689 
aim down sight and you walk faster but
I'm<00:00:48.229> just<00:00:48.589> using<00:00:48.769> this<00:00:48.979> submachine<00:00:49.519> gun

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
I'm just using this submachine gun

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.029 
I'm just using this submachine gun
because<00:00:49.969> the<00:00:50.510> maps<00:00:50.749> on<00:00:51.019> modern<00:00:51.440> warfare<00:00:51.559> 3<00:00:51.710> at

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
because the maps on modern warfare 3 at

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.949 
because the maps on modern warfare 3 at
the<00:00:52.159> moment<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:52.579> ones<00:00:52.729> that<00:00:52.940> I've<00:00:53.059> seen<00:00:53.299> are<00:00:53.929> a

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:53.959 
the moment the ones that I've seen are a

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:56.829 
the moment the ones that I've seen are a
lot<00:00:54.319> smaller<00:00:54.949> than<00:00:55.609> any<00:00:56.120> other<00:00:56.329> college<00:00:56.569> eat

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
lot smaller than any other college eat

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:58.779 
lot smaller than any other college eat
well<00:00:57.049> not<00:00:57.530> any<00:00:57.679> other<00:00:57.859> ecology<00:00:58.309> but<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.549> lot

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
well not any other ecology but a lot

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.629 
well not any other ecology but a lot
smaller<00:00:59.089> than<00:00:59.389> black<00:00:59.749> ops<00:01:00.019> and<00:01:00.639> modern

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:01.639 
smaller than black ops and modern

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:04.329 
smaller than black ops and modern
warfare<00:01:01.760> 2<00:01:02.119> so<00:01:02.749> it<00:01:02.929> kind<00:01:03.139> of<00:01:03.229> allows<00:01:03.829> for

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
warfare 2 so it kind of allows for

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.210 
warfare 2 so it kind of allows for
submachine<00:01:05.150> gun<00:01:05.330> gameplay<00:01:05.600> more<00:01:06.020> and<00:01:06.229> i<00:01:06.830> found

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
submachine gun gameplay more and i found

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.040 
submachine gun gameplay more and i found
that<00:01:07.310> i've<00:01:07.520> done<00:01:07.550> better<00:01:08.090> with<00:01:08.480> a<00:01:08.720> submachine

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
that i've done better with a submachine

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.460 
that i've done better with a submachine
gun<00:01:09.560> than<00:01:09.710> I<00:01:09.800> have<00:01:10.010> with<00:01:10.250> like<00:01:10.880> an<00:01:11.000> m4<00:01:11.450> or<00:01:11.660> a

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
gun than I have with like an m4 or a

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.670 
gun than I have with like an m4 or a
different<00:01:13.130> assault<00:01:13.370> rifle<00:01:13.700> so<00:01:14.450> chose<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.290> mp5

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
different assault rifle so chose the mp5

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.110 
different assault rifle so chose the mp5
for<00:01:15.920> this<00:01:16.040> game<00:01:16.220> it's<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.550> first<00:01:16.820> time<00:01:16.970> I've

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
and that's carried over from up to

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.590 
and that's carried over from up to
modern<00:01:48.409> warfare<00:01:48.680> 3<00:01:48.860> I<00:01:49.130> should<00:01:49.370> say<00:01:49.550> and<00:01:49.730> it

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
modern warfare 3 I should say and it

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.820 
modern warfare 3 I should say and it
just<00:01:50.810> feels<00:01:50.990> like<00:01:51.110> such<00:01:51.440> a<00:01:51.470> more

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
just feels like such a more

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.970 
just feels like such a more
action-packed<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:53.240> enjoyable<00:01:53.870> game<00:01:54.170> from

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
action-packed and enjoyable game from

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.490 
action-packed and enjoyable game from
what<00:01:55.130> I've<00:01:55.220> seen<00:01:55.250> so<00:01:55.490> far<00:01:55.760> I'm<00:01:56.720> not<00:01:56.930> making<00:01:57.380> any

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
but i'm going to talk about submachine

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
but i'm going to talk about submachine
guns<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.750> damage<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.780> they<00:02:31.110> do<00:02:31.400> in<00:02:32.400> this

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
guns and the damage that they do in this

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.120 
guns and the damage that they do in this
game<00:02:32.730> everything<00:02:33.480> has<00:02:33.680> stopping<00:02:34.680> power<00:02:34.800> built

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
game everything has stopping power built

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.420 
game everything has stopping power built
in<00:02:35.310> but<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.360> still<00:02:36.780> takes<00:02:37.680> more<00:02:37.950> bullets<00:02:38.280> to

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
in but it still takes more bullets to

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.430 
in but it still takes more bullets to
kill<00:02:38.460> somebody<00:02:38.820> than<00:02:39.240> it<00:02:39.360> did<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.540> modern

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
kill somebody than it did in modern

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.150 
kill somebody than it did in modern
warfare<00:02:40.590> 2<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.690> like<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.260> way<00:02:43.380> I<00:02:43.680> think

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
warfare 2 and I like it that way I think

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.640 
warfare 2 and I like it that way I think
it's<00:02:44.280> fair<00:02:44.460> that<00:02:44.490> way<00:02:44.790> because<00:02:45.110> it<00:02:46.110> kind<00:02:46.590> of

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
it's fair that way because it kind of

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.250 
it's fair that way because it kind of
goes<00:02:46.800> back<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.250> bit<00:02:47.520> more<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.940> cod4<00:02:48.660> style

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
goes back to a bit more of cod4 style

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.870 
goes back to a bit more of cod4 style
modern<00:02:49.470> warfare<00:02:49.740> 2<00:02:50.010> was<00:02:50.190> like<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.430> should<00:02:50.460> you

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
modern warfare 2 was like you should you

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.280 
modern warfare 2 was like you should you
see<00:02:51.060> somebody<00:02:51.300> you<00:02:51.570> shoot<00:02:51.810> them<00:02:51.930> they're<00:02:52.110> dead

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
see somebody you shoot them they're dead

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.260 
see somebody you shoot them they're dead
or<00:02:52.500> somebody<00:02:53.160> sees<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.490> you're<00:02:53.850> dead<00:02:54.030> and

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
or somebody sees you you're dead and

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.550 
or somebody sees you you're dead and
this<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.870> gives<00:02:54.960> you<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.140> little<00:02:55.260> bit<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.500> a

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
this it gives you a little bit of a

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.580 
this it gives you a little bit of a
chance<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:56.100> at<00:02:56.820> least<00:02:57.000> fight<00:02:57.390> back<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.900> to

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
chance to at least fight back and to

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.770 
chance to at least fight back and to
take<00:02:59.430> turn<00:02:59.670> around<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.090> just<00:03:00.120> run<00:03:00.420> away<00:03:00.510> and

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
take turn around and just run away and

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.260 
take turn around and just run away and
I'm<00:03:01.740> really<00:03:02.220> enjoying<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.730> in<00:03:02.910> this<00:03:03.000> game<00:03:03.060> i

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270

a<00:03:19.500> minute<00:03:19.740> actually<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:21.300> ump<00:03:21.780> with<00:03:22.050> a

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
a minute actually and the ump with a

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.770 
a minute actually and the ump with a
silencer<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.250> found<00:03:23.970> that<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.210> took<00:03:24.360> quite<00:03:24.630> a

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
silencer I found that it took quite a

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.600 
silencer I found that it took quite a
lot<00:03:25.020> of<00:03:25.050> bullets<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.500> kill<00:03:25.530> people<00:03:25.830> it<00:03:26.220> was

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
lot of bullets to kill people it was

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.700 
lot of bullets to kill people it was
quite<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.850> lot<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:27.390> bit<00:03:27.870> surprised<00:03:28.230> like<00:03:28.260> how

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
quite a lot a bit surprised like how

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.010 
quite a lot a bit surprised like how
didn't<00:03:29.250> he<00:03:29.340> died<00:03:29.490> after<00:03:29.850> i<00:03:29.880> put<00:03:30.030> like<00:03:30.210> seven<00:03:30.960> or

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
didn't he died after i put like seven or

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.870 
didn't he died after i put like seven or
eight<00:03:31.170> bullets<00:03:31.500> into<00:03:31.740> them<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.490> i<00:03:32.670> think

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
eight bullets into them and i think

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.940 
eight bullets into them and i think
that's<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.060> good<00:03:33.210> thing<00:03:33.270> actually<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:34.020> just<00:03:34.500> it

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
that's a good thing actually it just it

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.170 
that's a good thing actually it just it
means<00:03:35.130> that<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.340> have<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.490> be<00:03:35.670> better<00:03:35.970> you

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
means that you have to be better you

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.690 
means that you have to be better you
have<00:03:36.240> to<00:03:36.300> be<00:03:36.480> more<00:03:36.630> skilled<00:03:37.050> and<00:03:37.520> get<00:03:38.520> more

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
have to be more skilled and get more

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.390 
have to be more skilled and get more
shots<00:03:38.940> on<00:03:39.180> target<00:03:39.290> so<00:03:40.290> hopefully<00:03:41.070> that'll

I went into playing this game with that
opinion<00:05:10.289> or<00:05:10.740> that<00:05:10.919> mindset<00:05:11.460> and<00:05:11.850> I<00:05:12.510> got<00:05:13.260> a

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
opinion or that mindset and I got a

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:14.750 
opinion or that mindset and I got a
little<00:05:13.470> bit<00:05:13.710> frustrated<00:05:14.190> because<00:05:14.490> I<00:05:14.520> wasn't

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
little bit frustrated because I wasn't

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.000
