00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
realized that there is probably an

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.600 
realized that there is probably an
option<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.500> can<00:01:13.530> change<00:01:13.920> or<00:01:14.189> an<00:01:14.250> app<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.580> can

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
option I can change or an app I can

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.219 
option I can change or an app I can
download<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.210> allows<00:01:15.420> me<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.750> do<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.020> but<00:01:16.170> I

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
download that allows me to do that but I

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.480 
download that allows me to do that but I
haven't<00:01:16.439> actually<00:01:16.590> looked<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.189> yet<00:01:17.310> so

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
haven't actually looked for it yet so

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.999 
haven't actually looked for it yet so
therefore<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.119> doesn't<00:01:18.390> exist<00:01:18.600> now<00:01:19.500> because
