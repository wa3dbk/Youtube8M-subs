00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello my name is champ hansa and you 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.750
 see or hear now the call of duty 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.660
 ghost yes I am of course after 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.580
 in front of ghost not so ghost not 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.929
 so much suspicion but I give 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.040
 my best completely honest and also today 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.719
 I have a setup again 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.760
 to be suggested by a youtuber 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.039
 Colleagues you also know that is 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.350
 Namely in the anti we the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.480
 still from the palawan project know that 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.250
 is one of my competitors in 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.840
 quotes and he had 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.269
 here a setup suggested because he 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.019
 a little longer and a little more told 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.579
 I want to get in here now 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.590
 hold back a bit as you see 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.300
 already playing here and sooner 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.739
 so that you can explain beautiful for the first time 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.170
 what he thought 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.700
 hello dear jim ripen here very anti 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.320
 and I have one for you today 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.629
 new class setup for your coffee to 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.789
 go snoop series and this is it 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.410
 a little more unusual setup something 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.239
 what not many people are playing alone 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.129
 of the weapons was here but what 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.570
 the more fun you make with it 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.370
 handles properly 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.079
 I call this cluster affectionately 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.640
 rambo of the twenty-first century 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.350
 because it has similarities with 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.320
 what Rambow does in his repertoire 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.119
 but would have something with a 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.140
 more modern touch which weapon to take 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.790
 of course if we are as close as possible 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.130
 possible to stay original 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.570
 Of course the chainsaw is the only thing 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.369
 we just celebrate from the hip 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.439
 can and do not use it in 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.850
 can and the whole states like out 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.159
 with fast fire and one 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.869
 silencer what from the whole yes the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.430
 makes quiet death or to make it easy 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.150
 to sound even more aebischer 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.549
 good in spanish mrd 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.380
 Let's leave that as a secondary week 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.150
 we use the m9 with a silencer on 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.560
 best you can pretty much anybody 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.790
 second week but choose the switch 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.140
 is important because if you 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.970
 exceptionally on the secondary 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.170
 Of course, yours should also be accessible 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.930
 cover does not fly up 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.189
 what the tactics equipment and the primary 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.659
 equipment is there is actually 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.610
 free choice though sometimes i totally 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.380
 especially funny find a smoke grenade 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.850
 as a tactic equipment to take with because 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.649
 just drop it somewhere 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.060
 with a concentrated firepower of 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.590
 change just completely through 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.829
 wood and one or the other 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.360
 opponents yes get away what the perks are concerned 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.130
 we have both dexterity and 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.320
 steady hand around the clear weaknesses 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.759
 one thing in general, and that too 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.350
 Chain is supposed to be purely from the hip 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.509
 firing can counter a bit 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.580
 have humiliations around the staff 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.150
 to support the aspect a bit yes 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.370
 we have 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.049
 because you have twice 80 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.340
 balls in his repertoire but the 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.110
 just faster with fast before 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.540
 away as you can look and last 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.180
 we have players what you too 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.799
 again just a mountain after each 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.000
 respawn hopefully that gives 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.159
 also a certain advantage over 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.049
 Your opponent brings this class 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.370
 setup is definitely not a run and gun 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.930
 Time off as you probably already 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.299
 but it is a setup 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.099
 something special for maps and modes 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.450
 checkpoints is meant speak 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.530
 rule for a long time something like 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.700
 sprengkommando not yet in the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.950
 normal listen in it is 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.510
 probably the ideal mode to work with 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.549
 This thing a little more defensive 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.409
 play the sound for your own benefit 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.599
 otherwise just use the clenched 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.980
 firepower to use the opponents times 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.079
 to shave so properly 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.639
 I hope you have just as much fun with 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.139
 this class setup like me and wish 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:01.019
 you still much success with this series 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:03.389
 1000 yes many thanks for this setup 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.010
 I do not know if I am yet 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.629
 to thank me or if I am 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.639
 just in the jet vomit that me 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.989
 Actually , just try me 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.579
 thus the whole pds and the 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.079
 deal storm guns 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.400
 I'm not quite into the city yet 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.019
 gone and also with the others 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.150
 I have not really shared yet 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.190
 a lot of experience is collected anyway 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.930
 so now my first trip to the 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.819
 lmg Sckell or whatever ye 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.750
 should show if so if you are 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.699
 if you're feeling a bit like that 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.500
 Construction machinery from can dollar or with 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:30.359
 Devices with which you really broke something 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.370
 Can do on the spot then sees that here 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.199
 Like either a chainsaw or 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.909
 why a fat jackhammer so he 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:37.579
 because this special handle around the man 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.230
 on this chains judgment has yes 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.329
 really cool looks really 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.530
 and it's awesome shit 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.129
 multiplied the first round with it 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.290
 ran 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.459
 I mean my air marin got me 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.629
 so also warned so he also said 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.979
 because of that is not that 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.120
 classic thing you should do with it too 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.970
 not so much fast through the area 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.530
 et cetera blabla and I had to 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.000
 unfortunately also on my own body somewhere 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.530
 experienced and this is one of the 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 better round in others I have 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.979
 just directly on the face 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.359
 it did not really get me much 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:05.099
 made fun but later 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.150
 Love better then and this one 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.010
 as I said one of the about 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.349
 quotes is better round 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.690
 of course not relevant to this me 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.760
 think the setup I will again 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.109
 later discover again for me or 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.220
 pick up again and when I enter 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.900
 a little bit better 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.980
 I'll try it again 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.750
 to erase around 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.370
 I always demand this series 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.950
 to write on me comments 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.240
 what I can do better here 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.310
 Maybe it's still up a bit 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.530
 to find my playing style or you like 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.910
 that would be all it takes to play 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.620
 I allowed watch me then 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.540
 times and will optionally one the 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.840
 or other thing there again after play 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.520
 or me again look at who now 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.960
 Why is he thinking about this now? 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.800
 anti got back so why does he have me 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.500
 not asked etc 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.990
 At the moment I'm just wondering 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.330
 a few youtuber colleagues you 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.820
 obviously youtube youtube call of 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.870
 have a duty experience and go later 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.250
 We then maybe in live 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.450
 streams and so on this thing 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.400
 so that we can do it a bit 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.660
 can adapt a bit live but now 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.850
 this is a story for the moment 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.380
 they just keep on trying 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.180
 my youtuber colleagues from so 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.770
 I do not need any direct 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.190
 setup suggestions per pn or something 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.480
 write 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.580
 if that's in the comments that is 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.530
 very important that I read through me 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.090
 then to see okay that's more in 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.010
 this direction or marriage before this direction 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.840
 I pulled that out again 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.490
 experience and then you also share 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.020
 then to the community 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.500
 Of course, the one or 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.060
 pull out another thing or 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.470
 See what other people are playing 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.420
 I think that's extremely important 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.790
 is for me also such a source of 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.290
 Information that else me 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.060
 probably either locked 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.740
 would stay or spend a lot of time 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.030
 would last much longer so now he has 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.520
 me just because so even in the 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.570
 jump with his shit nakba weapon 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.500
 the corner wood but here in the 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.850
 Repeat has been seen 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.950
 I had probably met before 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.650
 when I'm still waiting on the floor fucking 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.180
 on it so the setup here I would have 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.040
 probably play a lot more passive 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.990
 so it does not have to be here for 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.460
 I passed a good score later 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.230
 I still have to catch it the next time 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.160
 make it in any case and see now 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.660
 I write in German in the 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.360
 comments what would you recommend me 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.310
 that could improve here and again 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.960
 thank you so much for anti that he gave me this 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.820
 Of course, setup also suggested 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.050
 including the soundtrack little know 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.000
 should look right now in the 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.080
 connecting his channel to link finds 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.310
 of course, as always in the 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.900
 description my name is jim rumen 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.900
 I say thanks for watching on up
