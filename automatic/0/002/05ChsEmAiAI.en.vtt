00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
think the top level was a first prestige

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.569 
think the top level was a first prestige
level<00:01:33.810> 30<00:01:34.229> or<00:01:34.380> something<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.710> this

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
abilities to note that they were going

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.149

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
to capture it if I didn't do that so I

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.679 
to capture it if I didn't do that so I
did<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.579> because<00:03:02.790> I'm<00:03:03.060> part<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.359> matrix

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689
