00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 it's hard for me to vote match 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.990
 like that and you read if ever that 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.429
 you do not succeed they go after that 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.309
 it's difficult in the minutes that 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.750
 follow or otherwise dezaki following as 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.910
 in football are competitors 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.039
 we are all competitors so we have to 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.930
 quickly put on horseback and we have a 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.789
 opportunity if I allow myself image 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.760
 next to be able to tell the public and 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.430
 it's a faux pas Sunday we talked 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.980
 of inefficiency it is assumed that against the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.670
 Benin we will find this efficiency 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.300
 I imagine you are working at 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.739
 the training is not a 1-1 2-3 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.290
 days we can work 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.780
 the finalization if I have good memory or 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.430
 you too have the archives of 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.510
 Malian football in recent years to 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.170
 a problem of finalization I think we 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.730
 talked about it we'll be working from here 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.320
 know we are the tool in the middle of 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.500
 field and practically in defense 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.000
 advanced the desert so it lasts since 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.250
 years I think we'll go there 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.469
 working on it we created 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.300
 occasions I think they consider 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.700
 that these days it was a day without and of 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.590
 mans is the one where one day for us 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.970
 when he hit the headlines he 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.340
 are these little zain de matic 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.200
 and puts them in the big picture that's all 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.719
 will say yeah good cachexia names 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.869
 he arrived late and albi who 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:23.180
 so is he happened he kept coming 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.250
 talk to the group first because 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.950
 it's the spirit of group and others so 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.070
 he got there by miller others 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.069
 that's the test is it should go to 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.369
 also be explained and offered us 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:40.310
 the southern scale the supreme authority of the 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.280
 football and so my mood so the 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.649
 group does not accept and has not too much but you 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.289
 know football I do not like me 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.630
 project if you followed even in 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.329
 Beyond interviews before Rwanda I have 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.640
 not want to talk to property or 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.939
 of Algeria because the lightning united 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.709
 the present that counts the future 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.289
 the past does not count algeria 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:06.380
 I do not think about it yet it's the bene 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:09.410
 I think I will take two months puffed 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.690
 to think of algeria has it all 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.730
 next there is the Benin 24 hours a day 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.180
 we must think benign and learn to 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.180
 the Algeria
