is<00:00:13.259> how<00:00:13.410> cuz<00:00:13.620> we're<00:00:13.799> just<00:00:14.009> put<00:00:14.190> all<00:00:14.340> these

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
is how cuz we're just put all these

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.310 
is how cuz we're just put all these
lights<00:00:14.820> up<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.240> trying<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.509> get<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:15.870> pretty

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
lights up and trying to get this pretty

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.429 
lights up and trying to get this pretty
well<00:00:16.680> luma<00:00:17.190> needed<00:00:17.570> but<00:00:18.570> we're<00:00:19.050> putting<00:00:19.350> the

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
well luma needed but we're putting the

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.050 
well luma needed but we're putting the
5-speed<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.100> super<00:00:20.369> right<00:00:20.550> now<00:00:20.699> as<00:00:20.880> you

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
5-speed in the super right now as you

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.759 
5-speed in the super right now as you
saw<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.390> probably<00:00:21.720> last<00:00:21.869> video<00:00:22.170> we're<00:00:22.410> taking

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
saw in probably last video we're taking

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.679 
saw in probably last video we're taking
the<00:00:22.859> automatic<00:00:23.369> out<00:00:23.550> we<00:00:23.939> got<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.210> 5-speed

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
the automatic out we got the 5-speed

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.980 
the automatic out we got the 5-speed
right<00:00:24.869> here<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:25.320> not<00:00:25.350> 154<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.630> I<00:00:27.630> thought

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
right here it's not 154 and I thought

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.509 
right here it's not 154 and I thought
I'd<00:00:28.230> show<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.529> guys<00:00:28.710> how<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.070> much<00:00:29.250> works

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
I'd show you guys how it much works

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.130 
I'd show you guys how it much works
because<00:00:29.820> I'm<00:00:30.150> sure<00:00:30.330> some<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.810> don't<00:00:30.990> know

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
because I'm sure some of you don't know

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.310 
because I'm sure some of you don't know
exactly<00:00:31.380> how<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.130> works<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:33.329> why<00:00:33.630> not<00:00:33.809> before

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
exactly how it works so why not before

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.920 
exactly how it works so why not before
we<00:00:34.410> put<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.739> I'll<00:00:34.950> show<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.160> how<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.930> so

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
we put in I'll show you how to do it so

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
clutch does it transfers the power from

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.910 
clutch does it transfers the power from
the<00:01:02.489> engine<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.420> transmission<00:01:03.530> how<00:01:04.530> might

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the engine to the transmission how might

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.450 
the engine to the transmission how might
you<00:01:05.010> ask<00:01:05.040> well<00:01:06.110> we<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.590> thing<00:01:07.920> called<00:01:08.189> a

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
you ask well we have this thing called a

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.840 
you ask well we have this thing called a
flywheel<00:01:09.320> this<00:01:10.320> will<00:01:10.560> be<00:01:10.770> bolted<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.369> rightly

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
flywheel this will be bolted to rightly

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.170 
flywheel this will be bolted to rightly
to<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> engine<00:01:12.450> spinning<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.900> crankshaft

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
to the engine spinning on the crankshaft

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.990 
to the engine spinning on the crankshaft
and<00:01:15.180> then<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:16.500> pressure<00:01:16.830> plate<00:01:17.100> with<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
and then this pressure plate with the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.140 
and then this pressure plate with the
throw<00:01:18.600> up<00:01:18.720> bearing<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.259> will<00:01:20.040> be<00:01:20.159> bolted<00:01:20.369> to

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
throw up bearing on it will be bolted to

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.310 
throw up bearing on it will be bolted to
the<00:01:21.240> side<00:01:21.479> wheel<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.520> in<00:01:23.520> between<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:24.320> will

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the side wheel and in between that will

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.960 
the side wheel and in between that will
be<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> clutch<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.790> will<00:01:26.880> be

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
be the clutch it is so it will be

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.760 
be the clutch it is so it will be
sandwiched<00:01:27.450> right<00:01:28.460> between<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> two<00:01:29.729> and

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
sandwiched right between the two and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.289 
sandwiched right between the two and
when<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.610> then<00:01:32.729> before<00:01:33.000> we

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
when it's like that and then before we

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.160 
when it's like that and then before we
bolt<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.720> down<00:01:35.030> it<00:01:36.030> will<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.240> completely

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
bolt it down it will be completely

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.620 
bolt it down it will be completely
contacting<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.040> clutch<00:01:38.400> disc<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.450> will

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
contacting the clutch disc so this will

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.100 
contacting the clutch disc so this will
be<00:01:39.780> engaged<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.310> flywheel<00:01:41.759> spins<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.990> will

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
be engaged so the flywheel spins it will

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.899 
be engaged so the flywheel spins it will
spin<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.409> clutch<00:01:43.590> disc<00:01:43.950> which<00:01:44.399> will<00:01:44.579> spin<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
spin the clutch disc which will spin the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.280 
spin the clutch disc which will spin the
pressure<00:01:45.149> plate<00:01:45.450> because<00:01:45.930> they're<00:01:46.140> all

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
pressure plate because they're all

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.160 
pressure plate because they're all
connected<00:01:46.740> now<00:01:47.210> when<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.329> disengages<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
connected now when it disengages the

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.950 
connected now when it disengages the

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
bearing here which pulls on these fins

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.760 
bearing here which pulls on these fins
which<00:02:02.490> pulls<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.360> friction<00:02:03.869> material<00:02:04.350> back

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
which pulls this friction material back

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.639 
which pulls this friction material back
away<00:02:05.700> from<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.000> clutch<00:02:06.180> disc<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:07.439> when<00:02:07.560> it

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
away from the clutch disc so when it

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.040 
away from the clutch disc so when it
pulls<00:02:07.860> away<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.970> clutch<00:02:09.179> disc<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.780> just

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
pulls away the clutch disc is just

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.119 
pulls away the clutch disc is just
spinning

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
spinning

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.640 
spinning
on<00:02:11.609> the<00:02:11.730> input<00:02:11.999> shaft<00:02:12.260> which<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:13.499> will

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
on the input shaft which this will

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.860 
on the input shaft which this will
simulate<00:02:13.969> it<00:02:14.969> will<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:15.180> be<00:02:15.299> spinning<00:02:15.540> on<00:02:15.749> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
simulate it will just be spinning on the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.199 
simulate it will just be spinning on the
input<00:02:16.139> shaft<00:02:16.700> don't<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.819> touch<00:02:17.969> on<00:02:18.120> the

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
input shaft don't you touch on the

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.699 
input shaft don't you touch on the
flywheel<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.959> will<00:02:19.139> completion<00:02:19.590> the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
flywheel and will completion the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.809 
flywheel and will completion the
pressure<00:02:19.920> plate<00:02:20.189> so<00:02:20.400> it's<00:02:20.549> completely

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
pressure plate so it's completely

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.509 
pressure plate so it's completely
disengaged<00:02:21.599> when<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.680> let<00:02:22.829> off<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.040> pedal

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.330 

the<00:02:26.519> pressure<00:02:26.849> plate<00:02:27.180> goes<00:02:27.719> back<00:02:27.989> on

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
the pressure plate goes back on

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.520 
the pressure plate goes back on
sandwiches<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.370> too<00:02:29.939> to<00:02:30.450> first<00:02:31.200> plate<00:02:31.409> in

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
sandwiches that too to first plate in

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.589 
sandwiches that too to first plate in
the<00:02:31.590> flood<00:02:31.799> wheel<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.250> it's<00:02:33.030> engaged<00:02:33.329> again

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
the flood wheel and it's engaged again

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.379 
the flood wheel and it's engaged again
and<00:02:33.810> transfers<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.379> power<00:02:34.439> so<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.790> material

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
and transfers the power so the material

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.170 
and transfers the power so the material
on<00:02:36.599> a<00:02:36.629> clutch<00:02:37.019> is<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:38.099> same<00:02:38.430> material<00:02:38.969> as<00:02:39.120> a

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
on a clutch is the same material as a

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.800 
on a clutch is the same material as a
brake<00:02:39.510> pad<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.790> if<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:42.299> really<00:02:42.540> think<00:02:42.749> about

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
brake pad so if you really think about

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.129 
brake pad so if you really think about
it<00:02:43.139> this<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.439> your<00:02:43.560> fifth<00:02:43.859> brake<00:02:44.870> works<00:02:45.870> just

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
it this is your fifth brake works just

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.890 
it this is your fifth brake works just
like<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.349> brake<00:02:46.560> pad<00:02:47.329> pushing<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:48.419> brake<00:02:48.540> panel

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
like a brake pad pushing the brake panel

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.979 
like a brake pad pushing the brake panel
nice<00:02:49.079> and<00:02:49.290> slow<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:50.090> engage<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.269> smoothly<00:02:51.569> and

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
nice and slow and engage it smoothly and

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.770 
nice and slow and engage it smoothly and
just<00:02:52.500> accelerates<00:02:53.090> easy<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.449> it<00:02:54.569> doesn't

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
just accelerates easy and it doesn't

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.569 
just accelerates easy and it doesn't
slam<00:02:55.650> nice<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:56.790> easy<00:02:57.319> if<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:58.439> slam<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.370> brake

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
slam nice and easy if you slam the brake

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.819 
slam nice and easy if you slam the brake
pedal<00:02:59.939> you<00:03:00.419> jerk<00:03:00.659> forward<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.319> pretty<00:03:01.590> much

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
pedal you jerk forward and pretty much

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.240 
pedal you jerk forward and pretty much
same<00:03:02.489> thing<00:03:02.699> with<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.819> clutch<00:03:03.829> if<00:03:04.829> you<00:03:04.980> let<00:03:05.129> the

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
same thing with a clutch if you let the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.800 
same thing with a clutch if you let the
pedal<00:03:05.459> out<00:03:05.790> slowly<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:07.590> goes<00:03:07.769> in<00:03:08.010> slowly

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
pedal out slowly it goes in slowly

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.110 
pedal out slowly it goes in slowly
engages<00:03:09.810> slowly<00:03:10.199> nice<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.769> smooth<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.310> you

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
engages slowly nice and smooth and you

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.179 
engages slowly nice and smooth and you
don't<00:03:12.269> squeal<00:03:12.900> your<00:03:13.109> wheels<00:03:13.379> or<00:03:13.709> stall<00:03:14.010> or

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
don't squeal your wheels or stall or

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.809 
don't squeal your wheels or stall or
whatever<00:03:14.509> if<00:03:15.509> you<00:03:15.629> dump<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.430> boom

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
whatever if you dump it boom

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.509 
whatever if you dump it boom
slams<00:03:18.239> right<00:03:18.540> on<00:03:18.659> it<00:03:18.810> instant<00:03:19.620> engagement<00:03:20.220> you

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
slams right on it instant engagement you

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.520 
slams right on it instant engagement you
either<00:03:20.669> stall<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.299> or<00:03:21.569> you're<00:03:21.870> burning<00:03:22.319> tires

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
either stall it or you're burning tires

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.099 
either stall it or you're burning tires
down<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:22.949> racetrack<00:03:23.599> so<00:03:24.599> it's<00:03:24.720> kind<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:24.930> like

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
down the racetrack so it's kind of like

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.309 
down the racetrack so it's kind of like
the<00:03:25.859> opposite<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.639> what<00:03:26.699> a<00:03:26.849> brake<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.329> or<00:03:28.019> if

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
the opposite of what a brake is or if

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.020 
the opposite of what a brake is or if
you're<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.530> Corvette<00:03:29.069> they<00:03:29.310> can<00:03:29.519> spin<00:03:29.849> the

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
you're a Corvette they can spin the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.599 
you're a Corvette they can spin the
wheels<00:03:30.299> yeah<00:03:32.030> if<00:03:33.030> your<00:03:33.299> pressure<00:03:33.689> plate<00:03:34.609> if

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
wheels yeah if your pressure plate if

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.969 
wheels yeah if your pressure plate if
this<00:03:36.030> pressure<00:03:36.269> plate<00:03:36.569> does<00:03:37.470> not<00:03:37.709> have<00:03:37.949> a

this pressure plate does not have a
strong<00:03:38.310> enough<00:03:38.430> grip<00:03:38.879> if<00:03:39.120> these<00:03:39.389> fins<00:03:39.720> are<00:03:40.129> not

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
strong enough grip if these fins are not

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:46.390 
strong enough grip if these fins are not
as<00:03:41.400> strong<00:03:41.759> and<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:44.310> attempt<00:03:44.639> to<00:03:44.699> burnout<00:03:45.150> it

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
as strong and you attempt to burnout it

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.729 
as strong and you attempt to burnout it
is<00:03:47.400> possible<00:03:48.090> for<00:03:48.209> this<00:03:48.449> disc<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:49.109> be<00:03:49.379> fully

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
is possible for this disc to be fully

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.979 
is possible for this disc to be fully
engaged<00:03:50.040> on<00:03:50.669> the<00:03:51.180> pressure<00:03:51.419> plate<00:03:51.540> at<00:03:51.900> the

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
engaged on the pressure plate at the

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.360 
engaged on the pressure plate at the
flywheel<00:03:52.229> and<00:03:52.590> spin<00:03:54.379> now<00:03:55.379> it's<00:03:55.560> acting<00:03:56.009> just

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
flywheel and spin now it's acting just

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.580 
flywheel and spin now it's acting just
like<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.609> brake<00:03:56.819> pad<00:03:57.090> this<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.169> brake<00:03:58.379> pad

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
like a brake pad this is the brake pad

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.300 
like a brake pad this is the brake pad
this<00:03:58.829> is<00:03:58.919> murder

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
this is murder

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.129 
this is murder
it's<00:03:59.489> just<00:03:59.699> spinning<00:04:00.150> on<00:04:00.449> it<00:04:00.599> constantly

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
it's just spinning on it constantly

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.129 
it's just spinning on it constantly
spinning<00:04:01.759> thousands<00:04:02.759> of<00:04:02.819> organs<00:04:03.150> by<00:04:03.359> 5,000

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
spinning thousands of organs by 5,000

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.240

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.470 

so<00:04:08.250> it's<00:04:08.400> spinning<00:04:08.640> spinning<00:04:08.850> spinning<00:04:09.000> and

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
so it's spinning spinning spinning and

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.480 
so it's spinning spinning spinning and
it's<00:04:10.020> burning<00:04:10.410> if<00:04:10.500> you<00:04:10.620> ever<00:04:10.740> drove<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.160> really

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
it's burning if you ever drove a really

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.920 
it's burning if you ever drove a really
big<00:04:11.670> truck<00:04:11.970> towing<00:04:12.240> something<00:04:12.690> going
