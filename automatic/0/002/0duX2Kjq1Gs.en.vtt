00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.230
 I do not know about you, but personally for me if I have a long time 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.390
 playing any game is always interesting 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.120
 happens to look at the same version 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.309
 games on different platforms 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.930
 battlefield 4 i play sit for peak 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.210
 most of those who are me now 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.939
 listens of course playing on bye 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.159
 but I always wondered what in general 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.619
 batla is different on different platforms 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:27.499
 because apparently so historically 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.589
 It happened but for me the information about it 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:33.050
 It came very little and grabbed premium 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:36.140
 Yiddish for another sale in psn to me 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.460
 still managed to live it all out learn tell 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.160
 immediately battles 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.829
 it never on yet it port very 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.129
 even like it and almost always I did 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.280
 but the difference is they are not fundamental 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.379
 but there are what anyone sees first 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.019
 a player who wants to play 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.309
 battlefield 4 first window entry 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.379
 origin then open browser 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.550
 having rummaged in the future browsers 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.579
 batlog you still 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.160
 find yourself a server opens the game and 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.960
 greets you with loading and if you want 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.670
 go immediately with a friend 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.340
 drag and vodnik on the strip 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.560
 downloads to do it if the gods 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.410
 today on your side then a friend will get 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.530
 washes away no later than 3 terrace and you 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.300
 Start downloading fun together 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.190
 To go nuts just especially considering how up 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.530
 Browser batalov is still working 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.020
 which is still at any moment 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.570
 manage to start braking in every possible way 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.670
 rage first does not send invite 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.560
 and then sends everything at once when 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.540
 trying to capture more than one person 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.210
 whole new you still go first in 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.270
 whom do you invite but how much 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:46.550
 you need to do to run bf4 on 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.830
 ps4 just click on the button 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.560
 well maybe one more time to skip 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.200
 requires all other actions search 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.870
 server, etc. etc. happens exactly 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.820
 in the game by the way if you want to jump with 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.100
 the friend is all very simple inside the game 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.560
 a squad is created whose leader chooses 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.140
 where and how to play just such a composition 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.670
 you are in the game and jump and no logachev 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.190
 invader 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.860
 after logging in and always go to the selection stage 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.110
 server and immediately catches the eye with one another 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.120
 profusion on the console for each mode 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.640
 There is a certain number of players on 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.720
 server that is a big capture only in 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.760
 64 people are small at 32 to 32 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.860
 smoky tire at 20 and so on 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.880
 I don’t know plus or minus but 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.820
 feature is 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.620
 and one more small item which is very 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.650
 noticeable when choosing a server 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.870
 The fact that there are 4 dead 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.910
 modes with modes like mavi 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.610
 anosov who all lost two weeks 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.320
 after dlc and u forgot about it 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.720
 regimes like diffuse already 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.330
 neutralization and other dead 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.520
 either little popular modes because 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.950
 that he plays on any console man 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.680
 more than yet find the filled 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.050
 server with these modes easier not 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.209
 say to save them much as 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.840
 I'm dead and they are not without reason 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:08.480
 but there is a fact of further loading in 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.540
 average about 20 seconds and then 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.640
 own gameplay itself on this 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.049
 Stage in the eye catches the look of the game 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.940
 and here it is required to clarify 3 points 1 to 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.220
 on consoles battlefield 4 is the same 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.790
 the graphics as she is on ultra with all 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.690
 the effects of the second is not in full 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.390
 1080 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.459
 and in 900 I don’t know how you will 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.040
 I personally noticed such a difference 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.850
 only when I shot a video in 1080 and then 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.510
 revised 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:42.260
 but someone seems to have a couple of pixels 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.690
 very important so yes how are and 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.580
 the third such shade that you 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.180
 See the very beginning you will have 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.120
 is always 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:54.230
 no graphics settings are here all 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.130
 these light blur shadow effects it all 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.040
 can not be disabled 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.920
 besides, you still can not adjust your angle 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.890
 review for all standard me first 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.260
 I did not like it very much and I referred it to 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.570
 minus but I will say honestly played and 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.120
 getting used I realized that in fact it 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.390
 plus all these effects make a picture 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:18.680
 only better hide everything to the network of graphics and 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.900
 all that but if for now you need them 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.789
 shut off just to see no more 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.240
 suffer from what is worse notice 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:28.539
 enemies here i'm now halibut 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.220
 they and all do not turn off and so everything in 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.800
 equal conditions and all have beautiful 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.810
 the picture and the last thing in my opinion 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.060
 the main difference is the console version from 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.389
 so far they were selling me more 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.060
 all this balance how do you know returns 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.789
 most barrels if not all 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.310
 polls vafa 4 is controlled very 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:50.410
 easy and balance because of it suffers 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.479
 a lot of complaints come on 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.819
 uniformity of all trunks very many 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.099
 trunks themselves do not show as they should 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:59.740
 in situations that they should not 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:02.199
 do this besides but for now always 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.389
 many mokousy many window different 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:07.060
 things on different legs and so on and so 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.520
 similar on consoles with this much 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.190
 better you accelerate return for example 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.050
 really felt not like 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.509
 of course hardline but felt 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.539
 there is no such as for example as a 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:22.270
 sniper with bolt track more than 50 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.909
 meters this one most likely shoots 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.729
 in 3 seconds and what's the strangest 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:29.979
 most of the trunks which is bye 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.710
 absolutely not popular on the console 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.479
 used almost everywhere here 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.000
 for example a lot you are at home for not yet 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:39.580
 greeted fighters with dmr 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.789
 it seems that there is not there it is considered the norm 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:46.000
 because dmr is a weapon for 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.830
 certain situation and distance and there 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.229
 replace it with some carbine or 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.419
 assault rifle can not again 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.650
 anything happens the problem still remains 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:57.880
 but as I said there with this get and 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.830
 Now I do not want to start another 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.360
 console srach in no case 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.340
 urge anyone to play any 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.310
 platform everyone plays where he is 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.430
 more like just such here 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.860
 I'm impressed by the transition to ps4 game 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.560
 opened for me a second time again 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.949
 get her a lot of fun and this 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.199
 great luck to you on the battlefield just 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:23.819
 all the very very smaller meet in 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:23.819
 online and see you
