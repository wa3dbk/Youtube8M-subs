in<00:00:16.059> these<00:00:16.990> 30<00:00:17.320> second<00:00:17.740> drawings<00:00:18.189> what<00:00:18.910> I'm

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
in these 30 second drawings what I'm

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.359 
in these 30 second drawings what I'm
looking<00:00:19.449> for<00:00:19.750> is<00:00:20.080> structure<00:00:20.860> so<00:00:21.099> I'm<00:00:21.189> just

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
looking for is structure so I'm just

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:22.760 
looking for is structure so I'm just
looking<00:00:21.520> for<00:00:21.910> the<00:00:22.000> rib<00:00:22.180> cage<00:00:22.420> and<00:00:22.599> the<00:00:22.660> pelvis

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
sloppy you draw the boxes and I tried to

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.609 
sloppy you draw the boxes and I tried to
make<00:01:10.180> these<00:01:10.360> nice<00:01:10.570> and<00:01:10.600> clean<00:01:10.990> so<00:01:11.259> they<00:01:11.380> ended

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
make these nice and clean so they ended

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.139 
make these nice and clean so they ended
up<00:01:11.800> closer<00:01:12.130> to<00:01:12.280> a<00:01:12.399> minute<00:01:12.759> than<00:01:12.910> thirty

up closer to a minute than thirty

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.749 
up closer to a minute than thirty
seconds<00:01:13.660> but<00:01:13.890> regardless<00:01:14.890> it's<00:01:15.070> still<00:01:15.340> the

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
seconds but regardless it's still the

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.160 
seconds but regardless it's still the
same<00:01:15.970> thing<00:01:16.210> you're<00:01:16.479> just<00:01:16.509> looking<00:01:17.140> for

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
same thing you're just looking for

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.280 
same thing you're just looking for
structure<00:01:18.009> and<00:01:18.250> if<00:01:18.759> you<00:01:18.850> get<00:01:19.060> this<00:01:19.210> right<00:01:19.509> you

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
structure and if you get this right you

the<00:01:55.180> photograph<00:01:55.570> or<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.899> model<00:01:56.229> will<00:01:56.350> show

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
the photograph or the model will show

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.469 
the photograph or the model will show
you<00:01:56.590> that<00:01:56.829> and<00:01:57.100> then<00:01:57.909> there's<00:01:58.149> certain

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
you that and then there's certain

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.789 
you that and then there's certain
proportions<00:01:59.110> that<00:01:59.320> you're<00:01:59.439> going<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.619> want<00:01:59.770> to

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
proportions that you're going to want to

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.160 
proportions that you're going to want to
work<00:01:59.950> towards<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:00.579> if<00:02:00.790> you<00:02:00.969> know<00:02:01.420> my<00:02:01.810> pillow

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
work towards and if you know my pillow

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.990 
work towards and if you know my pillow
shape<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.829> the<00:02:03.040> articles<00:02:03.399> from<00:02:03.520> imagined

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
shape and the articles from imagined

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.850 
shape and the articles from imagined
effects<00:02:04.299> and<00:02:04.479> so<00:02:04.630> forth<00:02:04.659> then<00:02:05.469> you<00:02:05.590> know<00:02:05.740> those

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
effects and so forth then you know those

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.759 
effects and so forth then you know those
proportions<00:02:06.520> in<00:02:06.729> there<00:02:06.930> I'll<00:02:07.930> explain<00:02:08.560> those

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
proportions in there I'll explain those

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.090 
proportions in there I'll explain those
in<00:02:08.920> another<00:02:09.009> video<00:02:09.310> in<00:02:10.079> the<00:02:11.100> relationship

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
in another video in the relationship

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.190 
in another video in the relationship
between<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.579> two<00:02:12.760> it<00:02:13.000> is<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.450> spine<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:14.110> the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
between the two it is the spine in the

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.960 
between the two it is the spine in the
back<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.769> it<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.160> centerline<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:15.880> the

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
back and it is the centerline in the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.150 
back and it is the centerline in the
front<00:02:16.269> now<00:02:17.019> as<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.260> get<00:02:17.380> involved<00:02:17.620> in<00:02:17.799> these<00:02:17.950> two

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
front now as I get involved in these two

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.400 
front now as I get involved in these two
reclining<00:02:18.760> poses<00:02:19.180> these<00:02:19.570> next<00:02:19.900> two<00:02:19.989> reclining

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
reclining poses these next two reclining

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.069 
reclining poses these next two reclining
poses<00:02:20.799> I'll<00:02:21.640> explain<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.150> little<00:02:22.239> bit<00:02:22.540> about

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
poses I'll explain a little bit about

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.349 
poses I'll explain a little bit about
what's<00:02:23.410> going<00:02:23.470> on<00:02:23.769> here<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.280> when<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.180> do<00:02:25.329> a

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
what's going on here so when you do a

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.390 
what's going on here so when you do a
quick<00:02:25.630> sketch<00:02:25.900> there<00:02:26.590> are<00:02:26.739> two<00:02:27.100> different

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
quick sketch there are two different

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.960 
quick sketch there are two different
camps<00:02:27.699> of<00:02:27.790> thinking<00:02:28.150> between<00:02:28.269> kick

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
camps of thinking between kick

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.510 
camps of thinking between kick
sketches<00:02:29.450> there's<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.650> camp<00:02:30.890> of<00:02:31.070> thinking

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
sketches there's the camp of thinking

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.390 
sketches there's the camp of thinking
where<00:02:32.000> you<00:02:32.510> just<00:02:32.750> draw<00:02:33.140> in<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.650> raw<00:02:33.830> state<00:02:34.250> of

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
where you just draw in the raw state of

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.250 
where you just draw in the raw state of
drawing<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:34.970> there's<00:02:35.480> nothing<00:02:36.080> wrong<00:02:36.200> with

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
drawing and there's nothing wrong with

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.080 
drawing and there's nothing wrong with
doing<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:36.800> in<00:02:36.920> fact<00:02:37.160> there<00:02:37.640> isn't<00:02:37.790> anything

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
doing that in fact there isn't anything

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.420 
doing that in fact there isn't anything
wrong<00:02:38.420> with<00:02:38.750> any<00:02:39.050> way<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:39.890> doing<00:02:40.220> what<00:02:40.400> you

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
wrong with any way of doing what you

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.370 
wrong with any way of doing what you
want<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:40.820> do<00:02:40.970> but<00:02:41.510> if<00:02:41.660> you're<00:02:41.780> going<00:02:41.930> down<00:02:42.050> an

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
want to do but if you're going down an

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.620 
want to do but if you're going down an
academic<00:02:42.890> pathway<00:02:43.400> if<00:02:43.880> you're<00:02:44.150> going<00:02:44.300> down<00:02:44.450> a

academic pathway if you're going down a

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.390 
academic pathway if you're going down a
practical<00:02:45.320> pathway<00:02:45.740> or<00:02:45.950> you're<00:02:46.070> going<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.250> be

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
practical pathway or you're going to be

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.070 
practical pathway or you're going to be
working<00:02:46.580> in<00:02:46.850> an<00:02:46.940> industry<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.450> any<00:02:47.660> kind<00:02:47.930> that

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
working in an industry of any kind that

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.470 
working in an industry of any kind that
has<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.410> do<00:02:48.560> with<00:02:48.740> storyboarding<00:02:49.520> comic<00:02:50.300> books

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
has to do with storyboarding comic books

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.140 
has to do with storyboarding comic books
illustration<00:02:51.260> whatnot<00:02:51.800> then<00:02:52.490> you<00:02:52.790> have<00:02:53.000> to

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
illustration whatnot then you have to

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.210 
illustration whatnot then you have to
have<00:02:53.390> a<00:02:53.420> work<00:02:53.840> routine<00:02:54.260> that<00:02:54.560> helps<00:02:54.920> get<00:02:55.070> new

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
have a work routine that helps get new

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.640 
have a work routine that helps get new
results<00:02:55.400> so<00:02:56.390> what<00:02:56.810> we're<00:02:56.930> doing<00:02:57.230> here<00:02:57.470> with

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
results so what we're doing here with

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.260 
results so what we're doing here with
these<00:02:57.860> particular<00:02:58.100> quick<00:02:58.580> sketches<00:02:58.850> is<00:02:59.090> we're

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
these particular quick sketches is we're

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.540 
these particular quick sketches is we're
looking<00:02:59.540> for<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.810> masses<00:03:00.260> inside<00:03:00.710> the<00:03:01.100> torso

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
looking for the masses inside the torso

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.310 
looking for the masses inside the torso
in<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.760> rib<00:03:01.940> cage<00:03:02.209> if<00:03:02.450> we<00:03:02.690> can<00:03:02.870> plot<00:03:03.080> those

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
in the rib cage if we can plot those

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.640 
in the rib cage if we can plot those
masses<00:03:03.800> correctly<00:03:04.610> in<00:03:04.820> their<00:03:05.030> proportions

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
masses correctly in their proportions

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.860 
masses correctly in their proportions
and<00:03:06.650> we<00:03:07.459> can<00:03:07.640> get<00:03:07.790> their<00:03:07.940> rotation<00:03:08.540> correct

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
and we can get their rotation correct

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.870 
and we can get their rotation correct
then<00:03:09.110> we<00:03:09.290> also<00:03:09.470> see<00:03:09.830> something<00:03:10.100> more<00:03:10.459> which<00:03:10.730> is

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
then we also see something more which is

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.400 
then we also see something more which is
called<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.270> animation<00:03:11.840> of<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:11.990> pose<00:03:12.200> and

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
called the animation of the pose and

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.440 
called the animation of the pose and
that's<00:03:12.560> going<00:03:12.800> to<00:03:12.890> bring<00:03:13.100> us<00:03:13.340> poses<00:03:14.270> that<00:03:14.390> are

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
that's going to bring us poses that are

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.540 
that's going to bring us poses that are
more<00:03:14.810> active<00:03:15.020> more<00:03:15.530> lively<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:16.100> more

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
more active more lively and more

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.850 
more active more lively and more
gestural<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.510> picture<00:03:17.900> so<00:03:18.110> that's<00:03:18.560> what

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
gestural to the picture so that's what

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.060 
gestural to the picture so that's what
this<00:03:19.130> basic<00:03:19.760> exercise<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:20.780> about<00:03:20.930> looking<00:03:21.860> for

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
this basic exercise is about looking for

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.310 
this basic exercise is about looking for
that<00:03:22.190> dynamic<00:03:22.760> relationship<00:03:23.510> in<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:24.050> core

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
that dynamic relationship in the core

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:49.089 
that dynamic relationship in the core
portion<00:03:24.709> of<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.700> torso

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.520 

all<00:03:50.099> right<00:03:50.190> these<00:03:50.370> next<00:03:51.120> 30<00:03:51.780> seconds<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.349> one

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
all right these next 30 seconds to one

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.080 
all right these next 30 seconds to one
minute<00:03:52.560> gestures<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.519> you<00:03:53.700> should<00:03:53.910> be<00:03:54.000> able

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
minute gestures and you should be able

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.500 
minute gestures and you should be able
to<00:03:54.209> work<00:03:54.330> your<00:03:54.390> way<00:03:54.660> towards<00:03:55.019> 30<00:03:55.260> seconds<00:03:55.860> our

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
to work your way towards 30 seconds our

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.270 
to work your way towards 30 seconds our
spiraling<00:03:57.510> gestures<00:03:57.989> I<00:03:58.319> call<00:03:58.800> it<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:59.010> kind<00:03:59.250> of

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
spiraling gestures I call it I kind of

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.930 
spiraling gestures I call it I kind of
call<00:03:59.489> them<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.790> tornado<00:04:00.950> technique<00:04:01.950> and<00:04:02.190> what

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
call them the tornado technique and what

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.400 
call them the tornado technique and what
you're<00:04:03.090> looking<00:04:03.599> to<00:04:03.629> do<00:04:03.870> is<00:04:04.019> you're<00:04:04.170> looking

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
you're looking to do is you're looking

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.440 
you're looking to do is you're looking
to<00:04:04.530> find<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.890> perspective<00:04:05.519> of<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:05.790> body<00:04:05.970> the

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
to find the perspective of the body the

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.839 
to find the perspective of the body the
limbs<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:07.200> axial<00:04:07.590> skeletal<00:04:08.010> portion<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.640> the

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
limbs the axial skeletal portion and the

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.880 
limbs the axial skeletal portion and the
tourists<00:04:09.209> of<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.390> core<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:09.989> you're<00:04:10.560> looking

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
tourists of the core and you're looking

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.369 
tourists of the core and you're looking
for<00:04:11.129> the<00:04:11.220> correct<00:04:11.610> rotation<00:04:12.209> of<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.110> lines

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
for the correct rotation of the lines

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.380 
for the correct rotation of the lines
and<00:04:13.680> you're<00:04:13.769> only<00:04:13.950> showing<00:04:14.549> that<00:04:14.700> portion<00:04:15.269> of

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
and you're only showing that portion of

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.960 
and you're only showing that portion of
it<00:04:15.540> that<00:04:15.750> wraps<00:04:16.079> around<00:04:16.229> the<00:04:16.590> body

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
it that wraps around the body

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.460 
it that wraps around the body
objectively<00:04:17.970> so<00:04:18.359> that<00:04:18.540> you<00:04:18.690> can<00:04:18.930> see<00:04:19.290> the

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
objectively so that you can see the

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.259 
objectively so that you can see the
perspective<00:04:20.100> from<00:04:20.130> your<00:04:20.340> point<00:04:20.729> of<00:04:20.820> view<00:04:20.880> if

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
perspective from your point of view if

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.719 
perspective from your point of view if
you<00:04:22.109> get<00:04:22.290> this<00:04:22.440> perspective<00:04:22.740> correct<00:04:23.400> then<00:04:23.580> in

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
you get this perspective correct then in

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.730 
you get this perspective correct then in
addition<00:04:24.210> to<00:04:24.389> the<00:04:24.660> blocks<00:04:25.290> that<00:04:25.470> we<00:04:25.650> were

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
addition to the blocks that we were

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.620 
addition to the blocks that we were
working<00:04:26.040> with<00:04:26.160> before<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:26.820> this<00:04:27.270> perspective

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
working with before and this perspective

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.770 
working with before and this perspective
these<00:04:28.500> two<00:04:29.010> concepts<00:04:29.760> together<00:04:30.000> should<00:04:30.540> help

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
these two concepts together should help

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.469 
these two concepts together should help
you<00:04:31.020> understand<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:31.860> resolve<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:32.880> full<00:04:33.180> body

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
you understand and resolve the full body

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:39.500 
you understand and resolve the full body
within<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:34.020> three-dimensional<00:04:34.740> space<00:04:38.510> in

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
within a three-dimensional space in

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.270 
within a three-dimensional space in
doing<00:04:40.229> this<00:04:40.350> technique<00:04:40.620> once<00:04:41.100> you're

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
doing this technique once you're

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.100 
doing this technique once you're
finished<00:04:41.639> with<00:04:41.729> the<00:04:41.850> spiraling<00:04:42.360> lines<00:04:42.660> then

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
finished with the spiraling lines then

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.529 
finished with the spiraling lines then
outline<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.220> contours<00:04:44.370> around<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.360> figure

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
outline the contours around the figure

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.900 
outline the contours around the figure
so<00:04:45.870> that<00:04:45.900> you<00:04:46.110> can<00:04:46.289> solidify<00:04:46.680> those<00:04:47.190> spiraling

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
so that you can solidify those spiraling

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.390 
so that you can solidify those spiraling
lines<00:04:48.120> into<00:04:48.479> a<00:04:48.510> mass<00:04:48.840> so<00:04:49.350> you<00:04:49.440> can<00:04:49.620> objectively

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
lines into a mass so you can objectively

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.610 
lines into a mass so you can objectively
look<00:04:50.729> at<00:04:50.850> the<00:04:50.940> full<00:04:51.120> volume<00:04:51.600> with<00:04:52.139> a<00:04:52.169> boundary

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
look at the full volume with a boundary

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.950 
look at the full volume with a boundary
around<00:04:53.010> it<00:04:53.520> and<00:04:53.700> here<00:04:54.240> I'm<00:04:54.360> putting<00:04:54.600> some

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
around it and here I'm putting some

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.750 
around it and here I'm putting some
lines<00:04:55.200> in<00:04:55.470> so<00:04:55.680> you<00:04:55.770> can<00:04:55.979> see<00:04:56.010> the<00:04:56.430> perspective

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
lines in so you can see the perspective

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.670 
lines in so you can see the perspective
of<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:57.479> drawing<00:04:57.750> those<00:04:58.020> are<00:04:58.169> the<00:04:58.260> lines<00:04:58.440> and

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
of the drawing those are the lines and

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.930 
of the drawing those are the lines and
those<00:04:58.800> are<00:04:58.950> the<00:04:59.010> directions<00:04:59.610> that<00:04:59.700> those

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
those are the directions that those

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.260 
those are the directions that those
parts<00:05:00.180> of<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.360> body<00:05:00.539> are<00:05:00.750> moving<00:05:01.110> in<00:05:01.970> this<00:05:02.970> is

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
parts of the body are moving in this is

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.940 
parts of the body are moving in this is
something<00:05:03.720> that<00:05:03.750> can<00:05:04.050> be<00:05:04.080> done<00:05:04.349> very<00:05:04.410> quickly

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
something that can be done very quickly

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.520 
something that can be done very quickly
and<00:05:05.550> in<00:05:05.729> fact<00:05:06.000> if<00:05:06.300> you<00:05:06.510> get<00:05:06.660> your<00:05:06.840> hand<00:05:07.200> into<00:05:07.410> a

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
and in fact if you get your hand into a

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.790 
and in fact if you get your hand into a
habit<00:05:08.070> of<00:05:08.160> moving<00:05:08.400> very<00:05:08.789> quickly<00:05:09.289> you<00:05:10.289> can<00:05:10.500> do

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
habit of moving very quickly you can do

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.940 
habit of moving very quickly you can do
these<00:05:10.979> within<00:05:11.310> 10<00:05:11.729> 15<00:05:11.910> seconds<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:13.530> extra

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
these within 10 15 seconds the extra

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.279 
these within 10 15 seconds the extra
lines<00:05:14.220> that<00:05:14.490> I<00:05:14.550> put<00:05:14.820> in<00:05:15.000> I<00:05:15.210> do<00:05:15.300> one<00:05:15.660> circle<00:05:16.110> for

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
lines that I put in I do one circle for

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:17.629 
lines that I put in I do one circle for
where<00:05:16.440> the<00:05:16.530> head<00:05:16.710> goes<00:05:16.979> and<00:05:17.280> then<00:05:17.370> I<00:05:17.400> put<00:05:17.610> a

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
where the head goes and then I put a

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.820 
where the head goes and then I put a
rhythm<00:05:18.120> line<00:05:18.360> across<00:05:18.750> where<00:05:19.169> the<00:05:19.349> boundaries

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
rhythm line across where the boundaries

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.100 
rhythm line across where the boundaries
should<00:05:20.250> be<00:05:20.400> set<00:05:20.760> for<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.330> size<00:05:21.570> of<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:21.870> pose

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
should be set for the size of the pose

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.320 
should be set for the size of the pose
if<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.919> arms<00:05:23.190> are<00:05:23.340> spread<00:05:23.460> wide<00:05:23.669> I'm<00:05:24.120> going<00:05:24.240> to

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
if the arms are spread wide I'm going to

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.940 
if the arms are spread wide I'm going to
make<00:05:24.479> some<00:05:24.660> gesture<00:05:25.050> points<00:05:25.380> out<00:05:25.530> there<00:05:25.710> so<00:05:25.919> I

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
make some gesture points out there so I

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.950 
make some gesture points out there so I
know<00:05:26.070> how<00:05:26.460> big<00:05:26.849> I'm<00:05:27.060> making<00:05:27.450> the<00:05:27.720> pose

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
know how big I'm making the pose

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.200 
know how big I'm making the pose
otherwise<00:05:28.500> sometimes<00:05:29.430> some<00:05:29.669> of<00:05:29.700> the<00:05:29.820> details

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
otherwise sometimes some of the details

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.650 
otherwise sometimes some of the details
can<00:05:30.419> get<00:05:30.599> lost<00:05:30.840> and<00:05:31.229> grow<00:05:31.919> on<00:05:32.220> you<00:05:32.550> which<00:05:32.880> it<00:05:33.240> is

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
can get lost and grow on you which it is

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.800 
can get lost and grow on you which it is
at<00:05:33.840> what<00:05:33.960> times<00:05:34.200> those<00:05:35.090> gestural<00:05:36.090> qualities

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
at what times those gestural qualities

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.600 
at what times those gestural qualities
or<00:05:37.050> those<00:05:37.289> inconsistencies<00:05:37.710> can<00:05:38.400> be<00:05:38.520> an

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
or those inconsistencies can be an

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.860 
or those inconsistencies can be an
interesting<00:05:38.849> thing<00:05:39.240> for<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:39.450> drawing

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
interesting thing for the drawing

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.690 
interesting thing for the drawing
however<00:05:40.349> again<00:05:40.500> I'm<00:05:40.800> looking<00:05:40.950> to<00:05:41.430> learn

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700

again<00:05:46.770> we're<00:05:47.039> putting<00:05:47.340> some<00:05:47.639> outlines<00:05:47.970> around

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
again we're putting some outlines around

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.450 
again we're putting some outlines around
it<00:05:48.450> so<00:05:48.599> we<00:05:48.690> can<00:05:48.840> see<00:05:49.050> exactly<00:05:49.470> where<00:05:50.310> the

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
it so we can see exactly where the

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.730 
it so we can see exactly where the
contours<00:05:51.000> are<00:05:51.240> that<00:05:51.570> we<00:05:51.720> have<00:05:51.900> built<00:05:52.169> and<00:05:52.410> how

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
contours are that we have built and how

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.920 
contours are that we have built and how
they<00:05:52.950> work<00:05:53.220> in<00:05:53.400> three-dimensional<00:05:54.060> space<00:05:54.090> he

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
they work in three-dimensional space he

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.360 
they work in three-dimensional space he
also<00:05:55.080> has<00:05:55.289> a<00:05:55.320> little<00:05:55.590> cloth<00:05:55.830> over<00:05:56.130> his<00:05:56.219> body

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
also has a little cloth over his body

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.670 
also has a little cloth over his body
and<00:05:56.640> that's<00:05:56.700> what<00:05:56.880> I<00:05:56.909> drew<00:05:57.120> in

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
and that's what I drew in

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.200 
and that's what I drew in
there<00:05:59.500> so<00:06:00.500> the<00:06:00.889> rings<00:06:01.310> that<00:06:01.850> we're<00:06:01.970> drawing

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
there so the rings that we're drawing

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.390 
there so the rings that we're drawing
here<00:06:02.600> are<00:06:02.780> complete<00:06:03.229> ellipses<00:06:03.830> but<00:06:04.160> I'm<00:06:04.280> only

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
here are complete ellipses but I'm only

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.310 
here are complete ellipses but I'm only
putting<00:06:04.729> a<00:06:04.880> portion<00:06:05.270> of<00:06:05.360> the<00:06:05.479> ellipse<00:06:05.780> in<00:06:06.020> I'm

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.320 
putting a portion of the ellipse in I'm

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.890 
putting a portion of the ellipse in I'm
letting<00:06:06.710> the<00:06:06.860> hand<00:06:07.130> move<00:06:07.490> all<00:06:08.120> the<00:06:08.389> way<00:06:08.419> around

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
letting the hand move all the way around

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.450 
letting the hand move all the way around
through<00:06:09.320> the<00:06:09.470> entire<00:06:09.770> gesture<00:06:10.250> of<00:06:10.280> the

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
through the entire gesture of the

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.340 
through the entire gesture of the
ellipse<00:06:10.729> but<00:06:10.940> I'm<00:06:11.060> only<00:06:11.360> marking<00:06:11.840> down<00:06:12.050> on<00:06:12.259> the

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.350 
ellipse but I'm only marking down on the

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.710 
ellipse but I'm only marking down on the
page<00:06:12.590> where<00:06:13.039> the<00:06:13.310> portion<00:06:14.210> of<00:06:14.300> the<00:06:14.419> ellipse

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
page where the portion of the ellipse

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.689 
page where the portion of the ellipse
should<00:06:14.930> be<00:06:15.110> that<00:06:15.380> faces<00:06:15.800> forward<00:06:16.039> towards<00:06:16.460> us

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:16.699 
should be that faces forward towards us

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:19.240 
should be that faces forward towards us
if<00:06:16.910> I<00:06:17.509> draw<00:06:17.960> the<00:06:18.020> whole<00:06:18.259> thing<00:06:18.320> then<00:06:18.860> chances

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
if I draw the whole thing then chances

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.529 
if I draw the whole thing then chances
are<00:06:19.310> likely<00:06:19.520> I<00:06:19.699> could<00:06:19.940> get<00:06:20.060> a<00:06:20.090> really<00:06:20.360> messy

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539 
are likely I could get a really messy

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:22.210 
are likely I could get a really messy
drawing<00:06:20.930> and<00:06:21.139> I<00:06:21.199> won't<00:06:21.410> really<00:06:21.710> be<00:06:21.979> able<00:06:22.009> to

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
drawing and I won't really be able to

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.129 
drawing and I won't really be able to
read<00:06:22.580> the<00:06:22.910> picture<00:06:23.360> for<00:06:23.690> the<00:06:23.870> perspective

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
read the picture for the perspective

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:27.490 
read the picture for the perspective
that<00:06:24.440> I'm<00:06:24.650> looking<00:06:24.889> for<00:06:25.539> and<00:06:26.539> again<00:06:26.870> once<00:06:27.289> all

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
that I'm looking for and again once all

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.529 
that I'm looking for and again once all
of<00:06:27.680> the<00:06:27.770> Rings<00:06:28.009> have<00:06:28.220> been<00:06:28.340> established<00:06:28.970> then

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:29.539 
of the Rings have been established then

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:31.089 
of the Rings have been established then
it's<00:06:29.690> a<00:06:29.750> good<00:06:29.900> idea<00:06:30.169> to<00:06:30.289> go<00:06:30.410> back<00:06:30.440> around<00:06:30.860> the

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
it's a good idea to go back around the

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.920 
it's a good idea to go back around the
whole<00:06:31.220> figure<00:06:31.460> put<00:06:31.910> an<00:06:32.000> outline<00:06:32.150> around<00:06:32.449> it<00:06:32.810> so

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:32.930 
whole figure put an outline around it so

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.719 
whole figure put an outline around it so
that<00:06:32.960> you<00:06:33.139> can<00:06:33.289> see<00:06:33.440> the<00:06:33.560> proportions<00:06:34.160> as<00:06:34.370> well

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:34.729 
that you can see the proportions as well

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:36.640 
that you can see the proportions as well
as<00:06:34.940> the<00:06:35.120> limited<00:06:35.570> space<00:06:35.960> that<00:06:35.990> you<00:06:36.289> have<00:06:36.440> just

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
as the limited space that you have just

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.020 
as the limited space that you have just
created<00:06:36.770> for<00:06:37.280> yourself<00:06:37.639> with<00:06:37.849> full

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030 
created for yourself with full

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:48.730 
created for yourself with full
perspective<00:06:38.470> involved<00:06:39.470> around<00:06:39.770> it

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.499 

all<00:06:49.280> right<00:06:49.400> these<00:06:49.520> last<00:06:49.759> two<00:06:49.940> drawings<00:06:50.360> are

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:50.509 
all right these last two drawings are

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:52.240 
all right these last two drawings are
just<00:06:50.660> pure<00:06:50.840> contour<00:06:51.349> and<00:06:51.590> what<00:06:51.830> you<00:06:51.949> do<00:06:52.069> with

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
just pure contour and what you do with

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.460 
just pure contour and what you do with
these<00:06:52.370> drawings<00:06:52.729> well<00:06:53.180> if<00:06:53.449> if<00:06:53.750> you<00:06:53.990> have<00:06:54.259> those

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470 
these drawings well if if you have those

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.499 
these drawings well if if you have those
proportions<00:06:54.800> in<00:06:55.190> mind<00:06:55.430> that<00:06:55.789> of<00:06:55.910> the<00:06:56.030> body<00:06:56.210> and

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:56.509 
proportions in mind that of the body and

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:57.909 
proportions in mind that of the body and
you<00:06:56.539> understand<00:06:57.110> it<00:06:57.289> then<00:06:57.440> what<00:06:57.590> you<00:06:57.680> kind<00:06:57.800> of

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 
you understand it then what you kind of

00:06:57.919 --> 00:06:59.740 
you understand it then what you kind of
do<00:06:58.069> is<00:06:58.220> you<00:06:58.340> go<00:06:58.460> back<00:06:58.729> and<00:06:58.940> forth<00:06:59.180> between<00:06:59.360> the

00:06:59.740 --> 00:06:59.750 
do is you go back and forth between the

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.550 
do is you go back and forth between the
two<00:06:59.930> sides<00:07:00.289> and<00:07:00.729> not<00:07:01.729> just<00:07:02.300> draw<00:07:02.750> down<00:07:03.229> one

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:03.560 
two sides and not just draw down one

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.379 
two sides and not just draw down one
side<00:07:03.949> and<00:07:04.220> then<00:07:04.460> come<00:07:04.669> back<00:07:04.699> around<00:07:05.090> and<00:07:05.270> do

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:05.389 
side and then come back around and do

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:06.969 
side and then come back around and do
the<00:07:05.509> other<00:07:05.539> side<00:07:05.780> while<00:07:06.440> that<00:07:06.620> will<00:07:06.770> produce

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:06.979 
the other side while that will produce

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:09.180 
the other side while that will produce
for<00:07:07.430> you<00:07:07.580> some<00:07:07.819> really<00:07:08.000> interesting

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.190 
for you some really interesting

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.550 
for you some really interesting
qualities<00:07:10.190> in<00:07:10.580> asymmetric<00:07:11.270> sits<00:07:11.870> so<00:07:12.020> and<00:07:12.289> so

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
qualities in asymmetric sits so and so

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.379 
qualities in asymmetric sits so and so
forth<00:07:12.860> and<00:07:13.069> if<00:07:13.310> you're<00:07:13.430> a<00:07:13.460> really<00:07:13.910> good<00:07:13.940> hand

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:14.389 
forth and if you're a really good hand

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:15.670 
forth and if you're a really good hand
you<00:07:14.599> might<00:07:14.780> be<00:07:14.870> able<00:07:14.990> to<00:07:15.080> get<00:07:15.199> things<00:07:15.380> more

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 
you might be able to get things more

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.460 
you might be able to get things more
symmetrical<00:07:16.250> it<00:07:16.669> does<00:07:17.150> lead<00:07:17.930> to<00:07:17.960> problems

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.470 
symmetrical it does lead to problems

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.409 
symmetrical it does lead to problems
with<00:07:18.949> one<00:07:19.160> side<00:07:19.430> of<00:07:19.610> the<00:07:19.699> figure<00:07:19.849> to<00:07:20.150> the<00:07:20.270> other

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:20.419 
with one side of the figure to the other

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:23.230 
with one side of the figure to the other
side<00:07:20.750> and<00:07:21.050> with<00:07:21.889> these<00:07:22.009> gestures<00:07:22.370> you<00:07:22.909> really

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 
side and with these gestures you really

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.749 
side and with these gestures you really
have<00:07:23.389> to<00:07:23.509> think<00:07:23.690> side<00:07:24.169> to<00:07:24.530> side<00:07:24.830> as<00:07:25.190> you<00:07:25.250> draw

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 
have to think side to side as you draw

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:27.670 
have to think side to side as you draw
them<00:07:25.970> through<00:07:26.360> and<00:07:26.630> that's<00:07:27.169> sort<00:07:27.380> of<00:07:27.470> what's

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 
them through and that's sort of what's

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.680 
them through and that's sort of what's
happening<00:07:28.069> here<00:07:28.130> I'm<00:07:28.699> working<00:07:28.849> from<00:07:29.150> one<00:07:29.389> side

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:29.690 
happening here I'm working from one side

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.450 
happening here I'm working from one side
and<00:07:29.900> then<00:07:30.259> going<00:07:30.500> to<00:07:30.530> the<00:07:30.650> other<00:07:30.830> side<00:07:30.949> as<00:07:31.340> you

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:31.460 
and then going to the other side as you

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.100 
and then going to the other side as you
can<00:07:31.490> see<00:07:31.759> here<00:07:32.090> the<00:07:32.389> same<00:07:32.599> thing<00:07:32.840> with<00:07:32.990> the

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.110 
can see here the same thing with the

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.080 
can see here the same thing with the
legs<00:07:33.349> one<00:07:33.770> side<00:07:34.069> and<00:07:34.340> then<00:07:34.490> the<00:07:34.639> other<00:07:34.789> and

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.090 
legs one side and then the other and

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.809 
legs one side and then the other and
here<00:07:35.690> I<00:07:35.720> have<00:07:36.080> left<00:07:36.409> the<00:07:36.710> muscles<00:07:36.949> out<00:07:37.340> so<00:07:37.669> that

00:07:37.809 --> 00:07:37.819 
here I have left the muscles out so that

00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:39.309 
here I have left the muscles out so that
I<00:07:37.880> can<00:07:38.060> get<00:07:38.180> the<00:07:38.270> gesture<00:07:38.569> of<00:07:38.750> the<00:07:38.870> leg<00:07:39.110> in

00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:39.319 
I can get the gesture of the leg in

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:41.469 
I can get the gesture of the leg in
first<00:07:39.590> and<00:07:40.009> then<00:07:40.550> I'll<00:07:40.699> put<00:07:40.880> the<00:07:40.909> muscles<00:07:41.330> in

00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:41.479 
first and then I'll put the muscles in

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:43.330 
first and then I'll put the muscles in
afterwards<00:07:42.050> or<00:07:42.289> a<00:07:42.349> few<00:07:42.620> of<00:07:42.650> the<00:07:42.800> muscles<00:07:43.159> where

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:43.340 
afterwards or a few of the muscles where

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.980 
afterwards or a few of the muscles where
they<00:07:43.460> need<00:07:43.639> to<00:07:43.729> go<00:07:43.909> if<00:07:44.120> the<00:07:44.300> gesture<00:07:44.659> does<00:07:44.810> not

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:44.990 
they need to go if the gesture does not

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.830 
they need to go if the gesture does not
a<00:07:45.020> lot<00:07:45.319> for<00:07:45.620> the<00:07:46.130> correct<00:07:46.550> linear<00:07:47.090> notation<00:07:47.750> of

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 
a lot for the correct linear notation of

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.710 
a lot for the correct linear notation of
the<00:07:47.960> body<00:07:48.169> but<00:07:48.949> these<00:07:49.159> are<00:07:49.460> correctly<00:07:50.270> drawn

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 
the body but these are correctly drawn

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.469 
the body but these are correctly drawn
or<00:07:51.050> at<00:07:51.470> least<00:07:51.880> designed<00:07:52.880> in<00:07:53.180> a<00:07:53.300> way<00:07:53.449> that

00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:53.479 
or at least designed in a way that

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:56.140 
or at least designed in a way that
resembles<00:07:54.440> the<00:07:54.770> pose<00:07:55.009> within<00:07:55.490> a<00:07:55.580> thirty<00:07:55.849> to

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:56.150 
resembles the pose within a thirty to

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.159 
resembles the pose within a thirty to
one<00:07:56.180> minute<00:07:56.780> duration<00:07:57.620> of<00:07:57.919> time
