00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:14.130
 rosalinda serum I have studied a campus and 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:16.170
 now I am a veterinary technician what I have 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.180
 learned on campus 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.770
 a pretty complete study is very 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.510
 I think I 'm qualified for what 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.240
 what I'm doing is fast 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.910
 maybe because good you all our 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.250
 agenda at the time of the study and the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.810
 time you want to spend you had your 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.989
 finished finishing the studies five 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.080
 months I see it the truth that to the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.330
 tutors I would not qualify so very well 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.540
 that environment seemed to me that I was 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.449
 quite on top of you then very nice 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.860
 very familiar and talking to you all very clear 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:51.890
 and very well giving you then expectation of 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.989
 find work when you finish 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.510
 I decided to study by campus 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.410
 It is the truth that is the first thing that 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.840
 I saw I asked there for how to see 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.180
 to the study method and I signed up 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.970
 directly that's how it was to see him and on that day 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.910
 I was doing the course I have a 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:15.259
 I would give a 10 to the people who have 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.909
 lying there a field I'm easy I made 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:23.570
 disney is the manager of the clinic 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:26.420
 veterinary leave the students bring 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.640
 a pretty good theoretical foundation and here 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.040
 what it's about is that they take management 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.270
 in animals how to treat people 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.090
 how to approach the owner 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.820
 to use material that they learn 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.979
 operative instruments to see the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.600
 employment options with people who 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.049
 it comes from practices of course it's 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.610
 fundamental if there is a vacancy ever 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.980
 let's take a person who has not 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.380
 done no course because 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.480
 a very specific field we need that 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.700
 have a basic training such as 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.310
 of our campus and then a 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.990
 practices the valuation of the people of 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.450
 practices that has been around here 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.820
 very good times is very educated people 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.930
 very correct we have been left wanting 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.930
 to have more time
