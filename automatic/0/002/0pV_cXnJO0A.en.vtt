00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:15.000
 hello very good the other day reviewing 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.490
 some samples that will come to me from 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.710
 discover a very simple thing very 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.210
 simple and yet very effective in 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.420
 that mobile has surely happened 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.700
 someone use it 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.710
 you are asking me what is 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.320
 talking about this good man he talks to you 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.570
 from the invisible deck you will see all 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.600
 you surely already know him 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.809
 procedure his revelation is in fact 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.070
 a deck revealed on my channel in 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:45.080
 several occasions with various modalities 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.290
 but one that had not taken place 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:51.170
 I never think it 's a deck that if the 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.330
 you do to a very large audience you have to 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.360
 be very clear that when you open the 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.210
 shuffle this one must be very close to the 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.239
 carpet because as you know we show 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.500
 one deck all face cards but 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.630
 is that the back also 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.040
 they are facing the one that does not pass a 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.380
 procedure that you search on my channel 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.330
 invisible deck and you know pushbutton 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.310
 so I'm not going to talk to you in a way 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.520
 clear and direct properties of 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.830
 this deck already we know them well what 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.440
 it happens that if this game we do it in 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.729
 a scenario we find the 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.190
 circumstance that you're going to have to 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.410
 show the letters well 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.340
 because they will not be able to see her back 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.890
 and as you have a side audience, it gives you 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.790
 you are when you see them 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.430
 good faces 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.530
 and regardless of whether it's going to go better or 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.460
 the worst I realized the following 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.260
 it turns out that you open an invisible deck 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.360
 giant that was for stage and brought 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.310
 another joker card had not been 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.830
 removed the jockers and would not have put 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.400
 what happens when I remove the deck 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.260
 I found that there is no danger that 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.080
 see the back of the deck look at the 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.890
 detail that happens that evidently 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.840
 depending on which side of we're going to 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.910
 use because if they ask us for peer 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.920
 we will open on this side but if we 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.340
 ask for pairs we will open for this other 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.590
 where there is not a problem my purpose is 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.599
 that now every time you ask for a deck 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.310
 invisible those who have bought it 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.470
 that you have it you know that the names do not 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.200
 they come they retreat I leave us aside 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.819
 with them he built with all those who 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.410
 removed along the decks that 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.870
 they use to manufacture all kinds of 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.390
 games built the decks of 52 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.819
 good jokers well now they will come with 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.040
 younger and if you have me that is one 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.050
 The current deck is used in the 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.810
 invisible and do the following a joker 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.340
 top down always keeping clear in 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.800
 which side do you have the look of 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.470
 the odd and obviously at the time of 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.660
 extract if you say they ask me for a letter 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.160
 in wall seven of spades for example 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.060
 well then 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.040
 and you arcress the letters the pressures for 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.890
 that create a bow and you can observe 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.670
 all the mind and extra was deck of 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:11.570
 face and calmly show it 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.580
 On the back, nothing happens because there is no 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.560
 danger of seeing the back is 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.330
 say that you do not see yourself in need and the 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.660
 obligation to stick your hands to the mat 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.940
 and that no curious child happens and 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.000
 What has not happened to you is coming to us 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.070
 and peeks out from the bottom to 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.350
 see what we have under the deck and 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.390
 obviously there will not be anything 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.490
 I miss just having face cards if it's 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.280
 very small will not discover the secret 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:41.390
 it's not going to be suspicious 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.350
 but we can in this case using the 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.760
 jockers as a back of the deck 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.200
 we can extract the deck with much more 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.970
 naturalness we are not going to say a 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.150
 respect because obviously when you 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.920
 are you the deck of how could you 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.570
 deposit and keep talking and there's 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.310
 no problem and when you go to 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:05.410
 execute the game as we said he 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:07.090
 the normal 7 of 37 of spades 97 hours 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.319
 Well, we already know that we have to go 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:14.020
 to look for the 6 of guarantors I opened them 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.380
 days and parties and diamonds and 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.730
 extras the letter that there is of back 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.720
 indicating that all all of these 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.630
 they are face 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.900
 until the joker is not very convenient 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.480
 and do not move the one that runs out and 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.630
 I would draw, as we know, 70 goals 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.400
 yes it 's fine I do not know if I said 707 piles of 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:39.800
 67 epic water is behind that of 6 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.460
 hearts exactly here is worth 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.229
 well then this way it gives us 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.289
 Well, as I said more 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.460
 naturalness obviously always goes 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.160
 to be a letter inside 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.440
 if someone is realized displayed 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.250
 the letter inside because nobody the letter in 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.080
 the deck a problem is that in this 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.910
 game the envelopes were not used that 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.300
 they go inside they do not go out they use good 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:09.860
 Well, you see a back letter 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:12.020
 in joker of two or in pairs I remain 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.020
 of oslo on the odd and when 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.240
 you extract as you arch on one side or 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.620
 arches on the other side is this side is a 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.880
 little bit more difficult because it's not a matter 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.870
 to practice it 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:27.440
 and carry it out and I'll see to see 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.440
 what a way 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.780
 can be done practicing the 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.600
 surely it comes out very naturally 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:41.330
 if he will remove what was at the same time 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.320
 no problem of ex 317 will remain here 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.760
 always stuck on the pretext of 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.979
 have a letter of the serious the 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.110
 retreat you leave it aside and all 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:53.680
 all the cards are face 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.620
 you continue with your natural movement of 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:00.470
 can show the torso as if from the background 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.630
 of the deck will be treated without more than 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.389
 the same thing was completed but suddenly 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.870
 to see a letter in 2 today I said and by 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:09.979
 not 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:12.650
 simple from here idea that as I did not have 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:14.630
 No doubt in capturing it in a video and 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.180
 in sharing it with all of us for 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.340
 that you can get the most out of 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.380
 those who have or wish to have a 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.560
 invisible deck I remind you personal to 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:27.289
 plus one of the cheapest ones they no longer feel 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.600
 what I say one of the cheapest in the 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:30.650
 magic shop my point shifting is many 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.449
 Thank you 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.449
 the resort of it until the next video
