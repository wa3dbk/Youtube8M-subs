sell<00:01:30.479> it

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
sell it

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.140 
sell it
there<00:01:31.259> might<00:01:31.439> be<00:01:31.470> more<00:01:32.159> expensive<00:01:32.400> items<00:01:32.970> out

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
there might be more expensive items out

there<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.630> haven't<00:01:33.840> found<00:01:34.200> any<00:01:34.439> yet<00:01:34.530> so

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
there but I haven't found any yet so

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.270 
there but I haven't found any yet so
definitely<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.450> states<00:01:36.750> at<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.020> end<00:01:37.200> but<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
definitely it states at the end but the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.780 
definitely it states at the end but the
question<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.970> how<00:01:39.420> will<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.750> affect<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
question is how will this affect the

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.010 
question is how will this affect the
blood-borne<00:01:41.790> community<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> blood-borne

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
blood-borne community in the blood-borne

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.149 
blood-borne community in the blood-borne
game<00:01:43.350> thank<00:01:43.979> God<00:01:44.340> we<00:01:44.729> don't<00:01:44.909> have<00:01:45.119> blood<00:01:45.479> echo

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
game thank God we don't have blood echo

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.940 
game thank God we don't have blood echo
memory<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.579> game<00:01:47.820> which<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.270> similar<00:01:48.630> to

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
memory in this game which is similar to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.819 
memory in this game which is similar to
soul<00:01:49.950> memory<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.360> previous<00:01:51.750> games<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.649> we

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
soul memory in the previous games so we

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.580 
soul memory in the previous games so we
won't<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.280> deal<00:01:53.460> with<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.439> all

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
won't have to deal with the have all

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.800 
won't have to deal with the have all
monsters<00:01:55.950> or<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> max<00:01:56.969> level<00:01:57.240> characters

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
monsters or the max level characters

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.030 
monsters or the max level characters
even<00:01:57.990> though<00:01:58.110> you're<00:01:58.380> not<00:01:58.500> max<00:01:58.799> level

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
even though you're not max level

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.660 
even though you're not max level
everything<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.240> level<00:02:00.689> based<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:02.219> won't

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
everything is level based so it won't

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.240 
everything is level based so it won't
really<00:02:03.180> affected<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.049> much<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.829> only<00:02:05.040> thing

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
really affected that much the only thing

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.700 
really affected that much the only thing
is<00:02:05.430> you're<00:02:05.640> gonna<00:02:05.700> have<00:02:05.909> people<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.710> might

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
is you're gonna have people that might

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.249 
is you're gonna have people that might
be<00:02:07.890> new<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.520> series<00:02:08.819> that'll<00:02:09.810> use<00:02:10.050> this

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
be new to the series that'll use this

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.589 
be new to the series that'll use this
cheat<00:02:10.679> to

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
cheat to

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.869 
cheat to
go<00:02:12.379> through<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.680> game<00:02:12.890> extremely<00:02:13.580> quickly

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
go through the game extremely quickly

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.089 
go through the game extremely quickly
and<00:02:14.540> then<00:02:14.780> they<00:02:14.900> probably<00:02:15.170> will<00:02:15.500> be<00:02:15.680> bored

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
and then they probably will be bored

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.039 
and then they probably will be bored
with<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.430> before<00:02:16.970> they<00:02:17.090> even<00:02:17.239> get<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.540> chance<00:02:17.629> to

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
with it before they even get a chance to

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.199 
with it before they even get a chance to
pvp<00:02:18.860> or<00:02:18.890> really<00:02:19.489> become<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:19.819> part<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.120> the

things like that so there can be some

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.860 
things like that so there can be some
good<00:03:00.470> hand<00:03:00.769> from<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.099> but<00:03:01.280> I'd<00:03:02.030> rather<00:03:02.239> this
