inspection of both figures in my
possession<00:00:35.550> I've<00:00:36.330> noticed<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.900> there's

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
possession I've noticed that there's

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.700

more<00:00:38.130> than<00:00:38.370> more<00:00:38.940> differences<00:00:39.600> than<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.230> in

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
more than more differences than that in

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.960 
more than more differences than that in
these<00:00:41.340> two<00:00:41.670> figures<00:00:42.530> so<00:00:43.550> first<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
these two figures so first we have the

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:53.140 
these two figures so first we have the
heads<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:51.300> eyes<00:00:51.540> on<00:00:51.990> this<00:00:52.230> guy<00:00:52.560> or<00:00:52.800> bigger

then I mean the black part on this guy

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.480 
then I mean the black part on this guy
is<00:00:56.970> bigger<00:00:57.450> than<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.720> black<00:00:57.930> part<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.440> him<00:00:58.740> if

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
is bigger than the black part on him if

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.810 
is bigger than the black part on him if
you<00:01:00.030> look<00:01:00.300> at<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.010> X<00:01:02.010> forces<00:01:04.339> Deadpool<00:01:05.339> he<00:01:05.640> has

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
different if you turn to figure around

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.490 
different if you turn to figure around
and<00:01:53.380> you<00:01:53.890> look<00:01:54.130> at<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.460> but<00:01:55.140> there's<00:01:56.140> like

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
and you look at the but there's like

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:04.050

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:18.570 
none on this guy then let's take a look
at<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.119> arms<00:02:10.600> as<00:02:11.880> you<00:02:12.880> can<00:02:13.120> see<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.920> rest<00:02:18.280> are

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
at the arms as you can see the rest are

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.800 
at the arms as you can see the rest are
different<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:21.280> can<00:02:21.520> take<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:21.790> better<00:02:22.690> look

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
different and you can take a better look

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.300 
different and you can take a better look
at<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:24.360> shoulders<00:02:25.360> too<00:02:25.920> it's<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.070> same

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
at the shoulders too it's the same

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.770 
at the shoulders too it's the same
design<00:02:27.760> but<00:02:27.790> it's<00:02:28.570> not<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.959> same<00:02:29.200> figure<00:02:30.780> then

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
design but it's not the same figure then

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.250 
design but it's not the same figure then
we<00:02:31.959> got<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.380> leg<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:34.300> can<00:02:34.450> see<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:37.260> then

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
we got the leg you can see and then

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.960 
we got the leg you can see and then
there's<00:02:38.530> this<00:02:38.800> pattern<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.680> leg<00:02:41.920> here<00:02:42.340> is

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
there's this pattern the leg here is

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.900 
there's this pattern the leg here is
pointy<00:02:43.750> an<00:02:44.080> x-force<00:02:44.770> that<00:02:45.130> pool<00:02:45.459> but<00:02:45.700> it's

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
pointy an x-force that pool but it's

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.800 
pointy an x-force that pool but it's
square<00:02:46.360> on<00:02:46.800> comic<00:02:47.800> pack<00:02:48.040> Deadpool<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:49.480> get

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
square on comic pack Deadpool you get

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:57.289 
square on comic pack Deadpool you get
the<00:02:50.020> legs<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.120> feet<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:55.830> this<00:02:56.830> is<00:02:56.860> a

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
the legs and the feet so this is a

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.340 
the legs and the feet so this is a
entirely<00:02:58.299> brand<00:02:58.660> new<00:02:58.959> figure<00:02:59.580> and<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:01.840> I'm

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
entirely brand new figure and this I'm

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.160 
entirely brand new figure and this I'm
guessing<00:03:03.190> is<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.370> straight<00:03:03.880> repaint<00:03:04.540> from<00:03:04.989> the

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
guessing is a straight repaint from the

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.930 
guessing is a straight repaint from the
Wolverine<00:03:05.620> Origins<00:03:06.250> figure

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.710 

the<00:03:10.510> harnesses<00:03:11.170> are<00:03:11.350> different<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.190> are<00:03:12.880> the

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
the harnesses are different and are the

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.260 
the harnesses are different and are the
belts<00:03:16.110> but<00:03:17.110> that's<00:03:17.500> um<00:03:17.940> because<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:19.150> the

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
belts but that's um because of the

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.220 
belts but that's um because of the
design<00:03:19.480> that's<00:03:20.290> obvious<00:03:21.150> all<00:03:22.150> right<00:03:22.330> so<00:03:23.140> if

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
design that's obvious all right so if

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.590 
design that's obvious all right so if
you're<00:03:23.440> a<00:03:23.470> Deadpool<00:03:24.100> lover<00:03:24.460> like<00:03:25.030> I'm<00:03:25.330> turning

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
you're a Deadpool lover like I'm turning

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.980 
you're a Deadpool lover like I'm turning
