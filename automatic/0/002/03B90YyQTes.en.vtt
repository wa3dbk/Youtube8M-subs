over here I've installed some terminal

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.459 
over here I've installed some terminal
blocks<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.239> we<00:01:00.390> can<00:01:00.660> hook<00:01:00.899> up<00:01:01.079> things

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
blocks so that we can hook up things

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.100 
blocks so that we can hook up things
such<00:01:01.890> as<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.309> instrumentation<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.080> e

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
an insta hot for heat as you can see

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.910 
an insta hot for heat as you can see
here<00:01:17.909> we've<00:01:18.060> fabricated<00:01:18.299> some<00:01:19.080> some<00:01:19.799> special

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
here we've fabricated some some special

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.960 
here we've fabricated some some special
brackets<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.030> 500<00:01:21.720> amp<00:01:21.900> fuse<00:01:22.759> this<00:01:23.759> is

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
brackets for the 500 amp fuse this is

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.569 
brackets for the 500 amp fuse this is
the<00:01:24.180> evision<00:01:24.830> system<00:01:26.240> which<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.810> basically

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
the evision system which is basically

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.940 
the evision system which is basically
instrumentation<00:01:29.579> for<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.530> state<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.650> charge

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
instrumentation for the state of charge

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.819 
instrumentation for the state of charge
as<00:01:32.460> well<00:01:33.090> as<00:01:33.150> many<00:01:33.570> other<00:01:33.780> things<00:01:33.900> voltage<00:01:34.560> etc

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
as well as many other things voltage etc

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.060 
as well as many other things voltage etc
and<00:01:35.460> then<00:01:36.450> over<00:01:36.630> here<00:01:36.659> we've<00:01:36.930> fabricated<00:01:37.560> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and then over here we've fabricated a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.730 
and then over here we've fabricated a
bracket<00:01:38.490> from<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.759> throttle<00:01:39.079> we've<00:01:40.079> also<00:01:40.290> got

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
bracket from the throttle we've also got

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.490 
bracket from the throttle we've also got
a<00:01:40.950> power<00:01:41.820> assisted<00:01:42.570> brakes<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.920> car<00:01:44.220> and

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
a power assisted brakes on this car and

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.399 
a power assisted brakes on this car and
there's<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.680> compressor<00:01:47.490> right<00:01:47.610> there<00:01:48.409> we'd

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
there's the compressor right there we'd

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.830 
there's the compressor right there we'd
like<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.710> thank<00:01:50.030> superior<00:01:51.030> performance<00:01:51.630> for

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
like to thank superior performance for

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.870 
like to thank superior performance for
helping<00:01:52.170> us<00:01:52.350> they<00:01:52.890> did<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.189> bodywork<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
helping us they did the bodywork and the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.350 
helping us they did the bodywork and the
paintwork<00:01:54.799> which<00:01:55.799> has<00:01:56.040> really<00:01:56.250> turned<00:01:56.969> into<00:01:57.180> a

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
paintwork which has really turned into a

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.690 
paintwork which has really turned into a
pretty<00:01:57.570> nice<00:01:57.840> car

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.520 

this<00:02:02.600> is<00:02:02.719> a<00:02:02.750> Porsche<00:02:03.110> 944<00:02:04.659> 1984<00:02:05.659> model<00:02:08.530> go

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
this is a Porsche 944 1984 model go

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.130 
this is a Porsche 944 1984 model go
ahead<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:09.830> lower<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.250> hood<00:02:10.399> down<00:02:10.670> on<00:02:10.910> it<00:02:11.140> so

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
ahead and lower the hood down on it so

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.820 
ahead and lower the hood down on it so
you<00:02:12.200> can<00:02:12.260> get<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.530> good<00:02:12.680> look<00:02:12.739> at<00:02:13.069> it<00:02:17.709> these<00:02:18.709> are

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
you can get a good look at it these are

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.500 
you can get a good look at it these are
not<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.190> stock<00:02:19.459> headlights<00:02:19.970> these<00:02:20.300> are<00:02:20.420> an

conveniences<00:03:11.000> what<00:03:11.989> I<00:03:12.019> like<00:03:12.260> about<00:03:12.440> this<00:03:12.829> is

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
conveniences what I like about this is

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.000 
conveniences what I like about this is
that<00:03:13.700> it's<00:03:13.880> easily<00:03:14.480> covered<00:03:15.079> up<00:03:15.200> with<00:03:15.889> this

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
that it's easily covered up with this

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.570 
that it's easily covered up with this
covered

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.390 

so<00:03:19.580> as<00:03:19.700> you<00:03:19.849> can<00:03:20.000> see<00:03:20.060> it's<00:03:20.450> about<00:03:21.200> 450<00:03:22.069> pounds

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
so as you can see it's about 450 pounds

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.000 
so as you can see it's about 450 pounds

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.980 
for a ride and show you how it performs
okay<00:05:02.710> okay<00:05:03.370> we're<00:05:03.640> backing<00:05:04.120> up<00:05:04.270> the<00:05:04.419> car<00:05:04.660> and

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
okay okay we're backing up the car and

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.600 
okay okay we're backing up the car and
as<00:05:05.290> you<00:05:05.410> can<00:05:05.560> see<00:05:05.620> it<00:05:05.919> backs<00:05:06.130> up<00:05:06.340> nice<00:05:06.580> and

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
as you can see it backs up nice and

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.210 
as you can see it backs up nice and
smooth<00:05:07.710> we<00:05:08.710> don't<00:05:08.919> back<00:05:09.490> up<00:05:09.520> fast<00:05:10.060> we<00:05:10.360> have<00:05:10.540> the

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
smooth we don't back up fast we have the

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.300 
smooth we don't back up fast we have the
the<00:05:12.220> sulla<00:05:12.640> Tron<00:05:12.940> controller<00:05:13.570> actually

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
the sulla Tron controller actually

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.460 
the sulla Tron controller actually
limits<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.750> voltage<00:05:16.750> to<00:05:16.930> the<00:05:17.020> motor<00:05:17.050> when

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
limits the voltage to the motor when

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.650 
limits the voltage to the motor when
you're<00:05:17.650> in<00:05:17.740> Reverse<00:05:18.120> so<00:05:19.120> now<00:05:19.270> we're<00:05:19.419> doing<00:05:19.540> a

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
you're in Reverse so now we're doing a

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.140 
you're in Reverse so now we're doing a
second<00:05:20.050> gears<00:05:20.230> to<00:05:20.350> take<00:05:20.530> up<00:05:20.770> and<00:05:21.040> we're<00:05:21.970> going

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
second gears to take up and we're going

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.940 
second gears to take up and we're going
real<00:05:22.510> slow<00:05:22.690> and<00:05:22.840> kind<00:05:23.260> of<00:05:23.350> the<00:05:23.410> season<00:05:23.590> on<00:05:23.830> the
