00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.349
 121 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.480
 that's all I remember later 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.430
 because it will leave in supply Bessie 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.620
 multiplied it was chronic which one 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.140
 fate but how could they have kept 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.260
 everyone has their own destiny there is an island 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.690
 the one who was on the defensive afterwards 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.030
 the Germans drove up a cup of smoke there 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.699
 throw the bum and would not have been invented 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.979
 the soldiers went out they were shot by witnesses 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.159
 say how 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.300
 the clip has become 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.270
 cleaned up the third surrendered why 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:18.320
 it was such a tragedy that still 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:24.200
 pore not studied when historians 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:27.320
 begin here is how you have paper i'm here 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.300
 always want orchestra associate with this 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.320
 field then let's get there there 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.440
 several musicians 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.300
 on trombone the rest to god because 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.910
 when begin he enlisted was 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.820
 Betrayal was from songs that was 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:45.410
 that ta pulled out of context was bschu and 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:48.560
 heroism and treachery and panic and everything 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.840
 because it played its role and 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.720
 especially in the initial period of the war this 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.090
 sad because it took so long was 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.090
 because victory is so dear to us and we 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:12.340
 God forbid 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:16.930
 if we gave it there, let's try 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:24.129
 to play here, too, because 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:28.360
 ask for another built epaulettes 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:30.160
 possible in a different way I was the marshal of all 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.069
 pierre they wouldn't occupy 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:41.709
 votes and the choice I put under two 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:45.010
 roads were two and three months old 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:50.590
 not reached because styles nevertheless 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:55.060
 we sat down and then the strategy today is lazy 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:59.860
 not himself does not know how to sleep what to do 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.920
 creepy to say began to make history she 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.440
 this does not tolerate the subjunctive 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.019
 direction as it is, so we say 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.290
 draw conclusions and good from this story 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.160
 will not affect what we say for 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.150
 youth we are engaged in the essence 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.220
 military patriotic education but she 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.990
 must be correct and because you 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.720
 see how not half cool 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.810
 they are holidays when we are completely different 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.600
 direction is turned where it is suddenly 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.690
 exactly how russia would say and do 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:37.970
 we said that they are here 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.920
 all stupid though true hero 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.590
 not much 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.600
 I participate especially in recent years now 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.870

 President of yours and goes that is started 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.670
 a little bit where there relate more 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:04:05.710

 what came out there you will find well let's go there 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.640
 then who did not go 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:24.090
 hands will not have started this 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.960
 relax 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.790
 handed out a genre 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:57.720
 risk here yes you can buy a periscope 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.910
 right pen is configured 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.490
 if you want up or down the path to the right 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:18.830
 pen and this is a gasoline generator dota 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:18.830
 I was a fatherland extension 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.750
