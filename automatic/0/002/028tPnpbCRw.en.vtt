 now I just leave the highlight sinister 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.210
 high points because it would be a bit long 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.890
 if I practice two million Africans 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.490
 so that probably won't live 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.859

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.190
 rest is not very expensive and expensive 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.989

 Profit from market film arose as 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.689
 personal pride 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.610
 your big keeley was that 4th branch problem 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.920

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.630
 She lives that carnival for 4 days and me 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.680

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.909

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.729
 conversation that success i look how to 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.770
 scarface get that really so 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.790
 spectacularly beautiful look of course 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.729
 to success 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.320
 Monday I go a buggy PC and Tuesday 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.460
 of course it finally comes again 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.049
 deliver the world around in 80 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.329
 We have asked a lot about these countries 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.740
 then it can be a good turn again 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.390
 once African time, of course 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.220
 because of team over tournament 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.780
 and then we go see what where it 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.670
 ship beach if all goes well it is us 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.200
 a relationship and then it goes with it 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.719
 ship or the whole world met ground 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.490
 a whole bunch of teams do this 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.049
 does that strawpoll done and the whole 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.230
 many people already told us 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.140
 really very much 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.540
 around 38 42% that I only have the typhus 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.190
 do with completely red players and 100 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.850
 otherwise it would crash it to us 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.710
 look 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.630
 I now go the rest of the quick release 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.640
 same as me and coriander 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.720
 yesterday how they work on a Friday 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.880
 psv must play 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.100
 so the first match I think 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.990
 a whole year more about psv 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.670
 so i really got stranded in that 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.690
 though maybe nothing happens so 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.340
 then I miss nothing 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.900
 donate as one of the two games 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.070
 season I saw it later at 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.140
 folk sport 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.090
 2 4g I should perhaps have heard 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.500
 get like playing through too but 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.970
 yes then I can myself I also understand you 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.220
 of course it's a delicious one 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.380
 contest and of course that ajax 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.450
 against FC Twente also a nice shape that 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.240
 no me away dude and noise 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.390
 so he is two players from the Catholic 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.680
 nothing that we scroll marc-marie 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.880
 dirty of course because of their own bib shorts 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.320
 that always do the links in the 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.210
 description states coins that are one 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.860
 reasonably cheap those prices that will 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.900
 be ready to 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.700
 and I watch mycom there in the meantime 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.350
 packages will still be quite subtle 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.530
 comes to optimum decorating and that is 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.630
 June or July is not mistaken 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.700
 and fall board both and structures but up 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.740
 so far they won't stay cool 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.050
 around a very polite per vodka such as the 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.959
 very good when you get it here 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.150
 Nokia is not that very good looks 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.160
 to give him my shirt number 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.810
 I already got a few levels yesterday 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.750
 I have a number on what package 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.330
 I do and see how it will bring and me 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.130
 had and differences and in formulas and tom 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.250
 shilling for 50 lot of course whole 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.800
 very nice but running branch of 12 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.690
 I can hardly speak a candle 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.000
 ryan babel greeting smear that guy that 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.440
 I really enjoyed my lips and 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.239
 then ticks went in the wrong direction 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.920
 when my fun is my brother 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.830
 Wrong you got a tweet from Ryan 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.330
 including and and how it is already 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.000
 unnatural building on crazy or that 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.620
 filler 0 yes when I was very sweet again 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.300
 it if I have a nice response to ourselves 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.190
 sometimes tomorrow at one 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.410
 farmer peeping people to the skates 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.239
 to sample among the from 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.470
 Ryan Babylon 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.270
 I have a few packets of smoke and 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.080
 fire also cannot be made yet 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.330
 about four or 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.160
 have to remember you from seeing to you 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.960
 don't ask when this fact that one 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.490
 risk the video jump on having that 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.860
 prefer that it stays silent 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.840
 I also asked a yes or something behind you 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.459
 it was a bit divided but now see 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.320
 I that much youtuber in the Netherlands that 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.180
 does a lot with music 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.350
 so that implementation thereof have something at home 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.570
 I then only the voice of the 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.130
 commentator why find some anyway 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.510
 also fine than benefit 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.010
 so if you like it leave him and 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.410
 reactions or of course and go second 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.420
 do especially thumbs down 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.270
 How do you open a few more packets 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.620
 two or three in the group then join me and 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.390
 you see tricks like I like says 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.650
 the two means I do not sometime this 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.750

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.950
 so we get messi on the front 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.560
 Messi are you going to bring us luck and the 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.190
 best player in teams that are very good if 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.560
