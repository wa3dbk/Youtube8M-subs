00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.130
 Hey folks 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.870
 class today is about protozoa 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.240
 as well as algae they are part of the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.070
 kingdom protoc ti six but in this class 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.439
 we will see the characteristics of the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.619
 protozoa its physiology and its 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.109
 Let's start with the classification 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.960
 characteristics and using for mexico 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.060
 as an example when the cells have 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.840
 one and only 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.940
 then the whole protozoan is unicellular 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.370
 note this structure is the core 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.059
 delimited by membrane or envelope 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.980
 nuclear 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.280
 then the whole protozoan is a cell 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.379
 eukaryotes like every cell I fell where 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.629
 have the other member bodies of our 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.129
 endoplasmic reticulum 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:57.680
 endoplasmic golgi complex enjoyment 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:01:01.680
 mitochondria lysosomes peroxy we are 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.629
 ribosomes and those between luther 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.479
 mitochondria therefore perform 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.939
 cellular respiration but as seen not 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.700
 have chloroplast so do not 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.430
 Photosynthesis also do a thousand 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.560
 synthesis, then the whole protozoan is to have the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.390
 trump are the three characteristics of 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.720
 the whole unicellular protozoan 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.700
 eucaryotes and and have another fire although 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.979
 protozoa have all the organelles 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.930
 there represented in the vestibular 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.009
 usually charge only those 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.590
 structures 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.659
 note we have a time here I think 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.220
 controls cellular activities the micro 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.049
 core that is exchanged with another 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.689
 protozoan of the same species 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.060
 in the process of conjugation becomes a 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.750
 that the cell mouth that for example 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.240
 Mexico has the digestive vehicles 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.640
 we will see in the next slides and the agreement 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.979
 contractual system whose function is also 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.950
 we will have in the next slides 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.380
 let's go to physiology now 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.110
 example for amoeba as the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.390
 processes of gas exchange elimination 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.030
 discreet absorption of food and 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.030
 water control the monty kuvango 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.160
 begin with gaseous protozoan exchanges 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.300
 need oxygen to perform the 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.800
 right cellular respiration 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.140
 oxygen in the environment than in 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.180
 protozoan then the green oxygen where 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.600
 have more product have less and enter by 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.730
 diffusion the cellular respiration produces gas 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.920
 which is concentrated within the 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:32.020
 protozoan and carbon dioxide also exits 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.200
 by diffusion ok excretion whole cell 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.180
 produces through its metabolism 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.940
 toxic substances called discrete 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.430
 which are concentrated within the cell 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:48.400
 and therefore only impose diffusion also ok 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.870
 this amoeba will ingest that 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.610
 for merci on top now 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.580
 for it they move through the 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.470
 psiu dollars involves the payment or 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.690
 internalizing a visit called 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.640
 homo fires and lysosomes release 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.320
 digestive enzymes in the forum somo that 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.090
 it is called the objective vacuum 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.160
 because digestion occurs then the 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.200
 nutrition is done please become if the 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.810
 food for solid hypnosis tozzi your 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.840
 food for liquid watches this video 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:18.520
 now here we have a goal already spoken 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.230
 citing two paramÃ©cios it involves them 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.020
 with the pseudonym it says 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.120
 the inmates in the fires are the 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:29.580
 lysosomes release digestive enzymes and 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.580
 it will happen digestion pay attention 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.370
 realize now that you can not see the 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.300
 two individualized paramedics to 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.300
 digestion is happening 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:56.150
 Okay, well, what was not digested is 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.870
 deleted by klaus mann if tozzi that one 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.110
 the process of epis osce tozzi and finally 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.050
 the osmotic control the cytoplasm of 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.150
 contains cells and homs molecules 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.250
 electrically charged and also 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.980
 polar molecules therefore has certain 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.410
 tonicity for water protozoa 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.739
 the medium is hypotonic in relation to 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.350
 its cytoplasm then water present in the 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.260
 through osmosis and the tendency of 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.940
 cell and tea until analysis happens as 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.460
 animal cells 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.500
 however much of this water enters 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.479
 in the vacuums pulsated as they fill up 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.000
 when the center bag is full 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.400
 vacuum contracts and expels water by 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.340
 to the middle then control and robotics 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.430
 made by vacuum the site or contract 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:47.740
 watch this video now I'll put the 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:52.850
 satio here in the middle it fills up 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:55.210
 otherwise noticed it fills up again and goes 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:05:00.710
 re-contracting this pulsatile vacuum 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:04.220
 functioning and lastly the classification 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.470
 the criterion here is the presence and type of 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.539
 structure of the locomotive 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.789
 classification which is still levied on 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.560
 in the academic environment. 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.060
 rating no longer exists 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.729
 according to this classification the 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.030
 protozoa are classified into four 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.280
 classes 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.310
 the risotto says a dynamic bag that 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:27.020
 locomove through pseudo people tells who 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:29.180
 is this then that amoeba very well that there is 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.580
 a radio station they have these 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.600
 carapace of limestone or silica and form 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.310
 these rays 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.789
 the pseudo opponents through 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:42.620
 openings in the shell ok 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:45.020
 This is an outside minister who also 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.310
 has shell are evidence of 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.720
 existence of oil when 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.970
 found fossils of them in the soil 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:56.000
 the class of the flagellates one chewed 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.430
 holes move by scourge 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.460
 there is a trypanosome that causes the 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:05.330
 Chagas disease 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:08.240
 here is the day that causes giardiasis and 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:12.230
 here is a monkey knitting 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:15.890
 trichomoniasis one dst affiliates or 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:20.090
 cioffi locomove through eyelashes we have 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:22.850
 here one for mercio very well and here one 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:26.060
 balance sheet of a cause of balance day 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:29.630
 and and finally exposing users who 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:32.990
 do not have locomotive structures we have 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.730
 here is the malaria-causing plasmid and 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:39.110
 here the toxoplasma that causes 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:41.570
 toxoplasmosis guys for now is this 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.890
 watch also a class of protozoa 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.890
 hug and see you around
