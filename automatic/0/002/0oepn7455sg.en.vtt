00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
which is a bit shite but I don't think

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.599 
which is a bit shite but I don't think
this<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.739> going<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.010> be<00:00:59.100> an<00:00:59.190> easy<00:00:59.340> mob

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
this is going to be an easy mob

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.270 
this is going to be an easy mob
whatsoever<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.449> kill<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:01.559> seems<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.980> just<00:01:02.129> like

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
whatsoever to kill it seems to just like

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.490 
whatsoever to kill it seems to just like
regenerate<00:01:02.910> health<00:01:03.199> so<00:01:04.199> there's<00:01:04.290> obviously

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
regenerate health so there's obviously

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.109 
regenerate health so there's obviously
gonna<00:01:05.010> be<00:01:05.159> something<00:01:05.580> where<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:05.939> after

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
gonna be something where you can after

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.969 
gonna be something where you can after
so<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.930> doesn't<00:01:07.200> regenerate<00:01:07.500> health<00:01:07.830> which

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
so it doesn't regenerate health which

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.410 
so it doesn't regenerate health which
it's<00:01:08.130> gonna<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.400> pretty<00:01:08.670> difficult<00:01:08.820> thing<00:01:09.180> I'd

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
it's gonna be pretty difficult thing I'd

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.670 
it's gonna be pretty difficult thing I'd
imagine<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:09.930> something<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.500> with<00:01:10.590> the
