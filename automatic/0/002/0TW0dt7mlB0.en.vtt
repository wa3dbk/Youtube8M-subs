00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:22.550
 one of my favorites and the bate one 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.500
 luscious chocolate shell with 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.099
 the soft coconut inside so let's see 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.270
 to recreate it in hair format 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.000
 let's start with the preliminary actions then 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.280
 we line a mafia tent with ours 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.170
 the inevitable paper cups la 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.620
 let's set aside and preheat the 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.440
 oven at 180 degrees apart combine in 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.990
 a bowl 350 g of half flour 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.720
 teaspoon of table salt up and a 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.340
 whole spoon of baking powder or 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.480
 we mix like a metal whisk 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.440
 it is missing this way 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.460
 let's all mix well with you 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.200
 and sandy nice I was a while 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.070
 unfortunate coin rolled up supermarket 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.730
 coconut milk 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.980
 therefore I take 250 ml of milk 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.089
 whole if you find it from coconut be a tree 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.820
 unfortunately I did not have it done 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.100
 bad sewer or drink supermarket among all 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.049
 how many said it was too summer but 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.079
 we will bring the summer anyway in which 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:18.530
 dinner a tablespoon of natural extract 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.119
 of coconut if you find it or is now tech 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.369
 I would have bought a supermarket if not 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.280
 coconut streets, perhaps the body with rum 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.200
 the coconut pencil the preparations for i 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.969
 sweets so I also prepared for the 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.439
 coconut based cocktail anyway 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:33.040
 the alcohol that is then cooked and empty 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.600
 only the taste remains 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.960
 in the bowl of our mixer 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.370
 we combine 135 grams of butter 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.200
 strictly at temperatures went to 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:48.160
 medium high speed less when you are 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:50.950
 becoming in the bowl of our mix 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:56.260
 we combine 135 grams of butter a 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:58.870
 room temperature and we go into the 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.700
 bowl of our mixer we combine 135 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.440
 grams of butter strictly a 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.660
 room temperature and we do it 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.070
 cremate for about 2 or 3 minutes a 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.720
 average high speed until you are 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.720
 become soft and fluffy 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.330
 once the board has added a 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.520
 frothy appearance so very soft 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.620
 add 280 grams of sugar 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.540
 white very slowly then a 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.959
 spoon times so the pasta will come more 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.959
 soft 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.130
 once the sugar is butter 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.110
 perfectly cremated we are ready for 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.630
 add the eggs one at a time 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.720
 there are three we add the eggs one to the 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.720
 time 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.510
 at this point we reduce to the person 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.610
 of the mixer lowers the best possible 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.160
 that we have and we alternate the compound 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.770
 dry flour with milk mixture 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.930
 and coconut abstract in three parts and two 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.030
 parts always begin and end with 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.410
 the flour then we start with a first 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.410
 third of silver of flour 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.710
 add a little at a time to this 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.790
 so we don't work the dough too much 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:26.500
 just the flour if in that 40 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.180
 add half of the milk mixture and 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.100
 just the milk immediately incorporated 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.910
 let's add another third of ours 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:37.510
 they would end our blend 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:41.620
 liquid by adding the last half of the 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.540
 art grock milk as soon as this is you 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.750
 combined we end with ours 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.780
 flour and finally 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.880
 add 40 grams of coconut flour 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.490
 here of our classic coconut flakes 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.040
 that will give that feeling a bit like 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.530
 of the pampering motions bounty is exactly 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.660
 what we want to achieve 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:05.110
 let's not mix it up, let's give it one last 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.350
 scraped to our bowl and we are 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.150
 ready for the outside now helping us with 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.120
 a classic for tajani production 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.530
 I think 30 years give it to me 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.090
 remember the total months because we liked it 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.620
 the ball so I'm in 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.320
 gives sickness 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.820
 amarcord using the classic beta 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.370
 ice cream maker po two tablespoons if desired 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.740
 we collect a ball from the dough and the 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.740
 we pour inside Isasco private 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.820
 we bake our pan in the oven 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.860
 preheated to 180 degrees for about 18 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.420
 bar at twenty minutes is clearly worth the 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.400
 so let's see you then, toothpick 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:50.380
 all then twenty minutes have passed to the 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.680
 our coconut cupcakes are beautiful 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.380
 beautiful white shining any 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.480
 say let them rest for about 10 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.530
 minutes in their grill and then there 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.760
 extract and leave to cool 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.070
 completely 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.080
 in the meantime we prepare a recipe of 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.760
 frosting to the Philadelphia and if you want 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.890
 see how to get ready click 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.010
 exactly below and I'll show you 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.210
 how to get ready soon 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.220
 repaired our frosting a 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.470
 philadelphia we add the classic 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.940
 with vanilla we add one thing in 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.280
 plus the one that will give a kind of taste 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.090
 even a little more happened passes through the 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.210
 term 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:29.590
 add two tablespoons of flour 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:34.180
 of coconut in this way we will succeed 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:36.790
 really biting cupcake to bite 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.430
 also feel the taste of coconut but not 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.730
 only the taste but also the serious is 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.800
 what we are looking for once 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.060
 cool cupcake and transfer everything 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.550
 how much is frosting inside one 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.800
 equipped woods bag I prefer this 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.560
 once a round open tip this is 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.140
 a number eighty eight for the 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.980
 accuracy then keeping it still 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:02.980
 perpendicular to the center of the cup cake the 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:05.170
 massa couples we're going to do so many 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.500
 small concentric cylinders we see 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.500
 how you do it 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.630
 I melted some chocolate a 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.669
 Bain-marie so this is all 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.360
 how beautiful liquid is to create 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:25.440
 that typical effect of the bounty we will go 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.449
 clearly being very careful is 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.270
 been on a plate to cover the whole 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:32.190
 how much the coconut frosting part is 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.759
 philadelphia with our chocolate 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.759
 let's see how
