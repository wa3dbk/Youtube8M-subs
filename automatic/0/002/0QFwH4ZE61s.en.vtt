these stronger strikers which runner him

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.980 
these stronger strikers which runner him
well<00:01:40.619> 79<00:01:41.040> passing<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.850> he<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.390> whip<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.780> them

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
well 79 passing so he can whip in them

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.139 
well 79 passing so he can whip in them
crosses<00:01:43.500> when<00:01:43.680> he<00:01:43.770> does<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.310> runs<00:01:44.759> just

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
crosses when he does the runs just

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.120 
crosses when he does the runs just
bombing<00:01:45.390> forward<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.380> he's<00:01:46.500> got<00:01:46.680> 78

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
bombing forward and he's got 78

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.670 
bombing forward and he's got 78
dribbling<00:01:47.700> which<00:01:47.909> was<00:01:48.060> also<00:01:48.240> pretty<00:01:48.750> good

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
dribbling which was also pretty good

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.510 
dribbling which was also pretty good
getting<00:01:50.310> around<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:51.530> left-sided<00:01:52.530> or<00:01:53.280> the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
getting around the left-sided or the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.940 
getting around the left-sided or the
left<00:01:53.700> back<00:01:53.880> he's<00:01:54.780> got<00:01:54.990> three<00:01:55.259> saw<00:01:55.439> skill<00:01:55.710> moves

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
left back he's got three saw skill moves

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.560 
left back he's got three saw skill moves
which<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.460> mean<00:01:56.729> for<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> fullback<00:01:57.329> class

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
which I mean for a fullback class

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.910 
which I mean for a fullback class
predicated<00:01:58.049> completely<00:01:58.350> roulette<00:01:58.680> when<00:01:58.829> he

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
predicated completely roulette when he

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.560 
predicated completely roulette when he
is<00:01:59.070> running<00:01:59.280> down<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> wing<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.000> he<00:02:00.030> does

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
is running down the wing and he does

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.990 
is running down the wing and he does
have<00:02:00.719> high<00:02:00.960> high<00:02:01.170> work-rate<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:02.040> when<00:02:02.700> he's<00:02:02.820> up

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
have high high work-rate so when he's up

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.639 
have high high work-rate so when he's up
there<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.420> he's<00:02:03.689> crossed<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.020> end<00:02:04.229> he<00:02:04.409> runs

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
there and he's crossed the end he runs

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.429 
there and he's crossed the end he runs
back<00:02:04.740> straightaway<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.520> help<00:02:06.180> defend<00:02:06.540> now<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
back straightaway to help defend now the

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.180 
back straightaway to help defend now the
one<00:02:08.060> reason<00:02:09.060> why<00:02:09.270> he<00:02:09.450> does<00:02:09.629> not<00:02:09.899> get<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.410> 10<00:02:10.950> hour

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
one reason why he does not get a 10 hour

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.000 
one reason why he does not get a 10 hour
of<00:02:11.280> 10<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.870> purely<00:02:12.870> because<00:02:13.170> I'm<00:02:13.560> comparing

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
of 10 is purely because I'm comparing

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.490 
of 10 is purely because I'm comparing
him<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.400> other<00:02:14.730> right<00:02:15.060> backs<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.660> basically

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500
