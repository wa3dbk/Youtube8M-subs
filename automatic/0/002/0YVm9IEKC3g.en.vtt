minecraft tutorial this tutorial will be
on<00:00:11.550> coordinates<00:00:12.500> something<00:00:13.500> that<00:00:13.950> is

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
on coordinates something that is

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.029 
on coordinates something that is
underrated<00:00:15.450> or<00:00:15.660> mostly<00:00:16.350> not<00:00:16.590> even<00:00:16.859> known

about and this is very useful tool so

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.609 
about and this is very useful tool so
let's<00:00:22.439> say<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.890> have<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.460> very<00:00:23.789> nice<00:00:24.060> outhouse

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
let's say I have this very nice outhouse

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.460 
let's say I have this very nice outhouse
that<00:00:25.619> has<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> great<00:00:26.070> view<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.660> want<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.289> build

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
that has a great view so I want to build

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.429 
that has a great view so I want to build
a<00:00:28.769> tunnel<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.580> goes<00:00:29.880> right<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.960> cube

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
a tunnel that goes right to this cube

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.920 
a tunnel that goes right to this cube
right<00:00:31.740> here<00:00:32.009> right<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> square<00:00:32.930> but

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
right here right to the square but

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.680 
right here right to the square but
instead<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.500> counting<00:00:35.010> like<00:00:35.370> each<00:00:35.790> individual

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
instead of counting like each individual

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.020 
instead of counting like each individual
block<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.820> go<00:00:38.940> ahead

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
block and going like this and go ahead

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.420 
block and going like this and go ahead
and<00:00:39.180> Counting<00:00:39.930> them<00:00:40.110> because<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.040> takes<00:00:41.250> a

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
and Counting them because that takes a

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.030 
and Counting them because that takes a
lot<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.700> work<00:00:41.879> going<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.540> your<00:00:42.690> house<00:00:42.930> which<00:00:43.770> my

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
house is right here you can use

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.639 
house is right here you can use
coordinates<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.750> coordinates<00:00:49.379> are<00:00:49.500> very

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
coordinates and coordinates are very

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.330 
coordinates and coordinates are very
useful<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:51.180> all<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.320> do<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:53.100> go

and press f3 and f3 will show the
coordinates<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.539> upper<00:01:04.019> left-hand

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
coordinates on the upper left-hand

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.800 
coordinates on the upper left-hand
corner<00:01:04.559> upper<00:01:05.309> left<00:01:05.519> 10<00:01:05.850> corner<00:01:06.240> right<00:01:06.540> okay

good
it'll<00:01:08.460> show<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.900> XY<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.200> Z<00:01:10.439> what<00:01:10.619> we're<00:01:10.770> gonna

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
it'll show you XY and Z what we're gonna

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.620 
it'll show you XY and Z what we're gonna
be<00:01:11.070> looking<00:01:11.340> at<00:01:11.400> today<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:12.170> only<00:01:13.170> X<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.920> Z<00:01:14.630> so

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
be looking at today is only X and Z so

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.910 
be looking at today is only X and Z so
for<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:17.100> mean<00:01:17.280> 57<00:01:18.119> I'm<00:01:18.270> writing<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.659> down

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
for this I mean 57 I'm writing it down

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.039 
for this I mean 57 I'm writing it down
for<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.939> shows<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.330> where<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.630> are<00:01:21.659> in

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
for this this shows you where you are in

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.350 
for this this shows you where you are in
space<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.970> write<00:01:24.150> these<00:01:24.299> down

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
space so you have to write these down

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.990 
space so you have to write these down
and<00:01:25.220> then<00:01:26.220> go<00:01:26.400> back<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.700> your<00:01:26.880> home<00:01:27.740> so<00:01:29.000> mine

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and then go back to your home so mine

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.660 
and then go back to your home so mine
were<00:01:31.280> 536<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.520> negative<00:01:33.210> 57<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:35.130> go<00:01:35.430> back<00:01:35.549> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
were 536 and negative 57 so go back to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.039 
were 536 and negative 57 so go back to
your<00:01:35.759> house<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.600> want<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.810> build<00:01:36.930> a

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
your house and you want to build a

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.469 
your house and you want to build a
tunnel<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.439> goes<00:01:37.500> right<00:01:37.860> towards<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.490> so

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
tunnel that goes right towards that so

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.639 
tunnel that goes right towards that so
first<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.619> want<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.950> get<00:01:41.990> 536<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.320> want<00:01:43.590> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
first you want to get 536 so I want to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.480 
first you want to get 536 so I want to
go<00:01:43.829> up<00:01:44.250> from<00:01:44.909> 516<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.930> 536<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.250> want<00:01:47.399> to

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
go up from 516 to 536 so I just want to

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:59.950 
go up from 516 to 536 so I just want to
go<00:01:47.610> up<00:01:47.790> from<00:01:47.939> there<00:01:48.119> okay

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.929 

so<00:02:00.960> now<00:02:01.110> I'm<00:02:01.259> at<00:02:01.380> 5:36<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.280> now<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.610> theory<00:02:02.820> I

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
so now I'm at 5:36 so now in theory I

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.760 
so now I'm at 5:36 so now in theory I
just<00:02:03.149> have<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.450> dig<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.810> way<00:02:04.020> until<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.470> get<00:02:04.649> to

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
just have to dig this way until I get to

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:17.000 
just have to dig this way until I get to
negative<00:02:04.890> 57<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:16.140> now<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.500> I'm<00:02:16.680> at<00:02:16.860> negative

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
negative 57 so now that I'm at negative

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.610 
negative 57 so now that I'm at negative
57<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:17.940> should<00:02:18.090> just<00:02:18.209> be<00:02:18.360> able<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.599> dig<00:02:18.750> up<00:02:18.930> and

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
57 I should just be able to dig up and

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.040 
57 I should just be able to dig up and
it<00:02:19.739> should<00:02:19.980> be<00:02:20.099> right<00:02:20.310> there<00:02:20.690> I'm<00:02:21.690> gonna<00:02:21.870> have

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
it should be right there I'm gonna have

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:35.630 
it should be right there I'm gonna have
to<00:02:22.170> use<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.410> ladder<00:02:32.930> look<00:02:33.930> at<00:02:34.019> that<00:02:34.400> so<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.459> got

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
to use a ladder look at that so I got

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.130 
to use a ladder look at that so I got
right<00:02:36.030> up<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:37.170> my<00:02:37.290> light<00:02:37.560> up<00:02:38.489> to<00:02:38.700> my<00:02:38.850> sorry<00:02:39.420> what

using<00:02:45.209> coordinates<00:02:45.830> so<00:02:46.830> it's<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.099> great<00:02:47.280> little

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
using coordinates so it's a great little

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.330 
using coordinates so it's a great little
tool<00:02:48.019> where<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.049> can<00:02:49.200> sort<00:02:49.769> of<00:02:49.799> build<00:02:49.980> tunnels

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
tool where you can sort of build tunnels

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.539 
tool where you can sort of build tunnels
to<00:02:50.730> houses<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:52.319> your<00:02:52.440> spawn<00:02:52.769> point<00:02:52.799> and

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
to houses and to your spawn point and

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.360 
to houses and to your spawn point and
you<00:02:54.000> can<00:02:54.150> also<00:02:54.269> mark<00:02:54.720> places<00:02:55.049> that<00:02:55.950> maybe<00:02:56.250> you

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
you can also mark places that maybe you

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.860 
you can also mark places that maybe you
want<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.580> go<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:56.940> revisit<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.569> write<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.840> down

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
want to go and revisit and write it down

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.140 
want to go and revisit and write it down
so<00:02:58.799> you<00:02:58.830> can<00:02:59.010> go<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.549> see<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.910> place<00:03:00.120> that

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
so you can go and see that place that

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.229 
so you can go and see that place that
you<00:03:00.360> found<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.780> one<00:03:00.989> time<00:03:02.000> that's<00:03:03.000> very

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
you found that one time that's very

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.349 
you found that one time that's very
useful<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.870> also<00:03:04.340> for<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.430> Y<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.670> shows<00:03:06.209> you

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
useful and also for the Y that shows you

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.190 
useful and also for the Y that shows you
how<00:03:06.570> many<00:03:06.840> blocks<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.530> are<00:03:07.709> above<00:03:08.220> bedrock<00:03:09.200> so

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
how many blocks you are above bedrock so

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.810 
how many blocks you are above bedrock so
you<00:03:10.290> can<00:03:10.500> see<00:03:10.769> how<00:03:10.920> deep<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.370> are<00:03:11.549> and

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
you can see how deep you are and

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.170 
you can see how deep you are and
actually<00:03:12.239> a<00:03:12.450> fun<00:03:13.109> tip<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:14.280> at<00:03:14.519> 15<00:03:15.030> above

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
actually a fun tip is that at 15 above

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.559 
actually a fun tip is that at 15 above
bedrock<00:03:15.569> is<00:03:16.019> where<00:03:16.410> most<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.569> minerals

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
bedrock is where most of the minerals

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.930 
bedrock is where most of the minerals
are<00:03:18.780> like<00:03:19.049> most<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.560> diamond<00:03:20.519> on<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.700> iron

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
are like most of the diamond on the iron

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.259 
are like most of the diamond on the iron
ore<00:03:21.150> so<00:03:21.420> that's<00:03:21.600> just<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:22.019> fun<00:03:22.470> little<00:03:22.530> thing<00:03:23.269> so

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
ore so that's just a fun little thing so

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.780 
ore so that's just a fun little thing so
this<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.600> very<00:03:24.780> useful<00:03:24.870> I<00:03:25.530> use<00:03:26.069> it<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.280> lot<00:03:26.459> in<00:03:26.519> my

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
this is very useful I use it a lot in my

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.440 
this is very useful I use it a lot in my
houses<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:28.310> interconnect<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.730> houses<00:03:30.209> and

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
houses I interconnect the houses and

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.229 
houses I interconnect the houses and
tough<00:03:30.660> with<00:03:30.840> tunnels<00:03:31.260> like<00:03:31.440> these<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:33.090> it's

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
tough with tunnels like these and it's

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.840 
tough with tunnels like these and it's
very<00:03:33.420> useful<00:03:33.569> to<00:03:33.780> navigate<00:03:34.430> when<00:03:35.430> it's<00:03:35.609> dark

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
very useful to navigate when it's dark

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.580 
very useful to navigate when it's dark
out<00:03:36.060> like<00:03:36.269> this<00:03:36.510> I'm<00:03:36.690> unpeaceful<00:03:37.079> and<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.530> do

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
out like this I'm unpeaceful and I do

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.069 
out like this I'm unpeaceful and I do
have<00:03:37.829> inventory<00:03:38.220> edit<00:03:38.700> on<00:03:38.850> just<00:03:39.630> for<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.900> sake

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
have inventory edit on just for the sake

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.430 
have inventory edit on just for the sake
of<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.650> tutorial<00:03:40.799> so<00:03:41.660> it's<00:03:42.660> very<00:03:42.810> useful<00:03:43.260> and

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
of the tutorial so it's very useful and

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.809 
of the tutorial so it's very useful and
have<00:03:44.220> fun<00:03:44.430> with<00:03:44.579> it
