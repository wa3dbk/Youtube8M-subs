 hello welcome and welcome once 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:42.309
 more to the channel what I bring today is 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:45.340
 a new edition of my facial routine 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.260
 daily and I will delete the previous video 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.230
 of this because I did not like how it was 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.390
 so that's what I wanted to record again like that 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.160
 that if they had commented please please 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.930
 leave your comments below and your 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.300
 little fingers up if they want it that way 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.420
 and good to start the first thing that I 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.110
 I do when I wake up with a face 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.909
 awesome dream is to occupy a very gel 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.430
 cleaning 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.670
 I have this garnier that is for skin 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:17.920
 normal friendship 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:20.700
 and 150 ml and it is in gel texture 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.700
 it's like that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:30.180
 but he can not focus my little camera 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.580
 and it's super good I take a little bit the 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.570
 first it is with my face then moisten 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.100
 my hands 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.640
 a little bit in the middle of the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.920
 hands of water so I produce foam and 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.770
 then applied all over my face and leather 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.380
 The product recommends applying it only in 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.930
 the zone t because as it is for mixed skin 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.090
 it's like to release the fat from that 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.040
 zone but I apply it on the whole face 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.610
 and I have absolutely no 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.070
 problem so it's going really well and that 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.890
 is what I occupy after obviously in 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.280
 I play and I continue with the routine what I do 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.190
 next is to take from these discs 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.780
 express makeup remover of the redonditos 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:15.030
 and moisten it with my tonic 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.830
 revitalizing my idea which I like 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.460
 a lot because it's also for my kind of 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.890
 skin and cool in a way 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.230
 awesome apart the cleaning gel 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.930
 with a feeling like hydrated 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.069
 super rich and that's why I also like it 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.400
 because he complemented it with 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.349
 the tonic suddenly feel the 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.810
 need that I do not have to use cream 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.049
 because it leaves me so hydrated the gel but 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.269
 Like I occupy this obviously apart 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:47.469
 has the factor 15 is the viola and riba 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:52.680
 albert de nivea is a super rich cream 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:52.680
 It is white and has a texture 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.680
 which is absorbed quickly hydrates 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.620
 very much and for my skin type it goes 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.250
 super super first what I do next 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.510
 it's with a lip moisturizer 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.850
 anyone can be far can be 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.030
 a blister moisturize my lips to 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:18.520
 then start the makeup routine 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:21.050
 and that's my morning facial routine 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.020
 when I do it at night after 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.650
 I did my make-up routine I'm going 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.780
 to upload in another video what I do is 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.170
 occupy this cream 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.140
 that in texture is similar I would say that 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:39.300
 almost equal to the little jar cream of that 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:43.470
 the typical blue body 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:47.010
 it's like this is super compact and uses it or high 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.740
 and it is not lowered by its texture 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.160
 thick and this one occupied him for what they are 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:56.490
 the cheeks that is like the dry part 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.280
 of my skin and then occupied is also 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.890
 at night for what is the area and the 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.700
 neck is super super but those two 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.470
 creams and then I wake up with my face 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.960
 super super rich so 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.680
 and I forgot before applying the 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:18.820
 cream in the night applied this again 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:22.300
 the tonic and the creams so that 's my 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.270
 daytime and evening facial routine and 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.420
 I hope you like it, you know, they subscribe 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.480
