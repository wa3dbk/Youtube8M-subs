control<00:02:10.030> of<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.209> d4<00:02:10.720> square<00:02:10.899> just<00:02:11.200> that

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
control of the d4 square just that

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.820 
control of the d4 square just that
square<00:02:11.800> in<00:02:11.950> front<00:02:12.220> of<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.430> isolated<00:02:12.819> pawn<00:02:13.090> and

square in front of the isolated pawn and

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.820 
square in front of the isolated pawn and

and<00:02:17.920> now<00:02:18.100> Bishop<00:02:18.310> f6<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:19.150> black<00:02:19.390> is<00:02:19.690> not

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
and now Bishop f6 so black is not

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.580 
and now Bishop f6 so black is not
minding<00:02:20.350> exchanging<00:02:21.040> off<00:02:21.130> pieces<00:02:22.590> after

minding exchanging off pieces after

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.980 
minding exchanging off pieces after
Bishop<00:02:23.710> takes<00:02:23.890> f6<00:02:24.640> queen<00:02:25.120> takes<00:02:25.270> f6<00:02:25.720> now<00:02:25.930> we

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
Bishop takes f6 queen takes f6 now we

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.310 
Bishop takes f6 queen takes f6 now we
see<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.460> blockade<00:02:27.460> not<00:02:28.240> we<00:02:28.330> have<00:02:28.420> Knight<00:02:28.600> d4<00:02:29.080> and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
see a blockade not we have Knight d4 and

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.600 
see a blockade not we have Knight d4 and
black<00:02:29.470> immediately<00:02:30.010> challenges<00:02:30.490> the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
black immediately challenges the

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.070 
black immediately challenges the
blockade<00:02:31.000> with<00:02:31.240> 96<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.640> now<00:02:33.640> white<00:02:33.970> creates<00:02:34.870> a

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
blockade with 96 and now white creates a

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.960 
blockade with 96 and now white creates a
bit<00:02:35.290> more<00:02:35.500> dynamic<00:02:35.770> 'no<00:02:36.160> sin<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.520> position<00:02:36.850> or

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
bit more dynamic 'no sin the position or

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.090 
bit more dynamic 'no sin the position or
rather<00:02:37.150> imbalance<00:02:37.780> by<00:02:37.960> taking<00:02:38.350> bishop<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.770> f5

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
rather imbalance by taking bishop and f5

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.160 
rather imbalance by taking bishop and f5
so<00:02:39.790> we<00:02:39.880> have<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.300> Bishop<00:02:40.600> versus<00:02:40.960> Knight

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
so we have a Bishop versus Knight

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.950 
so we have a Bishop versus Knight
situation<00:02:41.890> now<00:02:42.070> with<00:02:42.760> black<00:02:43.000> having<00:02:43.390> isolated

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
situation now with black having isolated

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.640 
situation now with black having isolated
D<00:02:44.140> pawn

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
D pawn

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.610 
D pawn
so<00:02:45.010> can<00:02:45.370> whites<00:02:46.000> neutralize<00:02:46.750> blacks<00:02:47.110> counter

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
so can whites neutralize blacks counter

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.920 
so can whites neutralize blacks counter
play<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.070> try<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.760> tie<00:02:49.000> black<00:02:49.300> defensively

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
play and try and tie black defensively

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.890 
play and try and tie black defensively
to<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.320> D<00:02:50.530> pawn<00:02:50.800> will<00:02:51.280> see<00:02:51.580> after<00:02:52.420> castles

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
to that D pawn will see after castles

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.150 
to that D pawn will see after castles
rook<00:02:53.260> F<00:02:53.470> d8

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.930

so<00:02:54.460> black<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:54.910> gearing<00:02:55.180> up<00:02:55.360> for<00:02:55.420> d4<00:02:56.700> white<00:02:57.700> play

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940

immediately<00:04:06.850> you<00:04:06.910> want<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.150> come<00:04:07.360> to<00:04:07.480> f3<00:04:07.690> let's

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
immediately you want to come to f3 let's

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.979 
immediately you want to come to f3 let's
have<00:04:08.410> a<00:04:08.470> quick<00:04:08.680> look<00:04:08.890> Bishop<00:04:09.280> f3

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
have a quick look Bishop f3

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.030 
have a quick look Bishop f3
that<00:04:10.989> would<00:04:11.110> be<00:04:11.200> interesting<00:04:11.590> as<00:04:11.709> well<00:04:11.860> but

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
that would be interesting as well but

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.590 
that would be interesting as well but
maybe<00:04:12.220> you<00:04:12.489> know<00:04:12.580> black<00:04:12.820> can<00:04:13.060> play<00:04:13.090> Knight<00:04:13.450> II

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
maybe you know black can play Knight II

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.159 
maybe you know black can play Knight II
6<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.140> rook<00:04:14.860> 88<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.430> still<00:04:15.640> prepare<00:04:15.940> d4<00:04:16.570> which

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
6 and rook 88 and still prepare d4 which

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:18.390 
6 and rook 88 and still prepare d4 which
is<00:04:17.290> actually<00:04:17.560> what<00:04:17.680> occurred<00:04:17.980> in<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:18.190> game

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
is actually what occurred in the game

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.820 
is actually what occurred in the game
but<00:04:19.090> actually<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.450> bishop<00:04:19.690> came<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:19.989> h3<00:04:20.530> so

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
but actually the bishop came to h3 so

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.950 
but actually the bishop came to h3 so
the<00:04:21.280> idea<00:04:21.580> is<00:04:21.669> perhaps<00:04:21.940> to<00:04:22.120> reroute<00:04:22.660> it<00:04:22.840> now

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
the idea is perhaps to reroute it now

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.279 
the idea is perhaps to reroute it now
with<00:04:23.110> g4<00:04:23.530> in<00:04:23.590> Bishop<00:04:23.860> g2<00:04:24.210> after<00:04:25.210> rook<00:04:25.330> a<00:04:25.480> d8<00:04:25.780> g3

with g4 in Bishop g2 after rook a d8 g3

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.260 
with g4 in Bishop g2 after rook a d8 g3
was<00:04:26.500> played<00:04:26.830> so<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.669> rewriting<00:04:28.000> of<00:04:28.210> the

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
was played so the rewriting of the

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.909 
was played so the rewriting of the
bishop<00:04:28.539> again<00:04:28.960> it<00:04:29.050> will<00:04:29.110> be<00:04:29.229> pointing<00:04:29.620> at<00:04:29.680> the

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
bishop again it will be pointing at the

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.650 
bishop again it will be pointing at the
vulnerable<00:04:30.550> d5

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
vulnerable d5

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.530 
vulnerable d5
porn<00:04:32.110> but<00:04:32.260> now<00:04:32.410> g5<00:04:33.130> so<00:04:33.670> a<00:04:33.700> very<00:04:33.910> aggressive

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540

move<00:04:34.780> from<00:04:35.160> kramnik<00:04:36.160> so<00:04:36.610> he<00:04:36.790> really<00:04:37.090> wants<00:04:37.330> to

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
move from kramnik so he really wants to

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.010 
move from kramnik so he really wants to
get<00:04:37.570> in<00:04:37.950> 96<00:04:38.950> and<00:04:39.220> d4<00:04:39.880> so<00:04:40.300> every<00:04:40.660> one<00:04:40.810> of<00:04:40.840> his

get in 96 and d4 so every one of his

get in 96 and d4 so every one of his

the exchange down it's gonna be lost to
him<00:05:07.480> so<00:05:07.660> so<00:05:07.990> he<00:05:08.050> plays<00:05:08.290> the<00:05:08.530> rook<00:05:08.680> back<00:05:08.890> and<00:05:09.190> off

the default blacks really comfortably
equalized<00:05:12.070> now<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.640> it<00:05:13.210> doesn't<00:05:13.390> really

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
equalized now and it doesn't really

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.750 
equalized now and it doesn't really
matter<00:05:13.990> about<00:05:14.290> his<00:05:14.650> King<00:05:14.920> side<00:05:15.190> singing<00:05:15.610> me<00:05:15.730> a

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
matter about his King side singing me a

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.240 
matter about his King side singing me a
bit<00:05:15.990> open<00:05:16.990> because<00:05:17.290> it's<00:05:17.530> not<00:05:17.770> really<00:05:18.070> an

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
bit open because it's not really an

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.070 
bit open because it's not really an
exploitable<00:05:18.760> weakness<00:05:18.880> these<00:05:19.600> pawns

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
exploitable weakness these pawns

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.720 
exploitable weakness these pawns
there<00:05:20.620> wasn't<00:05:20.770> enough<00:05:21.070> pressure<00:05:21.310> for<00:05:21.490> white

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
there wasn't enough pressure for white

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.670 
there wasn't enough pressure for white
on<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:21.970> King<00:05:22.180> side<00:05:22.210> it's<00:05:22.630> all<00:05:22.750> been<00:05:22.990> revolving

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
on the King side it's all been revolving

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.800 
on the King side it's all been revolving
around<00:05:24.040> that<00:05:24.220> D<00:05:24.580> pawn<00:05:24.940> so<00:05:25.420> why<00:05:25.570> it's<00:05:25.720> not

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
around that D pawn so why it's not

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.380 
around that D pawn so why it's not
really<00:05:26.080> set<00:05:26.260> up<00:05:26.290> for<00:05:26.650> an<00:05:26.710> attack<00:05:27.180> he<00:05:28.180> just

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
really set up for an attack he just

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.600 
really set up for an attack he just
takes<00:05:28.660> on<00:05:28.870> d4<00:05:29.320> and<00:05:29.530> after<00:05:29.800> rook<00:05:30.010> takes<00:05:30.280> and

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
was offered and accepted so they drew

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.940 
was offered and accepted so they drew
here<00:05:37.060> not<00:05:37.630> as<00:05:37.720> exciting<00:05:38.200> as<00:05:38.290> the<00:05:38.380> 3rd<00:05:38.560> game<00:05:38.770> but

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
here not as exciting as the 3rd game but

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.440 
here not as exciting as the 3rd game but
it's<00:05:39.040> still<00:05:39.220> an<00:05:39.400> interesting<00:05:39.580> demonstration

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
it's still an interesting demonstration

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.660 
it's still an interesting demonstration
of<00:05:40.630> how<00:05:40.900> to<00:05:40.930> play<00:05:41.290> both<00:05:41.770> for<00:05:42.040> and<00:05:42.190> against<00:05:42.580> the

exchanges which occur and white decided
to<00:06:18.220> saddle<00:06:18.580> black<00:06:18.880> with<00:06:19.480> the<00:06:19.600> isolated<00:06:19.990> port

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
to saddle black with the isolated port

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.860 
to saddle black with the isolated port
because<00:06:21.040> after<00:06:21.280> C<00:06:21.490> takes<00:06:21.790> Knight<00:06:22.300> takes<00:06:22.630> white

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
because after C takes Knight takes white

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.710 
because after C takes Knight takes white
plays<00:06:23.140> Knight<00:06:23.410> takes<00:06:24.010> d5<00:06:24.520> so<00:06:25.120> leaving<00:06:25.390> black

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
plays Knight takes d5 so leaving black

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.890 
plays Knight takes d5 so leaving black
with<00:06:25.870> a<00:06:25.930> d5<00:06:26.380> pawn<00:06:26.650> and<00:06:26.950> now<00:06:26.980> D<00:06:27.700> takes<00:06:28.030> e5

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
with a d5 pawn and now D takes e5

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.670 
with a d5 pawn and now D takes e5
so<00:06:29.500> it<00:06:29.590> all<00:06:29.740> revolves<00:06:30.640> around<00:06:30.730> this<00:06:31.030> pawn<00:06:31.270> now

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
so it all revolves around this pawn now

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.410 
so it all revolves around this pawn now
the<00:06:32.680> blockading<00:06:33.250> maneuvers<00:06:33.700> and<00:06:33.910> the

Knight<00:06:40.450> takes<00:06:40.750> f5<00:06:41.380> allowing<00:06:42.130> this<00:06:42.610> Bishop

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 
Knight takes f5 allowing this Bishop

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.630 
Knight takes f5 allowing this Bishop
versus<00:06:43.300> Knight<00:06:43.630> set<00:06:44.440> up<00:06:44.620> in<00:06:44.830> balance<00:06:45.310> in<00:06:45.550> the

versus Knight set up in balance in the

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.330 
versus Knight set up in balance in the
position<00:06:46.030> but<00:06:46.750> white<00:06:47.410> never<00:06:47.740> really<00:06:48.130> could

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.340 
position but white never really could

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.480 
position but white never really could
fix<00:06:48.669> that<00:06:49.090> pawn<00:06:49.450> it<00:06:49.690> once<00:06:49.900> black<00:06:50.310> arranged<00:06:51.310> the

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
fix that pawn it once black arranged the

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.480 
fix that pawn it once black arranged the
default<00:06:51.940> black<00:06:52.120> equalized<00:06:52.840> and<00:06:53.140> the<00:06:54.070> very

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
default black equalized and the very

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:55.710 
default black equalized and the very
interesting<00:06:54.910> move<00:06:55.030> of<00:06:55.150> the<00:06:55.240> game<00:06:55.390> was<00:06:55.570> this

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 
interesting move of the game was this

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.370 
interesting move of the game was this
some<00:06:56.190> g5<00:06:57.190> so<00:06:57.970> putting<00:06:58.210> immediate<00:06:58.750> pressure<00:06:59.020> on

00:06:59.370 --> 00:06:59.380 
some g5 so putting immediate pressure on

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.650 
some g5 so putting immediate pressure on
white<00:07:00.130> and<00:07:00.460> potentially<00:07:01.330> you<00:07:01.419> know<00:07:01.540> the

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:01.660 
white and potentially you know the

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.420 
white and potentially you know the
knight<00:07:01.810> coming<00:07:02.110> to<00:07:02.229> e6<00:07:02.650> also<00:07:03.040> had<00:07:03.190> very

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
knight coming to e6 also had very

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.370 
knight coming to e6 also had very
aggressive<00:07:03.940> ideas<00:07:04.360> of<00:07:04.479> Knight<00:07:04.690> g5<00:07:05.050> and<00:07:05.290> Knight

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.380 
aggressive ideas of Knight g5 and Knight

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.820 
aggressive ideas of Knight g5 and Knight
f3

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830 
f3

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.330 
f3
so<00:07:06.490> basically<00:07:07.260> 96<00:07:08.260> was<00:07:08.530> was<00:07:08.860> potentially<00:07:09.280> a

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 
so basically 96 was was potentially a

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.940 
so basically 96 was was potentially a
dual-purpose<00:07:09.580> move<00:07:10.150> but<00:07:10.750> Kramnik<00:07:11.560> chose<00:07:11.770> just

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:11.950 
dual-purpose move but Kramnik chose just

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.770 
dual-purpose move but Kramnik chose just
position<00:07:12.490> they<00:07:12.580> just<00:07:12.790> played<00:07:13.000> d4<00:07:13.479> which<00:07:13.630> is

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.780 
position they just played d4 which is

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.650 
position they just played d4 which is
what<00:07:14.200> all<00:07:14.380> his<00:07:14.680> pieces<00:07:14.950> are<00:07:15.280> geared<00:07:15.610> up<00:07:15.700> for<00:07:15.970> to

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:16.660 
what all his pieces are geared up for to

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.460 
what all his pieces are geared up for to
play<00:07:16.870> d4<00:07:17.410> so<00:07:18.190> it's<00:07:18.340> a<00:07:18.400> very<00:07:18.610> logical<00:07:18.820> move

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:19.470 
play d4 so it's a very logical move

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.370 
play d4 so it's a very logical move
dissolving<00:07:20.470> his<00:07:20.740> theoretical<00:07:21.070> weakness<00:07:21.729> and

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.380 
dissolving his theoretical weakness and

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.900 
dissolving his theoretical weakness and
being<00:07:23.380> able<00:07:23.500> to<00:07:23.650> easily<00:07:23.950> like<00:07:24.400> draw<00:07:24.700> with

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:24.910 
being able to easily like draw with

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.270 
being able to easily like draw with
black<00:07:25.150> which<00:07:25.540> leads<00:07:26.380> him<00:07:26.590> to<00:07:26.620> just<00:07:26.950> prepare

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 
black which leads him to just prepare

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.340 
black which leads him to just prepare
for<00:07:27.340> the<00:07:27.520> next<00:07:27.640> game<00:07:27.910> as<00:07:28.120> white<00:07:28.360> which<00:07:28.870> maybe

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:29.350 
for the next game as white which maybe

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.130 
for the next game as white which maybe
he<00:07:29.560> will<00:07:29.680> try<00:07:29.860> for<00:07:30.100> more<00:07:30.280> I<00:07:30.750> hope<00:07:31.750> you<00:07:31.870> enjoyed

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:32.140 
he will try for more I hope you enjoyed
