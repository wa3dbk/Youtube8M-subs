00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.270 
a difference so we're all the energy and
then<00:03:33.900> put<00:03:34.109> it<00:03:34.200> toward<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.530> George<00:03:34.950> what's<00:03:35.160> the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
then put it toward the George what's the

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.890 
then put it toward the George what's the
physics<00:03:35.670> in<00:03:35.820> this<00:03:35.850> I<00:03:36.209> don't<00:03:36.420> know<00:03:36.480> any<00:03:36.660> skull

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
physics in this I don't know any skull

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.949 
physics in this I don't know any skull
price<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:38.400> physics<00:03:38.850> is<00:03:39.030> not<00:03:39.239> very<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:39.720> doesn't

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
price the physics is not very it doesn't

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.530 
price the physics is not very it doesn't
matter<00:03:40.019> what<00:03:40.230> physics<00:03:40.650> is<00:03:40.829> it<00:03:41.070> work<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:42.299> wait

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
matter what physics is it work so wait

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.460 
matter what physics is it work so wait
if<00:03:42.750> that's<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:43.079> store<00:03:43.320> joint<00:03:43.560> got<00:03:43.709> a<00:03:43.859> guy<00:03:44.660> no<00:03:45.660> I

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
if that's the store joint got a guy no I

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.590 
if that's the store joint got a guy no I
want<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:47.190> least<00:03:47.400> give<00:03:47.579> a<00:03:47.609> nigga<00:03:47.970> off<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.450> it

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
want it least give a nigga off of it

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.509 
want it least give a nigga off of it
yeah<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.769> screen<00:03:50.010> bent<00:03:50.430> up<00:03:52.160> yeah<00:03:53.160> you<00:03:53.220> can

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
yeah the screen bent up yeah you can

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.599 
yeah the screen bent up yeah you can
tell<00:03:53.730> they<00:03:53.880> get<00:03:54.000> anyone<00:03:54.359> then<00:03:55.069> see<00:03:56.069> it<00:03:56.190> up<00:03:56.430> a

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
tell they get anyone then see it up a

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.610 
tell they get anyone then see it up a
little<00:03:56.850> higher<00:03:57.060> than<00:03:57.359> all<00:03:57.870> these<00:03:58.079> are<00:03:58.260> foolish

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
little higher than all these are foolish

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.000 
little higher than all these are foolish
this<00:03:58.859> has<00:03:59.010> been<00:03:59.220> too

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.059 

it<00:04:02.580> was<00:04:02.730> even<00:04:02.909> get<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.150> new<00:04:03.299> bottom<00:04:04.069> yeah

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
it was even get a new bottom yeah

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.619 
it was even get a new bottom yeah
imagine<00:04:05.700> I<00:04:05.730> could<00:04:05.790> find<00:04:06.090> one<00:04:06.269> somewhere<00:04:06.510> oh<00:04:08.629> I

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
imagine I could find one somewhere oh I

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.660 
imagine I could find one somewhere oh I
also<00:04:10.140> Pratt<00:04:10.560> were<00:04:10.769> you<00:04:10.950> proud<00:04:11.189> I<00:04:11.489> was

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
also Pratt were you proud I was

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.869 
also Pratt were you proud I was
surprised<00:04:12.030> I<00:04:12.329> was<00:04:13.189> like<00:04:14.189> times<00:04:14.549> like<00:04:14.700> this<00:04:14.819> a

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
surprised I was like times like this a

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.259 
surprised I was like times like this a
bump<00:04:15.150> it<00:04:15.659> didn't<00:04:16.049> break<00:04:16.290> it<00:04:16.560> if<00:04:17.400> not<00:04:17.639> it<00:04:17.910> didn't

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
bump it didn't break it if not it didn't

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.810 
bump it didn't break it if not it didn't
break<00:04:18.389> well<00:04:18.660> I<00:04:18.690> have<00:04:18.870> to<00:04:19.049> say<00:04:19.220> pretty<00:04:20.220> amazing

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820

with<00:04:27.600> an<00:04:27.690> iphone<00:04:29.360> okay<00:04:30.650> while<00:04:31.650> it's<00:04:31.830> recording

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
with an iphone okay while it's recording

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.480 
with an iphone okay while it's recording
its<00:04:33.600> record<00:04:33.990> i'm<00:04:34.530> trying<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:34.889> see<00:04:35.039> if<00:04:35.220> like

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
its record i'm trying to see if like

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.840 
its record i'm trying to see if like
smoke<00:04:38.479> show<00:04:39.479> in<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.750> video
