suck goo with an exclamation mark it's

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.769 
suck goo with an exclamation mark it's
the<00:00:26.160> first<00:00:26.400> thing<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.670> do<00:00:26.789> would<00:00:26.970> be<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.240> make<00:00:27.750> a

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
the first thing to do would be to make a

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.720 
the first thing to do would be to make a
background<00:00:30.109> here's<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.260> goon<00:00:31.500> he'll<00:00:31.800> different

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
background here's a goon he'll different

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.530 
background here's a goon he'll different
areas<00:00:33.149> with<00:00:33.390> different<00:00:33.420> colors<00:00:37.040> there<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
areas with different colors there and

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:47.000 
areas with different colors there and
now<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.600> need<00:00:39.750> some<00:00:39.930> sky<00:00:45.440> like<00:00:46.440> clouds

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
now we need some sky like clouds

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.029 
now we need some sky like clouds
so<00:00:47.190> let's<00:00:47.370> stamp<00:00:47.640> some<00:00:47.879> clouds<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.920> hold<00:00:49.920> in

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
so let's stamp some clouds on hold in

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.040 
so let's stamp some clouds on hold in
here<00:00:51.829> and<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.760> order<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.059> suck<00:00:54.270> goo<00:00:54.449> we<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
here and in order to suck goo we have to

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.920 
here and in order to suck goo we have to
have<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> pipe<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.949> let's<00:00:56.280> draw<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> pipe<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
have a pipe so let's draw a pipe in the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.850 
have a pipe so let's draw a pipe in the
middle<00:01:02.930> but<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.080> still<00:01:04.229> kind<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.439> blocking

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
middle but it's still kind of blocking

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.380 
middle but it's still kind of blocking
so<00:01:05.040> we<00:01:05.220> need<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.460> round<00:01:05.670> out<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> pipes<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
so we need to round out the pipes and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.300 
so we need to round out the pipes and
kind<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.659> make<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.439> elbows<00:01:07.830> look<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.159> little

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
nicer so I'm gonna do that by hand zoom

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.630 
nicer so I'm gonna do that by hand zoom

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
looked at us so let's take the eyeball

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.830 
looked at us so let's take the eyeball
over<00:01:47.909> here<00:01:50.540> move<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.659> down<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> little<00:01:53.720> when<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
over here move it down a little when the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.170 
over here move it down a little when the
Google<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.229> tapped<00:01:55.530> not<00:01:56.340> only<00:01:56.549> do<00:01:56.729> we<00:01:56.820> go<00:01:56.939> north

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
Google is tapped not only do we go north

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.539 
Google is tapped not only do we go north
but<00:01:57.509> let's<00:01:57.689> add<00:01:57.840> an<00:01:57.990> action<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:59.189> now<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.369> goo

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
but let's add an action so now that goo

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.630 
but let's add an action so now that goo
ball<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.820> traveling<00:02:00.210> upwards<00:02:01.399> now<00:02:02.399> it's

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
ball is traveling upwards now it's

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.459 
ball is traveling upwards now it's
animating<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.719> now<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.899> whole<00:02:04.140> experience

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
animating but now the whole experience

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.840 
animating but now the whole experience
kind<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.799> falls<00:02:04.979> flat<00:02:05.159> because<00:02:05.520> we<00:02:05.610> don't<00:02:05.790> have

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
kind of falls flat because we don't have
