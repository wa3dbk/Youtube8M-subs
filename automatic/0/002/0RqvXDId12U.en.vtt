 we approach the highest part of the 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.459
 list and with the first three positions in 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.409

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:44.730
 millions of people closing the list and 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.040
 doubling in quantity to the previous ones 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:52.060
 we have diseases 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:55.060
 cardiovascular being number 2 for 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.440

 13 percent of all deaths 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.720
 annual 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.770
 obviously there are more causes but these 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.450
 are the most likely for someone who 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.370
 live on earth 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.000
