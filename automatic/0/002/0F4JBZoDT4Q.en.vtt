00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.559
 granite blocks almost 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.189
 the feeling that there is so much to the 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:16.560
 hand is watching the world all the way there is 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.950
 so much that you can't reach it anymore 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.490
 come 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.490
 it's too much 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.479
 come kind faÃ§ades or layers to the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.829
 outside is kind 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.409
 comes a kind of panse or armor like if 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.420
 the skin 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.719
 the skin of innocence that is called got it 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.890
 that the entire machine park is in us 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.600
 but we don't see that because we have one 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.840
 cool skin around it but if you do that 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.060
 also then you come to the inside and 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.679
 going into car goes for me goes there 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.679
 about how we're at that within country 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.719
 how can you make this to make it there 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.390
 space is created 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.280
 and if you look at the details 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.460
 look at the moments and you go 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.340
 zoom in on it and you'll see those details 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.440
 your chi space because can see and 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.540
 then you see the whole that you see the yellow 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.130
 understand that you think differently 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.500
 on the whole 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.950
 because you can see from which elements it is 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.950
 built up 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.560
 in rehearsal I notice that I am sitting now 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.290
 in the kind of you have a mass is that 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.700
 pulls himself slowly walking like you 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.350
 a little bit more 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.300
 comes next process it goes on one 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.710
 zombie min and eventually you come to 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.630
 one 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.730
 and then he has a free for me 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.880
 long way 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.190
 it not often that was a long slant 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.260
 but now I find the solo 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.750
 just the one what a red because me 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.120
 at that facility of one person and 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.010
 now a licensed child where you totally 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.240
 which you fully dive into and that is think 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.400
 I do something now with this 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.230
 performance tries to find how is possible 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.230
 I added an income 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:21.250
 that really from that mass 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.820
 what remains is what I find exciting 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.820
 discovery tour 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.159
 peel off the skin and that inside 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.959
 and that sensitivity comes with it 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.450
 these are the sources of inspiration for 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.439
 from which I look at from which I make choices 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.099
 to make 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:50.159
 but we are traveling we are on our way and 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:52.560
 Fall is the premiere that I can do it 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.530
 reflect back ok i'm with 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.780
 these words started these thoughts 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.280
 and things have changed along the way 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.280
 where they finally arrived
