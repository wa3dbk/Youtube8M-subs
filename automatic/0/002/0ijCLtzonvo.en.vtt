00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.580
 so has people i am your great wall 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.000
 motor today a tutorial 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.949
 namely how to start in round 20 because 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.449
 many of you do not want to 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.730
 always start at 1 and want to 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.140
 just a few and after saving and there 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.230
 I just think something 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.490
 how I would do 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.410
 I'll tell you the plan works here 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.640
 actually as good as ever and if you are 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.199
 spun on the map I found 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.899
 Just when I think of the first thing I do 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.480
 do it if it just 120 directly to the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.920
 go crate and it is namely without 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.629
 Problems are lost because the zombies are there 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660
 First, the Alsdorfer can be bound 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.969
 you take without problems and is with me 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.860
 now in the case one on 19 11 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.110
 you can of course better weapons 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.789
 get or worse and yes by that 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.539
 just recommend the crate again 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.760
 undo 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.829
 and when zombies amassed 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.850
 Just have a walk in Weimar and 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.280
 give the second week 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.449
 and if you have the two weapons go 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.140
 Just go back a bit 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.000
 in the center 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.409
 because you can not do it pretty well 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.990
 Run round and the zombies behind 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.180
 you have best collects shows only 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.580
 time to save all zombies and ammunition 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.070
 and yes with as few balls as possible 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.750
 as possible for zombies wrap and me 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.070
 have packed now is a little stupid 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.070
 because you can only nadis 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.950
 nahdistanz can take and yes if the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.299
 happens to pass by quick view then 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.619
 can also equal, we take 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.250
 Although similar we do not need 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.320
 to die 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.060
 and yes you can always beautiful now 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.579
 for example here in the straight nice 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.720
 shoot at the zombie and then take it 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.189
 actually only a time expenditure 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.320
 it just takes a bit to get here 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.720
 example new because you could have something like that 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.670
 also like to access and you have to 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.540
 be careful because the zombies will be 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.329
 saved everywhere 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.960
 that means they can come from everywhere 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.829
 have to be very careful because they are believed 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.880
 maybe not so fast 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.939
 they can not look as you can see 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.290
 suddenly comes to the back 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.090
 I've been forced to do that here 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.590
 but to change directions is to change 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.689
 no problem just always 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.409
 go through until he notices then comes 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.880
 no more 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.100
 and then you can play the same game 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.380
 Just do it from the beginning 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.700
 Gather beautifully and as appropriate 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.819
 which weapon has to shoot and what 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.030
 I might you 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.180
 could recommend if you are 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.180
 maybe it will not get a weapon 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.650
 so good or or choose one then 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.469
 can you go to the church again and 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.400
 I think I'll be in the later 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.560
 video are now synonymous again 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.420
 show because my weapon I have then 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.530
 extra unfortunately, can to amex emma and the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.420
 I did not take that because I did 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.730
 just wanted to show you how it would be if 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.170
 no macs always comes and then you can 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.849
 you not quite comfortable even to the box 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.010
 running to skate after you 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.439
 and then it would have to go down there 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.810
 and yes, it was about it now 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.370
 look at the end and then I will 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.799
 still shows how one can come to the crate 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.719
 with a horde of zombies or wishes 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.129
 Much success says jobs has cut 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:58.349
 and then we choose the next one 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.349
 video re-skin three new grand awards 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.770
 on
