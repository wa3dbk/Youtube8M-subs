00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.180 

okay<00:00:14.840> I<00:00:14.870> thought<00:00:15.140> I'd<00:00:15.320> introduce<00:00:15.530> you<00:00:15.860> to<00:00:16.160> a

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
okay I thought I'd introduce you to a

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.130 
okay I thought I'd introduce you to a
different<00:00:16.400> style<00:00:16.850> of<00:00:17.030> scalable<00:00:17.510> truck<00:00:17.840> this

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
different style of scalable truck this

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
different style of scalable truck this
is<00:00:18.410> a<00:00:18.710> torsion<00:00:19.550> style<00:00:20.000> truck<00:00:20.650> it's<00:00:21.650> not<00:00:21.890> the

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
is a torsion style truck it's not the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.760 
is a torsion style truck it's not the
same<00:00:22.369> as<00:00:22.700> a<00:00:22.730> reverse<00:00:23.210> kingpin<00:00:23.810> or<00:00:24.110> a<00:00:24.140> typical

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
same as a reverse kingpin or a typical

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.750 
same as a reverse kingpin or a typical
kingpin<00:00:25.610> truck<00:00:25.939> like<00:00:26.599> a<00:00:26.980> regular<00:00:27.980> Indy<00:00:28.580> that

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
kingpin truck like a regular Indy that

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.850 
kingpin truck like a regular Indy that
kind<00:00:29.060> of<00:00:29.119> thing<00:00:29.360> it's<00:00:29.599> a<00:00:29.840> torsion<00:00:30.320> style<00:00:30.619> truck

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
kind of thing it's a torsion style truck

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.400 
kind of thing it's a torsion style truck
and<00:00:31.009> it<00:00:31.070> works<00:00:31.279> on<00:00:31.490> a<00:00:31.520> principle<00:00:31.730> of<00:00:32.419> using<00:00:33.170> one

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
and it works on a principle of using one

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.240 
and it works on a principle of using one
bushing<00:00:33.890> here<00:00:34.400> it<00:00:34.520> is<00:00:34.700> and<00:00:35.890> relying<00:00:36.890> on<00:00:37.100> the

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
bushing here it is and relying on the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.170 
bushing here it is and relying on the
twisting<00:00:37.820> motion<00:00:39.250> to<00:00:40.250> give<00:00:40.460> you<00:00:40.670> the

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
twisting motion to give you the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.400 
twisting motion to give you the
compression<00:00:41.870> so<00:00:42.380> this<00:00:43.329> bushing<00:00:44.329> fits<00:00:45.079> into

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
compression so this bushing fits into

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.619 
compression so this bushing fits into
the<00:00:45.500> baseplate<00:00:45.829> you<00:00:46.100> can<00:00:46.280> see<00:00:46.489> that<00:00:47.269> it's<00:00:47.449> got

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
the baseplate you can see that it's got

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.729 
the baseplate you can see that it's got
corresponding<00:00:48.590> holes<00:00:48.969> to<00:00:49.969> lock<00:00:50.300> this<00:00:51.050> bushing

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
corresponding holes to lock this bushing

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.029 
corresponding holes to lock this bushing
in<00:00:52.010> place<00:00:52.309> and<00:00:52.730> then<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.390> hanger<00:00:54.039> has

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
in place and then the hanger has

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:04.720 
in place and then the hanger has
corresponding<00:00:56.000> holes<00:00:56.239> to<00:01:01.660> nicely<00:01:02.679> and<00:01:03.730> that's

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
corresponding holes to nicely and that's

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.280 
corresponding holes to nicely and that's
it<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:05.180> you've<00:01:05.330> only<00:01:05.360> got<00:01:05.600> one<00:01:05.810> bushing<00:01:06.170> it's

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
it so you've only got one bushing it's

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.500 
it so you've only got one bushing it's
not<00:01:06.470> being<00:01:06.680> compressed<00:01:07.130> when<00:01:07.400> it<00:01:07.550> turns<00:01:07.850> it

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
not being compressed when it turns it

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.010 
not being compressed when it turns it
twists<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:10.040> you'll<00:01:10.220> also<00:01:10.370> see<00:01:10.820> that<00:01:11.060> when<00:01:11.720> it

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
twists and you'll also see that when it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:21.069 
twists and you'll also see that when it
is<00:01:12.230> set<00:01:12.530> up<00:01:12.560> these<00:01:13.550> two<00:01:14.090> parts<00:01:15.970> overlap

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.380 

reading<00:01:22.079> mode<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.399> means<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:24.000> can<00:01:24.149> only

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
reading mode and that means it can only

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.100 
reading mode and that means it can only
turn<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.740> far<00:01:26.450> there's<00:01:27.450> no<00:01:27.630> way<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.869> can

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
turn that far there's no way you can

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.399 
turn that far there's no way you can
turn<00:01:28.350> any<00:01:28.619> further<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.490> these<00:01:29.759> trucks<00:01:30.409> mean

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
turn any further so these trucks mean

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.190 
turn any further so these trucks mean
that<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:32.070> run<00:01:32.340> very<00:01:32.789> low<00:01:33.060> setups<00:01:33.659> without

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
that you can run very low setups without

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.899 
that you can run very low setups without
wheel<00:01:34.409> bite<00:01:34.770> will<00:01:35.039> bite<00:01:35.310> being<00:01:35.670> something

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
wheel bite will bite being something

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.580 
wheel bite will bite being something
that<00:01:36.000> scares<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.960> lot<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.140> people<00:01:37.470> when<00:01:37.560> they

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
that scares a lot of people when they

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.749 
that scares a lot of people when they
first<00:01:37.890> start<00:01:39.229> because<00:01:40.229> just<00:01:41.159> means<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
first start because just means that the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.880 
first start because just means that the
board<00:01:42.060> comes<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.539> something<00:01:42.780> stop<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.170> rub<00:01:43.679> so

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
board comes to something stop it rub so

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.520 
board comes to something stop it rub so
let's<00:01:44.399> say<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.670> want<00:01:44.880> an<00:01:44.939> ice<00:01:45.090> dancer<00:01:45.530> cruiser

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
let's say you want an ice dancer cruiser

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.910 
let's say you want an ice dancer cruiser
board<00:01:47.210> something<00:01:48.210> turns<00:01:48.720> very<00:01:49.079> quickly<00:01:49.439> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
board something turns very quickly and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.980 
board something turns very quickly and
you<00:01:50.250> want<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.460> run<00:01:50.579> quite<00:01:50.880> large<00:01:51.119> wheels<00:01:51.450> you

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
you want to run quite large wheels you

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.240 
you want to run quite large wheels you
don't<00:01:52.170> want<00:01:52.289> it<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.440> be<00:01:52.530> too<00:01:52.740> high<00:01:52.920> off<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
don't want it to be too high off the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.440 
don't want it to be too high off the
ground<00:01:53.450> but<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.659> want<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.929> have<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:56.450> these

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
ground but you want to have it these

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.350 
ground but you want to have it these
tracks<00:01:57.810> are<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.049> perfect<00:01:58.729> solution<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.149> here

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
tracks are the perfect solution so here

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.730 
tracks are the perfect solution so here
we<00:02:00.479> are<00:02:00.799> they<00:02:01.799> look<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.009> bit<00:02:02.039> odd<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.340> start<00:02:02.759> with

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
we are they look a bit odd to start with

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.199 
we are they look a bit odd to start with
because<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.009> kingpins<00:02:05.429> sort<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.789> facing

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
because the kingpins sort of is facing

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.900 
because the kingpins sort of is facing
the<00:02:06.299> wrong<00:02:06.450> way<00:02:06.720> but<00:02:07.069> put<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.220> name<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
the wrong way but put the name on the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.410 
the wrong way but put the name on the
front<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.509> way<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.049> know<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:11.700> then<00:02:12.299> if

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
front and that way you know and then if

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.289 
front and that way you know and then if
I<00:02:12.569> press<00:02:12.750> down<00:02:12.870> hard<00:02:14.390> here<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:16.560> should<00:02:16.860> see

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
I press down hard here you should see

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:22.039 
I press down hard here you should see
but<00:02:18.299> it<00:02:19.230> won't<00:02:19.560> do<00:02:19.830> bite<00:02:20.420> us<00:02:21.420> about<00:02:21.780> a

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
but it won't do bite us about a

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.360 
but it won't do bite us about a
centimeter<00:02:22.860> away<00:02:23.549> from<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.660> deck<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.980> put<00:02:26.190> my

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
centimeter away from the deck and put my

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.120 
centimeter away from the deck and put my
finger<00:02:26.630> underneath<00:02:27.630> this<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:28.920> there's

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
finger underneath this so there's

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.949 
finger underneath this so there's
absolutely<00:02:29.340> no<00:02:29.940> way<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.150> can<00:02:30.420> get<00:02:30.540> wheel<00:02:30.750> by

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
absolutely no way you can get wheel by

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.540 
absolutely no way you can get wheel by
now<00:02:31.170> this<00:02:31.320> gives<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.709> tremendous<00:02:32.130> confidence

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
now this gives you tremendous confidence

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.060 
now this gives you tremendous confidence
you<00:02:34.060> can<00:02:34.270> lean<00:02:34.930> as<00:02:35.830> far<00:02:36.310> as<00:02:36.580> you<00:02:36.730> possibly<00:02:37.510> want

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
you can lean as far as you possibly want

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.840 
you can lean as far as you possibly want
knowing<00:02:39.070> that<00:02:39.190> you<00:02:39.310> won't<00:02:39.490> come<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.700> a

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
knowing that you won't come to a

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.790 
knowing that you won't come to a
grinding<00:02:40.030> halt<00:02:40.390> it's<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.660> kind<00:02:40.870> of<00:02:40.930> board<00:02:41.140> you
