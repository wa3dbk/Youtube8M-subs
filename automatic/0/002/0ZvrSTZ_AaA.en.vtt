I've got a PhD sitting up here she's the
one<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.870> were<00:02:34.610> emulating<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.880> know<00:02:35.970> we're

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
one that were emulating you know we're

one that were emulating you know we're
kicking<00:02:36.450> out<00:02:36.540> all<00:02:36.690> these<00:02:36.780> hen<00:02:37.019> calls<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:37.800> we

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
kicking out all these hen calls so we

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.470 
kicking out all these hen calls so we
want<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.160> have<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.280> hand<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:38.790> might<00:02:39.060> even<00:02:39.239> move

want to have a hand I might even move

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.410 
want to have a hand I might even move
her<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.690> little<00:02:39.930> closer<00:02:40.640> but<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.790> focal<00:02:42.150> point

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
her a little closer but the focal point

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
her a little closer but the focal point
is<00:02:42.600> going<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:42.959> be<00:02:43.080> dirty<00:02:43.739> B<00:02:44.269> that<00:02:45.269> is<00:02:45.480> where<00:02:46.230> you

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
is going to be dirty B that is where you

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.809 
is going to be dirty B that is where you
want<00:02:46.680> those<00:02:46.860> times<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.250> be<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.519> you<00:02:47.580> got<00:02:47.700> to

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
want those times to be and you got to

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.250 
want those times to be and you got to
think<00:02:47.910> about<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.330> if<00:02:48.510> your<00:02:48.630> bow<00:02:48.870> hunting

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
think about that if your bow hunting

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.320 
think about that if your bow hunting
doing<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.769> out<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:50.069> ground<00:02:50.310> blind<00:02:50.489> or<00:02:50.910> doing

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
doing it out of a ground blind or doing

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.300 
doing it out of a ground blind or doing
it<00:02:51.390> hiding<00:02:51.690> behind<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.989> tree<00:02:52.019> you<00:02:52.799> got<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.130> have

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
it hiding behind a tree you got to have

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.960 
it hiding behind a tree you got to have
a<00:02:53.340> way<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:53.750> positioning<00:02:54.750> your<00:02:55.170> shot<00:02:55.560> now<00:02:56.340> if<00:02:56.730> I

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
a way of positioning your shot now if I

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.539 
a way of positioning your shot now if I
was<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.239> gun<00:02:57.720> hunt<00:02:58.049> I<00:02:58.260> might<00:02:59.100> back<00:02:59.250> these

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
was to gun hunt I might back these

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.759 
was to gun hunt I might back these
decoys<00:02:59.970> up<00:03:00.209> 25<00:03:00.750> yards<00:03:01.110> if<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.320> was<00:03:01.440> in<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.590> blind

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
decoys up 25 yards if I was in a blind

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.650 
decoys up 25 yards if I was in a blind
if<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.549> was<00:03:02.640> running<00:03:02.910> through<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.180> timber<00:03:03.510> I

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
if I was running through the timber I

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.000 
if I was running through the timber I
probably<00:03:04.110> have<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.230> PhD<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.329> the<00:03:06.329> dirty<00:03:06.510> be

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
probably have a PhD and the dirty be

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.580 
probably have a PhD and the dirty be

running gun with it set them up give a
little<00:03:10.890> motion<00:03:11.070> you've<00:03:11.940> got<00:03:12.150> your<00:03:12.299> hand<00:03:12.630> that

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
little motion you've got your hand that

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.810 
little motion you've got your hand that
sits<00:03:13.079> up<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.350> little<00:03:13.530> higher<00:03:13.769> she's<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.670> one

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
sits up a little higher she's the one

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.340 
sits up a little higher she's the one
that<00:03:14.850> you're<00:03:15.060> emulating<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.630> calls<00:03:15.870> anyhow

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
that you're emulating the calls anyhow

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.710 
that you're emulating the calls anyhow
but<00:03:17.070> this<00:03:17.310> is<00:03:17.489> gonna<00:03:17.640> be<00:03:17.730> your<00:03:18.090> focal<00:03:18.510> point

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
but this is gonna be your focal point

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.699 
but this is gonna be your focal point
and<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.900> always<00:03:19.019> kind<00:03:19.260> of<00:03:19.350> want<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.530> think

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
about that when you're using decoys you

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.970 
about that when you're using decoys you
know<00:03:21.810> I'm<00:03:21.930> sitting<00:03:22.200> up<00:03:22.350> against<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.739> blind

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
know I'm sitting up against the blind

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.280 
know I'm sitting up against the blind
right<00:03:23.190> here<00:03:23.430> but<00:03:23.910> if<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.269> were<00:03:24.390> gun<00:03:24.630> honey<00:03:24.840> and
