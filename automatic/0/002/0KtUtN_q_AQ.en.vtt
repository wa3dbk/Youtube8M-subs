00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.940 

once<00:01:08.060> you<00:01:08.180> finish<00:01:08.479> trying<00:01:08.659> them<00:01:08.870> out<00:01:08.960> you<00:01:09.920> can

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
once you finish trying them out you can

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.910 
once you finish trying them out you can
get<00:01:10.250> them<00:01:10.490> all<00:01:10.790> sorted<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:11.690> you<00:01:12.619> can<00:01:12.770> figure

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
get them all sorted and you can figure

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.920 
get them all sorted and you can figure
out<00:01:13.040> which<00:01:13.190> ones<00:01:13.460> you<00:01:13.610> want<00:01:13.729> to<00:01:13.850> use<00:01:14.030> first

how<00:02:02.850> he<00:02:03.479> made<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.840> maybe<00:02:04.170> it'll<00:02:04.350> make<00:02:04.530> more

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
how he made it maybe it'll make more

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:13.940

and then you can start sewing these two

00:02:15.930 --> 00:03:21.180 
and then you can start sewing these two
together

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
you really works but I'm gonna do I'm

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.360 
you really works but I'm gonna do I'm
gonna<00:03:52.570> try<00:03:52.870> to<00:03:52.930> do<00:03:53.080> a<00:03:53.110> little<00:03:53.290> bit<00:03:53.440> of<00:03:53.500> both<00:03:53.680> but

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
gonna try to do a little bit of both but

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.440 
gonna try to do a little bit of both but
I<00:03:54.730> came<00:03:56.460> to<00:03:57.460> some<00:03:57.610> trouble<00:03:57.970> because<00:03:58.060> I<00:03:58.240> don't

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
I came to some trouble because I don't

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.980 
I came to some trouble because I don't
find<00:03:59.260> it<00:03:59.470> too<00:03:59.710> puffy<00:04:00.190> so<00:04:00.760> I<00:04:01.060> figured<00:04:01.660> out<00:04:01.780> that

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
find it too puffy so I figured out that

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.520 
find it too puffy so I figured out that
if<00:04:02.170> I<00:04:02.290> saw<00:04:02.620> some<00:04:02.950> another<00:04:03.990> length<00:04:04.990> on<00:04:05.260> there

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
if I saw some another length on there

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.650 
if I saw some another length on there
that<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.070> could<00:04:06.400> make<00:04:06.550> it<00:04:06.700> a<00:04:06.850> little<00:04:07.300> bit<00:04:07.510> more

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
that I could make it a little bit more

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
that I could make it a little bit more
