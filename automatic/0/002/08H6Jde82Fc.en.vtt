00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.650
 hello to all we find ourselves for a 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.790
 video about clothes 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.020
 I decided to divide it in two years 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.730
 this time we will do the shuffleboard 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.200
 part of the upper body and the next 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.780
 I will do one on the lower body 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.660
 in all that is in heels juppÃ© was 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.340
 So, go to your pencils 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.010
 so I made you two models so 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.630
 masculine rather feminine semi-realistic 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.970
 manguin to understand first a little 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.350
 how it works 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.930
 so we'll put that one benefits and 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.830
 we will make clothes over 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.150
 so we'll start with the trick 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.160
 stupid because in fact that's why 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.460
 you can do a lot of clothes 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.540
 is going to make a t-shirt so what is it 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:46.520
 what's going on actually is we're going to see 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:49.710
 the collar that will come to make this round the 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.390
 suddenly and who will come to see this little 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.489
 change of direction at the level of 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.910
 clavicles knowing that must not be forgotten 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.980
 that behind that extends a place the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.859
 that golf is well around the court 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.820
 must not forget it's important then 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.820
 after what happens in my 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.110
 swiss to am really the rest of the quran 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.970
 on that there is not much to 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.460
 say 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.189
 same for the pure here with the little ones 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.540
 folds that will form in general in 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.159
 terminals this after that depends how we get them 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:23.430
 door man like level 2 at level 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.820
 fluff the breastplate and the shoulder 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.090
 clothes that plions secret and hop 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.650
 the same t-shirt here and the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.439
 do not forget you say it often 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.680
 the rounding to mark the volume so 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.329
 here is already a t-shirt and we're going 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.320
 serve as this basis to understand each other 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.820
 how can we do the rest 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.490
 so if I had to do it for example 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.759
 a registered with a hood 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.070
 finally it's the same process I keep 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.159
 really glue I'm doing the hood 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.490
 behind to remember that it makes 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.820
 well the outline I wanted to say with the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.490
 small 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.860
 little gadget and closing that makes 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.760
 all along we see there after he stays 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:12.100
 more than to do the sleeves 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:13.600
 finally to enlarge the starts the 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.010
 arm so what with the little folds at 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.440
 wrist and elbow level 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.380
 So here we have just created a sweatshirt 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.640
 at the station, keeping the t-shirt as a base 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.170
 same thing a game if I'm going to make a 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.480
 shirt 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.200
 imagine chi chi larue the roll up at 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.110
 level of the elbows 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.190
 so I erase that we 'll do it 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.690
 to find at the elbow 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.670
 so the folds obviously there are a lot 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.270
 of rain so rolled up and there 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.580
 what's going on 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.970
 so that 's not there anymore we keep by 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.590
 against the founding firm from the beginning the 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.010
 hood no longer exists but what is 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.560
 is going to happen we'll see a pass so the 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.970
 glue it's all stupid 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.080
 that's it again do not forget 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.410
 it's not the same principle as the 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.190
 hood but we have it more buttons 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:06.010
 here and there we have a shirt 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.180
 so you've seen you just have to 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.500
 understand a little bit how it works 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.570
 level of a tee shirt 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.840
 after we stretch the sleeves 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.190
 find one changes the collar a round neck to 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.870
 v-neck no matter 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.880
 and we can have all kinds of things 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.459
 if we want to see some kind of 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:27.310
 coats and ben it's the same 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:30.540
 simply here we do with 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.540
 pockets on the sides 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.390
 maybe have something the 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.000
 garment may be a little less 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.350
 curved so in the head gomis to do a 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.510
 little more and more little more 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:47.930
 loose hop here is something 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.460
 like that this is really a coat or 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.040
 there is something a bit more 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.240
 long perhaps that the inhabitants col of the 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.390
 kick the collar will not be like that would have 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.650
 obviously the neck he has if it's 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:05.960
 a coat with something a little more 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:08.890
 narrowed there ok with the top like that a 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.910
 little bit like a costume what suddenly 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:16.430
 even have a costumes a base of 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:22.160
 costumes by shortening what 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:24.350
 so here is so it's really 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.200
 things all stupid and we can have to 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.560
 pretty much the same rendering for for the 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.510
 girl herself made simple we'll say 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.000
 with always to be taken into account by 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.360
 example is not seeing that the glitches 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.080
 something a little lighter in 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:46.569
 the suspenders that will come to pass there 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.090
 the chest then the little folds that 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:53.050
 have to train themselves to the changes of 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.189
 direction the level of the hips and then 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.500
 bah So here it is with them 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:59.439
 why not small folds in all the 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.909
 chest and we have some sort of longshoremen 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:02.770
 that's a stupid thing 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:05.650
 so same principle as for the 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.270
 male character we want to change on 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.879
 can do things a little bit of 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.090
 sleeves a little longer so with the 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:15.849
 folds at the level of the change of 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.060
 direction between the chest and 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.949
 shoulder 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:25.650
 and after this you can have fun 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:27.600
 grow them up the sleeves the 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.100
 shrink the fold finally here 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.009
 you saw that it's true you have to 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.000
 really created the basic character and 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:33.900
 it works with all the styles it's at 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.930
 to say that I made you little ones 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:43.710
 a little more cartoon 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:46.669
 it's the same principle up there is no trick 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.750
 very very complicated we pass the shot 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.139
 well there they do not forget even 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:56.370
 forget that the rounded off 1 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:06:00.030
 here is to redo him a tweet and it's 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:03.900
 the same principle the folds down the 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:06.419
 folds at the shoulders and after you 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.389
 dress it up as you want you go 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.770
 see you type on the internet 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:13.560
 clothes and who inspired you 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.639
 clothes and there's more to it than 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.270
 it's the same we wanted to make a 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:21.720
 stuff all open a little tee shirt without 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.729
 forget one never forget the 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.830
 rounded to a high level of members 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:27.830
 to have something in volume and 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.889
 people just what 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:35.430
 and after that roll for the rest 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.889
 what I hope this little trick 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.490
 skyline clothes you will have liked 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:40.889
 do not hesitate to tell me in comment 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.500
 what you want to see more I 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.820
 surely had to forget about it, I tell you 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.250
 see you soon for a new video 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.760
 by then do you wear well and at very 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.760
 soon ball
