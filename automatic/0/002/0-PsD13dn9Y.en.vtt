00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
know after you're done one element you

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.289 
know after you're done one element you
can<00:01:13.290> move<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:14.040> next<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.700> can<00:01:14.880> do<00:01:15.030> light

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
can move on to next you can do light

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.740 
can move on to next you can do light
after<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.350> have<00:01:16.590> both<00:01:17.240> but<00:01:18.240> if<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.479> if

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
after so you can have both but if you if

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.539 
after so you can have both but if you if
you're<00:01:18.930> just<00:01:19.200> kind<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.530> playing<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.369> off

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
you're just kind of playing on and off

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.870 
you're just kind of playing on and off
and<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:22.080> enough<00:01:22.650> magic<00:01:23.189> for

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
and you just have just enough magic for

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.990 
and you just have just enough magic for
one<00:01:23.960> element<00:01:24.960> then<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:26.009> should<00:01:26.189> just<00:01:26.400> pour<00:01:26.820> it

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
one element then you should just pour it

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.450 
one element then you should just pour it
into<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.630> side<00:01:27.960> but<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.619> eventually<00:01:29.009> I

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
into one side but you can eventually I

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.450 
into one side but you can eventually I
believe<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:31.049> from<00:01:31.710> what<00:01:31.860> from<00:01:32.250> what<00:01:32.400> I

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
believe you can from what from what I

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.130 
believe you can from what from what I
understand<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.540> both<00:01:33.720> get<00:01:33.869> both

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
understand is you can both get both

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.100 
understand is you can both get both
elements<00:01:34.799> but<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.850> have<00:01:36.030> have<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.930> have

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
elements but you just have have to have

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.950 
elements but you just have have to have
enough<00:01:37.409> magic<00:01:37.710> for<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.250> eggs<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:39.210> hatch<00:01:39.450> into

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
enough magic for the eggs the hatch into

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.560 
enough magic for the eggs the hatch into
the<00:01:40.049> habitat<00:01:40.470> if<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.100> egg<00:01:41.430> right<00:01:42.329> in
