00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.460 
for the crafting wasn't really done that
well<00:00:26.460> basically<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.390> just<00:00:27.420> put<00:00:27.810> dirt<00:00:28.019> in<00:00:28.140> here

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
well basically you just put dirt in here

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
house or something like look at that

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.730 
house or something like look at that
that's<00:01:09.270> that's<00:01:09.600> awesome<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.470> still

then<00:03:02.130> as<00:03:02.280> well<00:03:02.459> just<00:03:02.700> make<00:03:02.910> mini<00:03:03.209> redstone

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
then as well just make mini redstone

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.569 
then as well just make mini redstone
torches<00:03:04.079> and<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.500> could<00:03:05.040> probably<00:03:05.220> go<00:03:05.430> and

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
torches and I could probably go and

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.660 
torches and I could probably go and
connect<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.120> all<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.540> way<00:03:06.570> over<00:03:06.810> there

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670

there<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:12.329> can<00:03:12.480> hide<00:03:12.660> redstone<00:03:13.230> like<00:03:13.470> all<00:03:13.680> of

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
there you can hide redstone like all of

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.490 
there you can hide redstone like all of
the<00:03:14.100> way<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:15.090> it's<00:03:15.329> completely<00:03:15.510> hidden<00:03:16.320> you

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
the way so it's completely hidden you

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.720 
the way so it's completely hidden you
cannot<00:03:16.799> see<00:03:17.070> this<00:03:17.250> redstone<00:03:17.579> at<00:03:17.940> all<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:19.410> is

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
Oh see there we go that's the next block

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.960 
Oh see there we go that's the next block
right<00:03:42.540> there<00:03:42.569> so<00:03:43.530> is<00:03:43.980> that<00:03:44.069> still<00:03:44.489> powered<00:03:44.850> I

so<00:03:58.660> it<00:03:58.780> just<00:03:58.960> keeps<00:03:59.200> going<00:03:59.410> I<00:04:01.560> put<00:04:02.560> it<00:04:02.650> the

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
so it just keeps going I put it the

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.370 
so it just keeps going I put it the
wrong<00:04:02.800> way<00:04:02.860> and<00:04:03.450> there<00:04:04.450> we<00:04:04.570> go<00:04:04.660> there<00:04:05.170> we<00:04:05.200> go

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
wrong way and there we go there we go

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.630 
wrong way and there we go there we go
perfect<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:05.920> then<00:04:06.400> I<00:04:06.760> could<00:04:08.100> do<00:04:09.100> that<00:04:09.130> and

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
perfect and then I could do that and

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.970 
perfect and then I could do that and
look<00:04:09.940> it<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.540> such<00:04:10.930> tiny<00:04:11.290> red<00:04:11.560> stone<00:04:11.800> makes

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
look it that such tiny red stone makes

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.340 
look it that such tiny red stone makes
this<00:04:12.130> piston<00:04:12.580> work<00:04:12.820> so<00:04:13.540> that<00:04:13.780> is<00:04:14.020> fascinating

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
this piston work so that is fascinating

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.870 
this piston work so that is fascinating
mini<00:04:15.130> tiny<00:04:15.580> red<00:04:16.030> stone<00:04:16.269> canes<00:04:16.600> see<00:04:17.019> that<00:04:17.230> well

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
mini tiny red stone canes see that well

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.490 
mini tiny red stone canes see that well
so<00:04:18.880> it's<00:04:19.060> perfectly<00:04:19.630> good<00:04:19.720> for<00:04:20.049> hiding<00:04:20.200> stuff

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
so it's perfectly good for hiding stuff

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.740 
so it's perfectly good for hiding stuff
hiding<00:04:20.830> TT<00:04:21.220> to<00:04:21.370> mess<00:04:22.030> with<00:04:22.210> your<00:04:22.330> friends<00:04:22.660> and

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
hiding TT to mess with your friends and

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.780 
hiding TT to mess with your friends and
 so<00:04:23.320> that<00:04:23.920> works<00:04:24.130> pretty<00:04:24.310> well<00:04:24.460> i<00:04:24.610> think

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
 so that works pretty well i think

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.460 
 so that works pretty well i think
that's<00:04:25.030> that's<00:04:25.300> awesome<00:04:25.870> that's<00:04:25.990> really<00:04:26.110> cool

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
that's that's awesome that's really cool

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.990 
that's that's awesome that's really cool
you<00:04:26.650> can<00:04:26.800> use<00:04:26.920> redstone<00:04:27.220> like<00:04:27.460> that<00:04:27.610> just<00:04:27.820> make

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
you can use redstone like that just make

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.100 
you can use redstone like that just make
it<00:04:28.030> insanely<00:04:28.960> tiny<00:04:29.490> now<00:04:30.750> things<00:04:31.750> that<00:04:31.930> you're

even do it in this well if you were to

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:49.980 
even do it in this well if you were to
take<00:04:42.040> like<00:04:42.310> say<00:04:43.290> a<00:04:46.530> water<00:04:47.530> block<00:04:48.990> that

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
take like say a water block that

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.720 
take like say a water block that
wouldn't<00:04:50.290> really<00:04:50.350> work<00:04:50.590> that<00:04:50.770> well<00:04:50.919> you<00:04:51.610> can

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
wouldn't really work that well you can

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.280 
wouldn't really work that well you can
make<00:04:51.880> mini<00:04:52.090> lava<00:04:52.419> but<00:04:52.780> when<00:04:52.930> you<00:04:52.990> take<00:04:53.140> the

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290

make mini lava but when you take the
water<00:04:53.470> block<00:04:53.770> i'm<00:04:53.950> pretty<00:04:54.100> sure<00:04:54.250> it<00:04:54.340> doesn't

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
water block i'm pretty sure it doesn't

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.580 
water block i'm pretty sure it doesn't
work<00:04:54.730> so<00:04:55.419> look<00:04:55.600> at<00:04:55.690> that<00:04:55.780> many<00:04:56.020> tiny<00:04:56.290> lava
