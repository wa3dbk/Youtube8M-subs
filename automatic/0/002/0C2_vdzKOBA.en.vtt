00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.170 

hey<00:00:06.410> I'm<00:00:06.590> Rondo<00:00:07.010> by<00:00:07.340> geeks<00:00:07.640> and<00:00:07.880> we're<00:00:08.060> looking

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.180 
hey I'm Rondo by geeks and we're looking

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.299 
hey I'm Rondo by geeks and we're looking
right<00:00:08.600> here<00:00:08.840> at<00:00:09.020> the<00:00:09.200> new<00:00:09.350> toshiba<00:00:09.590> 7-inch

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
right here at the new toshiba 7-inch

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.160 
right here at the new toshiba 7-inch
prototype<00:00:10.820> that<00:00:10.850> we<00:00:11.180> just<00:00:11.389> got<00:00:11.570> announced<00:00:11.809> at

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
prototype that we just got announced at

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.070 
prototype that we just got announced at
the<00:00:12.820> microsoft<00:00:13.820> press<00:00:14.030> event<00:00:14.360> and<00:00:14.570> it's

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
the microsoft press event and it's

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.440 
the microsoft press event and it's
basically<00:00:15.380> i<00:00:15.769> would<00:00:16.040> guess<00:00:16.220> that<00:00:16.250> a<00:00:16.700> Bay<00:00:17.180> Trail

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
basically i would guess that a Bay Trail

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.080 
basically i would guess that a Bay Trail
based<00:00:17.720> betrayal<00:00:18.410> entry<00:00:18.740> based<00:00:18.950> tablet<00:00:19.939> what

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
based betrayal entry based tablet what

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.760 
based betrayal entry based tablet what
we<00:00:20.180> have<00:00:20.360> right<00:00:20.480> here<00:00:20.540> so<00:00:20.960> the<00:00:21.170> whole<00:00:21.349> thing<00:00:21.380> is

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
we have right here so the whole thing is

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.330 
we have right here so the whole thing is
a<00:00:22.160> 7<00:00:22.789> inch<00:00:22.880> device<00:00:23.480> which<00:00:23.930> has<00:00:24.350> a<00:00:24.710> screen<00:00:25.279> that

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
a 7 inch device which has a screen that

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.710 
a 7 inch device which has a screen that
looks<00:00:25.490> like<00:00:25.850> 1024<00:00:26.779> x<00:00:26.960> 600<00:00:27.710> because<00:00:28.640> it<00:00:29.119> is<00:00:29.300> a<00:00:29.330> TN

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
looks like 1024 x 600 because it is a TN

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.240 
looks like 1024 x 600 because it is a TN
panel<00:00:29.750> so<00:00:30.199> they're<00:00:30.350> definitely<00:00:30.560> gunning<00:00:31.010> for

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
panel so they're definitely gunning for

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.040 
panel so they're definitely gunning for
a<00:00:31.279> super<00:00:31.789> low<00:00:31.910> price<00:00:32.150> point<00:00:32.180> right<00:00:32.599> there<00:00:32.629> and

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
a super low price point right there and

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.259 
a super low price point right there and
that<00:00:33.080> should<00:00:33.860> be<00:00:34.010> competitive<00:00:34.670> with<00:00:34.879> pretty

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:35.269 
that should be competitive with pretty

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.570 
that should be competitive with pretty
much<00:00:35.360> every<00:00:35.840> other<00:00:35.980> 7-inch<00:00:36.980> tablet<00:00:37.370> coming

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580 
much every other 7-inch tablet coming

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.569 
much every other 7-inch tablet coming
out<00:00:37.850> from<00:00:38.630> manufacturers<00:00:39.530> using<00:00:39.770> Android<00:00:40.340> and

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
out from manufacturers using Android and

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.490 
out from manufacturers using Android and
that's<00:00:40.820> just<00:00:41.180> another<00:00:41.809> example<00:00:41.989> how

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
that's just another example how

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.990 
that's just another example how
Microsoft<00:00:43.040> is<00:00:43.160> trying<00:00:43.460> to<00:00:43.550> push<00:00:43.730> down<00:00:43.760> prices

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
Microsoft is trying to push down prices

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.440 
Microsoft is trying to push down prices
on<00:00:44.750> these<00:00:45.440> super<00:00:46.280> low-end<00:00:46.489> devices<00:00:47.000> with

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
on these super low-end devices with

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.110 
on these super low-end devices with
Windows<00:00:47.840> 8.1<00:00:48.079> right<00:00:48.680> here<00:00:48.920> let's<00:00:49.910> take<00:00:50.059> a

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
Windows 8.1 right here let's take a

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.180 
Windows 8.1 right here let's take a
quick<00:00:50.329> look<00:00:50.360> around<00:00:50.629> and<00:00:51.200> we're<00:00:51.770> not<00:00:51.950> allowed

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
quick look around and we're not allowed

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.930 
quick look around and we're not allowed
to<00:00:52.370> touch<00:00:52.579> it<00:00:52.640> but<00:00:53.570> here<00:00:54.050> we<00:00:54.290> have<00:00:54.500> a<00:00:54.980> micro<00:00:55.910> SD

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
to touch it but here we have a micro SD

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.250 
to touch it but here we have a micro SD
card<00:00:56.480> slot<00:00:56.540> and<00:00:57.020> a<00:00:57.850> typical<00:00:58.850> setup<00:00:59.450> of<00:00:59.690> port<00:01:00.020> so

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
card slot and a typical setup of port so

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.470 
card slot and a typical setup of port so
that's<00:01:00.440> probably<00:01:00.739> a<00:01:01.160> micro<00:01:01.820> USB<00:01:02.180> port<00:01:02.210> right

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
that's probably a micro USB port right

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.680 
that's probably a micro USB port right
there<00:01:02.629> a<00:01:03.020> volume<00:01:03.590> rocker<00:01:03.829> a<00:01:04.250> headset<00:01:05.149> jack<00:01:05.420> and

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
there a volume rocker a headset jack and

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.770 
there a volume rocker a headset jack and
maybe<00:01:06.590> even<00:01:06.890> a<00:01:07.310> that's<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:08.030> headset<00:01:08.420> jack<00:01:08.570> right

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
maybe even a that's a headset jack right

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.380 
maybe even a that's a headset jack right
there<00:01:09.610> take<00:01:10.610> a<00:01:10.640> look<00:01:10.789> at<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.030> bottom<00:01:11.360> right

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
there take a look at the bottom right

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.760 
there take a look at the bottom right
there<00:01:12.429> that<00:01:13.429> seems<00:01:13.759> to<00:01:13.880> be<00:01:14.030> speaker<00:01:14.770> pretty

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
there that seems to be speaker pretty

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.340 
there that seems to be speaker pretty
small<00:01:16.190> by<00:01:16.399> the<00:01:16.459> bezels<00:01:17.030> for<00:01:17.209> device<00:01:17.509> at<00:01:17.750> seven

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
small by the bezels for device at seven

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.139 
small by the bezels for device at seven
inches<00:01:18.619> right<00:01:18.800> there<00:01:19.390> thickness<00:01:20.390> seems<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.200> be

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
inches right there thickness seems to be

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.270 
inches right there thickness seems to be
just<00:01:23.149> over<00:01:23.599> one<00:01:24.020> centimeter<00:01:24.619> I<00:01:24.709> would<00:01:24.890> guess<00:01:25.069> I

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
just over one centimeter I would guess I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.010 
just over one centimeter I would guess I
have<00:01:25.429> a<00:01:25.459> silver<00:01:25.759> plastic<00:01:26.119> backing<00:01:26.539> on<00:01:26.780> there

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
have a silver plastic backing on there

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.600 
have a silver plastic backing on there
with<00:01:27.709> a<00:01:27.950> structure<00:01:28.700> on<00:01:28.910> it<00:01:30.190> just<00:01:31.190> let<00:01:31.399> me<00:01:31.459> move

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
with a structure on it just let me move

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.150 
with a structure on it just let me move
to<00:01:31.910> the<00:01:32.030> right<00:01:32.179> side<00:01:32.479> for<00:01:32.869> a<00:01:32.899> second<00:01:33.319> we<00:01:34.069> have

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
to the right side for a second we have

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.040 
to the right side for a second we have
the<00:01:34.250> power<00:01:34.459> button<00:01:34.670> on<00:01:34.849> the<00:01:34.910> side<00:01:35.179> windows

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
the power button on the side windows

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.070 
the power button on the side windows
button<00:01:36.259> seems<00:01:36.470> to<00:01:36.619> be<00:01:36.740> on<00:01:36.830> top<00:01:37.039> somewhere

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
button seems to be on top somewhere

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.300 
button seems to be on top somewhere
pretty<00:01:39.080> much<00:01:39.200> nothing<00:01:39.349> else<00:01:39.679> on<00:01:39.830> that<00:01:39.860> thing

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
pretty much nothing else on that thing

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.940 
pretty much nothing else on that thing
so<00:01:40.670> it's<00:01:41.569> definitely<00:01:41.990> a<00:01:42.050> TN<00:01:42.319> panel<00:01:42.349> not<00:01:42.830> the

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
so it's definitely a TN panel not the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.710 
so it's definitely a TN panel not the
most<00:01:43.130> good-looking<00:01:43.610> screen<00:01:44.209> right<00:01:44.390> there<00:01:44.420> but

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
most good-looking screen right there but

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.109 
most good-looking screen right there but
it<00:01:44.810> seems<00:01:45.050> to<00:01:45.170> be<00:01:45.289> decently<00:01:45.709> bright<00:01:46.009> if<00:01:46.940> you're

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
it seems to be decently bright if you're

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.580 
it seems to be decently bright if you're
going<00:01:47.390> down<00:01:47.509> to<00:01:47.720> those<00:01:47.840> price<00:01:48.140> points<00:01:48.170> you

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
going down to those price points you

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.770 
going down to those price points you
probably<00:01:48.920> have<00:01:49.099> to<00:01:49.250> do<00:01:49.610> some<00:01:49.640> trade-offs<00:01:50.060> and

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
probably have to do some trade-offs and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.080 
probably have to do some trade-offs and
it's<00:01:51.020> obviously<00:01:51.619> using<00:01:51.890> one<00:01:52.160> of<00:01:52.190> those<00:01:52.399> cheap

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
it's obviously using one of those cheap

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.270 
it's obviously using one of those cheap
