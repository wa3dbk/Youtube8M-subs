the station's humor is water-cooler
humor<00:02:34.950> it's<00:02:35.100> it's<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.610> specific<00:02:36.269> topic<00:02:36.480> that

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
humor it's it's a specific topic that

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
you take with you all day long

so<00:02:38.850> we<00:02:38.970> like<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.150> see<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.540> merchandising<00:02:40.170> do

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
so we like to see the merchandising do

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.900 
so we like to see the merchandising do
the<00:02:40.410> same<00:02:40.590> thing<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.100> I<00:02:41.400> think<00:02:41.519> we've<00:02:41.790> hit

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
the same thing and I think we've hit

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.449 
the same thing and I think we've hit
that<00:02:41.970> how<00:02:42.600> do<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.989> make<00:02:43.739> yourself<00:02:43.950> different

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
that how do you make yourself different

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.509 
that how do you make yourself different
I<00:02:45.200> don't<00:02:46.200> think<00:02:46.650> there's<00:02:46.799> a<00:02:46.890> lot<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.069> star

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
I don't think there's a lot of star

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.880 
I don't think there's a lot of star
mentality<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:49.200> makes<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.680> difference

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
mentality and that makes the difference

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.940 
mentality and that makes the difference
when<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.790> average<00:02:51.180> guy<00:02:51.540> in<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.840> street<00:02:52.140> can
