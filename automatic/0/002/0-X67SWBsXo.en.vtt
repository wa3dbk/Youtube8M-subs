00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
oval but a little bit different because

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.800

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
it has a little bit it's sort of smaller

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.729 
it has a little bit it's sort of smaller
on<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.260> top<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.759> oval<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.390> just<00:00:33.660> same<00:00:34.440> as

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
on the top and the oval is just same as

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.100 
on the top and the oval is just same as
the<00:00:35.370> bottom<00:00:36.170> and<00:00:37.760> what<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.790> always<00:00:39.270> say<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.870> I

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
the bottom and what I always say is I

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.410 
the bottom and what I always say is I
just<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.680> just<00:00:41.489> um

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
just I just um

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.889 
just I just um
draw<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.440> light<00:00:44.100> until<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.760> can<00:00:45.090> get<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.329> right

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.319 

if<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:48.960> draw<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.469> hard<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:50.239> then<00:00:51.239> you

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
if you draw it hard and then then you

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.410 
if you draw it hard and then then you
might<00:00:51.510> not<00:00:51.719> be<00:00:52.079> able<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.590> erase<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.420> very

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
might not be able to erase it very

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.060 
might not be able to erase it very
easily<00:00:56.690> they<00:00:57.690> try<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.350> make<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.710> top<00:00:59.010> very

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
easily they try to make the top very

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.480 
easily they try to make the top very
small<00:01:02.070> like<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:06.200> your<00:01:07.200> egg<00:01:07.470> does<00:01:07.799> not<00:01:08.130> have

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
small like that your egg does not have

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.679 
small like that your egg does not have
to<00:01:08.729> be<00:01:08.880> perfect<00:01:10.670> because<00:01:11.670> all<00:01:12.060> eggs<00:01:12.420> are

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
to be perfect because all eggs are

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:32.550 
to be perfect because all eggs are
different

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.000 

so<00:01:33.190> now<00:01:33.610> I'm<00:01:33.670> just<00:01:33.940> continuing<00:01:34.390> continuing<00:01:35.320> to

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
so now I'm just continuing continuing to

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:44.999 
so now I'm just continuing continuing to
make<00:01:36.159> my<00:01:36.520> egg<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.840> don't<00:01:43.990> have<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.470> make<00:01:44.650> a<00:01:44.680> egg

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
make my egg you don't have to make a egg

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.219 
make my egg you don't have to make a egg
if<00:01:45.250> you<00:01:45.369> don't<00:01:45.580> want<00:01:45.850> to<00:01:46.119> you<00:01:46.750> could<00:01:46.900> just

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
if you don't want to you could just

00:01:47.229 --> 00:02:02.900 
if you don't want to you could just
start<00:01:48.040> drawing<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.759> bunny

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.160

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
this way but I like to just make a

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.300 
this way but I like to just make a
little<00:02:51.970> bit<00:02:52.390> of<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.850> upsetting<00:02:55.390> you

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.760 
and then I just make a little line like
that<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:04.540> then<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:04.750> just<00:03:04.840> fill<00:03:05.230> in<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.470> eyes

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770

like<00:03:10.350> I'm<00:03:11.350> just<00:03:11.680> going<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.180> make<00:03:13.180> this<00:03:13.690> aisle<00:03:14.080> a

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
like I'm just going to make this aisle a

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.530 
like I'm just going to make this aisle a
little<00:03:14.650> bit<00:03:14.830> bigger<00:03:15.190> because<00:03:15.610> I<00:03:16.000> sort<00:03:16.420> of

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
little bit bigger because I sort of

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:25.949 
little bit bigger because I sort of
messed<00:03:16.810> up<00:03:17.050> on<00:03:17.200> that<00:03:17.230> one<00:03:17.700> but<00:03:18.700> it's<00:03:18.880> okay

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.559 

for<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.709> nose<00:03:27.010> I'm<00:03:27.489> just<00:03:27.819> going<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.120> make<00:03:28.540> a

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
for the nose I'm just going to make a

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.160 
for the nose I'm just going to make a
little<00:03:29.310> shape<00:03:30.310> up<00:03:30.609> sort<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.239> like<00:03:31.540> a<00:03:31.569> triangle

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
little shape up sort of like a triangle

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:48.960 
little shape up sort of like a triangle
around<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:37.510> out<00:03:37.659> one<00:03:37.930> though

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:04:01.790 

and<00:03:49.510> then<00:03:49.660> just<00:03:49.990> fill<00:03:50.320> it<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:51.030> lick<00:03:52.030> that

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.480 

and<00:04:02.340> then<00:04:02.550> I'm<00:04:02.670> just<00:04:02.730> going<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:04.100> draw<00:04:05.100> a<00:04:05.130> little

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490
