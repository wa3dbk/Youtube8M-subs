2014 three waves freeways text strings
as<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.640> know<00:00:53.789> I've<00:00:54.030> used<00:00:54.210> these<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.660> last

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
as you know I've used these for the last

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.990 
as you know I've used these for the last
three<00:00:55.079> four<00:00:55.320> years<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.980> last<00:00:56.190> two<00:00:56.489> years<00:00:56.520> they

three four years the last two years they

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.590 
three four years the last two years they
have<00:00:57.210> gone<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> tribe<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.969> system<00:00:59.969> which

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
have gone with a tribe in system which

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.959 
have gone with a tribe in system which
is<00:01:00.719> here<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.620> last<00:01:01.829> year<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.699> base<00:01:02.850> of

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
is here but last year the the base of

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.549 
is here but last year the the base of
the<00:01:03.030> tri<00:01:03.210> fin<00:01:03.480> system<00:01:03.840> was<00:01:03.960> designed<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.350> fit

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
the tri fin system was designed to fit

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.410 
the tri fin system was designed to fit
the<00:01:04.589> existing<00:01:05.129> shape<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.519> board<00:01:05.729> for<00:01:06.270> this

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the existing shape of the board for this

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.420 
the existing shape of the board for this
year<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.990> designed<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.350> board<00:01:07.650> or<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.250> tri

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
year that designed the board or in a tri

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.070 
year that designed the board or in a tri
fin<00:01:08.700> system<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.240> there's<00:01:09.510> been<00:01:09.630> some<00:01:09.780> subtle

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
fin system and there's been some subtle

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.080 
fin system and there's been some subtle
changes<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.950> width<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.460> shoulder<00:01:11.909> width

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
changes in in width and shoulder width

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.510 
changes in in width and shoulder width
and<00:01:12.299> rocker<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:13.200> make<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.470> border<00:01:14.010> basically

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
and rocker to make this border basically

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.240 
and rocker to make this border basically
sale<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:15.150> much<00:01:15.390> better<00:01:16.049> easier<00:01:16.619> faster<00:01:16.950> and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
sale that much better easier faster and

sale that much better easier faster and
earlier<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.780> here<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.200> my<00:01:19.380> 86<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.460> my

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
earlier so here is my 86 this is my

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.210 
earlier so here is my 86 this is my

eighty six kilos absolutely superb or

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.469 
eighty six kilos absolutely superb or
just<00:01:31.049> love<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.619> death<00:01:31.670> but<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:33.180> big

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
just love it to death but it's big

brother<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.140> 96<00:01:34.740> free<00:01:35.340> wavetek<00:01:35.759> stream

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
brother the 96 free wavetek stream

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.469 
brother the 96 free wavetek stream
exactly<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> same<00:01:37.799> thing<00:01:38.130> what's<00:01:39.090> good<00:01:39.420> about

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
exactly the same thing what's good about

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.350 
exactly the same thing what's good about
the<00:01:39.659> text<00:01:39.900> stream<00:01:40.140> finish<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.490> makes<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.850> super

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
the text stream finish it makes it super

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.600 
the text stream finish it makes it super
stiff<00:01:42.720> therefore<00:01:43.470> super<00:01:44.009> sharp<00:01:44.340> and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
stiff therefore super sharp and

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.569 
stiff therefore super sharp and
therefore<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.750> much<00:01:45.990> lighter<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.590> planes

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
therefore that much lighter and planes

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.889 
therefore that much lighter and planes
that<00:01:47.729> much<00:01:48.000> earlier<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.509> actually<00:01:48.750> have

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
that much earlier we actually have

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.539 
that much earlier we actually have
tested<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.259> against<00:01:49.619> team<00:01:49.799> additions<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
tested it against team additions and the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.580 
tested it against team additions and the
wood<00:01:51.299> sandwich<00:01:51.689> construction<00:01:51.930> boards<00:01:52.439> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
wood sandwich construction boards and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.280 
wood sandwich construction boards and
they<00:01:52.890> do<00:01:52.950> plane<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.610> much<00:01:53.729> quicker<00:01:54.290> so

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
they do plane that much quicker so

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.289 
they do plane that much quicker so
that's<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.829> 96<00:01:56.340> which<00:01:56.520> i'll<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.790> using<00:01:56.969> but

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
that's the 96 which i'll be using but

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.160 
that's the 96 which i'll be using but
new<00:01:57.509> for<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.930> year<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:59.630> have<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.780> little<00:02:00.990> bad
