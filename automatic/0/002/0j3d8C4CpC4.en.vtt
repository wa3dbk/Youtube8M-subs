okay<00:00:00.900> so<00:00:00.960> I'm<00:00:01.350> stopping<00:00:01.650> every<00:00:02.100> now<00:00:02.129> and<00:00:02.460> then

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:02.870 
okay so I'm stopping every now and then

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.570 
okay so I'm stopping every now and then
shaking<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:03.959> bottle

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:04.580 
shaking the bottle

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.150 
shaking the bottle
we<00:00:05.580> are<00:00:05.870> upside<00:00:06.870> down<00:00:07.109> but<00:00:07.379> what<00:00:07.740> we<00:00:07.859> really

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
we are upside down but what we really

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:19.009 
we are upside down but what we really
care<00:00:08.340> about<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.610> being<00:00:08.730> in<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.179> blue

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:19.019 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.390 

when<00:00:19.230> you're<00:00:19.349> filling<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.830> system<00:00:20.279> you

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
when you're filling the system you

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.630 
when you're filling the system you
should<00:00:20.429> be<00:00:20.669> agitating<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.449> bottle<00:00:22.640> making

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
should be agitating the bottle making

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.060 
should be agitating the bottle making
sure<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.950 

fluids<00:00:30.789> inside<00:00:31.179> the<00:00:31.300> bottle<00:00:31.660> of<00:00:31.750> being

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
fluids inside the bottle of being

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.760 
fluids inside the bottle of being
actually<00:00:32.379> making<00:00:32.680> it<00:00:32.800> into<00:00:33.100> them

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
actually making it into them

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.119 
actually making it into them
into<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.840> low<00:00:37.250> pressure<00:00:38.250> side<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
into the low pressure side and

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.750 
into the low pressure side and
recharging

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
recharging

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.490 
recharging
this<00:00:42.820> is<00:00:42.969> significantly<00:00:43.660> higher<00:00:43.960> than<00:00:43.989> it<00:00:44.350> was

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
this is significantly higher than it was

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.279 
this is significantly higher than it was
when<00:00:44.679> I<00:00:44.739> started<00:00:45.309> so<00:00:45.579> my<00:00:46.570> cool<00:00:46.899> air<00:00:47.109> is

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
when I started so my cool air is

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:48.779 
when I started so my cool air is
possibly<00:00:47.710> going<00:00:47.859> to<00:00:47.920> become<00:00:48.219> cold<00:00:48.519> at<00:00:48.699> this

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
possibly going to become cold at this

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.369 
possibly going to become cold at this
point<00:00:49.120> and

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:54.930 

have<00:00:53.559> much<00:00:53.739> left<00:00:54.010> in<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.219> jar<00:00:54.430> so<00:00:54.730> I'm<00:00:54.820> going

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
have much left in the jar so I'm going

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:08.100 
have much left in the jar so I'm going
to<00:00:55.000> finish<00:00:55.210> it<00:00:55.390> off

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.420

we are done under the hood go back in

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.630 
we are done under the hood go back in
yes<00:01:33.650> that<00:01:34.250> is<00:01:34.430> actually<00:01:34.909> cold

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
yes that is actually cold

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.820
