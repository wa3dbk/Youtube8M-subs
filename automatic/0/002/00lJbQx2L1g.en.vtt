00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
is still very very impressive and this

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.810 
is still very very impressive and this
is<00:01:36.750> where<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> end<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> HUD<00:01:37.950> actually<00:01:38.490> is

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
is where the end of the HUD actually is

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.670 
is where the end of the HUD actually is
and<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:40.049> let's<00:01:40.920> head<00:01:41.220> back<00:01:41.250> real<00:01:41.820> quick<00:01:42.530> so<00:01:43.530> of

course if you did have the emulator the
ROM<00:01:45.899> came<00:01:46.229> with<00:01:46.500> you'd<00:01:47.159> be<00:01:47.369> able<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.840> upload

I'm<00:01:51.149> not<00:01:51.540> sure<00:01:51.840> if<00:01:51.990> there's<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.259> way<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.530> do<00:01:52.799> that

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
I'm not sure if there's a way to do that

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.190 
I'm not sure if there's a way to do that
to<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:53.640> able<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.909> save<00:01:54.180> your<00:01:54.420> scores<00:01:54.780> on

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
scoring works up in the top left there

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.820

probably isn't the one you're looking
for<00:02:28.580> but<00:02:29.140> this<00:02:30.140> hack<00:02:30.380> in<00:02:30.560> itself<00:02:30.860> is<00:02:31.099> a<00:02:31.130> very

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
for but this hack in itself is a very

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.509 
for but this hack in itself is a very
impressive<00:02:32.030> thing<00:02:32.599> because<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.890> opens<00:02:34.280> up<00:02:34.430> a

impressive thing because it opens up a
lot<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.700> possibilities<00:02:35.000> in<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.870> future

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
lot of possibilities in the future

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.710 
lot of possibilities in the future
especially<00:02:36.500> with<00:02:37.099> an<00:02:37.280> with<00:02:37.880> an<00:02:38.000> emulator<00:02:38.540> that

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
especially with an with an emulator that

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.039 
especially with an with an emulator that
allows<00:02:39.230> for<00:02:39.709> stuff<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.010> be<00:02:40.250> uploaded<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.940> a

allows for stuff to be uploaded to a

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.190 
allows for stuff to be uploaded to a
online<00:02:42.049> thing<00:02:42.500> this<00:02:43.069> new<00:02:43.640> sonic<00:02:44.420> channel<00:02:44.989> has

online thing this new sonic channel has

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.199 
online thing this new sonic channel has
very<00:02:45.860> many<00:02:46.160> possibilities<00:02:46.910> in<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.180> future

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
very many possibilities in the future

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.580 
very many possibilities in the future
which<00:02:48.110> I'll<00:02:48.530> definitely<00:02:49.190> be<00:02:49.370> looking<00:02:49.489> out<00:02:49.790> for

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
which I'll definitely be looking out for

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.420 
which I'll definitely be looking out for
now<00:02:51.590> 39<00:02:52.430> seconds<00:02:52.940> not<00:02:53.780> bad<00:02:54.010> I've<00:02:55.010> done<00:02:55.280> it

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
now 39 seconds not bad I've done it

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.680 
now 39 seconds not bad I've done it
quicker<00:02:55.640> I'm<00:02:55.879> sure<00:02:56.150> I'm<00:02:56.239> sure

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
quicker I'm sure I'm sure

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.090 
quicker I'm sure I'm sure
but<00:02:57.160> that<00:02:58.160> wasn't<00:02:58.910> too<00:02:59.060> bad<00:02:59.090> so<00:02:59.650> at<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.829> end<00:03:00.950> of

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
but that wasn't too bad so at the end of

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.720 
but that wasn't too bad so at the end of
every<00:03:01.400> stage<00:03:01.730> we<00:03:02.630> get<00:03:02.870> this<00:03:03.079> new<00:03:03.410> little<00:03:04.220> menu

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
every stage we get this new little menu

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.430 
every stage we get this new little menu
come<00:03:05.060> up<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:05.420> it<00:03:05.540> tells<00:03:05.750> us<00:03:05.959> that<00:03:05.989> we've<00:03:06.230> got

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
come up and it tells us that we've got

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.910 
come up and it tells us that we've got
new<00:03:06.680> records<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.639> this<00:03:07.910> would<00:03:08.150> be<00:03:08.859> this<00:03:09.859> would

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
new records and this would be this would

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.870 
new records and this would be this would
be<00:03:10.430> what<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:11.410> online<00:03:12.410> capabilities<00:03:13.220> does<00:03:13.549> it

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
be what the online capabilities does it

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.180 
be what the online capabilities does it
records<00:03:14.660> what<00:03:14.810> you've<00:03:14.959> got<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:15.500> be<00:03:15.829> able<00:03:16.040> to

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
the button and have a look

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.860 
the button and have a look
top<00:03:22.960> left<00:03:23.230> there<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:25.030> but<00:03:25.300> that's<00:03:25.480> not<00:03:25.720> all

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
top left there so but that's not all

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.900 
top left there so but that's not all
that<00:03:26.080> we<00:03:26.200> have<00:03:26.440> over<00:03:26.950> here<00:03:27.220> in<00:03:27.490> the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
that we have over here in the

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.390 
that we have over here in the
miscellaneous<00:03:28.510> section<00:03:28.620> we<00:03:29.620> have<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:30.100> full

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
miscellaneous section we have the full

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.390 
miscellaneous section we have the full
game<00:03:30.960> which<00:03:31.960> allows<00:03:32.350> us<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.740> play<00:03:32.950> through<00:03:33.280> the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
game which allows us to play through the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.030 
game which allows us to play through the
entire<00:03:33.430> game<00:03:34.020> keeping<00:03:35.020> score<00:03:35.410> of<00:03:35.590> everything

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
entire game keeping score of everything

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.790 
entire game keeping score of everything
then<00:03:36.760> we<00:03:37.120> have<00:03:37.270> a<00:03:37.300> boss<00:03:37.600> attack<00:03:37.960> which<00:03:38.620> is

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
then we have a boss attack which is

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.770 
then we have a boss attack which is
probably<00:03:39.310> my<00:03:39.640> favorite<00:03:40.120> part<00:03:40.150> of<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.600> hack

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
probably my favorite part of the hack

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.420 
probably my favorite part of the hack
but<00:03:41.110> I'll<00:03:41.260> show<00:03:41.530> that<00:03:41.560> in<00:03:41.920> a<00:03:41.980> minute<00:03:42.100> because

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
but I'll show that in a minute because

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.580 
but I'll show that in a minute because
tucked<00:03:42.910> over<00:03:43.270> here<00:03:43.450> we<00:03:43.660> have<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.050> retro

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
tucked over here we have the retro

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.580 
tucked over here we have the retro
channel<00:03:44.980> going<00:03:45.700> in<00:03:45.910> this<00:03:46.090> ring<00:03:46.390> comes<00:03:47.110> up<00:03:47.350> with

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
channel going in this ring comes up with

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.520 
channel going in this ring comes up with
a<00:03:47.620> little<00:03:48.100> message<00:03:48.430> it<00:03:49.420> briefly<00:03:49.900> explains

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
a little message it briefly explains

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.310 
a little message it briefly explains
that<00:03:50.770> the<00:03:50.920> retro<00:03:51.280> channel<00:03:51.670> is<00:03:51.850> something<00:03:52.600> very

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
that the retro channel is something very

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.040 
that the retro channel is something very
very<00:03:53.620> special<00:03:54.280> at<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.820> moment<00:03:55.210> and<00:03:55.360> it<00:03:55.930> will

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
very special at the moment and it will

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.260 
very special at the moment and it will
definitely<00:03:56.290> expand<00:03:57.190> in<00:03:57.550> the<00:03:57.670> future<00:03:58.060> and

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
definitely expand in the future and

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.890 
definitely expand in the future and
actually<00:03:59.020> it<00:03:59.200> says<00:03:59.470> you<00:03:59.680> need<00:03:59.920> gens<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.210> a

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
actually it says you need gens and a

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.100 
actually it says you need gens and a
special<00:04:02.350> plug-in<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:03.460> actually<00:04:03.910> make<00:04:04.180> retro

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
special plug-in to actually make retro

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.530 
special plug-in to actually make retro
channel<00:04:05.470> work<00:04:05.710> so<00:04:06.580> I<00:04:06.850> didn't<00:04:07.210> get<00:04:07.330> that

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
channel work so I didn't get that

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.990 
channel work so I didn't get that
plug-in<00:04:07.840> plus<00:04:08.290> I'm<00:04:08.500> using<00:04:08.680> K<00:04:08.950> fusion<00:04:09.430> because

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
plug-in plus I'm using K fusion because

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.940 
plug-in plus I'm using K fusion because
it's<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.270> only<00:04:10.360> emulator<00:04:11.050> that<00:04:11.200> I<00:04:11.440> can<00:04:11.740> get

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
it's the only emulator that I can get

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.140 
it's the only emulator that I can get
fraps<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:13.050> work<00:04:14.050> with<00:04:14.290> and<00:04:14.670> with<00:04:15.670> that<00:04:15.880> let's

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
fraps to work with and with that let's

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.090 
fraps to work with and with that let's
have<00:04:16.359> a<00:04:16.390> little<00:04:16.570> look<00:04:16.870> at<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.320> boss<00:04:17.709> attack

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
have a little look at the boss attack

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.430 
have a little look at the boss attack
one<00:04:18.609> of<00:04:18.640> my<00:04:18.850> favorite<00:04:19.299> things<00:04:19.540> in<00:04:19.870> this<00:04:20.109> whole

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
one of my favorite things in this whole

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.750 
one of my favorite things in this whole
hack<00:04:22.470> when<00:04:23.470> I<00:04:23.500> first<00:04:23.980> have<00:04:24.250> a<00:04:24.280> look<00:04:24.520> at<00:04:24.640> the

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
hack when I first have a look at the

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.180 
hack when I first have a look at the
boss<00:04:25.060> attack<00:04:25.420> section<00:04:25.930> I<00:04:26.080> thought<00:04:26.350> how<00:04:26.980> would

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
boss attack section I thought how would

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.480 
boss attack section I thought how would
they<00:04:27.370> be<00:04:27.430> using<00:04:27.730> the<00:04:28.120> levels<00:04:28.660> but<00:04:29.380> no<00:04:29.590> I<00:04:29.950> really

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
they be using the levels but no I really

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.070 
they be using the levels but no I really
like<00:04:30.700> what<00:04:30.880> they've<00:04:31.030> done<00:04:31.060> here<00:04:31.540> it's<00:04:31.720> almost

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
like what they've done here it's almost

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.490 
like what they've done here it's almost
like<00:04:32.910> virtual<00:04:33.910> reality<00:04:34.510> training<00:04:34.840> on<00:04:35.380> the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
like virtual reality training on the

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.790 
like virtual reality training on the
bosses<00:04:35.950> that<00:04:36.760> all<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.450> bosses<00:04:38.050> are<00:04:38.350> set<00:04:38.530> up<00:04:38.620> in

the only difference is that you have one

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.970 
the only difference is that you have one
life<00:06:28.720> so<00:06:30.430> don't<00:06:31.430> die<00:06:32.020> if<00:06:33.020> you're<00:06:33.590> any<00:06:33.740> good<00:06:33.830> at
