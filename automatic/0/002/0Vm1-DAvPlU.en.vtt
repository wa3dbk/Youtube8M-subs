00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
way that they put a spawns it's not as

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.690 
way that they put a spawns it's not as
easy<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.810> spawn<00:00:28.140> trap<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.560> like<00:00:28.740> free<00:00:29.160> fall<00:00:29.400> on

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
was just like capping flags and I wasn't

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.729 
was just like capping flags and I wasn't
really<00:00:39.690> paying<00:00:39.780> attention<00:00:40.019> that<00:00:40.470> all<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.680> a

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739

sudden I start seeing a ton of people in
the<00:00:43.980> building<00:00:44.190> near<00:00:44.640> me<00:00:44.790> and<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:45.660> started

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
the building near me and I just started

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.869 
the building near me and I just started
spraying<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.290> the<00:00:46.350> course<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.800> kept<00:00:47.040> looking<00:00:47.489> in

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.479 
spraying on the course I kept looking in
and<00:00:48.030> out<00:00:48.200> so<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.379> would<00:00:49.530> continually<00:00:49.950> spawning

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
and out so it would continually spawning

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.940 
and out so it would continually spawning

and you know add a good sequence of

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.260 
and you know add a good sequence of
kills<00:01:01.980> i'm<00:01:02.129> not<00:01:02.219> sure<00:01:02.399> what<00:01:02.579> broke<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.910> spawn

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
kills i'm not sure what broke the spawn

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.359 
kills i'm not sure what broke the spawn
if<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.510> pushed<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:04.020> a<00:01:04.170> little<00:01:04.410> too<00:01:04.500> hard<00:01:04.770> maybe

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
if I pushed in a little too hard maybe

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.580 
if I pushed in a little too hard maybe
the<00:01:05.610> Goliath<00:01:06.000> over<00:01:06.240> here<00:01:06.479> i'm<00:01:06.690> not<00:01:07.020> sure<00:01:07.080> but

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
the Goliath over here i'm not sure but

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.370 
the Goliath over here i'm not sure but
you<00:01:08.490> know<00:01:08.610> for<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.850> most<00:01:08.940> part<00:01:09.300> it<00:01:10.080> was<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
you know for the most part it was a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.380 
you know for the most part it was a
really<00:01:10.920> quick<00:01:11.130> little<00:01:11.520> glimpse<00:01:11.940> of<00:01:12.119> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
really quick little glimpse of a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.870 
really quick little glimpse of a
potential<00:01:13.080> spawn<00:01:13.320> trap<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.460> course<00:01:14.670> i

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
potential spawn trap and of course i

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.880 
potential spawn trap and of course i
think<00:01:15.149> they'll<00:01:15.539> cathing<00:01:16.020> be<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.530> also<00:01:16.649> my

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
think they'll cathing be and also my

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.529 
think they'll cathing be and also my
teammates<00:01:17.250> pushing<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.729> did<00:01:17.940> not<00:01:18.090> help<00:01:18.300> of

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
teammates pushing in did not help of

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.050 
teammates pushing in did not help of
course<00:01:18.750> dumbass<00:01:19.380> blue<00:01:19.679> guy<00:01:19.890> pushes<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.819> and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
course dumbass blue guy pushes in and

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.380 
course dumbass blue guy pushes in and
breaks<00:01:21.569> a<00:01:21.720> spot<00:01:21.929> but<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.830> general<00:01:23.039> i<00:01:23.580> think

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
breaks a spot but in general i think

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.589 
breaks a spot but in general i think
this<00:01:25.050> game<00:01:25.649> like<00:01:26.310> as<00:01:26.550> far<00:01:26.789> as<00:01:26.910> if<00:01:27.030> somebody<00:01:27.270> can

00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:27.599 
this game like as far as if somebody can

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:30.350 
this game like as far as if somebody can
hold<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.229> spawn<00:01:28.560> now<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.550> is<00:01:29.700> domination<00:01:30.119> we

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
hold the spawn now this is domination we

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.120 
hold the spawn now this is domination we
all<00:01:30.479> know<00:01:30.630> domination<00:01:31.200> has<00:01:31.319> like<00:01:31.619> nowhere

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
all know domination has like nowhere

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.330 
all know domination has like nowhere
near<00:01:32.429> the<00:01:32.940> spawns<00:01:33.300> that<00:01:34.080> of<00:01:34.590> course<00:01:34.770> uplink

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
near the spawns that of course uplink

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.980 
near the spawns that of course uplink
momentum<00:01:35.910> and<00:01:36.060> other<00:01:36.209> game<00:01:36.450> modes<00:01:36.569> give<00:01:36.869> you

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
momentum and other game modes give you

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.690 
momentum and other game modes give you
so<00:01:37.410> if<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.800> like<00:01:37.950> two<00:01:37.979> or<00:01:38.280> three<00:01:38.310> guys

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
so if you have like two or three guys

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.430 
so if you have like two or three guys
and<00:01:39.149> you<00:01:39.270> know<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.420> basically<00:01:39.780> had<00:01:40.200> people

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
and you know you basically had people

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.809 
and you know you basically had people
helping<00:01:40.679> you<00:01:40.740> hold<00:01:40.979> spawns<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.580> people

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:41.819 
helping you hold spawns and people

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:44.389 
helping you hold spawns and people
didn't<00:01:42.090> leave<00:01:42.209> i<00:01:42.530> could<00:01:43.530> see<00:01:43.709> with<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.069> size

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
didn't leave i could see with this size

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.040 
didn't leave i could see with this size
of<00:01:44.580> a<00:01:44.640> map<00:01:44.819> and<00:01:45.060> how<00:01:45.360> fast<00:01:45.569> you<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:45.810> move

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
of a map and how fast you can move

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.499 
of a map and how fast you can move
around<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.440> and<00:01:46.649> how<00:01:47.369> fast<00:01:47.670> i<00:01:47.789> got<00:01:47.940> kills<00:01:48.209> just

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
around it and how fast i got kills just

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.809 
around it and how fast i got kills just
then<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:49.380> their<00:01:49.649> competitive<00:01:50.250> potentially

a 250 to 300 kill game especially on
this<00:01:53.880> map<00:01:54.090> i<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:55.380> feel<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.739> is<00:01:55.890> a

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
this map i just feel like this is a

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.639 
this map i just feel like this is a
smallest<00:01:56.280> bad<00:01:56.550> possible<00:01:57.179> at<00:01:57.750> before<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.380> i

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
smallest bad possible at before this i

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.680 
smallest bad possible at before this i
think<00:01:58.920> comeback<00:01:59.429> was<00:01:59.580> like<00:01:59.789> the<00:02:00.000> next<00:02:00.239> closest

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690

think comeback was like the next closest
it<00:02:00.810> seemed<00:02:00.989> like<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.759> it<00:02:02.759> just<00:02:02.819> wasn't<00:02:03.119> it

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929

too<00:02:25.210> often<00:02:25.390> however<00:02:25.750> just<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:26.800> if<00:02:26.920> somebody

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
too often however just so if somebody

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.800 
too often however just so if somebody

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
a 250 300 kill game so i figured i would

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.030 
a 250 300 kill game so i figured i would
share<00:02:31.930> it<00:02:31.990> especially<00:02:32.290> for<00:02:32.620> all<00:02:32.680> my<00:02:32.830> spawn

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
share it especially for all my spawn

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.040 
share it especially for all my spawn
