now blackberries came with the property
and<00:00:10.530> they<00:00:10.740> are<00:00:10.980> considered<00:00:11.429> an<00:00:11.639> invasive<00:00:12.000> weed

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
and they are considered an invasive weed

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.289 
and they are considered an invasive weed
because<00:00:13.259> they<00:00:13.620> are<00:00:13.710> taking<00:00:14.219> over<00:00:14.429> acres<00:00:15.059> and

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
because they are taking over acres and

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.359

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
acres of property all over the country

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.330 
acres of property all over the country
and<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:18.330> there<00:00:18.630> are<00:00:18.750> great<00:00:19.109> fruit<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:19.949> love

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
and so there are great fruit and I love

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.490 
and so there are great fruit and I love
to<00:00:20.580> eat<00:00:20.640> blackberries<00:00:20.970> but<00:00:21.930> when<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.260> grow

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
to eat blackberries but when you grow

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.560 
to eat blackberries but when you grow
them<00:00:22.740> make<00:00:23.070> sure<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.609> you're<00:00:23.760> very<00:00:23.939> careful

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
them make sure that you're very careful

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.599 
them make sure that you're very careful
with<00:00:24.750> them<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.260> not<00:00:25.740> grow<00:00:26.010> them<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.340> there<00:00:26.460> any

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
with them and not grow them in there any

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.429 
with them and not grow them in there any
natural<00:00:26.880> areas<00:00:27.510> where<00:00:27.720> they<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:28.050> take<00:00:28.230> over

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
natural areas where they can take over

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.859 
natural areas where they can take over
because<00:00:29.160> they<00:00:29.609> can<00:00:29.820> really<00:00:30.269> take<00:00:30.510> over<00:00:30.689> and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
because they can really take over and

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.359 
because they can really take over and
they're<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.289> easy<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.830> grow

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
they're so easy to grow

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.639 
they're so easy to grow
so<00:00:32.910> blackberries<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.719> raspberries<00:00:34.110> have<00:00:34.410> one

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
so blackberries and raspberries have one

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.260 
so blackberries and raspberries have one
thing<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:35.040> common<00:00:35.070> they<00:00:35.579> don't<00:00:35.790> really<00:00:36.000> even

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
thing in common they don't really even

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.840 
thing in common they don't really even
need<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.600> root<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.440> get<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> new<00:00:37.980> start<00:00:38.250> all<00:00:38.610> you

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
need a root to get a new start all you

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.420 
need a root to get a new start all you
need<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.270> cutting<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.079> as<00:00:40.800> long<00:00:41.070> as<00:00:41.250> that

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
need is a cutting and as long as that

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.459 
need is a cutting and as long as that
reaches<00:00:42.030> into<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.540> ground<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.290> just

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
reaches into the ground and you just

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.500 
reaches into the ground and you just
barely<00:00:43.890> cover<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.430> up<00:00:44.550> or<00:00:44.850> throw<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.120> into<00:00:45.360> a

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
barely cover it up or throw it into a

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.440 
barely cover it up or throw it into a
bucket<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.960> water<00:00:46.170> it'll<00:00:46.980> start<00:00:47.370> rooting<00:00:47.850> and

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
bucket of water it'll start rooting and

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.750 
bucket of water it'll start rooting and
you<00:00:48.870> could<00:00:49.050> even<00:00:49.200> set<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.860> piece<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.250> blackberry

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
you could even set a piece of blackberry

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.670 
you could even set a piece of blackberry
down<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.690> ground<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.320> it'll<00:00:52.500> immediately

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
down on the ground and it'll immediately

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.130 
down on the ground and it'll immediately
start<00:00:53.280> rooting<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.270> it'll<00:00:54.629> grow<00:00:54.840> almost

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
start rooting so it'll grow almost

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.849 
start rooting so it'll grow almost
anywhere<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:56.280> they're<00:00:56.520> very<00:00:56.760> easy<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.300> start

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
anywhere and they're very easy to start

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.619 
anywhere and they're very easy to start
but<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> easiest<00:00:59.340> way<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.609> grow<00:00:59.940> raspberries

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
but the easiest way to grow raspberries

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.779 
but the easiest way to grow raspberries
and<00:01:00.930> blackberries<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.649> your<00:01:01.770> garden<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.340> up

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
and blackberries in your garden is up

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.990 
and blackberries in your garden is up
against<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.300> fence<00:01:03.570> or<00:01:03.989> even<00:01:04.530> put<00:01:05.220> some<00:01:05.519> string

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
against a fence or even put some string

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.230 
against a fence or even put some string
out<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.900> row<00:01:07.710> because<00:01:08.460> they<00:01:08.820> will<00:01:09.000> grow

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
out on a row because they will grow

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.300 
out on a row because they will grow
right<00:01:09.510> onto<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.110> fence<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:11.010> kind<00:01:11.220> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
right onto the fence and you can kind of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.789 
right onto the fence and you can kind of
lead<00:01:11.549> them<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.970> way<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.540> then<00:01:13.110> every<00:01:13.470> fall

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
lead them that way and then every fall

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.560 
lead them that way and then every fall
when<00:01:14.280> they<00:01:14.369> start<00:01:14.640> dying<00:01:14.850> back<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.540> just

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
when they start dying back you can just

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.060 
when they start dying back you can just
prune<00:01:16.020> them<00:01:16.170> back<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.409> bit<00:01:16.740> because<00:01:16.860> they'll

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
prune them back a bit because they'll

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.490 
prune them back a bit because they'll
get<00:01:17.189> really<00:01:17.400> really<00:01:17.850> linky<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.350> keep

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
get really really linky and you can keep

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.590 
get really really linky and you can keep
them<00:01:19.710> along<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.220> fence<00:01:20.490> they'll<00:01:21.330> give<00:01:21.509> you

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
them along that fence they'll give you

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.240 
them along that fence they'll give you
lots<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.960> fruit<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:22.770> collect<00:01:23.040> in

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
lots of fruit that you can collect in

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.399 
lots of fruit that you can collect in
the<00:01:23.340> fall<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.820> freeze<00:01:24.180> or<00:01:24.540> use<00:01:24.869> over<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
the fall and freeze or use over the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.530 
the fall and freeze or use over the
winter<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.180> raspberries<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.360> blackberries

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
winter so raspberries and blackberries

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.210 
winter so raspberries and blackberries
are<00:01:28.170> really<00:01:28.500> easy<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.860> grow

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
are really easy to grow

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.280 
are really easy to grow
they<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.759> need<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> full<00:01:30.299> sunny<00:01:30.689> spot<00:01:31.049> with

organic<00:01:35.790> soil<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.829> make<00:01:37.829> sure<00:01:38.100> when<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.430> do

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
organic soil and make sure when you do

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.760 
organic soil and make sure when you do
grow<00:01:38.880> them<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.900> do<00:01:40.079> keep<00:01:40.290> them<00:01:40.500> under

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.980 
grow them that you do keep them under
control<00:01:40.799> because<00:01:41.579> they<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:42.030> take<00:01:42.329> over<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
control because they can take over and
