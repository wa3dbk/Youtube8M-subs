00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.750
 nice to all kids welcome this 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.420
 north and history on how to change some 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.259
 holidays settings mines xvi then 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:31.490
 together everything first thing on the menu 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:33.350
 spa we go to the acer computer 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.600
 if you have programs for your programs 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.620
 if you have the program only programs 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.449
 6 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:44.690
 go to this konami pro evolution 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:48.620
 soccer 2010 would be soon and then 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.480
 we must click on Cistercians then if 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.309
 for every time I am annoyed to do 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.170
 all this mess to get here 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:59.510
 enough is very simple 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.360
 click on the desktop creates 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.990
 link as I did 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:09.500
 here, however, the stop is appointed deputy of 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.420
 the 13 settings open this thing 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.869
 then here we can choose how 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.260
 put the full screen for example 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:21.830
 this is full screen this then 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.479
 the screen mode the fine mode 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.680
 are to be put because of 100 per 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.110
 a hundred fencers then these things with 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.040
 fassino only window if you put that 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.619
 but you can't put screenshots on it 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.930
 then why do we always put this 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.840
 only finesse, however, we await mode a 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.320
 window as good as we are 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.140
 we put 16 9 otherwise it comes with the 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.650
 black lateral stripes and then we click 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.150
 on vlt you can get the graphic quality 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.020
 put it up if you have a delicious one 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.840
 Video Card 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.229
 in this case if if you are not figures 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.670
 of your clicked video card if there 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.510
 were a colleague that your card 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.790
 video is not very powerful 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.500
 so I just feel average anyway 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.050
 He sees some quite well chastity is 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.940
 beautiful even in the media then can 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.660
 be a spruce if you already have 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:20.520
 understand if you do not understand then fine 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:24.540
 I said then this be set i 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:28.170
 commands now we are used to 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:32.700
 minecraft so if we with w for example 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:35.510
 at zero expense I also say with t weva 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.850
 used to walking forward and we put w 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.780
 so when we play we will go on 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.940
 same thing with the left arrow 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.190
 we turn we left we 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.710
 accustomed to maida then he commands and decides 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.540
 tumor if you have never done so then read 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.540
 the maicon commands 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:02.130
 ok going by clicking we will go ahead 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:08.690
 by clicking on we will go left looking for and 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:12.570
 we'll heal in the back and click we'll go 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:18.230
 then when he then puts it for example 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.230
 to put 17 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:25.230
 with for example really f to pull 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:32.020
 then I 'm used to running with rt 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:36.220
 then put r run then put 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:39.760
 I feel shopper both recovery and me 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:44.260
 They are also used to her total 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:51.360
 of the boxes then with y for example y 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:54.930
 let's stay and then for the businessman goku 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:59.950
 why so this players candles 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:03.430
 anyway everything is done then it would 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.340
 habitat s played with the controls that 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.900
 you have just configured and if there are 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.340
 remember you can play the taste 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:16.480
 better here, then, we need the 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:19.450
 xbox controller the audio take a test 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:23.169
 can choose if you want to put hopefully 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.770
 store are only serious tool then on 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.740
 line 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.380
 are you accept local if the car 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.310
 today chooses to emit mystery and for the 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:37.120
 specifications will avoid some information 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.590
 it's okay almost to drink a case if you 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:44.710
 it tells me reactive however it works for me 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:48.430
 okay the tutorial ends here 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:51.490
 wait if i wanted to choose now in 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.200
 the focus is also the wrong English 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.660
 because your forgot to put it 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.410
 Italian to put the packages in 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:02.770
 Italian living drop by downloading them 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:04.600
 had nothing i will play a little so it goes 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:09.900
 well because I stop immediately because 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:13.780
 this coral however this one sterile 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:18.220
 ask for english though when he already has 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:21.380
 having just this will make the game a 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:24.780
 prizes but regular 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:28.620
 lorenzo no to everything in fact my name is 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.560
 lorenzo which we taste better 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:34.380
 then for example it goes almost well 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:39.300
 I certainly don't understand a cable to me 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:43.020

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.450
