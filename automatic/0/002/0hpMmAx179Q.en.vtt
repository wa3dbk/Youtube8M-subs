00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
density they're able to be cut with a

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.270 
density they're able to be cut with a
fork<00:03:13.200> very<00:03:14.100> tender<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.560> I<00:03:16.560> also<00:03:16.710> thought<00:03:17.220> it

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
fork very tender and I also thought it

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.920 
fork very tender and I also thought it
was<00:03:17.490> notable<00:03:18.210> that<00:03:18.450> they<00:03:19.070> while<00:03:20.070> they<00:03:20.100> are<00:03:20.520> not

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
was notable that they while they are not

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.530 
was notable that they while they are not
actual<00:03:22.220> chicken<00:03:23.220> breast<00:03:23.580> slices<00:03:25.070> they're<00:03:26.540> not

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
actual chicken breast slices they're not

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.420 
actual chicken breast slices they're not
made<00:03:27.900> with<00:03:28.170> any<00:03:28.320> sort<00:03:28.800> of<00:03:29.240> filler<00:03:30.240> or<00:03:31.430> other

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
made with any sort of filler or other

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.630 
made with any sort of filler or other
things<00:03:32.910> in<00:03:33.210> there<00:03:33.480> it's<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:33.900> entirely<00:03:34.640> solid

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
things in there it's a entirely solid

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.340 
things in there it's a entirely solid
piece<00:03:36.330> of<00:03:36.720> chicken<00:03:37.200> white<00:03:37.950> meat<00:03:37.980> chicken<00:03:39.350> and

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
piece of chicken white meat chicken and

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.450 
piece of chicken white meat chicken and
I<00:03:40.620> thought<00:03:42.290> benefited<00:03:43.290> from<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.710> sauce<00:03:44.040> which

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
I thought benefited from the sauce which

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:56.259 
I thought benefited from the sauce which
I<00:03:44.610> want<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:44.880> try<00:03:45.180> separately<00:03:45.960> here

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.470 

it's<00:03:57.269> mostly<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.989> sweet<00:03:58.560> barbecue<00:03:59.519> sauce<00:03:59.909> a

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
it's mostly a sweet barbecue sauce a

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.960 
it's mostly a sweet barbecue sauce a
little<00:04:00.989> bit<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.439> honey<00:04:01.739> flavor<00:04:02.430> in<00:04:02.610> there<00:04:02.819> I

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
little bit of honey flavor in there I

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:10.130 
little bit of honey flavor in there I
detect<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:06.680> heat<00:04:07.680> level<00:04:08.069> is<00:04:08.519> I<00:04:08.909> would<00:04:09.900> say

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
detect the heat level is I would say

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.740 
detect the heat level is I would say
about<00:04:10.470> four<00:04:11.010> is<00:04:11.579> just<00:04:12.030> enough<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:12.720> add

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
about four is just enough to add

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.479 
about four is just enough to add
something<00:04:13.439> a<00:04:14.060> slight<00:04:15.060> zing<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.930> flavor

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
something a slight zing to the flavor

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.920 
something a slight zing to the flavor
but<00:04:17.489> if<00:04:17.639> you<00:04:17.820> don't<00:04:18.060> like<00:04:18.299> things<00:04:18.690> that<00:04:18.810> are

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
but if you don't like things that are

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.229 
but if you don't like things that are
just<00:04:19.289> terribly<00:04:19.889> hot<00:04:20.250> you'll<00:04:20.579> still<00:04:20.880> be<00:04:21.060> able

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
just terribly hot you'll still be able

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.939 
just terribly hot you'll still be able
to<00:04:21.419> enjoy<00:04:21.989> this<00:04:22.259> I<00:04:22.530> think<00:04:23.750> so<00:04:24.780> overall<00:04:25.500> very

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
to enjoy this I think so overall very

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.550 
to enjoy this I think so overall very
nice<00:04:26.280> flavor<00:04:26.850> in<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.360> sauce<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:28.110> then<00:04:28.500> the

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
nice flavor in the sauce and then the

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.000 
nice flavor in the sauce and then the
wing<00:04:29.160> now<00:04:29.910> let's<00:04:30.300> try<00:04:30.720> these<00:04:30.780> ranch<00:04:31.410> mashed

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
wing now let's try these ranch mashed

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.500 
wing now let's try these ranch mashed
potatoes<00:04:32.729> which<00:04:33.090> is<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:33.530> revolutionary<00:04:34.530> change

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
potatoes which is a revolutionary change

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.600 
potatoes which is a revolutionary change
from<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.630> history<00:04:37.139> of<00:04:37.289> Swanson<00:04:38.039> and<00:04:38.190> hungry

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
from the history of Swanson and hungry

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.550 
from the history of Swanson and hungry
me<00:04:38.789> and<00:04:39.000> they've<00:04:39.330> never<00:04:39.600> really<00:04:39.960> added

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
me and they've never really added

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.439 
me and they've never really added
anything<00:04:41.100> that<00:04:41.340> they're<00:04:41.460> mashed<00:04:41.789> potatoes

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
anything that they're mashed potatoes

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.469 
anything that they're mashed potatoes
before<00:04:43.310> and<00:04:44.310> they've<00:04:44.550> always<00:04:44.760> had<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.270> best

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
before and they've always had the best

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.370 
before and they've always had the best
frozen<00:04:46.199> mashed<00:04:46.710> potatoes<00:04:47.960> let's<00:04:48.960> go<00:04:49.260> ahead

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
frozen mashed potatoes let's go ahead

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:59.950 
frozen mashed potatoes let's go ahead
and<00:04:49.680> see<00:04:49.860> how<00:04:50.010> these<00:04:50.250> taste

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.290 

the<00:05:00.500> very<00:05:01.250> strong<00:05:01.820> of<00:05:02.150> a<00:05:02.270> ranch-flavored

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
the very strong of a ranch-flavored

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.939 
the very strong of a ranch-flavored
primarily<00:05:05.300> getting<00:05:05.630> more<00:05:06.020> that<00:05:06.290> classic

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:06.949 
primarily getting more that classic

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:16.239 
primarily getting more that classic
mashed<00:05:07.400> potatoes

00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:16.249 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:21.849 

there<00:05:16.819> are<00:05:17.029> some<00:05:17.329> little<00:05:17.539> green<00:05:17.929> specks<00:05:20.859> very

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:21.859 
there are some little green specks very

00:05:21.859 --> 00:05:24.489 
there are some little green specks very
small<00:05:22.369> but<00:05:22.759> I<00:05:22.789> guess<00:05:23.119> that<00:05:23.329> indicates<00:05:23.989> some<00:05:24.349> of

00:05:24.489 --> 00:05:24.499 
small but I guess that indicates some of

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:34.909 
small but I guess that indicates some of
the<00:05:24.589> ranch<00:05:24.859> season

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.779 

-<00:05:35.490> potatoes<00:05:36.240> are<00:05:36.479> good<00:05:36.750> but<00:05:37.110> you're<00:05:37.349> not

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
- potatoes are good but you're not

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.559 
- potatoes are good but you're not
strongly<00:05:38.789> ranch<00:05:39.419> flavor<00:05:39.990> just<00:05:40.439> a<00:05:40.650> hint<00:05:40.919> of<00:05:41.039> it

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:41.569 
strongly ranch flavor just a hint of it

00:05:41.569 --> 00:06:00.480 
strongly ranch flavor just a hint of it
so<00:05:42.569> now<00:05:42.810> let's<00:05:43.110> go<00:05:43.349> ahead<00:05:43.379> and<00:05:43.770> try<00:05:44.009> this<00:05:44.069> corn

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:08.710 

okay<00:06:01.490> on<00:06:01.790> the<00:06:01.970> corn<00:06:02.330> survey<00:06:03.170> says<00:06:06.700> I<00:06:07.700> have<00:06:08.510> to

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
okay on the corn survey says I have to

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.490 
okay on the corn survey says I have to
give<00:06:08.960> 1<00:06:09.770> or<00:06:09.800> 0<00:06:10.460> stars<00:06:11.000> for<00:06:11.480> this<00:06:11.600> corn<00:06:12.110> it's

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
give 1 or 0 stars for this corn it's

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.660 
give 1 or 0 stars for this corn it's
very<00:06:13.130> tough<00:06:14.320> almost<00:06:15.320> inedible<00:06:15.770> there's<00:06:16.490> a

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:16.670 
very tough almost inedible there's a

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.690 
very tough almost inedible there's a
slight<00:06:17.030> amount<00:06:17.420> of<00:06:17.690> butter<00:06:18.320> flavor<00:06:18.830> to<00:06:19.250> it<00:06:19.280> but

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
slight amount of butter flavor to it but

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.080 
slight amount of butter flavor to it but
so<00:06:19.940> now<00:06:20.120> let's<00:06:20.420> go<00:06:20.660> to<00:06:20.720> this<00:06:21.520> apple<00:06:22.520> crumble

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
so now let's go to this apple crumble

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:33.320 
so now let's go to this apple crumble
here

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.870 

I<00:06:33.360> thought<00:06:34.020> that<00:06:34.290> was<00:06:34.500> a<00:06:34.530> good<00:06:34.860> apple<00:06:35.460> dessert

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 
I thought that was a good apple dessert

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.890 
I thought that was a good apple dessert
it<00:06:36.270> has<00:06:36.800> most<00:06:37.800> importantly<00:06:38.580> tender<00:06:39.300> apples

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
it has most importantly tender apples

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.270 
it has most importantly tender apples
and<00:06:40.170> not<00:06:40.770> those<00:06:41.040> little<00:06:41.090> rubbery<00:06:42.090> ones<00:06:43.280> and

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
and not those little rubbery ones and

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.880 
and not those little rubbery ones and
the<00:06:44.990> crumble<00:06:45.990> on<00:06:46.200> top<00:06:46.260> and<00:06:47.220> around<00:06:47.460> it<00:06:48.150> has<00:06:48.390> a

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
the crumble on top and around it has a

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.520 
the crumble on top and around it has a
graham<00:06:49.890> cracker<00:06:50.030> taste<00:06:51.030> but<00:06:51.540> also<00:06:51.570> a<00:06:52.050> little

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.530 
graham cracker taste but also a little

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.630 
graham cracker taste but also a little
hint<00:06:52.890> of<00:06:53.040> butter<00:06:53.280> in<00:06:53.580> there<00:06:54.500> that<00:06:55.500> gives<00:06:56.220> it<00:06:56.490> an

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:56.640 
hint of butter in there that gives it an

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.080 
hint of butter in there that gives it an
overall<00:06:56.900> apple<00:06:57.900> pie<00:06:58.170> type<00:06:58.710> flavor<00:06:59.190> so<00:06:59.700> a<00:06:59.730> nice

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090 
overall apple pie type flavor so a nice

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.510 
overall apple pie type flavor so a nice
finish<00:07:00.690> to<00:07:00.960> the<00:07:01.080> meal<00:07:01.320> I<00:07:02.150> think<00:07:03.150> if<00:07:03.330> they<00:07:03.720> could

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 
finish to the meal I think if they could

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.720 
finish to the meal I think if they could
replace<00:07:05.520> the<00:07:06.590> coring<00:07:07.590> compartment<00:07:08.520> with<00:07:08.700> a

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:08.730 
replace the coring compartment with a

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.530 
replace the coring compartment with a
second<00:07:09.740> set<00:07:10.740> of<00:07:10.770> these<00:07:11.100> good<00:07:11.490> mashed<00:07:11.790> potatoes

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:12.540 
second set of these good mashed potatoes

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.230 
second set of these good mashed potatoes
in<00:07:12.810> there<00:07:13.430> that<00:07:14.430> would<00:07:14.700> be<00:07:14.850> a<00:07:14.880> great

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 
in there that would be a great

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.540 
in there that would be a great
improvement<00:07:15.390> I<00:07:16.170> just<00:07:16.560> don't<00:07:16.830> think<00:07:17.130> they<00:07:17.340> have

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
improvement I just don't think they have

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.780 
improvement I just don't think they have
the<00:07:17.580> best<00:07:17.970> mashed<00:07:18.300> potatoes<00:07:19.340> of<00:07:20.340> frozen

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:20.790 
the best mashed potatoes of frozen

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.150 
the best mashed potatoes of frozen
dinners<00:07:21.420> and<00:07:21.690> frankly<00:07:22.260> better<00:07:22.530> than<00:07:22.860> some

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 
dinners and frankly better than some

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.710 
dinners and frankly better than some
restaurants<00:07:24.170> and<00:07:25.170> you<00:07:25.350> have<00:07:25.590> these<00:07:26.720> above

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 
restaurants and you have these above

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.700 
restaurants and you have these above
average<00:07:28.350> moonless<00:07:29.040> wings<00:07:29.460> Sims<00:07:29.970> is<00:07:30.710> probably

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:31.710 
average moonless wings Sims is probably

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.400 
average moonless wings Sims is probably
the<00:07:31.890> best<00:07:32.160> barbecue<00:07:33.000> sauce<00:07:33.600> I've<00:07:33.930> had<00:07:34.170> the

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:34.410 
the best barbecue sauce I've had the

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:35.380 
the best barbecue sauce I've had the
teeny<00:07:34.740> dinner

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:35.390 
teeny dinner

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.200 
teeny dinner
so<00:07:36.390> overall<00:07:36.810> I<00:07:37.380> think<00:07:38.070> this<00:07:38.280> is<00:07:38.550> one<00:07:39.030> that

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.210 
so overall I think this is one that

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.000 
so overall I think this is one that
picked<00:07:39.510> up<00:07:39.750> while<00:07:40.050> they've<00:07:40.260> got<00:07:40.500> it<00:07:40.680> on<00:07:40.830> the

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.010 
picked up while they've got it on the

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:45.380 
picked up while they've got it on the
shelves<00:07:41.870> I'm<00:07:42.870> gonna<00:07:43.200> subtract<00:07:44.040> the<00:07:44.310> star<00:07:44.640> for

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:45.390 
shelves I'm gonna subtract the star for

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:50.540 
shelves I'm gonna subtract the star for
the<00:07:45.800> tough<00:07:46.800> cord<00:07:48.200> and<00:07:49.200> for<00:07:49.710> also<00:07:50.220> not

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:50.550 
the tough cord and for also not

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.210

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:53.220 
including a blue cheese sauce that could

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.640 
including a blue cheese sauce that could
be<00:07:53.370> defrost<00:07:53.910> and<00:07:54.270> perhaps<00:07:54.480> to<00:07:54.960> go<00:07:55.170> with<00:07:55.440> the

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:55.650

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.380

wings but sauce it got is pretty good
