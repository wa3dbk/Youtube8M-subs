then as you can get a suppose you know
we're<00:00:35.520> gonna<00:00:35.640> say<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.450> very<00:00:36.570> big

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
we're gonna say it's a very big

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.470 
we're gonna say it's a very big
certainly<00:00:37.350> hold<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.620> okay<00:00:37.920> our<00:00:38.129> very<00:00:38.460> big<00:00:38.730> you

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
certainly hold on okay our very big you

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.840 
certainly hold on okay our very big you
know<00:00:39.600> people<00:00:40.079> say<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.739> know<00:00:41.430> Leeds<00:00:41.670> and

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
know people say you know Leeds and

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.459 
know people say you know Leeds and
Bradford<00:00:42.030> these<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.809> big<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.440> think

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
Bradford these is a big one but I think

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.500 
Bradford these is a big one but I think
leads<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.070> cast<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.579> be<00:00:44.700> fair<00:00:44.910> because<00:00:45.090> you've

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
leads and cast to be fair because you've

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.200 
leads and cast to be fair because you've
got<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:46.520> certainly<00:00:47.520> from<00:00:47.730> an<00:00:47.820> outsider

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
got that certainly from an outsider

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.680 
got that certainly from an outsider
coming<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.719> or<00:00:48.989> coming<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.559> you've<00:00:49.739> got<00:00:50.690> small

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
coming in or coming in you've got small

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.630 
coming in or coming in you've got small
mining<00:00:52.110> town<00:00:52.140> big<00:00:52.890> city<00:00:54.379> very<00:00:55.379> rich<00:00:55.680> club<00:00:56.039> not

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
mining town big city very rich club not

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.439 
mining town big city very rich club not
a<00:00:56.699> rich<00:00:56.969> club<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.539> all<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.960> sort<00:00:58.410> of

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
a rich club is all that sort of

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.250 
a rich club is all that sort of
animosity<00:01:00.449> away<00:01:00.960> from<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.289> field<00:01:01.940> and<00:01:03.260> I

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
animosity away from the field and I

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.580 
animosity away from the field and I
think<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> past<00:01:05.400> probably<00:01:06.390> leads<00:01:07.260> have

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
think in the past probably leads have

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.330 
think in the past probably leads have
been<00:01:08.070> somewhat<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:09.290> an<00:01:10.290> egotistical<00:01:10.890> Club

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
been somewhat of an egotistical Club

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.560 
been somewhat of an egotistical Club
very<00:01:11.900> sort<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.110> looking<00:01:14.010> down<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.430> clubs<00:01:15.420> that

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
very sort of looking down on clubs that

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.109 
very sort of looking down on clubs that
oh<00:01:15.720> probably<00:01:16.590> not<00:01:16.860> as<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.369> wealthy<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:17.909> their

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
oh probably not as as wealthy as their

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.670 
oh probably not as as wealthy as their
allies<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.689> think<00:01:18.930> that's<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> case<00:01:19.350> now

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
allies and I think that's the case now

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.410 
allies and I think that's the case now
but<00:01:19.890> what<00:01:20.610> certainly<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.060> past<00:01:21.210> when<00:01:21.390> I

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
but what certainly in the past when I

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.890 
but what certainly in the past when I
first<00:01:21.720> joined<00:01:21.840> Castleford<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.590> think<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.009> was

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
performance we need to make sure that we

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.160 
performance we need to make sure that we
do<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.970> right<00:02:27.090> there<00:02:27.540> little<00:02:27.660> things<00:02:27.959> really

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
do the right there little things really

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.290 
do the right there little things really
well<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:29.640> know<00:02:29.760> we've<00:02:29.910> got<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:30.060> tough<00:02:30.270> task

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
well and you know we've got a tough task

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.940 
well and you know we've got a tough task
on<00:02:30.660> our<00:02:30.780> hands<00:02:30.959> but<00:02:31.170> we're<00:02:31.350> very<00:02:31.560> confident

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
on our hands but we're very confident

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.560 
on our hands but we're very confident
we'll<00:02:32.190> go<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.489> there<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.850> we<00:02:32.970> can<00:02:33.150> win<00:02:33.300> again

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
we'll go in there and we can win again

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.030 
we'll go in there and we can win again
and<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.870> think<00:02:34.050> if<00:02:34.470> that's<00:02:34.620> their<00:02:34.830> approach

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
and I think if that's their approach

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.610 
and I think if that's their approach
then<00:02:35.459> there's<00:02:35.790> no<00:02:35.910> reason<00:02:36.090> why<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.360> world<00:02:36.620> he

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
then there's no reason why the world he

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.140 
then there's no reason why the world he
had<00:02:37.739> open<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.130> look<00:02:38.280> on<00:02:38.400> Wembley<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.910> thing

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
had open the look on Wembley and thing

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.490 
had open the look on Wembley and thing
we've<00:02:39.270> got<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.420> get<00:02:39.600> revenge<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.320> think

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
we've got to get revenge and I think

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.660 
we've got to get revenge and I think
that's<00:02:40.650> history<00:02:41.010> that's<00:02:41.250> gone<00:02:43.130> daddle<00:02:44.130> the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
that's history that's gone daddle the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.790 
that's history that's gone daddle the
team<00:02:44.880> I'm<00:02:45.060> looking<00:02:45.420> forward<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.440> no<00:02:46.560> other

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
team I'm looking forward the no other

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.740 
team I'm looking forward the no other

life to do against Leeds a build think

00:02:48.750 --> 00:03:01.010 
life to do against Leeds a build think
last<00:02:49.140> year's<00:02:49.500> final<00:02:50.100> coming<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.900> reckoning

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:08.180 

I<00:03:05.270> think<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.420> atmosphere<00:03:06.540> in<00:03:07.020> Castle<00:03:07.380> Gus<00:03:08.010> and

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
I think the atmosphere in Castle Gus and

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.000 
I think the atmosphere in Castle Gus and
lazes<00:03:08.550> is<00:03:08.790> latley<00:03:09.180> says<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.600> can<00:03:09.720> only<00:03:09.810> be<00:03:10.050> i've

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
lazes is latley says it can only be i've

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.550 
lazes is latley says it can only be i've
never<00:03:11.250> played<00:03:11.370> in<00:03:11.640> another<00:03:11.910> hour<00:03:12.090> B<00:03:12.300> obviously

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
never played in another hour B obviously

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.790 
never played in another hour B obviously
but<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:14.060> castle<00:03:15.060> eats<00:03:15.210> games<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.350> atmosphere

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
but the castle eats games the atmosphere

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.840 
but the castle eats games the atmosphere

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
you know we've played there done a box

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.380 
you know we've played there done a box
in<00:03:33.540> there<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:33.870> there's<00:03:33.990> been<00:03:34.140> 22,000<00:03:35.100> people

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
in there and there's been 22,000 people

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.300 
in there and there's been 22,000 people
watching<00:03:36.390> these<00:03:36.510> games<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.800> like<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.010> say<00:03:38.280> I

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
watching these games and like I say I

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.280 
watching these games and like I say I
think<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:39.390> farm<00:03:39.660> that<00:03:39.780> was<00:03:39.900> out<00:03:40.080> of<00:03:40.230> the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
think the farm that was out of the

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.800 
think the farm that was out of the
window<00:03:40.650> casts<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.580> leads<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:42.360> ever<00:03:42.540> turns

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
window casts and leads it so ever turns

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.380 
window casts and leads it so ever turns
up<00:03:42.960> on<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.230> day<00:03:43.440> whoever's<00:03:44.240> prepared<00:03:45.240> the

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
up on the day whoever's prepared the

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.440 
up on the day whoever's prepared the
best<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:45.990> to<00:03:46.950> do<00:03:47.100> it<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.430> think<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:47.880> got<00:03:48.420> one

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
best and to do it I think you got one

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.200 
best and to do it I think you got one
farm<00:03:48.900> yeah<00:03:49.170> no<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.710> don't<00:03:50.280> think<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.550> can<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:51.180> I

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
farm yeah no I don't think you can and I

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.920 
farm yeah no I don't think you can and I
think<00:03:51.480> that<00:03:52.640> like<00:03:53.640> I<00:03:53.760> said<00:03:53.970> there's<00:03:54.660> the

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
think that like I said there's the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.860 
think that like I said there's the
atmosphere<00:03:55.440> I<00:03:55.530> think<00:03:55.620> as<00:03:56.490> a<00:03:56.550> massive<00:03:57.000> has<00:03:57.840> a

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
atmosphere I think as a massive has a

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.580 
atmosphere I think as a massive has a
massive<00:03:58.110> bearing<00:03:58.650> on<00:03:58.800> I'm<00:03:59.460> certainly<00:03:59.940> on

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
massive bearing on I'm certainly on

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.560 
massive bearing on I'm certainly on
Castleford<00:04:01.590> because<00:04:02.090> when<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.180> place<00:04:03.390> is

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
Castleford because when the place is

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.970 
Castleford because when the place is
full<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:05.160> know<00:04:05.190> they're<00:04:06.150> not<00:04:06.240> only<00:04:06.800> the<00:04:07.800> quiet

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
full you know they're not only the quiet

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.740 
full you know they're not only the quiet
analytical<00:04:08.670> class<00:04:08.910> apart<00:04:09.210> is<00:04:09.420> that<00:04:09.450> they

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
analytical class apart is that they

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.560 
analytical class apart is that they
understand<00:04:10.200> again<00:04:11.060> probably<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.210> little<00:04:12.360> bit

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
understand again probably a little bit

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.290 
understand again probably a little bit
more<00:04:12.750> than<00:04:12.990> probably<00:04:13.260> some<00:04:13.500> some<00:04:13.920> other<00:04:14.300> Club

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300

of<00:04:26.790> a<00:04:26.850> sudden<00:04:27.150> you<00:04:27.360> know<00:04:27.390> the<00:04:28.050> arousal<00:04:28.470> of<00:04:28.530> the

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
of a sudden you know the arousal of the

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.490 
of a sudden you know the arousal of the
supporters<00:04:29.220> as<00:04:29.630> ignited<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.750> team<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.200> just

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
supporters as ignited the team to just

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.000 
supporters as ignited the team to just
do<00:04:31.650> something<00:04:32.040> special<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.610> I<00:04:32.670> think<00:04:32.880> that

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
do something special and I think that

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.790 
do something special and I think that
you<00:04:35.010> know<00:04:35.160> if<00:04:35.370> certainly<00:04:36.270> in<00:04:36.390> this<00:04:36.540> game<00:04:36.810> that

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
you know if certainly in this game that

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.040 
you know if certainly in this game that
the<00:04:37.950> support<00:04:38.310> will<00:04:38.580> have<00:04:38.850> a<00:04:38.880> big<00:04:39.120> bearing<00:04:39.330> on

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
the support will have a big bearing on

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.480 
the support will have a big bearing on
the<00:04:40.140> outcome<00:04:40.170> outcome<00:04:40.890> of<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.100> game<00:04:41.250> I<00:04:41.310> think

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
the outcome outcome of the game I think

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.150 
the outcome outcome of the game I think
to<00:04:41.820> be<00:04:41.940> fair<00:04:42.440> there<00:04:43.440> is<00:04:43.470> a<00:04:43.560> lot<00:04:43.740> of<00:04:43.830> animosity

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
to be fair there is a lot of animosity

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.400 
to be fair there is a lot of animosity
between<00:04:44.640> the<00:04:44.970> bullets<00:04:45.510> between<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.230> tool

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
between the bullets between the tool

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.040 
between the bullets between the tool
sets<00:04:46.650> us<00:04:46.770> apart<00:04:46.920> as<00:04:47.190> I<00:04:47.310> think<00:04:47.370> and<00:04:48.030> peel<00:04:49.020> it

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
sets us apart as I think and peel it

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.630 
sets us apart as I think and peel it
simply<00:04:49.440> because<00:04:49.770> why<00:04:49.920> I<00:04:49.950> said<00:04:50.190> earlier<00:04:50.310> on

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
simply because why I said earlier on

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.720 
simply because why I said earlier on
well<00:04:50.910> I<00:04:51.120> think<00:04:51.830> you<00:04:52.830> know<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:53.100> L<00:04:53.370> of<00:04:53.400> a<00:04:53.520> lot<00:04:53.640> of

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
well I think you know the L of a lot of

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.940 
well I think you know the L of a lot of
leader<00:04:53.880> pause<00:04:54.240> there<00:04:54.570> and<00:04:54.720> I<00:04:54.810> think<00:04:54.870> that<00:04:55.080> that

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
leader pause there and I think that that

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.959 
leader pause there and I think that that
just<00:04:56.430> that<00:04:56.820> that<00:04:57.150> rivalry<00:04:57.600> for<00:04:58.230> me

00:04:58.959 --> 00:04:58.969 
just that that rivalry for me

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:01.329 
just that that rivalry for me
just<00:04:59.149> think<00:04:59.360> it's<00:04:59.599> it<00:05:00.199> says<00:05:00.379> close<00:05:00.679> to<00:05:00.889> a<00:05:00.919> I

00:05:01.329 --> 00:05:01.339 
just think it's it says close to a I

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:04.929 
just think it's it says close to a I
mean<00:05:01.639> asserted<00:05:02.029> a<00:05:02.149> be<00:05:02.329> as<00:05:02.419> you<00:05:02.539> could<00:05:02.719> get
