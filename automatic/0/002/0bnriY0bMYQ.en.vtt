I've got reels that I've attached to the
front<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.059> my<00:00:12.120> mower<00:00:12.360> because<00:00:13.490> when<00:00:14.490> they

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
front of my mower because when they

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.550 
front of my mower because when they
follow<00:00:14.910> them<00:00:15.150> all<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.420> these<00:00:15.599> wheels<00:00:16.199> on<00:00:16.440> the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560

system form a simple piece of angle iron

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.190 
system form a simple piece of angle iron
it's<00:00:46.920> pretty<00:00:47.160> thick<00:00:47.539> should<00:00:48.539> last<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.989> life

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
it's pretty thick should last the life

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.650 
it's pretty thick should last the life
of<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.680> couple<00:00:50.100> arms<00:00:50.610> attached<00:00:50.969> here<00:00:51.510> and

they<00:00:52.199> are<00:00:52.399> pinned<00:00:53.399> as<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.570> see<00:00:54.719> right

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
they are pinned as you can see right

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.600 
they are pinned as you can see right
here<00:00:54.960> which<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.649> can't<00:00:55.860> see<00:00:56.010> very<00:00:56.039> well<00:00:56.280> there

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
here which I can't see very well there

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.939 
here which I can't see very well there
we<00:00:56.699> go<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.719> pull<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> car<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.410> key<00:00:58.559> out<00:00:58.590> on

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
we go and I pull the car to key out on

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.860 
we go and I pull the car to key out on
each<00:00:59.340> side<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> whole<00:00:59.969> system<00:01:00.359> drops<00:01:00.600> off

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
each side and the whole system drops off

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.369 
each side and the whole system drops off
it's<00:01:01.500> also<00:01:01.680> independent<00:01:02.070> if<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:03.030> hit<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> bump

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
it's also independent if I hit a bump

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.810 
it's also independent if I hit a bump
the<00:01:04.379> whole<00:01:04.530> thing<00:01:04.799> will<00:01:04.979> lift<00:01:05.159> up<00:01:05.309> if<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.610> needs

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the whole thing will lift up if it needs

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.740 
the whole thing will lift up if it needs
to<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:07.170> only<00:01:07.350> downfall<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:09.270> can't

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
to the only downfall to this is I can't

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.620 
to the only downfall to this is I can't
steer<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.200> corners<00:01:10.650> very<00:01:10.890> well<00:01:11.420> because<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
steer in corners very well because the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.020 
steer in corners very well because the
real<00:01:12.780> stay<00:01:13.110> straight<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.820> they're<00:01:14.820> actually

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
real stay straight and they're actually

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.910 
real stay straight and they're actually
doing<00:01:15.210> most<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.900> traction<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.530> turning

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
doing most of the traction for turning

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.359 
doing most of the traction for turning
not<00:01:17.880> turning<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.360> guess<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.720> should<00:01:18.930> say<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:20.100> what

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
not turning I guess I should say so what

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.359 
not turning I guess I should say so what
I've<00:01:20.520> ordered<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.630> winch<00:01:22.530> cost<00:01:23.430> me<00:01:23.640> 50<00:01:24.000> bucks

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369

me behind will actually cut that cut
that<00:01:59.310> grass<00:01:59.579> for<00:01:59.939> me<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.189> system

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
that grass for me so this this system

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.940 
that grass for me so this this system
should<00:02:02.700> work<00:02:02.880> pretty<00:02:03.060> good<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:04.740> next

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
should work pretty good and the next

should work pretty good and the next
update<00:02:05.130> will<00:02:05.610> be<00:02:06.170> when<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.200> put<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:08.300> pulley

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
update will be when I put the pulley

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.800 
update will be when I put the pulley
system<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.899> there<00:02:10.140> with<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.129> winch<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.810> I'll

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
system on there with the winch and I'll

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
system on there with the winch and I'll
give<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.230> complete

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
give you a complete

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.100 
give you a complete
Moe<00:02:14.040> will<00:02:14.760> have<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.030> many<00:02:15.120> videotape<00:02:15.660> MIMO<00:02:15.960> on

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
Moe will have so many videotape MIMO on

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.300 
Moe will have so many videotape MIMO on
so<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.350> see<00:02:16.500> exactly<00:02:16.800> how<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.100> whole<00:02:17.280> process

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
so you see exactly how the whole process

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.410 
so you see exactly how the whole process
is<00:02:17.760> working<00:02:18.020> okay<00:02:19.020> see<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.380> later
