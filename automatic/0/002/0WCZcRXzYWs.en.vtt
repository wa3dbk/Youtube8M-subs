room<00:00:07.950> tutorial<00:00:08.580> again<00:00:08.730> since<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.809> patch

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
room tutorial again since the patch

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.870 
room tutorial again since the patch
rolled<00:00:10.710> out<00:00:10.980> what<00:00:11.190> they<00:00:11.340> did<00:00:11.550> was<00:00:11.730> they

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
rolled out what they did was they

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.970 
rolled out what they did was they
removed<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.420> collision<00:00:12.900> model<00:00:13.230> from<00:00:13.830> the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
removed the collision model from the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.970 
removed the collision model from the
Leviathan<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.089> pretty<00:00:15.269> much<00:00:15.360> will<00:00:15.719> made<00:00:15.990> my

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
Leviathan so it pretty much will made my

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.790 
Leviathan so it pretty much will made my
previous<00:00:17.430> tutorials<00:00:18.060> outdated<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.590> one

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
previous tutorials outdated so this one

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.300 
previous tutorials outdated so this one
is<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.100> technique<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.910> also<00:00:21.180> has<00:00:21.810> been<00:00:22.310> known

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
is a technique that also has been known

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.390 
is a technique that also has been known
about<00:00:23.340> since<00:00:24.150> pretty<00:00:24.930> much<00:00:25.109> will<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:26.099> captain

Scarlett's<00:00:27.090> DLC<00:00:27.660> was<00:00:27.810> released<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.859> has

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
Scarlett's DLC was released this has

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.890 
Scarlett's DLC was released this has
been<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> another<00:00:30.000> technique<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.689> lot<00:00:30.810> of

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
been a another technique that a lot of

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.350 
been a another technique that a lot of
people<00:00:31.170> use<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.009> just<00:00:32.250> hated<00:00:32.579> doing<00:00:33.120> it

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
people use but I just hated doing it

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.170 
people use but I just hated doing it
with<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.630> Leviathan<00:00:34.230> body<00:00:34.469> there<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.880> is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
with the Leviathan body there so this is

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.959 
with the Leviathan body there so this is
now<00:00:36.570> pretty<00:00:36.930> much<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.530> best<00:00:37.800> way<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.129> do<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.640> it

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
now pretty much the best way to do it it

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.930 
now pretty much the best way to do it it
doesn't<00:00:39.420> require<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.140> second<00:00:40.739> account<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.309> you

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
doesn't require a second account and you

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.389 
doesn't require a second account and you
can<00:00:42.090> actually<00:00:42.270> just<00:00:42.540> get<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.320> there<00:00:43.530> provided

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
can actually just get in there provided

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.029 
can actually just get in there provided
you<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.539> correct<00:00:45.930> mission<00:00:46.500> available

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
you have the correct mission available

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.529 
you have the correct mission available
if<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.370> don't<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> correct<00:00:48.210> mission

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
if you don't have the correct mission

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.450 
if you don't have the correct mission
available<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.410> may<00:00:49.649> need<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.980> reset<00:00:50.340> your

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
available you may need to reset your

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.459 
available you may need to reset your
progress<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.180> get<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.600> mission<00:00:51.930> available

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
progress and get that mission available

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.799 
progress and get that mission available
but<00:00:53.309> that's<00:00:54.030> something<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.449> you'll<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.690> to

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
but that's something that you'll have to

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.750 
but that's something that you'll have to
work<00:00:54.960> out<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.350> yourself<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:55.980> let's<00:00:56.430> get<00:00:56.610> on

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
work out for yourself so let's get on

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.930 
work out for yourself so let's get on
with<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.940> tutorial<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.770> let's<00:00:58.770> let's<00:00:59.579> start

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.890 
and be a bounty board here you'll see
that<00:01:04.860> there's<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.100> mission<00:01:05.460> there<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.909> it'll

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
that there's a mission there and it'll

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.010 
that there's a mission there and it'll
actually<00:01:07.110> let<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.770> go<00:01:08.310> back<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.090> refight<00:01:09.990> a

for the second time so if you have this
mission<00:01:14.340> available<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.659> means<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.290> can

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
a second time legitimately now we're

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.969 
a second time legitimately now we're
gonna<00:01:21.210> use<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.810> our<00:01:22.170> advantage<00:01:22.290> and

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
gonna use that to our advantage and

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.399 
gonna use that to our advantage and
we're<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.240> show<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.450> how<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.930> actually

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
we're going to show you how to actually

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.800 
we're going to show you how to actually
constantly<00:01:26.280> farm<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.820> providing<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.689> have

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
constantly farm it providing you have

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.140 
constantly farm it providing you have
that<00:01:28.020> mission<00:01:28.200> available<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.130> active<00:01:29.520> so

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
that mission available and active so

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.429 
that mission available and active so
here<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:30.420> at<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.869> top<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.140> Magnus

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
here we are at the top of Magnus

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.240 
here we are at the top of Magnus
lighthouse<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.689> all<00:01:34.130> necessary<00:01:35.130> you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
lighthouse and this is all necessary you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.920 
lighthouse and this is all necessary you
need<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.520> do<00:01:35.820> all<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.000> these<00:01:36.180> for<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.540> mission

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
need to do all of these for this mission

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.380 
need to do all of these for this mission
so<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.380> thought<00:01:37.799> I'd<00:01:37.979> cut<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.250> together<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.270> at

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
so I thought I'd cut it together and at

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.719 
so I thought I'd cut it together and at
least<00:01:39.630> show<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.409> what<00:01:40.890> was<00:01:41.070> involved<00:01:41.430> I'm

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
least show you what was involved I'm

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.100 
least show you what was involved I'm
sure<00:01:41.759> everyone<00:01:42.299> already<00:01:42.540> knows<00:01:42.750> what's

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
sure everyone already knows what's

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.830 
sure everyone already knows what's
involved<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:43.770> once<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.759> all<00:01:44.939> done<00:01:45.210> you

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
involved but once this is all done you

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.399 
involved but once this is all done you
don't<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.799> do<00:01:46.950> all<00:01:46.979> these<00:01:47.460> steps<00:01:47.729> again

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
don't have to do all these steps again

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.990 
don't have to do all these steps again
once<00:01:49.409> these<00:01:49.590> are<00:01:49.649> done<00:01:49.799> it's<00:01:50.369> pretty<00:01:50.610> much<00:01:50.759> all

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
once these are done it's pretty much all

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.810 
once these are done it's pretty much all
businesses<00:01:51.509> as<00:01:51.720> usual<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.680> makes<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.280> farm<00:01:53.579> a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
businesses as usual it makes the farm a

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.020 
businesses as usual it makes the farm a
little<00:01:54.329> bit<00:01:54.479> longer<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:55.290> it's<00:01:55.470> still<00:01:56.030> quite

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
little bit longer but it's still quite

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.149 
little bit longer but it's still quite
farmable<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.110> still<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.680> way<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.070> you

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
farmable and it's still a way that you

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.249 
farmable and it's still a way that you
can<00:01:59.399> get<00:01:59.579> into<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.909> treasure<00:02:00.149> room<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.659> right

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
can get into the treasure room so right

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.569 
can get into the treasure room so right
here<00:02:01.469> we're<00:02:01.590> gonna<00:02:01.649> get<00:02:01.890> eaten<00:02:02.009> by<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.340> worm

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579

we just beat Rosco I've tried to cut it
as<00:02:16.170> quick<00:02:16.410> as<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.620> can<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.040> make<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.370> as<00:02:18.000> succinct

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
as quick as I can to make it as succinct

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.150 
as quick as I can to make it as succinct
and<00:02:18.810> straight<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.319> point<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:19.920> beat

Rosco<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.910> course<00:02:21.209> this<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.840> all<00:02:21.989> one

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
Rosco of course this is all one

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.410 
Rosco of course this is all one
recording<00:02:22.860> too<00:02:23.010> so<00:02:23.220> this<00:02:23.310> isn't<00:02:23.519> isn't<00:02:24.030> cut

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
recording too so this isn't isn't cut

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.720 
recording too so this isn't isn't cut
this<00:02:24.599> is<00:02:24.780> just<00:02:24.989> one<00:02:25.200> recording<00:02:25.800> back-to-back

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
this is just one recording back-to-back

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.820 
this is just one recording back-to-back
straight<00:02:27.209> away<00:02:27.450> just<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:28.110> show<00:02:28.319> you<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.500> this

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
straight away just to show you that this

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.520 
straight away just to show you that this
does<00:02:29.280> work<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:30.510> after<00:02:30.959> of<00:02:31.110> course<00:02:31.349> you've

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
down and you have to execute themselves

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.750 
down and you have to execute themselves
so<00:02:40.230> here<00:02:40.470> we<00:02:40.560> are<00:02:40.590> fighting<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.190> Leviathan

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
so here we are fighting the Leviathan

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.890 
so here we are fighting the Leviathan
the<00:02:41.989> key<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.739> this<00:02:43.890> whole<00:02:44.160> thing<00:02:44.640> is<00:02:44.900> just

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
the key to this whole thing is just

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.870 
the key to this whole thing is just
being<00:02:46.230> aware<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:46.920> can't<00:02:47.250> turn<00:02:47.640> this

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
being aware that you can't turn this

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.259 
being aware that you can't turn this
mission<00:02:48.299> in<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.900> mission<00:02:49.200> has<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.160> be<00:02:50.340> has<00:02:51.090> to

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
mission in this mission has to be has to

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.630 
mission in this mission has to be has to
remain<00:02:51.569> active<00:02:51.900> in<00:02:52.410> your<00:02:52.799> quest<00:02:53.069> log<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.430> lot<00:02:53.459> of

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
remain active in your quest log a lot of

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.449 
remain active in your quest log a lot of
people<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.060> will<00:02:54.329> annoy<00:02:55.170> but<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.890> think<00:02:56.280> it's

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
people that will annoy but I think it's

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.390 
people that will annoy but I think it's
it's<00:02:57.060> not<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.329> really<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.930> bad<00:02:58.799> figure<00:02:59.130> it's<00:02:59.370> a

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
it's not a really a bad figure it's a

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.309 
it's not a really a bad figure it's a
good<00:02:59.579> trade-off<00:02:59.910> because<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:01.170> can

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
good trade-off because you can

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.470 
good trade-off because you can
constantly<00:03:01.680> farm<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.160> Treasury<00:03:02.489> so<00:03:03.329> you'll

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
constantly farm the Treasury so you'll

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.180 
constantly farm the Treasury so you'll
see<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.900> Leviathans<00:03:04.440> bodies<00:03:04.799> there<00:03:05.010> as

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
see that the Leviathans bodies there as

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.309 
see that the Leviathans bodies there as
normal<00:03:05.790> as<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.239> is<00:03:06.360> because<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:06.870> we've<00:03:07.140> done

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
normal as it is because that we've done

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.650 
normal as it is because that we've done
the<00:03:07.500> mission<00:03:08.040> legitimately<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:09.239> what<00:03:09.420> you

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.819 
course until you hit the invisible wall
and<00:03:30.060> then<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:30.600> want<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.780> hold<00:03:30.959> forward<00:03:31.650> and

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
and then you want to hold forward and

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.520 
and then you want to hold forward and
left<00:03:32.579> so<00:03:33.150> you<00:03:33.209> sort<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.569> push<00:03:33.840> forward<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.380> get

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
left so you sort of push forward and get

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.710 
left so you sort of push forward and get
into<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.889> corner<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.400> then<00:03:35.910> use<00:03:36.359> your

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
into the corner and then use your

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.420 
into the corner and then use your
preferred<00:03:37.079> technique<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.889> get<00:03:38.040> into<00:03:38.310> the

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
preferred technique to get into the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.479 
preferred technique to get into the
glitch<00:03:39.230> there<00:03:40.230> is<00:03:40.380> multiple<00:03:40.980> ways<00:03:41.040> to<00:03:41.340> do<00:03:41.459> it

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
glitch there is multiple ways to do it

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.340 
glitch there is multiple ways to do it
I'm<00:03:41.730> not<00:03:41.880> going<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.090> cover<00:03:42.299> it<00:03:42.420> but<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:43.049> glitch

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
I'm not going to cover it but the glitch

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.530 
I'm not going to cover it but the glitch
from<00:03:43.739> here<00:03:44.069> on<00:03:44.250> out<00:03:44.280> it's<00:03:44.880> business<00:03:45.359> as<00:03:45.510> usual

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
from here on out it's business as usual

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.289 
from here on out it's business as usual
if<00:03:46.139> you<00:03:46.170> can<00:03:46.410> get<00:03:46.590> into<00:03:46.889> the<00:03:47.040> glitch<00:03:47.299> the

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
if you can get into the glitch the

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.059 
if you can get into the glitch the
treasure<00:03:48.569> room<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:48.900> completely<00:03:49.290> farmable<00:03:49.799> and

what I'll do is I'm gonna do a complete

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.990 
what I'll do is I'm gonna do a complete
run<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.829> then<00:03:53.220> I'm<00:03:53.310> going<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.489> show<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.730> what

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
you have to do to actually make it

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.089 
you have to do to actually make it
farmable<00:03:56.190> so<00:03:56.880> but<00:03:57.620> yeah<00:03:58.620> it's<00:03:58.859> interesting

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
farmable so but yeah it's interesting

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.129 
farmable so but yeah it's interesting
that<00:03:59.459> they<00:03:59.579> would<00:03:59.609> actually<00:04:00.060> patch<00:04:00.660> it<00:04:00.930> this

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
that they would actually patch it this

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.440 
that they would actually patch it this
far<00:04:01.560> along<00:04:01.859> in<00:04:02.069> the<00:04:02.160> game's<00:04:02.400> life<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:03.030> mean<00:04:03.209> it's

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
far along in the game's life I mean it's

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.309 
far along in the game's life I mean it's
it's<00:04:03.959> it's<00:04:04.349> been<00:04:04.769> out<00:04:05.040> for<00:04:05.099> so<00:04:05.669> long<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.319> it

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
it's it's been out for so long and it

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.400 
it's it's been out for so long and it
was<00:04:07.530> really<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:08.060> harmless<00:04:09.060> thing<00:04:09.329> I<00:04:09.480> think<00:04:09.780> the

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
was really a harmless thing I think the

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.839 
was really a harmless thing I think the
only<00:04:10.620> thing<00:04:10.799> I<00:04:10.889> can<00:04:11.099> think<00:04:11.130> in<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.459> back<00:04:11.609> of<00:04:11.639> my

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
only thing I can think in the back of my

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.140 
only thing I can think in the back of my
mind<00:04:12.060> is<00:04:12.389> that<00:04:12.599> with<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.919> new<00:04:14.579> ultimate<00:04:15.000> vault

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
mind is that with the new ultimate vault

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.870 
mind is that with the new ultimate vault
hunter<00:04:15.409> upgrade<00:04:16.409> pack<00:04:16.650> coming<00:04:17.039> out<00:04:17.220> maybe

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
hunter upgrade pack coming out maybe

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.110 
hunter upgrade pack coming out maybe
there<00:04:18.299> could<00:04:18.510> have<00:04:18.539> been<00:04:18.659> side<00:04:19.169> effects<00:04:19.560> too

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
there could have been side effects too

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.930 
there could have been side effects too
you<00:04:20.229> actually<00:04:21.229> increasing<00:04:22.400> maybe<00:04:22.550> the<00:04:22.760> loot

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
you actually increasing maybe the loot

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.159 
you actually increasing maybe the loot
drop<00:04:23.210> rates<00:04:23.449> and<00:04:23.690> it<00:04:23.750> would<00:04:23.840> have<00:04:23.930> made<00:04:23.990> the

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
drop rates and it would have made the

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.950 
drop rates and it would have made the
treasure<00:04:24.530> room<00:04:24.740> too<00:04:25.070> good<00:04:25.400> or<00:04:25.880> they<00:04:26.750> could

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
treasure room too good or they could

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.110 
treasure room too good or they could
have<00:04:27.020> been<00:04:27.199> other<00:04:27.860> side<00:04:28.190> effects<00:04:28.580> unknown

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
have been other side effects unknown

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.990 
have been other side effects unknown
that<00:04:29.389> could<00:04:29.570> have<00:04:29.660> affected<00:04:29.780> something

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
that could have affected something

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.550 
that could have affected something
there's<00:04:32.000> there<00:04:32.270> has<00:04:32.419> to<00:04:32.449> be<00:04:32.690> a<00:04:32.810> reason<00:04:33.229> like<00:04:33.350> I

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
there's there has to be a reason like I

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.409 
there's there has to be a reason like I
just<00:04:33.620> don't<00:04:34.070> see<00:04:34.310> why<00:04:34.520> they'll<00:04:34.760> attach<00:04:35.090> it<00:04:35.300> I

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
just don't see why they'll attach it I

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.330 
just don't see why they'll attach it I
mean<00:04:35.570> of<00:04:35.960> course<00:04:36.080> it's<00:04:36.500> a<00:04:36.590> glitch<00:04:36.860> and<00:04:37.070> you<00:04:37.190> are

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
mean of course it's a glitch and you are

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.070 
mean of course it's a glitch and you are
doing<00:04:37.580> something<00:04:38.000> that<00:04:38.150> they<00:04:38.389> don't<00:04:38.630> intend

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
doing something that they don't intend

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.920 
doing something that they don't intend
but<00:04:39.500> it's<00:04:40.340> something<00:04:40.639> harmless<00:04:41.180> and<00:04:41.540> like<00:04:41.810> I

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
but it's something harmless and like I

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.840 
but it's something harmless and like I

Leviathans<00:05:33.560> body<00:05:33.919> and<00:05:34.599> what<00:05:35.599> you<00:05:35.720> can<00:05:35.840> do<00:05:35.960> is

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
Leviathans body and what you can do is

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.779 
Leviathans body and what you can do is
actually<00:05:36.260> just<00:05:36.560> run<00:05:36.770> straight<00:05:36.950> back<00:05:37.280> down<00:05:37.310> and

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
actually just run straight back down and

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:39.820 
actually just run straight back down and
after<00:05:38.300> that<00:05:38.450> it's<00:05:38.960> just<00:05:39.080> business<00:05:39.650> as<00:05:39.800> usual

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
after that it's just business as usual

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.890 
after that it's just business as usual
you<00:05:40.400> can<00:05:40.580> just<00:05:40.789> constantly<00:05:41.330> do<00:05:41.450> it<00:05:41.539> so<00:05:41.660> this<00:05:41.840> is

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
you can just constantly do it so this is

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.779 
you can just constantly do it so this is
what<00:05:42.110> I<00:05:42.169> was<00:05:42.289> talking<00:05:42.500> about<00:05:42.680> where<00:05:43.520> it<00:05:43.639> makes

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
what I was talking about where it makes

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.790 
what I was talking about where it makes
it<00:05:43.940> a<00:05:44.030> little<00:05:44.120> bit<00:05:44.300> longer<00:05:44.599> so<00:05:45.080> you<00:05:45.500> have<00:05:45.680> to

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
it a little bit longer so you have to

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.730 
it a little bit longer so you have to
run<00:05:46.010> through<00:05:46.930> sort<00:05:47.930> of<00:05:47.990> the<00:05:48.110> bowels<00:05:48.620> of

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
run through sort of the bowels of

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.439 
run through sort of the bowels of
whatever<00:05:48.979> he's<00:05:49.310> stomach<00:05:49.760> or<00:05:49.910> whatever<00:05:50.180> here

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449 
whatever he's stomach or whatever here

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:53.260 
whatever he's stomach or whatever here
and<00:05:50.599> get<00:05:51.500> back<00:05:51.800> to<00:05:52.250> his<00:05:52.400> little<00:05:52.550> area<00:05:53.030> which

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
and get back to his little area which

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.850 
and get back to his little area which
isn't<00:05:53.449> too<00:05:53.780> bad<00:05:54.020> especially<00:05:54.229> if<00:05:54.620> you<00:05:54.710> use<00:05:54.740> a

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
isn't too bad especially if you use a

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.070 
isn't too bad especially if you use a
siren<00:05:55.400> with<00:05:55.880> a<00:05:55.910> breakneck<00:05:56.180> banshee<00:05:56.750> setup

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
siren with a breakneck banshee setup

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.560 
siren with a breakneck banshee setup
it's<00:05:57.260> really<00:05:57.590> not<00:05:57.770> too<00:05:57.949> bad<00:05:57.979> at<00:05:58.340> all<00:05:58.430> but<00:05:59.090> yeah

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
it's really not too bad at all but yeah

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.180 
it's really not too bad at all but yeah
I'm<00:05:59.750> gonna<00:05:59.870> show<00:06:00.020> you<00:06:00.229> here<00:06:00.500> just<00:06:00.740> to<00:06:00.979> see<00:06:01.160> that

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
I'm gonna show you here just to see that

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.670 
I'm gonna show you here just to see that
it's<00:06:01.729> all<00:06:01.880> aboveboard<00:06:02.180> it<00:06:02.900> definitely<00:06:03.440> works

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
it's all aboveboard it definitely works

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.700 
it's all aboveboard it definitely works
I<00:06:04.010> recorded<00:06:04.880> all<00:06:05.060> in<00:06:05.210> one<00:06:05.419> sitting<00:06:05.780> just<00:06:06.620> to

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
I recorded all in one sitting just to

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.350 
I recorded all in one sitting just to
make<00:06:06.860> sure<00:06:06.889> it<00:06:07.160> all<00:06:07.280> did<00:06:07.460> work<00:06:07.639> it's

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
make sure it all did work it's

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.050 
make sure it all did work it's
definitely<00:06:08.840> a<00:06:08.870> technique<00:06:09.139> like<00:06:09.889> I<00:06:10.039> said<00:06:10.280> it's

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
definitely a technique like I said it's

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.810 
definitely a technique like I said it's
a<00:06:11.180> very<00:06:11.419> old<00:06:11.660> technique<00:06:12.190> nobody<00:06:13.190> has<00:06:13.430> shown<00:06:13.460> me

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
a very old technique nobody has shown me

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.969 
a very old technique nobody has shown me
anything<00:06:14.030> new<00:06:14.360> yet<00:06:14.690> I've<00:06:15.349> spent<00:06:15.620> a<00:06:15.740> little<00:06:15.860> bit

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 
anything new yet I've spent a little bit

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:16.580 
anything new yet I've spent a little bit
of<00:06:16.070> time

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
of time

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.230 
of time
four<00:06:16.800> different<00:06:16.920> spots<00:06:17.370> where<00:06:17.670> I<00:06:17.700> may<00:06:17.970> be<00:06:18.030> able

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
four different spots where I may be able

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.020 
four different spots where I may be able
to<00:06:18.390> glitch<00:06:18.660> in<00:06:18.930> but<00:06:19.860> I<00:06:19.890> really<00:06:20.430> think<00:06:20.640> he<00:06:20.790> box

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
to glitch in but I really think he box

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.180 
to glitch in but I really think he box
of<00:06:21.300> maybe<00:06:21.960> put<00:06:22.170> a<00:06:22.200> bit<00:06:22.350> of<00:06:22.440> time<00:06:22.620> in<00:06:22.890> and<00:06:23.040> said

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
of maybe put a bit of time in and said

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.650 
of maybe put a bit of time in and said
okay<00:06:23.460> we<00:06:23.610> don't<00:06:23.760> want<00:06:23.880> people<00:06:24.120> getting<00:06:24.420> in

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
okay we don't want people getting in

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.470 
okay we don't want people getting in
like<00:06:24.870> this<00:06:25.050> but<00:06:25.110> a<00:06:25.860> little<00:06:26.250> bit<00:06:26.490> more<00:06:26.670> work<00:06:26.910> but

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:27.480 
like this but a little bit more work but

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.630 
like this but a little bit more work but
you<00:06:27.600> can<00:06:27.630> still<00:06:28.170> do<00:06:28.350> it<00:06:28.380> all<00:06:28.860> you<00:06:29.190> have<00:06:29.340> to<00:06:29.490> do

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:29.640 
you can still do it all you have to do

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.210 
you can still do it all you have to do
is<00:06:30.030> keep<00:06:30.450> that<00:06:30.810> mission<00:06:31.230> active<00:06:31.710> so<00:06:31.890> you<00:06:31.920> see

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
is keep that mission active so you see

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.710 
is keep that mission active so you see
up<00:06:32.340> on<00:06:32.430> the<00:06:32.490> screen<00:06:32.580> where<00:06:32.970> it<00:06:33.000> says<00:06:33.090> turn<00:06:33.480> in

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720
