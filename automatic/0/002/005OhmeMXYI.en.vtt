00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
have a lot of color it's only when you

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.050 
have a lot of color it's only when you
choose<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.650> kind<00:03:49.799> of<00:03:49.890> break<00:03:50.430> free<00:03:50.670> from<00:03:50.700> that

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060

choose to kind of break free from that
routine<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.510> think<00:03:51.840> for<00:03:51.959> yourself<00:03:52.350> and<00:03:52.650> be

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
routine and think for yourself and be

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.560 
routine and think for yourself and be
your<00:03:53.040> own<00:03:53.130> person<00:03:53.610> that's<00:03:54.180> when<00:03:54.299> you<00:03:54.360> discover

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
your own person that's when you discover

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.699 
your own person that's when you discover
color<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.230> that's<00:03:55.350> when<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:55.530> discover

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
color and that's when you discover

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.280 
color and that's when you discover
freedom<00:03:56.519> so<00:03:57.120> there's<00:03:57.420> there's<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.900> think<00:03:57.930> those

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
freedom so there's there's I think those

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.289 
freedom so there's there's I think those
themes<00:03:58.590> are<00:03:58.799> really<00:03:59.040> really<00:03:59.850> clear<00:04:00.090> in<00:04:00.209> the
