you<00:00:14.549> can<00:00:14.670> see<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:15.139> pre-built<00:00:16.139> two<00:00:16.379> samples<00:00:16.830> here

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
you can see I pre-built two samples here

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.849 
you can see I pre-built two samples here
one<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> normal<00:00:18.600> tree<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.080> one<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.500> tree

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
one is a normal tree and one is a tree

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.970 
one is a normal tree and one is a tree
using<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.699> trick<00:00:21.119> as<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:22.050> can<00:00:22.170> see<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.769> one

ladders now as you can see i am using a

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.090 
ladders now as you can see i am using a
mod<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.690> Game<00:00:48.899> inventory<00:00:49.440> editor<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.070> I

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
mod it is in Game inventory editor so I

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.380 
mod it is in Game inventory editor so I
don't<00:00:50.309> have<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.489> go<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.760> collect<00:00:50.940> all<00:00:51.270> these

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
don't have to go and collect all these

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.200 
don't have to go and collect all these
items<00:00:51.629> as<00:00:52.050> well<00:00:52.110> as<00:00:52.890> I'm<00:00:53.070> using<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.850> single

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
items as well as I'm using a single

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.090 
items as well as I'm using a single
player<00:00:54.390> console<00:00:54.930> commands<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.739> force

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
player console commands so I can force

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.090 
player console commands so I can force
the<00:00:56.370> growth<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.390> tree<00:00:57.649> so<00:00:58.649> we're<00:00:58.949> not

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the growth of the tree so we're not

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.160 
the growth of the tree so we're not
waiting<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.730> while<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.719> grow<00:01:01.309> okay<00:01:02.309> so

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
waiting a while for it to grow okay so

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.270 
waiting a while for it to grow okay so
how<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.439> going<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.710> work<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.040> we're<00:01:05.189> going

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
how this is going to work is we're going

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.130 
how this is going to work is we're going
to<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.460> building<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:06.000> ten<00:01:06.479> blocks<00:01:06.750> off<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
to be building this ten blocks off the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.520 
to be building this ten blocks off the
ground<00:01:07.590> okay<00:01:08.840> one<00:01:09.840> two<00:01:10.520> three<00:01:11.520> four<00:01:12.210> five<00:01:12.530> six

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
ground okay one two three four five six

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.740 
ground okay one two three four five six
seven<00:01:14.340> eight<00:01:15.150> nine<00:01:17.030> ten<00:01:18.030> okay<00:01:19.009> i<00:01:20.270> am<00:01:21.270> doing

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
seven eight nine ten okay i am doing

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.440 
seven eight nine ten okay i am doing
this<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.259> three<00:01:22.530> by<00:01:22.680> three<00:01:22.710> block<00:01:23.450> leaving

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
this in a three by three block leaving

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.920 
this in a three by three block leaving
the<00:01:24.600> center<00:01:24.960> block<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.439> dirt<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:27.420> then<00:01:27.689> just

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
the center block is dirt and then just

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.520 
the center block is dirt and then just
go<00:01:28.049> ahead<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:29.009> know<00:01:29.360> stack<00:01:30.360> all<00:01:30.570> these<00:01:30.600> up

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.760 

now<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:35.729> way<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.119> works<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:36.990> not<00:01:37.290> one

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
now the way this works is it is not one

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.179 
now the way this works is it is not one
hundred<00:01:37.979> percent<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.180> time<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:40.110> works<00:01:40.320> it

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
hundred percent of the time it works it

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.910 
hundred percent of the time it works it
does<00:01:41.670> have<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.079> about<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> thirty<00:01:43.470> five<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.860> forty

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
does have a about a thirty five to forty

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.480 
does have a about a thirty five to forty
percent<00:01:44.460> fail<00:01:44.909> rate<00:01:45.619> however<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.220> tree

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
percent fail rate however the tree

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.719 
percent fail rate however the tree
usually<00:01:48.110> if<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.710> doesn't<00:01:50.040> grow<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.490> full

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
usually if it doesn't grow to the full

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.719 
usually if it doesn't grow to the full
height<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.570> will<00:01:52.110> grow<00:01:52.500> taller<00:01:52.920> than<00:01:53.340> normal

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
height it will grow taller than normal

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.660 
height it will grow taller than normal
so<00:01:54.450> either<00:01:55.229> way<00:01:55.530> usually<00:01:55.829> it's<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.280> win<00:01:56.520> but<00:01:58.670> so

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
so either way usually it's a win but so

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:13.010 
so either way usually it's a win but so
go<00:02:00.570> ahead<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.810> finish<00:02:01.110> doing<00:02:01.439> this

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.370 

okay<00:02:14.020> go<00:02:14.349> ahead<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.709> make<00:02:14.860> that<00:02:14.890> archway<00:02:15.489> now

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:37.190 

okay<00:02:20.380> out<00:02:20.620> of<00:02:20.830> place<00:02:21.010> out<00:02:21.190> ladders<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:23.230> just

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.410 

okay<00:02:38.200> once<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.769> letter<00:02:39.010> is<00:02:39.130> your<00:02:39.280> place<00:02:39.519> then

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
okay once the letter is your place then

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.720 
okay once the letter is your place then
all<00:02:40.569> you<00:02:40.720> have<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.989> do<00:02:41.170> is<00:02:41.319> plant<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.739> sapling<00:02:42.220> in

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
all you have to do is plant a sapling in

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.710 
all you have to do is plant a sapling in
the<00:02:42.819> middle<00:02:44.610> mmm<00:02:45.610> then<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.209> wait<00:02:46.390> for<00:02:46.599> it<00:02:46.690> to

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
the middle mmm then you wait for it to

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.839 
the middle mmm then you wait for it to
grill<00:02:47.019> I<00:02:47.260> will<00:02:47.980> be<00:02:48.069> forcing<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.640> growth

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
grill I will be forcing the growth

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:56.789 
grill I will be forcing the growth
however<00:02:49.060> for<00:02:49.750> this<00:02:49.840> video<00:02:50.849> so<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:56.290> see

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
however for this video so and see

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.009 
however for this video so and see
there's<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.430> shining<00:02:57.849> example<00:02:57.940> of<00:02:58.510> what<00:02:58.750> will

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
there's a shining example of what will

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.280 
there's a shining example of what will
happen<00:02:59.130> some<00:03:00.130> of<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.370> time<00:03:00.579> all<00:03:01.540> you<00:03:01.840> do<00:03:02.049> to

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
happen some of the time all you do to

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.080 
happen some of the time all you do to
fix<00:03:03.069> it<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.579> just<00:03:03.819> go<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:06.370> you<00:03:06.549> break<00:03:06.849> it<00:03:07.060> and

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
fix it you just go and you break it and

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.839 
fix it you just go and you break it and
you<00:03:07.420> wait<00:03:07.599> for<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:07.930> hold<00:03:08.200> it<00:03:08.319> clear<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:08.849> then

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
you wait for that hold it clear and then

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:17.670 
you wait for that hold it clear and then
we<00:03:09.940> grow<00:03:10.150> it<00:03:10.299> again<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.670> there<00:03:16.120> we<00:03:16.209> go<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:17.500> go

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
we grow it again and there we go so go

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:33.700 
we grow it again and there we go so go
ahead<00:03:17.829> and<00:03:18.100> we'll<00:03:18.940> try<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.299> growing<00:03:19.810> it<00:03:19.900> again

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.190 

and<00:03:34.340> you<00:03:34.580> didn't<00:03:34.910> grow<00:03:35.120> tall<00:03:35.570> right<00:03:36.410> I<00:03:38.200> forgot

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
and you didn't grow tall right I forgot

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.530 
and you didn't grow tall right I forgot
um<00:03:39.800> when<00:03:40.310> it<00:03:40.430> does<00:03:40.640> this<00:03:40.940> this<00:03:41.210> is<00:03:41.390> an

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
um when it does this this is an

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.810 
um when it does this this is an
important<00:03:42.080> step<00:03:42.260> to<00:03:42.650> it<00:03:42.830> oops<00:03:43.130> okay<00:03:43.790> i

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
important step to it oops okay i

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.430 
important step to it oops okay i
accidentally<00:03:44.800> get<00:03:45.800> rid<00:03:46.010> of<00:03:46.040> some<00:03:46.250> of<00:03:46.430> it

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
accidentally get rid of some of it

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.630 
accidentally get rid of some of it
important<00:03:48.440> step<00:03:48.680> to<00:03:48.830> this<00:03:48.980> is<00:03:49.220> you<00:03:49.400> need<00:03:49.610> to

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
important step to this is you need to

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.390 
important step to this is you need to
get<00:03:49.880> rid<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.390> leaves<00:03:50.600> that<00:03:50.840> are<00:03:50.900> outside

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
get rid of the leaves that are outside

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.070 
get rid of the leaves that are outside
because<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.550> way<00:03:52.670> this<00:03:52.850> works<00:03:53.150> is<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:53.900> the

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
because the way this works is that the

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.840 
because the way this works is that the
height<00:03:54.440> of<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.710> tower<00:03:54.890> is<00:03:55.160> tricking<00:03:55.700> the

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
height of the tower is tricking the

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.640 
height of the tower is tricking the
sapling<00:03:56.330> into<00:03:56.570> believing<00:03:57.050> that<00:03:57.170> that's<00:03:57.350> the

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
sapling into believing that that's the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.000 
sapling into believing that that's the
floor<00:03:58.150> so<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.180> grows<00:03:59.630> to<00:03:59.900> the<00:03:59.930> height<00:04:00.230> of<00:04:00.500> what

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
floor so it grows to the height of what

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.710 
floor so it grows to the height of what
it<00:04:01.130> believes<00:04:01.490> to<00:04:01.580> be<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.790> floor<00:04:02.440> so<00:04:04.720> external

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
it believes to be the floor so external

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.170 
it believes to be the floor so external
stuff<00:04:05.990> around<00:04:06.380> it<00:04:06.650> will<00:04:06.950> actually<00:04:07.190> make<00:04:07.610> it<00:04:07.790> do

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
stuff around it will actually make it do

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.280 
stuff around it will actually make it do
or<00:04:08.630> go<00:04:08.920> shorter<00:04:09.920> than<00:04:10.070> it<00:04:10.100> should<00:04:10.750> so<00:04:11.750> let's<00:04:12.170> go

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
or go shorter than it should so let's go

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.720 
or go shorter than it should so let's go
ahead<00:04:12.320> and<00:04:12.500> grow<00:04:12.740> it<00:04:12.890> and<00:04:13.010> there<00:04:13.460> we<00:04:13.580> have<00:04:13.610> it

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
ahead and grow it and there we have it

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.240 
ahead and grow it and there we have it
as<00:04:14.080> you<00:04:15.080> can<00:04:15.230> see<00:04:15.410> it<00:04:15.620> grow<00:04:15.770> it<00:04:15.830> to<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.040> top<00:04:16.190> of

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
as you can see it grow it to the top of

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.580 
as you can see it grow it to the top of
the<00:04:16.400> tower<00:04:16.610> then<00:04:17.600> all<00:04:17.750> you<00:04:17.780> have<00:04:17.900> to<00:04:18.200> do<00:04:18.380> is

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
the tower then all you have to do is

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.550 
the tower then all you have to do is
take<00:04:18.920> a<00:04:18.950> take<00:04:19.820> your<00:04:20.000> pick<00:04:20.180> X<00:04:20.420> come<00:04:20.989> up<00:04:21.170> here

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.830 

make<00:04:24.560> yourself<00:04:24.590> a<00:04:25.040> hole<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:25.820> cut<00:04:26.600> down<00:04:26.810> your

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
make yourself a hole and cut down your

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:36.100 
make yourself a hole and cut down your
wood<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:32.780> see<00:04:33.080> I<00:04:33.260> just<00:04:33.380> got<00:04:33.970> you<00:04:34.970> know<00:04:35.110> from

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
wood and see I just got you know from

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.380 
wood and see I just got you know from
those<00:04:36.320> three<00:04:36.500> trees<00:04:36.800> 21<00:04:37.430> would<00:04:37.640> not<00:04:38.000> too<00:04:38.210> bad

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
those three trees 21 would not too bad

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.380 
those three trees 21 would not too bad
and<00:04:38.720> then<00:04:39.590> just<00:04:40.250> you<00:04:40.700> know<00:04:40.820> wait<00:04:41.090> for<00:04:41.300> the

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
and then just you know wait for the

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.940 
and then just you know wait for the
leaves<00:04:41.570> to<00:04:41.780> go<00:04:41.930> away<00:04:42.170> you'll<00:04:42.500> probably<00:04:42.740> get

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
leaves to go away you'll probably get

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.550 
leaves to go away you'll probably get
more<00:04:43.160> saplings<00:04:43.730> from<00:04:43.880> it<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:44.320> then<00:04:45.320> just

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
more saplings from it and then just

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.910 
more saplings from it and then just
plant<00:04:45.920> it<00:04:46.040> again<00:04:46.340> and<00:04:46.580> wait<00:04:46.910> for<00:04:47.150> it<00:04:47.210> to<00:04:47.240> grow

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
plant it again and wait for it to grow

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.220 
plant it again and wait for it to grow
if<00:04:48.920> you're<00:04:49.400> going<00:04:49.760> to<00:04:49.970> use<00:04:50.330> these<00:04:50.510> as<00:04:50.570> farmers

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
if you're going to use these as farmers

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.530 
if you're going to use these as farmers
they<00:04:51.500> must<00:04:51.740> be<00:04:51.920> three<00:04:52.250> blocks<00:04:52.580> space<00:04:53.000> meaning

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
they must be three blocks space meaning

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.480 
they must be three blocks space meaning
if<00:04:54.320> I<00:04:54.410> were<00:04:54.530> going<00:04:54.620> to<00:04:54.680> do<00:04:54.860> another<00:04:55.100> one<00:04:55.310> like

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
if I were going to do another one like

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.130 
if I were going to do another one like
this<00:04:55.700> you<00:04:56.210> would<00:04:56.330> want<00:04:56.540> to<00:04:56.630> count<00:04:56.870> three

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
this you would want to count three

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:06.450 
this you would want to count three
blocks<00:04:57.380> over<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:57.980> build<00:04:58.760> it<00:04:59.000> like<00:04:59.260> right<00:05:00.260> here

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.040 

okay<00:05:07.460> because<00:05:07.880> if<00:05:08.030> it's<00:05:08.150> any<00:05:08.330> closer<00:05:08.630> it<00:05:08.930> will

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
okay because if it's any closer it will

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.420 
okay because if it's any closer it will
interfere<00:05:09.290> with<00:05:09.620> the<00:05:09.740> growth<00:05:09.950> of<00:05:09.980> the<00:05:10.280> tree

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
interfere with the growth of the tree

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.200 
interfere with the growth of the tree
inside<00:05:10.820> of<00:05:11.000> it<00:05:12.190> another<00:05:13.190> note<00:05:13.490> too<00:05:13.730> I<00:05:14.000> would

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
inside of it another note too I would

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.150 
inside of it another note too I would
not<00:05:14.360> recommend<00:05:14.510> grill<00:05:15.110> are<00:05:15.350> making<00:05:15.800> the<00:05:15.920> tower

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
not recommend grill are making the tower

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.210 
not recommend grill are making the tower
any<00:05:16.580> bigger<00:05:16.940> than<00:05:17.060> 10<00:05:17.390> blocks<00:05:17.830> any<00:05:18.830> bigger

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
any bigger than 10 blocks any bigger

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.250 
any bigger than 10 blocks any bigger
than<00:05:19.280> 10<00:05:19.550> blocks<00:05:19.790> because<00:05:20.480> it<00:05:20.870> will<00:05:21.080> then

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
than 10 blocks because it will then

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.020 
than 10 blocks because it will then
begin<00:05:21.470> to<00:05:21.620> bug<00:05:21.890> the<00:05:22.100> tree<00:05:22.340> out<00:05:22.490> to<00:05:22.700> where<00:05:22.850> it

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
begin to bug the tree out to where it
