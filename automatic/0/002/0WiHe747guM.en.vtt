00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.130
 Now I want to come to the press conference 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.540
 for tus koblenz against first fc 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.299
 Saarbrücken welcomes the two men 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.770
 from kilic and petrik sander kilic 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.449
 Congrats on the victory and your comment 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.340
 thank you first we knew 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.560
 that will be very intense game 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.180
 we have prepared ourselves 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.119
 also said alone only by 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.710
 playful or advance playful 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.329
 page we can not stand here 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.739
 we knew what to expect 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.850
 in my opinion very well done 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.620
 my team has that very well 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.640
 implemented the fight have accepted 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.870
 We usually can for games 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.660
 one thinks that we express ourselves in 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.180
 dominate all matters we have if 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.920
 Koblenz then became dangerous 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.170
 standard situations over the far 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.000
 Throw in or then the long ones 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.829
 free kick from your own half or 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.199
 or far from the penalty room 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.879
 Since we have had problems we have 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.670
 outstanding goalkeeper today in the back 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.809
 who brought us everything away 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.159
 if anything has over ours 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.530
 defender or the defensive line 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.640
 has gone on in all of us 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.619
 kept in play 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.380
 but nonetheless, I think so 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.000
 it was a deserved victory and like him 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.270
 then the three points 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.680
 deservedly still be able to take 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.390
 otherwise from my side wishes 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.259
 of course, by koblenz that they are the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.630
 keep great 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.790
 I have a connection to this myself 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.490
 I grew up near here 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.460
 therefore, the glad if you 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.229
 if you survive the struggle for promotion and 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:41.240
 Last but not least in the league 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:44.009
 Thank you first congratulations 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.490
 I have a slightly different view 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.490
 this game 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.090
 some play over 90 minutes considered 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:55.070
 so I do not have that big now 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.869
 difference and dominance 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.829
 already not at all I think both 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.420
 Teams have in theirs 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:03.770
 play in your in your structure 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.619
 changed many many long balls and what 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.179
 the difference was partly the 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.290
 individual quality of the players 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.930
 if you are then inattentive 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.239
 then of course that will be brutal 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.340
 exploited and that little bit of this 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.049
 take advantage of this mistake from us 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.549
 that was the key of this 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.440
 difference because everything else was a lot 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.170
 with new coach situation and with 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.819
 interruptions and free-kicks 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.140
 but we are in a relegation battle 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.010
 That's why I think that's legitimate 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.540
 I think the team has changed 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.630
 because of the second half we have 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.750
 a monster chance from danko boskovic 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.640
 and things like that wherever they're needed 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.880
 would have this point too 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.280
 deserved but that was unfortunately 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.269
 unfortunately not so in the engagement and 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.069
 which can upset the militant 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.239
 I can only agree with that 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.120
 only one of my team a praise 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:03.079
 pay that was okay 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.280
 and logically I wish for after 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.000
 we do our homework 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.590
 saarbrücken the climb is also 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.850
 Of course, that 's probable for us 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:17.000
 even then it has consequences and 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.769
 all the best for you and we would be further 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.709
 We will continue this line 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.760
 so we must see that we are 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.470
 us also for this we spent 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.079
 that is infinitely and 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.940
 Guys march and I can not do that 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.069
 reproach us for moving on 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.510
 reward and that will happen too 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.150
 because sooner or later it pays 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.519
 there are many thanks for such work 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.209
 ask the two trainer short 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.079
 show of hands 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.079
 if that's the case 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.330
 the fight one on the heel 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.380
 he does not get that sensible anymore 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.360
 could occur 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.100
 and signaled that he no longer 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.520
 can continue playing and that's why we have 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.520
 the change 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.299
 we have changed 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.310
 Markus Beyer marco meyer aid has 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.220
 right back then played so that 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.500
 mandy has acted offensively and the ball 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.289
 comes naturally optimal mandy throws herself 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:50.600
 in there and yes pleasing for us that 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:52.210
 The thing then goes in we ask 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.789
 have discussed this last night 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.350
 we saw that as a signal 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.350
 we are now even more in the duty 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.690
 when people act their own 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.949
 Press and press person in the background 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.650
 we will say we do not want any 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.210
 smoldering fire is not a variable but 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.220
 we just want to relax in the environment we 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.650
 want to do everything that the 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.539
 Team the team reasonable 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.010
 prepare for the last games 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.380
 can or even tackle that 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.380
 Can I find that a huge thing 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.500
 we depend on both sides how 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.840
 already dependent on the presidency anyway of 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.699
 all involved and we 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.050
 are just as dependent on the fans 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.639
 means if we can do it again as 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.500
 unit to function also up to 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.360
 Finally, I hope that we too 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.360
 to go that way again 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:47.719
 That was a very nice coincidence 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.550
 continue to ask all questions 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:50.959
 answered then thought our guests 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.059
 a good trip home munich we see 

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:56.649
 then pattern sunday then he lets us 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:56.649
 to leave a guest in the chip
