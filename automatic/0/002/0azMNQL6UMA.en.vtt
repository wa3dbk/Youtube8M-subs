thousands and thousands of hours and
that's<00:01:13.700> really<00:01:13.850> what<00:01:14.030> makes<00:01:14.209> it<00:01:14.479> work<00:01:14.689> if<00:01:15.170> we

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
that's really what makes it work if we

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:16.809 
that's really what makes it work if we
didn't<00:01:15.499> have<00:01:15.529> them<00:01:15.799> here<00:01:16.069> it<00:01:16.310> just<00:01:16.549> wouldn't

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:16.819 
didn't have them here it just wouldn't

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:19.249 
happen all of our volunteers go through

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:21.069 
happen all of our volunteers go through
a<00:01:19.310> pretty<00:01:19.549> rigorous<00:01:19.759> training<00:01:20.270> before<00:01:20.929> we

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
everyone should give it a shot because

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.109 
everyone should give it a shot because
