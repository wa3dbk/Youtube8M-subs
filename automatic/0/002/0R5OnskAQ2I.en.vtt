is the GPMG that me and Tom Armitage had
made<00:00:10.880> King<00:00:11.880> floor<00:00:12.380> now<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.440> G<00:00:13.740> PNG<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.309> very

made King floor now the G PNG is a very
high<00:00:14.849> level<00:00:15.030> commando<00:00:15.570> weapon<00:00:16.789> it's<00:00:17.789> slightly

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
high level commando weapon it's slightly

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.359 
high level commando weapon it's slightly
different<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:19.080> what<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.529> lot<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.890> commandos

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
different to what a lot of the commandos

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.900 
different to what a lot of the commandos
have<00:00:20.520> got<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:20.910> far<00:00:21.150> it's<00:00:22.050> more<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.910> heavy

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
have got so far it's more of a heavy

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.380 
have got so far it's more of a heavy
weapon<00:00:24.390> as<00:00:25.080> opposed<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.939> an<00:00:26.939> assault<00:00:27.330> rifle

weapon as opposed to an assault rifle
like<00:00:28.320> or<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> bigger<00:00:28.830> assault<00:00:29.189> rifle<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.760> it

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
like or a bigger assault rifle and it

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.970 
like or a bigger assault rifle and it
has<00:00:30.300> some<00:00:30.510> benefits<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.410> also<00:00:31.560> comes<00:00:31.890> with

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
has some benefits it also comes with

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.459 
has some benefits it also comes with
some<00:00:32.160> quite<00:00:32.759> significant<00:00:33.360> drawbacks<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.320> if

some quite significant drawbacks and if

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.810 
some quite significant drawbacks and if
you<00:00:34.590> pick<00:00:34.800> up<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.010> GPMG<00:00:35.399> you're<00:00:35.670> probably

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
you pick up the GPMG you're probably

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.639 
you pick up the GPMG you're probably
going<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.120> be<00:00:36.180> playing<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.570> GPMG<00:00:36.989> as<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> kind

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
going to be playing the GPMG as a kind

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.139 
going to be playing the GPMG as a kind
of<00:00:38.149> subclass<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.469> commando<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.760> first

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
of subclass of the commando so first

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.590 
of subclass of the commando so first
things<00:00:42.329> first<00:00:43.100> it<00:00:44.100> has<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.730> default<00:00:45.030> three

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
things first it has a default three

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
things first it has a default three
round<00:00:45.840> burst<00:00:47.059> firing<00:00:48.059> mode<00:00:48.360> now<00:00:49.350> there<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.590> a

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
round burst firing mode now there is a

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.229 
round burst firing mode now there is a
bit<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.800> an<00:00:49.920> animation<00:00:50.219> error<00:00:50.579> with<00:00:51.059> three

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
bit of an animation error with three

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.490 
bit of an animation error with three
round<00:00:51.420> bursts<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.780> I'm<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.140> fixing

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
round bursts so I'm going to be fixing

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.900 
round bursts so I'm going to be fixing
but<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.649> wanted<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.920> get<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.160> out<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.489> weekend

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
but I wanted to get it out this weekend

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.850 
but I wanted to get it out this weekend
somebody<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.390> try<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.500> give<00:00:55.649> me<00:00:55.680> some

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
somebody can try it and give me some

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.279 
somebody can try it and give me some
feedback<00:00:56.039> on<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.460> balance<00:00:56.760> now<00:00:57.420> three<00:00:58.140> round

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
feedback on the balance now three round

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.209 
feedback on the balance now three round
burst<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> high<00:00:59.430> spread<00:00:59.850> low<00:01:00.660> damage<00:01:01.219> mode

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
burst is a high spread low damage mode

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.830 
burst is a high spread low damage mode
which<00:01:02.789> allows<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.210> move<00:01:03.480> around<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
which allows you to move around the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.260 
which allows you to move around the
reposition<00:01:04.470> at<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> cost<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.880> some<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.090> your

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
reposition at the cost of some of your

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.710 
reposition at the cost of some of your
ammo<00:01:06.420> efficiency<00:01:07.020> now<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:09.150> reason<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.570> is

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
ammo efficiency now the reason this is

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.830 
ammo efficiency now the reason this is
important<00:01:10.170> will<00:01:10.260> come<00:01:10.470> up<00:01:10.590> later<00:01:10.970> but<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.689> gun

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
important will come up later but the gun

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.810 
important will come up later but the gun
has<00:01:13.020> two<00:01:13.229> firing<00:01:13.530> ways<00:01:13.799> tactical<00:01:14.340> burst<00:01:14.580> mode

has two firing ways tactical burst mode

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.190 
has two firing ways tactical burst mode
which<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.330> one-on-one<00:01:15.479> alignment<00:01:16.049> which

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
which is the one-on-one alignment which

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.520 
which is the one-on-one alignment which
fires<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.619> three<00:01:16.740> round<00:01:16.890> burst

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
fires a three round burst

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.720 
fires a three round burst
that's<00:01:19.430> kind<00:01:19.640> of<00:01:19.700> low<00:01:19.820> recoil

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
some drawbacks to balance it out now

this<00:01:51.410> means<00:01:51.650> that<00:01:51.800> if<00:01:51.890> you're<00:01:52.070> fighting

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
crouching will remove the kickback so

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.790 
crouching will remove the kickback so
you'll<00:01:59.840> only<00:01:59.869> get<00:02:00.170> kick<00:02:00.440> when<00:02:00.680> you're

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
and getting the extra damage with none

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.710 
and getting the extra damage with none
of<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.900> movement<00:02:06.890> penalties<00:02:09.970> what<00:02:10.970> else

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
of the movement penalties what else

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.740 
of the movement penalties what else
oh<00:02:12.489> the<00:02:13.489> GPM<00:02:13.820> -<00:02:13.880> you<00:02:13.970> can<00:02:14.090> only<00:02:14.180> be<00:02:14.330> reloaded

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
oh the GPM - you can only be reloaded

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.890 
oh the GPM - you can only be reloaded
when<00:02:14.870> it's<00:02:14.989> empty<00:02:16.330> this<00:02:17.330> means<00:02:17.600> that<00:02:17.750> you'll

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
when it's empty this means that you'll

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.020 
when it's empty this means that you'll
have<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.260> be<00:02:18.770> very<00:02:19.040> careful<00:02:19.520> how<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:19.700> use<00:02:20.000> your

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
have to be very careful how you use your

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.729 
have to be very careful how you use your
ammo<00:02:20.330> because<00:02:20.720> at<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:20.989> moment<00:02:21.020> you<00:02:21.350> only<00:02:21.500> have

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
ammo because at the moment you only have

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.520 
ammo because at the moment you only have
a<00:02:21.770> maximum<00:02:22.280> of<00:02:22.310> 200<00:02:22.489> rounds<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:24.170> you're<00:02:24.350> gonna

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
a maximum of 200 rounds so you're gonna

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.430 
a maximum of 200 rounds so you're gonna
have<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.800> be<00:02:25.010> really<00:02:25.489> sparing<00:02:25.940> with<00:02:26.030> it<00:02:26.440> and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
have to be really sparing with it and

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.370 
have to be really sparing with it and
only<00:02:27.890> like<00:02:28.519> you<00:02:29.510> want<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.720> be<00:02:29.840> firing<00:02:30.080> very

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
only like you want to be firing very

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.250 
only like you want to be firing very
tight<00:02:30.709> bursts<00:02:31.100> now<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.489> other<00:02:31.730> thing<00:02:31.910> is

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
tight bursts now the other thing is

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.420 
tight bursts now the other thing is
while<00:02:33.260> standing<00:02:33.620> up<00:02:33.709> in<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:33.920> automatic<00:02:34.250> mode

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
while standing up in the automatic mode

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.280 
while standing up in the automatic mode
your<00:02:35.060> recoil<00:02:35.570> is<00:02:36.110> insane<00:02:37.810> your<00:02:38.810> spread<00:02:39.140> is

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
your recoil is insane your spread is

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.500 
your recoil is insane your spread is
also<00:02:39.530> quite<00:02:39.769> wide<00:02:40.040> -<00:02:40.459> however<00:02:40.820> if<00:02:41.330> you're

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
also quite wide - however if you're

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.320 
also quite wide - however if you're
going<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:41.780> aim<00:02:41.930> mode<00:02:42.489> your<00:02:43.489> spread<00:02:43.820> goes<00:02:44.060> down

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
going to aim mode your spread goes down

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.040 
going to aim mode your spread goes down
and<00:02:44.660> if<00:02:45.019> you<00:02:45.140> crouch<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.650> name<00:02:46.570> actually<00:02:47.570> become

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
and if you crouch a name actually become

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.080 
and if you crouch a name actually become
very<00:02:50.760> very<00:02:51.760> precise

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.960 

so<00:02:57.690> yeah<00:02:58.370> tactical<00:02:59.370> moves<00:02:59.550> moving<00:02:59.880> around

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
so yeah tactical moves moving around

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.270 
so yeah tactical moves moving around
fully<00:03:00.720> automatic<00:03:01.200> mode<00:03:01.319> is<00:03:01.620> more<00:03:01.860> of<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.069> kind

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
fully automatic mode is more of a kind

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.850 
fully automatic mode is more of a kind
of<00:03:02.459> area<00:03:02.849> denial<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.959> as<00:03:04.110> a<00:03:04.200> commando<00:03:04.650> you're

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
of area denial so as a commando you're

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.830 
of area denial so as a commando you're
probably<00:03:05.040> going<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.310> be<00:03:05.370> sat<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.910> wouldn't<00:03:06.720> say

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
probably going to be sat I wouldn't say

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.839 
probably going to be sat I wouldn't say
in<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.020> back<00:03:07.290> you're<00:03:08.099> gonna<00:03:08.160> be<00:03:08.370> sat<00:03:08.670> on<00:03:08.819> our

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
in the back you're gonna be sat on our

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.390 
in the back you're gonna be sat on our
flank<00:03:09.599> defending<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.590> flank<00:03:10.920> with<00:03:11.160> fully

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
flank defending that flank with fully

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.580 
flank defending that flank with fully
automatic<00:03:11.459> mode<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.420> then<00:03:13.110> if<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.319> need<00:03:13.470> to

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
automatic mode and then if you need to

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.930 
automatic mode and then if you need to
move<00:03:13.769> or<00:03:14.010> run<00:03:14.099> away<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:15.840> can<00:03:16.519> you<00:03:17.519> can<00:03:17.670> do<00:03:17.790> that

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
move or run away you can you can do that

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.400 
move or run away you can you can do that
by<00:03:18.120> switching<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.510> tactical<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:19.110> be<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.230> bit

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
by switching to tactical and be a bit

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:29.760 
by switching to tactical and be a bit
freer

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:38.250 

see<00:03:30.770> how<00:03:31.160> effective<00:03:31.520> that<00:03:31.550> was<00:03:35.980> now<00:03:36.980> as<00:03:37.310> a

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
see how effective that was now as a

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.900 
see how effective that was now as a
interesting<00:03:39.260> bug<00:03:39.530> that<00:03:40.370> we<00:03:40.489> haven't<00:03:40.760> actually

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
interesting bug that we haven't actually

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.470 
interesting bug that we haven't actually
fixed<00:03:41.480> is<00:03:41.750> that<00:03:42.170> I'm<00:03:42.950> firing<00:03:43.459> automatic<00:03:43.640> fires

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
fixed is that I'm firing automatic fires

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.780 
fixed is that I'm firing automatic fires
two<00:03:45.110> bullets<00:03:45.140> instead<00:03:45.709> of<00:03:45.860> one<00:03:46.069> for<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:46.550> first

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
two bullets instead of one for the first

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.070 
two bullets instead of one for the first
shot<00:03:47.000> and<00:03:47.300> then<00:03:47.390> everything<00:03:47.810> else<00:03:47.900> is

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
shot and then everything else is

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.710 
shot and then everything else is
incremental<00:03:48.620> eyes<00:03:49.180> this<00:03:50.180> means<00:03:50.450> that<00:03:50.599> you

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
incremental eyes this means that you

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.430 
incremental eyes this means that you
can't<00:03:51.370> really<00:03:52.370> abuse<00:03:53.170> also<00:03:56.140> you<00:03:57.140> you'll<00:03:57.410> have

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
can't really abuse also you you'll have

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.670 
can't really abuse also you you'll have
to<00:03:57.590> seriously<00:03:58.099> consider<00:03:59.170> about<00:04:00.170> emptying

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
to seriously consider about emptying

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.350 
to seriously consider about emptying
your<00:04:00.709> mag<00:04:01.010> bullets<00:04:01.489> are<00:04:01.610> very<00:04:01.790> expensive<00:04:02.030> for

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
your mag bullets are very expensive for

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.190 
your mag bullets are very expensive for
this<00:04:02.420> as<00:04:02.569> well

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
this as well

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.410 
this as well
it's<00:04:03.470> retailing<00:04:03.950> I<00:04:04.310> think<00:04:04.790> I<00:04:05.000> don't<00:04:05.150> know<00:04:05.299> how

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
it's retailing I think I don't know how

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.580 
it's retailing I think I don't know how
much<00:04:05.569> is<00:04:05.690> reaching<00:04:06.019> before<00:04:06.260> I<00:04:06.319> think<00:04:06.410> it's

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
much is reaching before I think it's

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.650 
much is reaching before I think it's
applied<00:04:06.830> over<00:04:07.069> 2,000<00:04:07.610> this<00:04:07.940> is<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.090> very<00:04:08.390> high

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
applied over 2,000 this is a very high

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:17.270 
applied over 2,000 this is a very high
tier<00:04:08.989> commando<00:04:09.709> weapon<00:04:10.040> so<00:04:11.470> yeah<00:04:13.239> the

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.240 

oh<00:04:17.329> yes<00:04:18.329> so<00:04:18.750> if<00:04:19.170> you<00:04:19.290> know<00:04:19.380> if<00:04:19.410> I'm<00:04:19.709> firing

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
oh yes so if you know if I'm firing

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.039 
oh yes so if you know if I'm firing
I'm<00:04:20.430> clicking<00:04:20.730> once<00:04:21.060> but<00:04:21.329> it's<00:04:21.450> firing<00:04:21.690> twice

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
I'm clicking once but it's firing twice

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.470 
I'm clicking once but it's firing twice
this<00:04:22.620> is<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:22.890> stop<00:04:23.040> people<00:04:23.190> abusing<00:04:23.700> semi<00:04:24.240> mode

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
this is to stop people abusing semi mode

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.880 
this is to stop people abusing semi mode
and<00:04:24.750> just<00:04:24.930> picking<00:04:25.170> off<00:04:25.230> head<00:04:25.440> shots

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
and just picking off head shots

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.560 
and just picking off head shots
well<00:04:26.310> then<00:04:26.490> essentially<00:04:27.000> getting<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.390> hundred

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
well then essentially getting a hundred

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.280 
well then essentially getting a hundred
round<00:04:27.900> mag<00:04:28.140> for<00:04:28.590> head<00:04:28.770> shots<00:04:29.720> so<00:04:30.720> it<00:04:30.990> kind<00:04:31.200> of

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
round mag for head shots so it kind of

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.970 
round mag for head shots so it kind of
it<00:04:31.530> kind<00:04:31.680> of<00:04:31.800> impedes<00:04:32.280> that<00:04:32.520> if<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:32.880> notice

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
it kind of impedes that if you notice

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
it kind of impedes that if you notice
when<00:04:34.980> I<00:04:35.040> actually<00:04:35.220> do<00:04:35.490> start<00:04:35.790> firing

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
when I actually do start firing

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.780 
when I actually do start firing
automatic<00:04:36.240> it<00:04:36.990> goes<00:04:37.260> down<00:04:37.670> incremental<00:04:38.670> e<00:04:38.730> as

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
automatic it goes down incremental e as

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:49.140 
automatic it goes down incremental e as
it<00:04:38.940> should

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.090 

so<00:04:49.780> this<00:04:49.930> is<00:04:50.080> how<00:04:50.260> devastating<00:04:50.889> fully

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
so this is how devastating fully

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.659 
so this is how devastating fully
automatic<00:04:51.580> can<00:04:51.699> be<00:04:53.010> but<00:04:54.010> I<00:04:54.040> do<00:04:54.130> think<00:04:54.460> it's

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
automatic can be but I do think it's

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.330 
automatic can be but I do think it's
quite<00:04:54.880> this<00:04:55.150> is<00:04:55.210> hard<00:04:55.540> mode<00:04:55.750> by<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.020> way<00:04:56.169> I<00:04:56.949> do

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
quite this is hard mode by the way I do

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.320 
quite this is hard mode by the way I do
think<00:04:57.760> it's<00:04:57.880> quite<00:04:58.210> easy<00:04:59.050> for<00:04:59.380> you<00:04:59.650> to<00:04:59.860> get

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
think it's quite easy for you to get

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.110 
think it's quite easy for you to get
overwhelmed<00:05:02.070> if<00:05:03.070> you<00:05:03.280> haven't<00:05:03.580> got<00:05:03.669> a<00:05:03.699> team<00:05:03.940> to

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
overwhelmed if you haven't got a team to

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.760 
overwhelmed if you haven't got a team to
back<00:05:04.270> you<00:05:04.389> up<00:05:04.419> so<00:05:05.260> now<00:05:05.350> we're<00:05:05.440> going<00:05:05.530> to<00:05:05.620> switch

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
back you up so now we're going to switch

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.200 
back you up so now we're going to switch
to<00:05:05.800> tactical

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.339 

now

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
now

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:14.649 
now
