00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
is I don't know I think a handbag if

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.940 
is I don't know I think a handbag if
you're<00:01:21.780> gonna<00:01:21.900> especially<00:01:22.530> if<00:01:22.680> you're<00:01:22.799> gonna

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950

about<00:05:13.240> this<00:05:13.930> bag<00:05:14.260> is<00:05:14.590> the<00:05:14.860> fact<00:05:15.130> that<00:05:15.280> you<00:05:16.030> know

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
about this bag is the fact that you know

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.940 
about this bag is the fact that you know
because<00:05:16.480> it<00:05:17.290> has<00:05:17.500> all<00:05:17.740> these<00:05:18.300> markings<00:05:19.300> on<00:05:20.169> the

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950

because it has all these markings on the
leather<00:05:21.220> strap<00:05:21.700> I<00:05:22.060> think<00:05:22.750> you<00:05:23.169> know<00:05:23.290> due<00:05:23.530> to

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
leather strap I think you know due to

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.400 
leather strap I think you know due to
age<00:05:23.980> and<00:05:24.460> due<00:05:24.970> to<00:05:25.180> the<00:05:25.330> leather<00:05:25.510> softening<00:05:26.260> and

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
age and due to the leather softening and

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.500 
age and due to the leather softening and
then<00:05:26.560> has<00:05:26.830> all<00:05:27.010> these<00:05:27.190> marks<00:05:27.669> I<00:05:27.850> don't<00:05:28.270> really
