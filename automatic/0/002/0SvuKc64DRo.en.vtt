00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
chocolate is still very coarse therefore

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.690 
chocolate is still very coarse therefore
we<00:03:35.989> mill<00:03:36.230> it<00:03:36.379> longer<00:03:36.799> so<00:03:36.980> that<00:03:37.430> the

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
we mill it longer so that the

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.460 
we mill it longer so that the
ingredients<00:03:37.790> are<00:03:38.269> ground<00:03:38.540> very<00:03:38.810> fine<00:03:39.169> and

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
ingredients are ground very fine and

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.429

smell the long stirring time makes the

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:49.509 
smell the long stirring time makes the

chocolate soft and creamy Anna has to

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.030 
chocolate soft and creamy Anna has to
stir<00:03:49.730> for<00:03:50.060> a<00:03:50.090> long<00:03:50.329> time<00:03:50.689> now<00:03:50.900> so<00:03:51.560> we'll<00:03:51.739> take<00:03:51.980> a

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
stir for a long time now so we'll take a

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.409 
stir for a long time now so we'll take a
look<00:03:52.280> at<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.519> machine<00:03:52.849> that<00:03:53.060> stirs<00:03:53.389> the
