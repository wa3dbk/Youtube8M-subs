we've learned that running in circles

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.920 
we've learned that running in circles
doesn't<00:00:28.890> always<00:00:29.100> mean<00:00:29.630> finishing<00:00:30.630> where<00:00:30.780> you

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
we are the elites and the not-so elites

I<00:00:51.800> guess<00:00:52.520> you<00:00:52.670> could<00:00:52.850> say<00:00:53.030> we're<00:00:53.180> oddballs<00:00:55.120> but

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
I guess you could say we're oddballs but

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.480 
I guess you could say we're oddballs but
we<00:00:56.240> share<00:00:56.510> a<00:00:56.540> bond<00:00:56.870> that<00:00:57.620> is<00:00:57.650> forged<00:00:58.100> on<00:00:58.400> the

road from failure to triumph and back

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:14.790 
road from failure to triumph and back
again<00:01:01.910> and<00:01:02.480> that<00:01:04.420> makes<00:01:05.420> us<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:06.050> same

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.580 

these<00:01:15.790> are<00:01:16.240> our<00:01:16.480> excuses

these are our excuses
but<00:01:19.100> what<00:01:19.280> are<00:01:19.399> the<00:01:19.490> reasons

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.060 

what<00:01:22.940> really<00:01:23.210> moves<00:01:23.600> us

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.390 

what<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.730> there<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:29.970> something<00:01:30.300> deeper

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
what if there is something deeper

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.440 
what if there is something deeper
stronger<00:01:32.400> moving<00:01:33.240> us<00:01:33.390> forward

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.670 

what<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:39.750> think<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.290> know<00:01:40.560> the

what if we just think we know the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
what if we just think we know the
reasons<00:01:42.020> what<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.320> real<00:01:43.530> reasons<00:01:44.040> are<00:01:44.610> not

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
reasons what if the real reasons are not

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:55.040 
reasons what if the real reasons are not
entirely<00:01:45.360> our<00:01:46.049> own
