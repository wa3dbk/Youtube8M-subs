00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:27.339
 currently this tribute stands as a trial device 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:30.550
 in the GDR Regio Workshop Osnabrück 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.940
 he is the last driver swept across Germany 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.870
 in this workshop also the railcars of the series 6 3 become 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.850
 So currently 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.990
 drive too 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.010
 on the route 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.010
 Enschede 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.910
 pretty what is he doing now 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.460
 Dusseldorf RPO 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.690
 Billerbeck 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.690
 there are on the island on the way 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.830
 while being 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.830
 first expected 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.880
 Werner Tel 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.670
 here for a few minutes 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.090
 can drop by 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.090
 the procedure is running 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.240
 This year, the Osnabrück site will be abandoned 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.590
 the workshop 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.590
 to Münster 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.650
 thereby 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.850
 the 6 loses 24 pages 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.380
 help 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.539
 It was possible for East and for the employees of the workshop Osnabrück 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.990
 This vehicle shows the photo to move again 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.990
 where to come from 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:41.389
 to Seville 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.729
 I am still 59 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:45.849
 this is the oldest employee of her 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.049
 Oh well 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.989
 since 1970 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.519
 and they also have to be here and there or undressed under house arrest 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.899
 they have their activities is buck 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:58.279
 mainly 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:02:59.449
 the tribune 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.729
 and gate 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:04.799
 What was that problem? 24 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.759
 the biggest problem 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:09.839
 I would rather have said that 

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:11.879
 the problems happened so often 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.139
 Percent so it was a very good one 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:17.749
 that had his quirks, too 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:20.749
 also better to network 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:27.080
 but as I said food 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.080
 Water and Andersen that was not very good 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.279
 and then the vehicle part has 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:37.459
 At least our vehicles want to keep on running over Easy Jet for years 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.619
 Run without big problems 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.089
 be next to the actual place 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:45.089
 again 

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:14.429
 2 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:36.110
 currently this power car is 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.779
 as a souvenir 

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:40.870
 to save our region from scrapping 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.830
 including the employees of the Osnabrück plant 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.449
 and everyone interested 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.349
 to give the opportunity 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:50.740
 to visit a relic of the railway history
