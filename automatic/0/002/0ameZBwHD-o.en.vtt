00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.149
 it's a problem you have to respect what you put 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.440
 problems 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.630
 good to all welcome to another this 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.950
 a new episode and we have diego 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.750
 rivas x action number 8 and the truth is 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.210
 a player who has surprised me 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.349
 pretty much last year I liked it a lot 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.060
 I had disappointment in this year with him 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.620
 had to approve it finally with the team 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.770
 in which also but the windows key 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.530
 and the truth has seemed incredible to me 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.780
 true this year has improved it a lot 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.510
 respect as it was last year in fifa 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.940
 13 and the truth is that it shows is a 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.530
 mediocentro that has everything is everything 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.800
 that an offensive midfielder or 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.920
 mediapunta he has it here let's see 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.900
 your information is the Brazilian plays the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.310
 bundesliga the team is the wolsburg that 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.170
 I was wrong because the juventus 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.500
 forgotten is the monster forgiveness for that 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.760
 failure and its price ranges between three 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.590
 thousand coins in all consoles 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.510
 is a pretty offensive midfielder 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.330
 pretty good has pass has dribble 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.350
 has shot also has 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.250
 and throws fouls tremendously tremendously 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.350
 its phase is one of the best that I've 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.310
 seen proof of iniesta the proven to 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.240
 diego and the truth 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.420
 the state of iniesta pass 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.509
 difference and I thought that this happens a 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.909
 little worse than diego so it's a very 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.100
 good comparison of iniesta and the truth 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.220
 I'm staying with Diego and it's too much 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.929
 or much cheaper here we have the 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.570
 extras that stand out from the control 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:53.619
 87 s balloon pass 87 I'll put 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.659
 even more agility than 86 or others 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.090
 dribble series that never come badly and 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.190
 an incredible shot 78 is an authentic 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.890
 lie and the truth also runs out 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.939
 quick for those 66 that puts the letter of 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.289
 rhythm has a shot makes an annoying 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.690
 they come incredible and you put it in the 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.650
 goals 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.720
 It's very, very good to do a class 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.850
 and that would like any means 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.360
 center in 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.090
 in the world here we have longed for stars 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.670
 and highlights the skill here we have the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.950
 from physicists to certain images of 84 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.440
 86 balance of anticipation also 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.850
 to live very well those 86 of vision I would 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.070
 I would put a lot more has one step 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.230
 incredible and look at the attributes of 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.330
 skill all in green almost all a 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.480
 true green that an authentic wonder 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.950
 diego arribas we have also four 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.630
 Filigree stars against stars 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.120
 bad legs high working 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.470
 offensive and defensive work environment 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.090
 here we have the team that was the same 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.250
 in which I will provide the equality ushcc and 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.850
