and<00:01:20.780> I'm<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:21.960> gonna<00:01:22.080> brush<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.590> through

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.340 

okay<00:01:34.280> so<00:01:34.340> I've<00:01:34.880> worked<00:01:35.210> it<00:01:35.479> through<00:01:35.780> my<00:01:35.990> hair

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
okay so I've worked it through my hair

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.230 
okay so I've worked it through my hair
and<00:01:36.380> as<00:01:37.010> you<00:01:37.190> can<00:01:37.310> see<00:01:37.520> there's<00:01:37.729> a<00:01:37.790> little<00:01:38.090> bit

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
and as you can see there's a little bit

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.020 
and as you can see there's a little bit
of<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:38.450> brown<00:01:38.720> cast<00:01:39.200> through<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:39.920> not<00:01:40.610> my<00:01:40.820> sure

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
of a brown cast through it not my sure

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.610 
of a brown cast through it not my sure
why<00:01:41.150> it's<00:01:41.360> done<00:01:41.600> that<00:01:41.810> this<00:01:42.020> time<00:01:42.320> because

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
why it's done that this time because

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.030 
why it's done that this time because
it's<00:01:42.830> never<00:01:43.070> really<00:01:43.280> happened<00:01:43.400> before<00:01:43.790> and

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
it's never really happened before and

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.230 
it's never really happened before and
maybe<00:01:46.040> I<00:01:46.130> just<00:01:46.250> got<00:01:46.580> a<00:01:46.610> little<00:01:46.790> bit<00:01:47.030> too

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
maybe I just got a little bit too

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.040 
maybe I just got a little bit too
enthusiastic<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:48.320> put<00:01:48.560> too<00:01:48.740> much<00:01:48.890> on<00:01:49.130> but

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
enthusiastic and put too much on but

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.870 
enthusiastic and put too much on but
generally<00:01:51.050> it<00:01:51.380> tends<00:01:51.920> to<00:01:52.100> work<00:01:52.369> really<00:01:52.640> well

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
generally it tends to work really well

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.730 
generally it tends to work really well
as<00:01:53.060> you<00:01:53.090> can<00:01:53.300> see<00:01:53.509> from<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:53.810> sides<00:01:54.050> as<00:01:54.290> well<00:01:54.440> it

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
as you can see from the sides as well it

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.230 
as you can see from the sides as well it
just<00:01:54.979> tends<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:55.340> work<00:01:55.610> really<00:01:55.850> really<00:01:55.970> well

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
just tends to work really really well

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.020 
just tends to work really really well
and<00:01:56.570> it<00:01:57.229> might<00:01:57.500> also<00:01:57.800> be<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.190> lighting<00:01:58.790> I've

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
might be shining down on my hair but so

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.770 
might be shining down on my hair but so
this<00:02:06.470> dry<00:02:06.800> shampoo<00:02:07.369> is<00:02:07.759> about<00:02:09.729> let<00:02:10.729> me<00:02:10.880> think

really<00:02:22.220> do<00:02:22.520> like<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.790> because<00:02:24.670> despite<00:02:25.670> the

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
really do like it because despite the

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.030 
right now it works really really well on
my<00:02:33.380> dark<00:02:33.620> hair<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.220> most<00:02:34.760> of<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.150> time<00:02:36.040> it

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
my dark hair and most of the time it

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.210 
my dark hair and most of the time it
does<00:02:37.370> not<00:02:37.400> leave<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:37.940> cast<00:02:38.330> at<00:02:38.780> all<00:02:39.019> and<00:02:39.320> I<00:02:39.920> think

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
does not leave a cast at all and I think

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.729 
does not leave a cast at all and I think
part<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.120> reason<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.600> was<00:02:41.750> it's<00:02:42.320> looking<00:02:42.680> a

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
part of the reason it was it's looking a

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.380 
part of the reason it was it's looking a
little<00:02:42.860> bit<00:02:42.980> funny<00:02:43.459> at<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.820> moment<00:02:44.209> is

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
little bit funny at the moment is

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.039 
little bit funny at the moment is
because<00:02:44.630> one<00:02:45.590> this<00:02:46.190> bottle<00:02:46.640> is<00:02:47.049> practically

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
because one this bottle is practically

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.560 
because one this bottle is practically
empty<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:48.920> there's<00:02:49.310> very<00:02:49.790> little<00:02:49.970> left<00:02:50.090> in<00:02:50.450> it

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
empty and there's very little left in it

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.810 
empty and there's very little left in it
and<00:02:50.840> I'm<00:02:51.110> right<00:02:51.620> down<00:02:51.799> to<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.130> residue<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:52.730> I

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
and I'm right down to the residue and I

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:53.680 
and I'm right down to the residue and I
might<00:02:53.030> have<00:02:53.180> been<00:02:53.299> a<00:02:53.329> little<00:02:53.480> too

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
might have been a little too

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.150 
might have been a little too
enthusiastic<00:02:54.470> putting<00:02:54.769> too<00:02:54.920> much<00:02:55.040> on<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:56.090> um

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
enthusiastic putting too much on so um

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.789 
enthusiastic putting too much on so um
so<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.280> goes<00:02:58.459> on<00:02:58.670> dark<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.780> works<00:03:00.380> really<00:03:00.650> well

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
so it goes on dark it works really well

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.780 
so it goes on dark it works really well
in<00:03:00.980> terms<00:03:01.459> of<00:03:02.030> just<00:03:02.570> taking<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.989> shine<00:03:03.260> and

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
in terms of just taking the shine and

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.140 
in terms of just taking the shine and
drying<00:03:04.790> up<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.000> hair<00:03:05.390> it<00:03:06.079> also<00:03:06.670> makes<00:03:07.670> my<00:03:07.910> hair

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
drying up the hair it also makes my hair

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.750 
drying up the hair it also makes my hair
feel<00:03:08.180> like<00:03:08.630> hair<00:03:09.019> so<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.680> doesn't<00:03:09.709> leave<00:03:10.459> my

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
feel like hair so it doesn't leave my

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.060 
feel like hair so it doesn't leave my
hair<00:03:11.060> feeling<00:03:11.510> really<00:03:11.750> dry<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.230> straw<00:03:13.040> like

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
hair feeling really dry and straw like

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.430 
hair feeling really dry and straw like
which<00:03:13.519> was<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.450> reason<00:03:14.600> I<00:03:14.780> didn't<00:03:15.079> like<00:03:15.110> the

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
which was the reason I didn't like the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.090 
which was the reason I didn't like the
batiste

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
batiste

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.430

another<00:03:18.680> review<00:03:19.160> on<00:03:19.190> I<00:03:19.519> think<00:03:19.880> it<00:03:19.940> was<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.060> first

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
another review on I think it was a first

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.530 
another review on I think it was a first
impression<00:03:20.900> on<00:03:21.019> because<00:03:21.890> it<00:03:22.310> was<00:03:22.670> leaving<00:03:23.150> a

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
impression on because it was leaving a

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
impression on because it was leaving a
really<00:03:24.310> like<00:03:25.310> hard<00:03:25.760> stroy<00:03:26.630> feeling<00:03:27.170> my<00:03:27.320> hair

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
this doesn't do that this leaves my hair

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.410 
this doesn't do that this leaves my hair
feeling<00:03:30.920> very<00:03:32.290> soft<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.890> hair<00:03:34.519> like<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:35.150> I

area where I'm spraying my hair with

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
because the smell becomes really strong

because the smell becomes really strong
and<00:04:08.629> really<00:04:08.870> overpowering<00:04:09.500> so<00:04:09.860> just<00:04:10.489> a<00:04:10.580> word

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
and really overpowering so just a word

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.259 
and really overpowering so just a word
of<00:04:10.760> caution<00:04:10.910> if<00:04:11.480> you<00:04:11.599> do<00:04:11.810> use<00:04:12.110> this<00:04:12.410> to<00:04:13.269> be

of caution if you do use this to be

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.330 
of caution if you do use this to be
careful<00:04:14.660> how<00:04:14.840> much<00:04:14.900> you<00:04:15.200> spray<00:04:15.590> and<00:04:15.920> I<00:04:16.190> don't

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
careful how much you spray and I don't

careful how much you spray and I don't
know<00:04:16.400> hold<00:04:16.790> your<00:04:16.940> breath<00:04:17.090> or<00:04:17.329> step<00:04:17.630> away<00:04:17.780> so

know hold your breath or step away so

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.490 
know hold your breath or step away so
the<00:04:18.769> smell<00:04:19.070> doesn't<00:04:19.280> get<00:04:19.579> overpowering<00:04:20.510> and

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
the smell doesn't get overpowering and

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.850 
the smell doesn't get overpowering and
for<00:04:22.250> some<00:04:22.460> reason<00:04:22.940> this<00:04:23.240> bottle<00:04:23.660> also<00:04:23.930> seemed

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
for some reason this bottle also seemed

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.570 
for some reason this bottle also seemed
to<00:04:25.280> go<00:04:25.580> really<00:04:26.270> fast<00:04:26.630> on<00:04:26.930> me<00:04:27.110> like<00:04:27.320> I<00:04:27.530> feel<00:04:28.460> like

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
to go really fast on me like I feel like

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.469 
to go really fast on me like I feel like
I've<00:04:28.760> used<00:04:29.030> it<00:04:29.210> up<00:04:29.330> really<00:04:29.870> really<00:04:30.110> fast<00:04:30.410> but

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
I've used it up really really fast but

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.360 
I've used it up really really fast but
then<00:04:32.479> when<00:04:32.660> I<00:04:32.690> think<00:04:33.020> back<00:04:33.080> I<00:04:33.740> think<00:04:34.160> maybe

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
then when I think back I think maybe

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:41.110 
then when I think back I think maybe
I've<00:04:34.669> had<00:04:34.970> it<00:04:35.120> for<00:04:35.450> about<00:04:35.950> I<00:04:37.030> would<00:04:38.030> say<00:04:40.120> maybe

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
I've had it for about I would say maybe

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.940 
I've had it for about I would say maybe
a<00:04:41.330> month<00:04:41.479> and<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:41.870> half<00:04:41.900> to<00:04:42.289> two<00:04:42.470> months<00:04:42.680> and

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
a month and a half to two months and

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.879 
a month and a half to two months and
I've<00:04:43.190> been<00:04:43.520> using<00:04:43.729> it<00:04:43.970> pretty<00:04:44.300> much<00:04:44.450> all<00:04:45.229> the

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889

time<00:04:46.100> so<00:04:47.050> which<00:04:48.050> is<00:04:48.229> about<00:04:48.490> twice<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.520> week

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
time so which is about twice a week

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.770 
time so which is about twice a week
maybe<00:04:50.900> three<00:04:51.289> times<00:04:51.500> so<00:04:52.070> it's<00:04:52.940> not<00:04:53.419> too<00:04:53.750> bad

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780
