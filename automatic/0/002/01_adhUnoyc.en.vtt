00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.420
 what happens now when we have chocolate 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.160
 just melt and pour without 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.559
 to crystallize 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.960
 then let's get that nice shine and finish 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.270
 result obtained or not we go it 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.060
 just try it out 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.369
 I take a picture with paper 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.449
 I just melted the chocolate 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.390
 without 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.349
 followed crystallization and pour that on it 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.130
 picture and we are going to leave that 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.130
 to harden 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.590
 we are already a few hours further and 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.230
 only now has the chocolate stopped reasonably 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.680
 it took a long time before we 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.829
 this result is competent and what do we see 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.829
 he is ugly and matt melts quickly 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.449
 hyperpro lives on the paper 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.430
 it has no hard break in June 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.020
 like corally structure and there are 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.790
 stains on 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.770
 I have now done the same test with 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.100
 chocolate that is pre-crystallized 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.130
 and we are going to compare that 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.420
 we noticed this dissolves easily from it 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.090
 paper 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.810
 it is hard and even in a few 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.799
 minutes has a nice crack 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.740
 uniform in color and a satin sheen 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.770
 how is that the secret is in the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.350
 cocoa butter that must be in the right 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.329
 be brought in crystal form 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.460
 the fact is that the cacoa butter 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.070
 when cooling in different 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.740
 crystal forms can crystallize out 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.470
 there is only one that is the right one 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.409
 which give us the good qualities of the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.310
 chocolate delivered for catalysing is now 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.110
 just that 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.969
 right crystal for him in the molten 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.310
 bring chocolate you should know that 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.170
 current chocolate that contains this 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.939
 crystals 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.759
 so if we have harder chocolate in small 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.590
 chop pieces of chopping or k leds 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.560
 and we add it 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.129
 the melted chocolate then we are the 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.620
 chocolate on it before crystallizing 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.080
 it hardens within a few minutes 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.670
 shine perfectly and has the right cracking 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.290
 and chin strength 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.930
 this all sounds pretty theoretical 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.129
 but what does it actually mean in the 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.780
 practice 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.780
 well I am going to show follow
