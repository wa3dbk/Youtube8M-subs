00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.289
 pests in action 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.289
 objects are not doctors and the team follows more or less the same system as the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.419
 people used 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.719
 translate kinetic objects through construction denunciations for both 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.510
 parts 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.510
 It's one thing I did not say at the last minute but what I'm talking about now 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.050
 in that game the fish would have mentioned 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.730
 if you do not have one 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.080
 following the term 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.080
 in one of the scenes 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.850
 the horse for example instead of using object to cold 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.230
 for every position of my eyes 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.980
 Open 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.249
 made him admit some different way 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:05.950
 and that it is difficult for us to transpose what is three-dimensional with a surface 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.070
 two-dimensional 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.390
 that neither paper 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.810
 a lot of people end up pet 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.710
 found most does work with someone suddenly loaned you photograph 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.740
 start a business before we start within a year 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.110
 a friend in a camp 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.160
 most economical way 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.620
 the most practical 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.990
 but it's a way of doing it 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.820
 an exact number of victims looking for objects printed in magazines and deserted 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.810
 beach beach 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.500
 to use but I know what it is 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.500
 but on some live object than by his house in front of him 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.710
 way I'm going to work to china the advantage 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.510
 andrÃ©a his opinion beyond the internal proportions in the design of the cup 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.640
 gaba 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.820
 the opposition plan to dry up the world will end 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.450
 half a dozen daisy 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.920
 he was 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.870
 the proportions and 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.150
 1 they still have some proportions waiting for the limit of the project until the 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.150
 limit of the photo let's go down 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.769
 on the side of the workers he 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.280
 only selton observing the live japan is difficult to frame that thing 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:17.119
 what we see in animated movies 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:19.519
 painter of filmmakers like the few 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.519
 they imagine in time cenacolo with their fingers so fashion of the eyes to 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.409
 there, or do so, or just propose to imagine that frame and come back 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.369
 We gotta do it, you got a cardboard. 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:37.039
 cardboard carton tadashi 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.039
 is to cut in l format so 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:43.849
 so l format 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.219
 being thus instead of dividing 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:50.189
 team so we can take this piece of cardboard and fit it 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.589
 different ways of conseg videlinhas dvd of all that is so 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:55.969
 squares 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.729
 narrow was 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:59.889
 The judgement 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.779
 or politically 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:06.499
 anna or a or even belongs to us want to use the pope proposes 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:09.739
 another course the paper happens to close a rectangle 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.169
 proportional 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.169
 to paper 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:27.899
 it works more or less the following way my you did the format that 

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:33.569
 you want you turn to the object that is in front of you 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:34.859
 and then we close 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.199
 the eyes 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.519
 look for framing that lacerda 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.519
 it's the best way possible 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.189
 the wager bet 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.480
 the equator opened then you held and made one of the goals of non-payment 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:55.809
 there 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:57.579
 of the object to be vaccinated 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.319
 in front of you 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.169
 and it only starts to arrive because in addition to the internal proportions that 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.489
 You can make that comparison and by the time it happens, I even had it. 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.139
 thigh opportunity 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.139
 at the time of playing already starts with to the semed will help you 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.769
 In addition to these internal measures you will be left with a frame and 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.879
 thing and will help you the city aims still to enter them and illuminate 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:22.430
 monuments 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.520
 then I'll show you how quickly the silva's fable
