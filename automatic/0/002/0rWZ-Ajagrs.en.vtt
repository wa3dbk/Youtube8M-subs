about how to transform an existing
website<00:00:11.040> into<00:00:11.430> a<00:00:11.460> prototype<00:00:11.910> we've<00:00:12.570> actually

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
website into a prototype we've actually

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.240 
website into a prototype we've actually
had<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.020> lot<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.230> people<00:00:13.410> asking<00:00:13.860> us<00:00:13.980> on<00:00:14.099> how<00:00:14.219> to

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
had a lot of people asking us on how to

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.499 
had a lot of people asking us on how to
do<00:00:14.490> this<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.880> we<00:00:15.000> thought<00:00:15.150> it<00:00:15.269> would<00:00:15.300> make<00:00:15.480> a

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
I've just opened up a new web prototype

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.720 
I've just opened up a new web prototype
and<00:00:19.590> I'm<00:00:20.040> going<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.220> double<00:00:20.430> click<00:00:20.490> on<00:00:20.640> the

page to edit it I'm going to specify the
background<00:00:24.810> image<00:00:25.230> which<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.649> basically<00:00:26.009> just

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
background image which is basically just

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.400 
background image which is basically just
a<00:00:26.369> screenshot<00:00:26.669> of<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.570> website<00:00:27.989> that<00:00:28.020> I<00:00:28.230> would

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
like to transform by going up to the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.190 
like to transform by going up to the
breadcrumbs<00:00:31.050> navigation<00:00:31.850> which<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.000> up<00:00:33.149> here

actually pretty easy to transform this
website<00:00:49.110> into<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.470> prototype<00:00:49.920> because<00:00:50.280> you

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
website into a prototype because you

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.580 
website into a prototype because you
basically<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:50.940> overlay<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:52.290> background

basically just overlay this background
with<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.400> stencils<00:00:54.000> needed<00:00:54.360> for<00:00:54.870> example<00:00:55.170> I'm

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
with the stencils needed for example I'm

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.360 
with the stencils needed for example I'm
just<00:00:55.290> gonna<00:00:55.500> grab<00:00:55.740> and<00:00:56.700> draw<00:00:56.970> in<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.370> I'm

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
just gonna grab and draw in this and I'm

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.350 
just gonna grab and draw in this and I'm
just<00:00:59.520> gonna<00:00:59.900> copy<00:01:00.900> and<00:01:01.320> paste<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.239> because<00:01:03.239> I

alright so perhaps you are making your
website<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.440> a<00:01:22.500> prototype<00:01:22.920> for<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> specific

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
website of a prototype for a specific

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.460 
website of a prototype for a specific
reason<00:01:23.670> maybe<00:01:24.510> you<00:01:24.690> wanted<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.990> edit<00:01:25.290> some<00:01:25.440> of

reason maybe you wanted to edit some of

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.920 
reason maybe you wanted to edit some of
the<00:01:25.560> text<00:01:25.620> or<00:01:26.010> revised<00:01:26.370> it<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.540> that's

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
the text or revised it so that's

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.170 
the text or revised it so that's
actually<00:01:28.260> very<00:01:28.290> easy<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.740> do<00:01:28.890> with<00:01:29.130> Patoka<00:01:29.610> for

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
actually very easy to do with Patoka for

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.310 
actually very easy to do with Patoka for
example<00:01:30.510> if<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.659> wanted<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.930> revise<00:01:31.140> this

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
text here you can simply take a

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.109 
text here you can simply take a
rectangle<00:01:34.200> stencil<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.830> you<00:01:35.310> can<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.729> by

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
rectangle stencil and you can do that by

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.230 
rectangle stencil and you can do that by
going<00:01:36.150> down<00:01:36.479> here<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.229> rectangle<00:01:38.240> just

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
going down here to the rectangle just

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.180 
going down here to the rectangle just
resize<00:01:39.690> it<00:01:41.299> to<00:01:42.299> cover<00:01:42.510> up<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> text<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.500> now

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
resize it to cover up the text and now

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.700 
resize it to cover up the text and now
go<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> context<00:01:45.119> menu<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.690> change<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
go to the context menu and change the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.789 
go to the context menu and change the
border<00:01:46.979> color<00:01:47.010> to<00:01:47.729> no<00:01:48.240> border<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.260> there<00:01:49.710> you

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
border color to no border and there you

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.080 
border color to no border and there you
go<00:01:49.920> now<00:01:50.659> we<00:01:51.659> can<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.049> course<00:01:52.080> grab<00:01:52.500> some<00:01:52.710> text

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
go now we can of course grab some text

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.940 
go now we can of course grab some text
drag<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.240> down<00:01:54.420> here<00:01:54.590> double<00:01:55.590> click<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.860> edit
