00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:32.309
 hello to you with arthur and in repair 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:34.710
 Today version repair the front of the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.989
 of the car like that broken water then 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.909
 first glance it seems that nothing 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:46.949
 terrible and we see a little 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:50.659
 damaged wings hood hood will 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:54.620
 change from girona 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:01:01.379
 huge and fully visible when we analyze 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:06.000
 what I don't do is disassembled in front of his zircon 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:09.890
 look pretty awful though how 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.259
 see the engine mount is in place 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:21.720
 so these are the places they are bent 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:22.319
 that's what exactly repair tino left 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.000
 spar 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:32.100
 goes pretty easy to know 4 soft 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.210
 had enough pouring reed then you but right on 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.920
 this is not all 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:44.399
 and for continuation of work I delete from these 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:48.540
 glasses headlights pieces of tv so 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.119
 called after you deleted the whole 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.740
 good approaches 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.689
 the best ones can be seen and offered 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:01.920
 work but for convenience 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:07.259
 to knock out this room and align 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:13.650
 in this month spar I'll delete this one 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:18.890
 part of the spar that was the approach and so 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:24.540
 when u deleted it i rest for won and 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:28.290
 pull spar he straightens up and I rest 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.590
 Tina laid as you can see without reinforcement 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.419
 this soft and big problems 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.419
 creates dub it 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:00.319
 this window is fat from dubbed the rest from 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:04.430
 level in on the table now it looks like this 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:11.050
 and all athletes and part deleted here 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.050
 these which are i will grieve 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:47.030
 so laser welded I think it is 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.130
 you will not need to touch the finish more 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.530
 proceed to repair 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.950
 spar right will do the same as 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.950
 left 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:22.900
 so evenly done and now 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:27.479
 I measure diagonals more often and more 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.479
 measure the better and more accurate will 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.390
 so measured 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:14.540
 everything seems to be fine and now I will 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.930
 weld the bumper beam yourself 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.930
 television 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.280
 but 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:56.020
 before you cook completely 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:06:00.580
 TV I once again producing measurements 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:05.819
 and then dump and so tv on 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:10.599
 the place now I decided to paint it 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:11.560
 inside that's not to do extra work I 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.889
 painted it 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:19.990
 and then I will try on 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:27.060
 the rest of the forehand and so painted 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:28.180
 screwed wings hood put the headlights 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:35.680
 tried on 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:42.039
 bumper in all gaps in place and work with 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:47.580
 metal finished can be painted and so 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:47.580
 by putty primed wiped and 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:57.370
 painted 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:59.099
 and so remember before repair and after 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.380

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:09.699
