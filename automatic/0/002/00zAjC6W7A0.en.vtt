00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.259
 according super super I'm really great 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.110
 content 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.210
 I was not the favorite even though 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.280
 I was seeded number two and 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.500
 then I had a lot of pressure because 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.360
 that I had never played it 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.040
 always been the best in our 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.500
 category since we are tiny 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:57.520
 so that's really it's really good 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:58.030
 sure not satisfied barÃ§a is very bad 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.239
 start 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.700
 so I lose six years she took me from 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.220
 following the throat and suddenly it was a 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.380
 complicated name but progressively 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.079
 that they manage to find my rhythm at 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.210
 release me a little bit and then she has 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:14.860
 started a little bit just having a little 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.310
 more pressure because it starts to 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.360
 get closer to the score and the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.360
 end I got 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.620
 yes I try to stay in the game 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.960
 because if I start a little bit at us 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.330
 by pie ix and I can not come back 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.880
 So I'm really still 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.590
 stay the big center is possible on 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.020
 on my shots and on what I have 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.140
 to make me I am a player who types 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.270
 strong who who likes a lot of abuse 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.250
 but at the same time if you attack me game 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.340
 it's pretty good what mostly on earth 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.229
 where I could slip a long time and I 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.200
 would rather be a thing of accounts because 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.880
 that as soon as I'm attacked I know 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.369
 counterattacked actually my father is 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.930
 tennis teacher and blow since my 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.510
 younger age he put me on the ground 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.980
 and as I liked that I continued 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.980
 and it went naturally
