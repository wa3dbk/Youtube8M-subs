00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.630
 basic tag 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.670
 typical patsansky car while major 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.740
 begging from parents cayenne and boys 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:18.199
 where the golden youth to start dreaming 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.880
 It is about these machines I must 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.830
 I require tuning here this toning 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 around the taste of the owner can still 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.670
 add some magnesium discs and 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.740
 decorative grille 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.779
 and imagine the salon tag 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.740
 flawlessly hard Samara plastic 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.309
 front panel 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.960
 rough cloth upholstery and why 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.999
 we just took to shoot this car 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.899
 what we have not seen judging by the exterior 

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:43.370
 Salon there is hardly covered with Alcantara 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.859
 funny but in this car just so 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.629
 and there is alcantara excellent skin and full 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.629
 mincemeat from expensive musical components 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.530
 but 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.640
 big self in the trunk tag or on 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.350
 back seat 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.840
 it still has such an arsenal 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.940
 acquire many to open in summer 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.130
 in the car windows and entice passing 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.260
 past the beauties of insane low frequency 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.280
 noise but make a concert hall of a vase 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.320
 by all the rules 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.390
 auto sound art and spent on 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.780
 Mega expensive finish is capable of such 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.430
 only a true fan of Andrei himself 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.290
 knows very well that many are simply not 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.630
 I understand why he is such a kingdom of luxury 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.890
 not at all luxurious afton and amount 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.890
 spent on all this beauty 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.360
 He prefers to remain silent, he humbly 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.070
 in general, the comrade is rather modest and 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.140
 Apparently, therefore, I decided to look for 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.890
 car to the full inside and outside 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.650
 leave everything as usual autosound 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.240
 carried away 3 years ago 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.710
 experimented with a new component not 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.720
 others liked him 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.070
 in my car today is worth 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.800
 already 4 system 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.390
 information related to autosound was looking for 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.090
 on the internet in communication 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.770
 friends and acquaintances chatting on forums 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.600
 and the advice of friends turned out to be childish 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.460
 rattling on the mad rumble 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.990
 dangerous for our eardrums 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.850
 the hero on his own not advance 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.800
 I could because in autosound as in any 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.900
 a beginner should have a coach 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.390
 sensei and mentor in general man 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.950
 wise and experienced 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.600
 2010 I met with Dmitry 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.430
 head 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.200
 a great expert in car audio, I realized 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.440
 that all that was doing 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.590
 the earlier it was not serious and 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.870
 primitive much in the system depends on 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.140
 correct settings even if the components 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.180
 will be expensive and not rebuilt desired 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.720
 result and sound quality in 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.010
 by car 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.010
 it will be impossible to hear 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.800
 but 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.930
 those who are interested in car audio 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.520
 Dmitry Gubeva certainly know on 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.560
 car audio competition 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.600
 which he put his hands and ears 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.580
 consistently occupy top places 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.520
 he will now share with us one of 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.870
 good installation recipes 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.410
 alterations under the version completely all 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.490
 salon 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:11.990
 the entire trunk and all door skins 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.220
 system composition head unit 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:18.600
 pioneer which consists of sit 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:23.130
 pioneer p9 player and pq processor 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.760
 x 9 which we have in the luggage 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.190
 compartment of the car further 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.730
 3-way front is located in front then 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.850
 there are per channel and gain tweeters 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.990
 majors 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.450
 and midbass each speaker works from 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.750
 your amplifier amp and located 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.730
 again we have in the trunk here 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.950
 the advantage is that from the processor to 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.680
 amplifiers are located very small 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.130
 distances respectively interblock 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.870
 we have a small distance cable 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.720
 farther 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.640
 located on a three-lane front system 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.250
 located with in such a way that 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.160
 match the highest in 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.540
 sound quality and at the same time 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.760
 installed speakers do not overlap 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.760
 overview from the driver's seat and from the seat 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.650
 passenger head unit 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.530
 situated 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:20.060
 as high as possible for convenience of information 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.830
 on the screen below we have 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.930
 multimedia player aquarium 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.900
 which gives us the opportunity to participate 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:32.120
 in multimedia competitions 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:34.919
 stereo two channels go to 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.050
 let's boot the whole amplifying part 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.510
 system located in the trunk 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.060
 amplifiers and processor are mounted on 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.550
 steel structure which is welded 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.630
 specially for the size of amplifiers and 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.820
 cpu here also we can see 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.610
 scheme so that you can see where the wire 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.520
 and where what is the nominal cross section of the cable and 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.800
 fuse rating all cables 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.830
 systems are laid 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.870
 snake skin tubing and go on color 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.199
 gamut of power and we go black 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.169
 red and acoustic white stands 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:12.680
 subwoofer made back shelf 40 liters 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:15.620
 volume for better quality bass 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.139
 bass but immediately plays the cabin trunk 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.110
 there are two more amplifiers which 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:23.240
 h per m working dynamics and sub + 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.639
 we have each amplifier in addition 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.710
 powered by a power capacitor here 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.080
 made the backlight 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.840
 also in the trunk made drawers for 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.110
 tool storage 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.300
 that word something else is possible 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.879
 do n't stop our shooting don't blot 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.460
 total power of all these amplifiers 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:46.120
 is 1200 watts what for quality 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.610
 all the sound in the car is enough 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.110
 nothing should come out with this 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.150
 combat equipment car in 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.330
 competition has not yet participated season 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:59.569
 2011 will be his debut 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:03.340
 the car will be in our class 2 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:06.650
 This quality of sound is amateur and 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.409
 multimedia stereo two channels 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:13.460
 combat win occupy prize 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:16.060
 the places in front of us are the highest 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.330
 goals and objectives respectively 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:24.169
 winning regional stages and 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:27.600
 champion title final Russia so 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:29.870
 champion title at final Russia 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.870
 even
