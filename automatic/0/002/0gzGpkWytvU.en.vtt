reason<00:00:31.590> accepted<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.279> think<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.520> was<00:00:32.579> having

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
reason accepted it I think I was having

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.970 
reason accepted it I think I was having
a<00:00:32.850> problem<00:00:33.030> with<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.110> accepted<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.770> and

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
a problem with it so it accepted it and

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.770 
a problem with it so it accepted it and
then<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.309> realized<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:36.149> don't<00:00:36.210> know<00:00:36.360> that's<00:00:36.600> not

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
then it realized I don't know that's not

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.750 
then it realized I don't know that's not
actually<00:00:37.200> anything<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.370> when<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.579> try<00:00:38.700> to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
actually anything and so when it try to

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.639 
actually anything and so when it try to
refresh<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.629> when<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.020> tries<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.230> refresh

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
refresh is that when it tries to refresh

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.770 
refresh is that when it tries to refresh
that<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:41.550> can't<00:00:41.879> do<00:00:42.120> anything<00:00:42.329> because

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
that it can't do anything because

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.940 
that it can't do anything because
there's<00:00:43.230> nothing<00:00:43.440> there

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
there's nothing there

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.440 
thing that's gonna be coming out called
spring<00:03:05.500> rotator<00:03:06.129> I<00:03:06.430> believe<00:03:07.090> I'll<00:03:07.269> have<00:03:07.299> a

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
spring rotator I believe I'll have a

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.119 
spring rotator I believe I'll have a
link<00:03:07.719> of<00:03:07.840> that<00:03:07.870> into<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.319> description<00:03:08.739> or

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
link of that into the description or

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.039 
link of that into the description or
maybe<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.370> little<00:03:09.549> annotation<00:03:10.049> something

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
maybe a little annotation something

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.659 
maybe a little annotation something
along<00:03:11.290> those<00:03:11.469> lines<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:12.099> what<00:03:12.340> its<00:03:12.459> gonna<00:03:12.549> be

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:12.669 
along those lines and what its gonna be

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.390 
along those lines and what its gonna be
enable<00:03:13.329> you<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.510> do<00:03:13.780> is<00:03:13.989> when<00:03:14.709> you<00:03:14.859> rotate<00:03:15.280> your

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
enable you to do is when you rotate your

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.330 
enable you to do is when you rotate your
iDevice<00:03:15.819> iPhone<00:03:16.359> or<00:03:16.510> iPod<00:03:16.810> it'll<00:03:17.709> rotate<00:03:18.040> the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
iDevice iPhone or iPod it'll rotate the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.149 
iDevice iPhone or iPod it'll rotate the
whole<00:03:18.459> springboard<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:20.290> will<00:03:20.560> be<00:03:20.680> really

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
whole springboard and it will be really

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.259 
whole springboard and it will be really
really<00:03:21.190> cool<00:03:21.549> you<00:03:21.729> know<00:03:21.849> if<00:03:21.909> you've<00:03:22.030> seen<00:03:22.180> the

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
really cool you know if you've seen the

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.240 
really cool you know if you've seen the
iPad<00:03:22.659> things<00:03:22.989> I<00:03:23.169> think<00:03:23.349> that<00:03:23.500> it<00:03:23.650> does<00:03:23.859> that<00:03:24.069> to

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
iPad things I think that it does that to

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.879 
iPad things I think that it does that to
makes<00:03:25.060> it<00:03:25.209> cool<00:03:25.359> but<00:03:25.840> let's<00:03:25.989> see<00:03:26.260> here<00:03:26.590> if<00:03:26.680> this

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
makes it cool but let's see here if this

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:30.689 
makes it cool but let's see here if this
works<00:03:28.349> I've<00:03:29.349> done<00:03:29.650> this<00:03:29.739> before<00:03:29.799> because

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699 
works I've done this before because

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.550 
works I've done this before because
every<00:03:31.090> time<00:03:31.239> I<00:03:31.510> add<00:03:31.659> a<00:03:31.689> source<00:03:32.079> for<00:03:32.379> some

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
every time I add a source for some

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.509 
every time I add a source for some
reason<00:03:32.889> it<00:03:33.040> decides<00:03:33.400> it's<00:03:33.699> going<00:03:33.819> to<00:03:35.519> refresh

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
reason it decides it's going to refresh

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.339 
reason it decides it's going to refresh
on<00:03:36.790> those<00:03:36.939> memories<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.479> guess<00:03:37.510> it's<00:03:37.930> like<00:03:38.019> and

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
on those memories I guess it's like and

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.809 
on those memories I guess it's like and
like<00:03:38.949> pound<00:03:39.519> into<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:40.060> device<00:03:40.479> and<00:03:41.319> so<00:03:42.159> if<00:03:42.669> we

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
like pound into the device and so if we

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.330 
like pound into the device and so if we

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
the information given it's kind tough

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.469

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.670 
the back to the spring rotator thing
well<00:04:06.579> this<00:04:06.819> kind<00:04:07.030> of<00:04:07.090> loads<00:04:07.269> up<00:04:07.479> here<00:04:07.720> it's

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
well this kind of loads up here it's

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.439 
well this kind of loads up here it's
gonna<00:04:08.769> knit<00:04:09.069> two<00:04:09.519> row<00:04:09.639> totally<00:04:10.060> rotate<00:04:10.359> your

spring<00:04:10.780> board<00:04:10.989> like<00:04:11.199> the<00:04:11.409> iPad<00:04:11.859> does<00:04:12.129> and

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
spring board like the iPad does and

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.789 
spring board like the iPad does and
it'll<00:04:13.180> probably<00:04:13.329> happen<00:04:13.659> in<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:14.049> later<00:04:14.290> update

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
it'll probably happen in a later update

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:22.110 
it'll probably happen in a later update
to<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.239> iPhone<00:04:16.239> OS<00:04:18.000> OS<00:04:19.000> I<00:04:19.930> guess<00:04:20.109> software<00:04:21.120> but

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
to the iPhone OS OS I guess software but

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.850 
to the iPhone OS OS I guess software but
so<00:04:22.690> that'll<00:04:22.930> be<00:04:23.050> pretty<00:04:23.169> cool<00:04:23.440> and<00:04:23.710> that's

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
so that'll be pretty cool and that's

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.830 
so that'll be pretty cool and that's
coming<00:04:24.219> out<00:04:24.370> a<00:04:24.400> few<00:04:24.940> days<00:04:25.120> I<00:04:25.270> think<00:04:25.300> I'll<00:04:25.659> have
