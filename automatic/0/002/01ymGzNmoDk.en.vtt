about a sick society separate teams and
there<00:00:48.539> was<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.140> think<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.680> was<00:00:49.800> about

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
there was this I think it was about

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.160 
there was this I think it was about
thirty<00:00:50.280> second<00:00:50.700> battled<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.120> just<00:00:51.600> myself<00:00:51.809> and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
thirty second battled it just myself and

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.200 
thirty second battled it just myself and
it<00:00:52.410> seemed<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.340> was<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.640> us<00:00:53.789> two<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
it seemed that it was just us two on the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.790 
it seemed that it was just us two on the
pitch<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:55.050> was<00:00:55.170> up<00:00:55.320> there<00:00:55.530> was<00:00:55.649> other

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
pitch but it was up there was other

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.189 
pitch but it was up there was other
players<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> pitch<00:00:56.610> but<00:00:56.940> nobody<00:00:57.899> sort<00:00:58.109> of

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
players on the pitch but nobody sort of

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.110 
players on the pitch but nobody sort of
came<00:00:58.410> near<00:00:58.620> us<00:00:58.770> they<00:00:58.920> wanted<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.309> see<00:00:59.489> how<00:00:59.730> it

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
came near us they wanted to see how it

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.020

ended<00:01:00.570> up<00:01:00.690> who<00:01:00.930> came<00:01:01.199> out<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> stronger<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.910> I

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
ended up who came out the stronger and I

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.399 
ended up who came out the stronger and I
think<00:01:03.270> he<00:01:03.329> did<00:01:03.510> come<00:01:03.690> out<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.840> striking<00:01:04.170> you

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
think he did come out of striking you

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.760 
think he did come out of striking you
