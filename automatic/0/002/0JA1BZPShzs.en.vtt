suspension<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.950> you<00:02:09.950> know<00:02:10.099> we<00:02:10.610> came<00:02:10.819> out<00:02:11.060> with

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300

the<00:02:11.540> Rev<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.110> few<00:02:12.680> years<00:02:12.920> ago<00:02:13.130> which<00:02:13.940> really

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
the Rev a few years ago which really

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.660 
the Rev a few years ago which really
changed<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.810> way<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.080> use<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.799> snowmobile<00:02:16.430> I

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
changed the way you use to snowmobile I

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.110 
changed the way you use to snowmobile I
think<00:02:16.970> those<00:02:17.180> are<00:02:17.349> quite<00:02:18.349> major<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:19.250> he<00:02:20.000> had<00:02:20.090> a

saw<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.290> evolution<00:02:45.920> almost<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.640> complete

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
saw the evolution almost the complete

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.630 
saw the evolution almost the complete
evolution<00:02:47.540> of<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.780> product<00:02:48.260> at<00:02:48.980> that<00:02:49.250> time<00:02:49.459> we

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
evolution of the product at that time we

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.870 
evolution of the product at that time we
were<00:02:50.079> building<00:02:51.079> about<00:02:51.530> 10,000<00:02:52.130> machines<00:02:52.489> and

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
were building about 10,000 machines and

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.349 
were building about 10,000 machines and
we<00:02:53.630> went<00:02:53.840> up<00:02:53.989> to<00:02:54.019> at<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.829> end<00:02:54.950> of<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.160> 60s<00:02:55.639> to

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
we went up to at the end of the 60s to

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.440 
we went up to at the end of the 60s to
about<00:02:56.600> 200,000<00:02:57.470> units<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:58.100> now<00:02:59.000> we<00:02:59.060> are

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
about 200,000 units and now we are

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.890 
about 200,000 units and now we are
producing<00:03:00.200> around<00:03:00.560> 60,000<00:03:01.370> so<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:02.450> next<00:03:02.600> time

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
producing around 60,000 so the next time

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.140 
producing around 60,000 so the next time
you<00:03:03.200> throw<00:03:03.440> your<00:03:03.620> leg<00:03:03.859> over<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.220> trustee<00:03:04.790> sled
