so here we have this elephant and he he
has<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.320> bad<00:00:13.530> case<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:13.830> n<00:00:14.099> gone<00:00:14.280> itis<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.560> he's

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
has a bad case of n gone itis and he's

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.310 
has a bad case of n gone itis and he's
pretty<00:00:16.830> badly<00:00:17.130> infected<00:00:17.609> press<00:00:18.570> f2<00:00:18.990> we<00:00:19.170> can

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
pretty badly infected press f2 we can

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.689 
pretty badly infected press f2 we can
see<00:00:19.670> the<00:00:20.670> end<00:00:20.820> gods<00:00:21.029> become<00:00:21.420> inflamed<00:00:22.699> alright

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
see the end gods become inflamed alright

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.439 
see the end gods become inflamed alright
so<00:00:23.880> we're<00:00:24.689> going<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.840> go<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.140> here<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:26.449> check

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
so we're going to go in here and check

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.870 
so we're going to go in here and check
out<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.840> had<00:00:27.990> gone<00:00:28.199> now<00:00:29.099> what<00:00:29.250> an<00:00:29.340> end<00:00:29.490> gone<00:00:29.640> is

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
out and had gone now what an end gone is

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.659 
out and had gone now what an end gone is
is<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.240> polygon<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.590> more<00:00:32.009> than<00:00:32.189> four<00:00:32.460> sides

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
is a polygon with more than four sides

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.030 
is a polygon with more than four sides
to<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.780> can<00:00:33.840> see<00:00:34.050> here<00:00:34.320> we<00:00:34.469> have<00:00:34.680> five

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
to it so you can see here we have five

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.590 
to it so you can see here we have five
vertices<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.059> end<00:00:36.270> gone<00:00:37.129> it<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.550> be<00:00:38.790> five

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
vertices on this end gone it can be five

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.510 
vertices on this end gone it can be five
sides<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.260> can<00:00:40.440> be<00:00:40.559> seven<00:00:40.920> size<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.309> could<00:00:41.430> be

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
sides it can be seven size it could be

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.930 
sides it can be seven size it could be
ten<00:00:41.820> sides<00:00:42.230> as<00:00:43.230> long<00:00:43.440> as<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:43.800> above<00:00:44.100> four<00:00:44.460> so

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
ten sides as long as it's above four so

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.660 
ten sides as long as it's above four so
this<00:00:45.090> one<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.420> six<00:00:45.719> sides<00:00:45.960> as<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.500> can<00:00:46.680> see<00:00:46.890> now

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
this one is six sides as you can see now

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.459 
this one is six sides as you can see now
if<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:47.850> turn<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.149> turbosmooth<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.320> can

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
if we turn on turbosmooth you can

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.860 
if we turn on turbosmooth you can
actually<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:50.010> what<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.520> doing<00:00:50.910> as<00:00:51.449> I'm

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
actually see what this is doing as I'm

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.100 
actually see what this is doing as I'm
gone<00:00:52.050> has<00:00:52.230> created<00:00:52.910> five<00:00:53.910> our<00:00:54.270> six<00:00:54.690> edges

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
gone has created five our six edges

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.990 
gone has created five our six edges
going<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> vertice<00:00:56.840> down<00:00:57.840> here<00:00:58.199> has<00:00:58.440> created

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
going to a vertice down here has created

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.910 
going to a vertice down here has created
three<00:01:00.000> edges<00:01:00.449> going<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.809> emergency<00:01:01.289> these<00:01:01.770> are

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
three edges going to emergency these are

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.640 
three edges going to emergency these are
considered<00:01:02.370> polls<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.090> they<00:01:03.480> are<00:01:04.199> generally

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
considered polls and they are generally

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.080 
considered polls and they are generally
not<00:01:04.799> wanted<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:07.310> topology<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.670> your<00:01:08.909> mesh

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
not wanted in the topology of your mesh

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.530 
not wanted in the topology of your mesh
and<00:01:10.369> they<00:01:11.369> aren't<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.670> best<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.210> because

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
and they aren't the best to have because

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.750 
and they aren't the best to have because
they<00:01:12.689> create<00:01:12.990> shading<00:01:13.560> issues<00:01:13.760> deformation

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
they create shading issues deformation

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.490 
they create shading issues deformation
issues<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:17.270> when<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.299> remove<00:01:18.689> them<00:01:18.840> as<00:01:19.049> much<00:01:19.200> as

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
issues and when I remove them as much as

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.520 
issues and when I remove them as much as
whenever<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:21.000> your<00:01:21.060> mesh<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.659> to

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
whenever you can in your mesh so to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.499 
whenever you can in your mesh so to
remove<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:23.310> six<00:01:23.939> sided<00:01:25.729> poll<00:01:26.729> we're<00:01:27.270> going

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
remove this six sided poll we're going

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.789 
remove this six sided poll we're going
to<00:01:27.750> turn<00:01:28.409> off<00:01:28.470> turbosmooth<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:30.799> actually

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
to turn off turbosmooth and actually

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.510 
to turn off turbosmooth and actually
edit<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> polygons<00:01:33.829> so<00:01:35.869> do<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.560> bring

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
edit the polygons so do this and bring

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.950 
edit the polygons so do this and bring
this<00:01:38.729> through<00:01:39.979> turn<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.159> back<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.060> can

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
this through turn it back on and you can

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.760 
this through turn it back on and you can
see<00:01:43.259> it's<00:01:43.380> been<00:01:43.530> solved<00:01:44.100> they're<00:01:45.619> not<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
see it's been solved they're not the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.090 
see it's been solved they're not the
best<00:01:46.920> apology<00:01:47.460> right<00:01:47.610> here<00:01:48.439> but<00:01:49.439> we<00:01:49.950> have

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
best apology right here but we have

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.010 
best apology right here but we have
eliminated<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.270> six<00:01:51.720> edged<00:01:52.470> hole<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:54.020> it

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
eliminated the six edged hole and it

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.370 
eliminated the six edged hole and it
looks<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.350> little<00:01:55.439> bit<00:01:55.590> better<00:01:56.810> so<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.170> first

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
looks a little bit better so the first

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.660 
looks a little bit better so the first
technique<00:01:58.530> i'm<00:01:59.009> actually<00:01:59.280> going<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.579> be

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
technique i'm actually going to be

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.090 
technique i'm actually going to be
showing<00:01:59.700> you<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.149> turn<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.840> poly<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.860> we<00:02:01.950> go<00:02:02.040> to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
showing you is turn to poly so we go to

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.120 
showing you is turn to poly so we go to
the<00:02:02.219> modifier<00:02:02.610> list<00:02:02.640> here<00:02:03.320> and<00:02:04.320> turn<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.860> poly

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
the modifier list here and turn to poly

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.630 
the modifier list here and turn to poly
and<00:02:05.719> go<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.780> limit<00:02:07.469> polygon<00:02:07.890> size<00:02:08.160> make<00:02:08.489> sure

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
and go to limit polygon size make sure

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.910 
and go to limit polygon size make sure
that's<00:02:08.759> checked<00:02:08.910> on<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.690> max<00:02:09.959> size<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.560> set<00:02:10.800> at

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
that's checked on and max size is set at

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.360 
that's checked on and max size is set at
four<00:02:11.540> okay

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
four okay

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.160 
four okay
and<00:02:14.370> turnoff<00:02:14.670> turbosmooth<00:02:15.570> so<00:02:15.960> you<00:02:16.050> can

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
and turnoff turbosmooth so you can

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.040 
and turnoff turbosmooth so you can
actually<00:02:16.440> see<00:02:16.770> what's<00:02:16.950> going<00:02:17.160> on<00:02:17.310> here<00:02:17.870> if<00:02:18.870> I

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
actually see what's going on here if I

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.560 
actually see what's going on here if I
turn<00:02:19.290> on<00:02:19.320> and<00:02:19.740> off<00:02:19.830> turn<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.370> Polly<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:21.450> can

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
turn on and off turn to Polly you can

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.080 
turn on and off turn to Polly you can
see<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.020> has<00:02:22.230> added<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:23.130> appropriate<00:02:23.220> edges

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
see it has added the appropriate edges

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.710 
see it has added the appropriate edges
to<00:02:24.750> fix<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.200> end<00:02:25.320> guns<00:02:26.180> now<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.480> great

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
to fix the end guns now this is a great

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.780 
to fix the end guns now this is a great
technique<00:02:27.960> if<00:02:28.380> you're<00:02:28.890> working<00:02:29.130> with<00:02:29.280> hard

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
technique if you're working with hard

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.970 
technique if you're working with hard
surface<00:02:30.210> models<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.230> need<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.650> fast

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
surface models and you need a fast

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.640 
surface models and you need a fast
solution<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.640> get<00:02:32.790> rid<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:32.970> your<00:02:33.120> end<00:02:33.270> guns<00:02:33.650> if

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
solution to get rid of your end guns if

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.710 
solution to get rid of your end guns if
you<00:02:34.920> have<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.520> mesh<00:02:36.090> where<00:02:36.330> you<00:02:36.420> need<00:02:36.600> to

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
you have a mesh where you need to

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.690 
you have a mesh where you need to
control<00:02:37.050> your<00:02:37.230> topology<00:02:37.590> more<00:02:37.980> I'm<00:02:38.460> gonna<00:02:38.550> go

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
control your topology more I'm gonna go

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.460 
control your topology more I'm gonna go
in<00:02:38.910> right<00:02:39.209> now<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.660> actually<00:02:39.750> show<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.170> how

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
in right now and actually show you how

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.170 
in right now and actually show you how
to<00:02:40.880> eliminate<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.240> head<00:02:42.360> bones<00:02:42.570> by<00:02:42.720> hand<00:02:44.180> so

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
to eliminate the head bones by hand so

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.110 
to eliminate the head bones by hand so
in<00:02:45.360> here<00:02:45.950> we<00:02:46.950> fix<00:02:47.220> this<00:02:47.340> area<00:02:47.580> down<00:02:47.700> here<00:02:47.760> but

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
in here we fix this area down here but

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.510 
in here we fix this area down here but
we're<00:02:48.209> going<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.360> continue<00:02:48.600> this<00:02:49.170> by<00:02:50.070> going<00:02:50.370> to

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
we're going to continue this by going to

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.020 
we're going to continue this by going to
edge<00:02:50.730> mode<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:52.459> continuing<00:02:53.459> this<00:02:53.550> edge<00:02:53.760> loop

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
edge mode and continuing this edge loop

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.120 
edge mode and continuing this edge loop
up<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:56.930> first<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:58.080> all<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.170> know<00:02:58.320> that<00:02:58.470> these

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
up so first of all I know that these

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.850 
up so first of all I know that these
n-gons<00:02:59.550> are<00:02:59.790> here<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:00.660> how<00:03:00.989> about<00:03:01.050> tell<00:03:01.440> where

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
n-gons are here but how about tell where

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.220 
n-gons are here but how about tell where
the<00:03:02.010> end<00:03:02.160> guns<00:03:02.340> are<00:03:02.550> in<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:03.270> whole<00:03:03.600> mesh<00:03:03.870> well

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
the end guns are in the whole mesh well

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.270 
the end guns are in the whole mesh well
what<00:03:04.830> I<00:03:04.890> can<00:03:05.070> do<00:03:05.220> is<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.640> go<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.060> polygon<00:03:06.270> mode<00:03:06.510> I

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
what I can do is I go to polygon mode I

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.130 
what I can do is I go to polygon mode I
can<00:03:08.280> go<00:03:08.400> up<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:09.120> selection<00:03:09.540> ribbon<00:03:09.989> up

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
can go up to the selection ribbon up

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.229 
can go up to the selection ribbon up
here<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.650> all<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.520> way<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.850> right<00:03:12.000> we

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
here and all the way to the right we

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.530 
here and all the way to the right we
have<00:03:12.270> by<00:03:13.140> numeric<00:03:13.709> make<00:03:14.700> sure<00:03:14.910> greater<00:03:15.300> than

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
have by numeric make sure greater than

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.520 
have by numeric make sure greater than
is<00:03:15.780> toggled<00:03:16.739> on<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.310> sides<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:18.090> for<00:03:18.480> what<00:03:19.380> this

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
is toggled on and sides is for what this

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.930 
is toggled on and sides is for what this
is<00:03:19.620> going<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:19.860> do<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.250> select<00:03:20.459> all<00:03:20.790> the

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
is going to do is select all the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.930 
is going to do is select all the
polygons<00:03:21.360> on<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.630> mesh<00:03:21.810> that<00:03:22.380> are<00:03:22.860> more<00:03:23.760> than

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
polygons on the mesh that are more than

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.259 
polygons on the mesh that are more than
four<00:03:24.209> sided<00:03:24.510> polygons<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:25.890> in<00:03:26.880> other<00:03:27.030> words

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
four sided polygons so in other words

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.710 
four sided polygons so in other words
end<00:03:27.600> bones<00:03:27.840> we<00:03:28.769> press<00:03:28.980> select<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:30.150> select<00:03:30.510> all

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
end bones we press select so select all

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.590 
end bones we press select so select all
the<00:03:30.870> end<00:03:31.019> dawns<00:03:31.200> on<00:03:31.350> mesh<00:03:31.940> you<00:03:32.940> can<00:03:33.000> see<00:03:33.360> that

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
the end dawns on mesh you can see that

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.070 
the end dawns on mesh you can see that
and<00:03:34.530> start<00:03:35.430> eliminating<00:03:35.640> them<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.540> targeting

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
and start eliminating them and targeting

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.120 
and start eliminating them and targeting
where<00:03:37.470> they<00:03:37.680> are<00:03:38.120> so<00:03:39.140> let's<00:03:40.140> start<00:03:40.410> solving

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
where they are so let's start solving

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.530 
where they are so let's start solving
this<00:03:41.459> one<00:03:41.640> right<00:03:41.880> here<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:43.160> go<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.220> edge<00:03:44.400> mode<00:03:44.540> go

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
this one right here I go to edge mode go

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.789 
this one right here I go to edge mode go
down<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:46.140> cut<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:48.630> I'm<00:03:49.320> going<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.470> turn<00:03:49.650> my

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
down to cut and I'm going to turn my

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.699 
down to cut and I'm going to turn my
snapping<00:03:50.250> on<00:03:50.400> okay<00:03:51.360> so<00:03:52.260> if<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.500> right-click

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
snapping on okay so if you right-click

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.460 
snapping on okay so if you right-click
this<00:03:53.160> you<00:03:54.090> see<00:03:54.269> I<00:03:54.299> have<00:03:54.480> vertex<00:03:55.080> and<00:03:55.320> edge

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
this you see I have vertex and edge

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.500 
this you see I have vertex and edge
segment<00:03:56.070> selected<00:03:56.580> I'll<00:03:57.000> make<00:03:57.180> sure<00:03:57.360> these

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
segment selected I'll make sure these

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.910 
segment selected I'll make sure these
are<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.720> only<00:03:57.989> one<00:03:58.110> selected<00:03:58.620> when<00:03:58.799> you're

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
are the only one selected when you're

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.780 
are the only one selected when you're
working<00:03:59.220> with<00:03:59.310> these<00:03:59.430> edges<00:04:01.519> start<00:04:02.519> with<00:04:02.640> this

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
working with these edges start with this

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.229 
working with these edges start with this
vertice<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:03.810> continue<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.739> edge<00:04:04.920> loop

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
vertice and continue the edge loop

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.190 
vertice and continue the edge loop
upwards<00:04:07.700> actually<00:04:08.700> hit<00:04:08.880> a<00:04:08.910> vert<00:04:09.239> there<00:04:09.540> make

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
upwards actually hit a vert there make

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.990 
upwards actually hit a vert there make
sure<00:04:10.230> it's<00:04:10.410> on<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.739> edge

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.970 

complete<00:04:16.000> it<00:04:16.150> there<00:04:18.810> and<00:04:19.810> see<00:04:20.049> my<00:04:20.200> my<00:04:20.620> shaving

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
complete it there and see my my shaving

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.250 
complete it there and see my my shaving
actually<00:04:21.459> changed<00:04:21.850> there<00:04:22.060> so<00:04:22.330> i<00:04:22.570> zoom<00:04:22.900> in<00:04:23.230> here

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
actually changed there so i zoom in here

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.840 
actually changed there so i zoom in here
I'll<00:04:24.220> turn<00:04:24.430> off<00:04:24.580> snapping<00:04:25.120> for<00:04:25.360> a<00:04:25.419> second<00:04:25.780> and

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
I'll turn off snapping for a second and

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.170 
I'll turn off snapping for a second and
if<00:04:27.850> I<00:04:28.060> start<00:04:28.360> cutting<00:04:28.720> this<00:04:29.560> edge<00:04:29.830> to<00:04:30.190> here<00:04:31.030> and

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
if I start cutting this edge to here and

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.060 
if I start cutting this edge to here and
I<00:04:31.270> actually<00:04:31.389> miss<00:04:31.810> it<00:04:31.840> I'll<00:04:32.500> notice<00:04:32.889> the

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
I actually miss it I'll notice the

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.030 
I actually miss it I'll notice the
shading<00:04:33.430> will<00:04:33.580> change<00:04:33.820> a<00:04:33.940> little<00:04:34.060> bit<00:04:34.919> but<00:04:35.919> if

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
shading will change a little bit but if

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.700 
shading will change a little bit but if
I<00:04:36.130> could<00:04:36.400> cut<00:04:36.669> it<00:04:36.790> correctly<00:04:37.440> shading<00:04:38.440> will

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
I could cut it correctly shading will

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.830 
I could cut it correctly shading will
remain<00:04:39.930> close<00:04:40.930> to<00:04:41.169> where<00:04:41.530> it<00:04:41.620> was<00:04:41.770> before<00:04:42.840> so

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
remain close to where it was before so

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.570 
remain close to where it was before so
that's<00:04:43.930> just<00:04:44.139> a<00:04:44.290> little<00:04:44.500> tip<00:04:44.710> when<00:04:45.340> you're

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
that's just a little tip when you're

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.480 
that's just a little tip when you're
cutting<00:04:45.850> these<00:04:46.090> edges<00:04:46.919> another<00:04:47.919> way<00:04:48.070> to<00:04:48.130> cut

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
cutting these edges another way to cut

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.820 
cutting these edges another way to cut
these<00:04:48.669> edge<00:04:49.030> loops<00:04:49.389> through<00:04:49.780> and<00:04:50.380> see<00:04:50.680> this

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
these edge loops through and see this

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.540 
these edge loops through and see this
end<00:04:51.130> gone<00:04:51.310> right<00:04:52.120> here<00:04:52.919> where<00:04:53.919> I<00:04:53.979> solve<00:04:54.310> this

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
end gone right here where I solve this

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.540 
end gone right here where I solve this
by<00:04:55.090> selecting<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.720> adjacent<00:04:56.350> edge<00:04:56.530> to<00:04:57.370> the

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
by selecting the adjacent edge to the

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.440 
by selecting the adjacent edge to the
edge<00:04:57.580> loop<00:04:57.970> running<00:04:58.360> into<00:04:58.810> it<00:04:58.930> and<00:04:59.169> press<00:04:59.889> ring

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
edge loop running into it and press ring

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:06.680 
edge loop running into it and press ring
then<00:05:01.450> press<00:05:01.780> connect<00:05:02.790> connect<00:05:03.790> that<00:05:03.970> through

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.909 

now<00:05:07.690> when<00:05:07.870> you're<00:05:07.990> working<00:05:08.110> with<00:05:08.320> edge<00:05:08.590> loops

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
now when you're working with edge loops

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.250 
now when you're working with edge loops
a<00:05:09.190> good<00:05:09.639> thing<00:05:09.820> to<00:05:09.940> do<00:05:10.090> is<00:05:10.330> run<00:05:10.600> the<00:05:10.780> edge<00:05:10.960> loops

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
a good thing to do is run the edge loops

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.340 
a good thing to do is run the edge loops
into<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.889> border<00:05:12.310> or<00:05:12.490> the<00:05:12.790> symmetry<00:05:13.120> line<00:05:13.419> now

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
into the border or the symmetry line now

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.680 
into the border or the symmetry line now
the<00:05:14.410> border<00:05:14.919> we<00:05:15.669> can<00:05:15.820> look<00:05:15.970> at<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.180> eye<00:05:16.210> here

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
the border we can look at the eye here

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.900 
the border we can look at the eye here
and<00:05:17.820> if<00:05:18.820> I<00:05:19.240> have<00:05:19.530> border<00:05:20.530> selected<00:05:21.039> we<00:05:21.490> can<00:05:21.669> see

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
and if I have border selected we can see

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.210 
and if I have border selected we can see
that<00:05:22.120> it<00:05:22.570> is<00:05:22.630> a<00:05:22.900> border<00:05:23.380> there<00:05:23.650> is<00:05:23.889> a<00:05:23.919> hole

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
that it is a border there is a hole

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.020 
that it is a border there is a hole
there<00:05:24.490> and<00:05:24.700> we<00:05:25.000> can<00:05:25.470> run<00:05:26.470> edge<00:05:27.010> loops<00:05:27.639> into

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
there and we can run edge loops into

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.730 
there and we can run edge loops into
this<00:05:28.150> and<00:05:28.419> it<00:05:28.479> will<00:05:28.570> be<00:05:28.690> a<00:05:28.870> clean<00:05:29.440> place<00:05:29.710> to

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
this and it will be a clean place to

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.670 
this and it will be a clean place to
finish<00:05:30.220> the<00:05:30.490> edge<00:05:30.580> loop<00:05:30.850> so<00:05:31.690> up<00:05:32.050> here<00:05:32.289> we<00:05:32.350> have

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
finish the edge loop so up here we have

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.820 
finish the edge loop so up here we have
an<00:05:33.430> end<00:05:33.700> gone<00:05:33.880> and<00:05:34.470> we're<00:05:35.470> going<00:05:35.620> to<00:05:35.650> solve

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
an end gone and we're going to solve

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.250 
an end gone and we're going to solve
this<00:05:36.070> by<00:05:36.310> going<00:05:36.850> to<00:05:36.940> edges<00:05:37.300> select<00:05:38.080> the

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
this by going to edges select the

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.110 
this by going to edges select the
adjacent<00:05:38.860> edge<00:05:40.350> run<00:05:41.350> the<00:05:41.860> edge<00:05:42.220> loop<00:05:42.520> through

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
adjacent edge run the edge loop through

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.750 
adjacent edge run the edge loop through
it<00:05:43.710> we're<00:05:44.710> actually<00:05:44.830> going<00:05:45.100> to<00:05:45.220> select<00:05:45.460> the

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
it we're actually going to select the

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.560 
it we're actually going to select the
ring<00:05:45.940> connect<00:05:46.720> it<00:05:46.930> and<00:05:48.090> connect<00:05:49.090> that<00:05:49.240> to<00:05:49.479> the

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
ring connect it and connect that to the

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.060 
ring connect it and connect that to the
edge<00:05:49.720> loop<00:05:51.090> so<00:05:52.090> we<00:05:52.120> have<00:05:52.360> that<00:05:52.510> going<00:05:52.750> through

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
edge loop so we have that going through

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.529 
edge loop so we have that going through
into<00:05:54.070> the<00:05:54.610> eye<00:05:55.330> which<00:05:55.960> is<00:05:56.139> a<00:05:56.320> border<00:05:57.150> now<00:05:58.150> I

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
into the eye which is a border now I

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:00.870 
into the eye which is a border now I
said<00:05:58.840> there<00:05:59.139> it<00:05:59.740> can<00:05:59.919> also<00:06:00.070> be<00:06:00.310> done<00:06:00.580> on<00:06:00.639> the

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
said there it can also be done on the

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.490 
said there it can also be done on the
symmetry<00:06:01.180> line<00:06:01.450> and<00:06:01.750> the<00:06:01.930> reason<00:06:02.229> is<00:06:02.470> because

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
symmetry line and the reason is because

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.520 
symmetry line and the reason is because
the<00:06:03.039> symmetry<00:06:03.310> line<00:06:03.669> is<00:06:03.970> a<00:06:04.389> large<00:06:04.990> border<00:06:05.820> so

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
the symmetry line is a large border so

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.379 
the symmetry line is a large border so
you<00:06:08.530> can<00:06:08.710> run<00:06:08.889> your<00:06:08.919> edge<00:06:09.190> loops<00:06:09.460> into<00:06:09.970> the

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
you can run your edge loops into the

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:14.100 
you can run your edge loops into the
cemetery<00:06:10.780> line<00:06:11.110> if<00:06:11.349> you<00:06:11.710> have<00:06:11.889> one<00:06:12.479> I<00:06:13.479> do<00:06:13.870> not
