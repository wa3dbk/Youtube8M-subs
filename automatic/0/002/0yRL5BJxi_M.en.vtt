00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:12.610
 I do not think you get the impact on the environment as people live the world. 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.150
 Do you think you live without 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:21.039
 The specials have risen soaring. 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:25.210
 It does not affect 4 2 n coming year, and I have a hand so far 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:27.550
 Any-one's almost never met a horse forehead hit the phone dry 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.760
 You're right, you're saying that. 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:36.730
 The two disciples were not going to be together . 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:40.899
 I have a Master who has a bad name with his competitor. 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:45.519
 The product is known as Master I said that I used to hear mermaids Right. 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:47.679
 Another friend had the offense is so bad that the teacher Right. 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:50.739
 We deny that this may still leave the salt of 5 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:56.170
 Asshole gets is that he is right or wrong yes yes in front of people, insurance 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.159
 You say only my words, but the more important is the more fit and the less fit 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.359
 I have words. 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:04.510
 Given that people are influenced by the environment 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:08.110
 If the environment is good, it will succeed. 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.420
 If the environment is bad, it could fail, but that's not necessarily true. 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.560
 So I'll continue to talk about my beats 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.009
 Instead of good environment, there is a person who has a mark and a person who succeeds in bad environment 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.689
 You know. 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:24.340
 The characters do not have to beat your solving environmental Knitted people who love the environment Success 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:29.470
 I also like successful people such as the environment is not a good person who fails to three environmental 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:34.690
 4 people who do not like it, what are you guys doing? 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:40.720
 I do not know the success and failure yet , so I do not know if the environment is good. 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:44.860
 Good is your success and failure can you not tell him that I somehow 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:49.030
 I can control it, but I can control the environment. 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.360
 So make the environment an environment that can be cathedraled 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.720
 Because the environment is good and you have to be successful . 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:00.130
 Pastor, but that's not the environment we can not do right now . 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:04.750
 So this is recommended but not the environment I'm in 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.360
 If successful, such 2 You have been good but the first thing not finished watching the performance 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.860
 Something rather than success 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:16.420
 So 3 snakes and accidents are not good at all. 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.520
 The problem is that you do not have the environment. 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.930
 Be good, be good 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.520
 So I know in the environment that we can not change the staff 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.170
 You can. 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:33.880
 Also can not go on this way at night as the world number three leader in the house you know know 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:38.500
 So I will move and recover the house three times . 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:42.640
 I noddle in. Then I got fatigue. 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.269
 If you stretch it, if you come in 3rd, if you are afraid of black people in 3rd, you are 4th. 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:51.640
 Including the ahninya're living in dirty that perspective 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:55.540
 I am a registrar 11g, and I clean up nods, 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:59.440
 Would not it be possible to create a good environment 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.640
 Not only does this environment live with Jongno , but also with all animals 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.489
 But you 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.330
 Flask one argument I look thin to survive the golden less adaptation is incomparable 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.739
 You know 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.840
 There is no opponent who beats the dinosaur knows Dinosaur Dinosaur half way 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.959
 The dinosaurs were extinct . 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.489
 But then look, experience a frog bonded. 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:24.459
 Would the snake be part with the member Ah just been alone But now I am 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:29.260
 Do not you think color is spreading 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:32.890
 State's language would you rat can not have a cat that just added to the side * 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:37.860
 We do not keep living. We look. For who the frog is. 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:40.630
 It's not that it's not just about being strong. 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:46.240
 It's also important to say that you adapt. 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:51.760
 Adapt to your environment 3 Drugs are counter-productive but not adaptable 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:58.720
 Although everyone or one bad experience the harsh life what information you today 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:04:01.870
 If you adapt well and make something successful there, you will find beautiful flowers in the dumpster. 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:08.319
 Would not it be beautiful if you lose it? 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:09.760
 Such a successful life is to create an environment of your life to conquer the environment 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.230
 Hope to be 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.709
 Let's not separate. 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.709
 Thank you
