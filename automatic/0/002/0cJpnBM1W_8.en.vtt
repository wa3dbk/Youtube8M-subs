00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:08.269
 imagine the benefits but comes voice 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.910
 of more enigmatic 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.940
 if again tightly calendar 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.699
 for two weeks now playing 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.869
 matches without stopping but the truth that the 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.990
 response to the boys has been 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.830
 excellent we are on a good path 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.750
 I hope we can continue adding on 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.310
 everything here in the monumental I think that 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.830
 we are also getting two points 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.809
 important outside that that in the end to the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.690
 long when sums will help a lot 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.160
 and good the classic as always is a 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.809
 special match but I will not think about 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.809
 the classic because tomorrow we have bone 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.379
 it's because of the need obviously in the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.140
 play many matches in a row not all 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.790
 we do not have robots in the team we have 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.890
 human beings that is normal they are going to 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.930
 feel the fatigue then so you do not 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.879
 affects the performance of the team 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.879
 we do a pretty variant 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.610
 just the voice a team that comes 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.440
 also adding up starts many problems 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.570
 to congratulate the boys I go 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.700
 because the truth is that in the situation that 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.200
 they are very difficult to demand 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.120
 professionalism to players and have the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.340
 courage and have the strength to go to 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.070
 train without knowing where they will train 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.330
 without knowing without charging and the truth that 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.700
 that is being boix is something that 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.159
 what to have 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.710
 something redeemable something to highlight and 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.110
 then a team that has players 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.960
 important players who handle well 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.100
 in the midfield he handles the ball well 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.399
 experience then it's going to be a match 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.679
 they think I do not know if compression or not 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.509
 but they go out to play some 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.509
 way that can complicate anyone 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.950
 look what I said bruno 12 days ago andy 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.170
 polyfunctional software in the part 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.360
 tactical technique when we do the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.630
 The balance of the equipment yields in all 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.210
 positions obviously a lot of people sure 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.000
 will think that he must surrender later on 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.610
 the same thing that will make goals but he in 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.050
 he is a body reads functional and he 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.970
 adapts adapts to all positions 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.470
 then we like it in 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.850
 any position where we have 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.850
 used, we liked it a lot 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.670
 I think that the classical 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.940
 I think it's a pity classic we're 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.860
 making the arrangements because 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.500
 and I think that there are still in Italy can not 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.780
 play until until January then which is 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.730
 a little bit there we are thinking what is the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.710
 idea of ​​these people in taking him now and 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.600
 then send it back for the same 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.970
 that he still can not act on 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:59.120
 italy for the subject of regulations 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:00.950
 fifa that I am in minor and not what 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.450
 they give but the most concrete they give and not 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.250
 because there is already a contract or a pre 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.470
 contract and has signed and up all this 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.050
 officialized those in agreement are rumors 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.570
 I believe that the parma according to us 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.100
 counted has already accepted only palms 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.300
 but for December to after 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.490
 December 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.200
 that 's what every last one knows 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.870
 that we know but good if the 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.400
 parma comes tomorrow and puts the silver and the 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.350
 need that the voice has surely 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.350
 it will be the best thing thinking about the club 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.390
 and we are in that we are in that 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.910
 obviously you have to be a little 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.950
 cautious with the subject of foreigners 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.810
 then that is a little bit that is 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.490
 tying the situation but we continue in 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.220
 observation we keep looking at names 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.240
 looking in there because as I told you 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.950
 it's an instant the squad is short 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.110
 then we are more players for 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.570
 to be able to compete from here to the end 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.010
 of the championship but still we are not so 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.230
 desperate but everything with 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.610
 quiet the priorities that go 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.260
 also helping this administration to 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.240
 that the budget you have now 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.950
 same comply with what they are guys 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.850
 who have stayed have sacrificed and if 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.850
 sometimes in that change
