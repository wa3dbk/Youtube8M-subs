00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:10.680 
you guys an update I've been on the

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.799 
you guys an update I've been on the
South<00:00:10.889> Beach<00:00:11.130> Diet<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.730> today<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.270> day<00:00:12.510> five

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
South Beach Diet and today is day five

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.460 
South Beach Diet and today is day five
and<00:00:13.610> I<00:00:15.590> lost<00:00:16.590> 0.6<00:00:17.550> pounds<00:00:18.080> so<00:00:19.080> that's<00:00:19.289> about

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
and I lost 0.6 pounds so that's about

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.140 
and I lost 0.6 pounds so that's about
half<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> pound<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.400> now<00:00:21.060> weigh<00:00:21.390> 120<00:00:22.140> 6.4<00:00:22.950> and<00:00:23.340> I

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
half a pound I now weigh 120 6.4 and I

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.040 
half a pound I now weigh 120 6.4 and I
started<00:00:24.600> out<00:00:24.780> wing<00:00:25.400> 130<00:00:26.400> point<00:00:26.820> 8<00:00:27.120> so<00:00:27.690> I<00:00:27.720> guess

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
started out wing 130 point 8 so I guess

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.450 
started out wing 130 point 8 so I guess
that<00:00:28.260> means<00:00:28.470> I've<00:00:28.830> lost<00:00:33.710> which<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:35.010> four

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
that means I've lost which is that four

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.380 
that means I've lost which is that four
point<00:00:36.030> four<00:00:36.719> pounds<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:38.030> about<00:00:39.030> four<00:00:39.269> and<00:00:39.359> a

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
point four pounds so about four and a

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.020 
point four pounds so about four and a
half<00:00:39.420> pounds<00:00:40.019> that's<00:00:40.320> pretty<00:00:40.649> good<00:00:42.379> and<00:00:44.030> I

especially<00:02:35.520> when<00:02:35.640> you're<00:02:35.760> in<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.880> South

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060

especially when you're in the South
Beach<00:02:36.270> Diet<00:02:36.480> because<00:02:36.660> you're<00:02:36.750> not<00:02:36.930> really

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
Beach Diet because you're not really

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.960 
Beach Diet because you're not really
getting<00:02:37.890> much<00:02:38.130> fiber<00:02:38.430> since<00:02:38.760> you're<00:02:38.880> not

getting much fiber since you're not

eating<00:02:39.300> any<00:02:39.420> carbs<00:02:42.290> but<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.800> only<00:02:44.070> has<00:02:44.430> 4<00:02:44.880> grams

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
eating any carbs but it only has 4 grams

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.910 
eating any carbs but it only has 4 grams
of<00:02:45.330> sugar<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:47.540> that<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:48.870> really<00:02:49.140> good<00:02:49.440> compared

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
of sugar so that is really good compared

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.500 
of sugar so that is really good compared
to<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.130> other<00:02:50.340> yogurts<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.000> other<00:02:51.150> yogurts

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
to the other yogurts the other yogurts

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.770 
to the other yogurts the other yogurts
have<00:02:51.690> like<00:02:51.900> close<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.620> 20<00:02:52.950> grams<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.280> sugar<00:02:53.780> or

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
have like close to 20 grams of sugar or

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.080 
have like close to 20 grams of sugar or
the<00:02:55.200> very<00:02:55.410> least<00:02:55.740> that<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.070> saw<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.610> think<00:02:56.790> 12

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
the very least that I saw is I think 12

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.230 
the very least that I saw is I think 12
grams<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:57.690> 4<00:02:57.960> grams<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.320> sugar<00:02:58.530> is<00:02:58.650> really<00:02:58.890> good

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
grams so 4 grams of sugar is really good

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:06.830 
grams so 4 grams of sugar is really good
so<00:03:00.240> I<00:03:00.690> feel<00:03:01.350> okay<00:03:01.710> about<00:03:01.830> having<00:03:02.370> these<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:06.420> in

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
so I feel okay about having these so in

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.130 
so I feel okay about having these so in
that<00:03:08.870> with<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.020> another<00:03:10.230> snack<00:03:10.590> option<00:03:12.140> then

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
that with the another snack option then

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.540 
that with the another snack option then
for<00:03:13.860> lunch<00:03:17.330> or<00:03:18.330> for<00:03:18.360> snack<00:03:19.020> it<00:03:19.920> depends<00:03:20.400> just

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
for lunch or for snack it depends just

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.370 
for lunch or for snack it depends just
how<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.760> make<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.239> if<00:03:21.840> you're<00:03:22.020> gonna<00:03:22.080> do<00:03:22.260> this

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
how you make it if you're gonna do this

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.460 
how you make it if you're gonna do this
for<00:03:22.440> lunch<00:03:23.330> you<00:03:24.330> probably<00:03:24.660> want<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:24.930> have<00:03:24.989> a

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
for lunch you probably want to have a

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.949 
for lunch you probably want to have a
side<00:03:26.040> with<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.430> like<00:03:26.730> vegetables<00:03:27.390> or<00:03:27.540> salad<00:03:27.720> or

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
side with it like vegetables or salad or

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.750 
side with it like vegetables or salad or
something<00:03:29.270> but<00:03:30.650> to<00:03:31.650> not<00:03:31.890> is<00:03:32.130> always<00:03:32.489> good

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
something but to not is always good

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.759 
something but to not is always good
these<00:03:33.420> are<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.690> really<00:03:33.930> small<00:03:34.230> packets<00:03:34.680> you

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
these are the really small packets you

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:35.750 
these are the really small packets you
could<00:03:34.920> probably<00:03:35.040> get<00:03:35.250> away<00:03:35.340> with<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.550> bigger

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
could probably get away with a bigger

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.030 
could probably get away with a bigger
one<00:03:35.790> but<00:03:36.209> this<00:03:36.420> packet<00:03:36.900> here<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.660> 3<00:03:39.660> ounce

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
one but this packet here is a 3 ounce

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.759 
one but this packet here is a 3 ounce
can<00:03:41.300> and<00:03:42.300> it<00:03:42.390> has<00:03:42.510> 90<00:03:42.930> calories<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.530> tutors

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
can and it has 90 calories and tutors

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.490 
can and it has 90 calories and tutors
always<00:03:43.950> good<00:03:44.100> it<00:03:44.220> has<00:03:44.370> zero<00:03:44.940> carbs<00:03:45.390> one<00:03:46.260> gram

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
always good it has zero carbs one gram

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.160 
always good it has zero carbs one gram
of<00:03:46.530> fat<00:03:46.850> 20<00:03:47.850> yards<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.180> protein<00:03:48.630> so<00:03:48.810> this<00:03:48.989> is

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
of fat 20 yards of protein so this is

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.680 
of fat 20 yards of protein so this is
great<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.739> done<00:03:50.150> this<00:03:51.150> is<00:03:51.300> especially<00:03:51.480> good

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
great and done this is especially good

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.900 
great and done this is especially good
