00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 be very careful with those who say 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.790
 skaters 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.790
 they deserve 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.720
 Hey, people, I'm a rodrigo mouse. 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.449
 today we will start killing him to 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.580
 to start well from scratch we'll teach 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.000
 and if we are not going to give some tips on how and 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.420
 where to buy the iscte 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.309
 fuck the noise because for a layman it's 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.590
 very difficult to buy the first skate 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.960
 sometimes because that track is the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.450
 seller does not understand anything and sells one 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.579
 slopes times the wood the seller 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.110
 sell one to the track 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.940
 the street freestyle isla long all 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.809
 kits have differences that 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.030
 working, and 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.850
 I do not like riding a skateboard to everything and 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.100
 to become active a pact he swims 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.820
 walks and he flies only he does not 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.440
 not good 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.809
 the ideal is to buy a more focused skate 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.890
 for the type of ticket you want to do 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:11.820
 nothing like the focus of the date that one is to give a 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.560
 river nÃ© skate downhill we will pull 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.180
 more to this side so I will not talk 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.799
 much of it criticized 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.369
 but the ideal to buy the first 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.320
 skate is to look for a specialized store 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:27.090
 there are some to avoid buying in 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.210
 large networks because generally those that 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.420
 already come mounted or skateboard nascimbem 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.060
 very bad and with this money 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.909
 difference they already bought a skateboard one 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.119
 little better or better many times 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.909
 in a specialized store that the seller 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.759
 skateboard he understands that he 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.790
 know right well the parts indicate you're in 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.040
 time to look to see if the seller 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.799
 Anyone who is connected to the store? 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.200
 shop to see if it is a practitioner to see if he is 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.110
 going to the championships to see if you 're doing 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.090
 photos videos he lives this even many 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.960
 times the guy with the skateboard to walk the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.500
 border 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.310
 only he wants to go downhill has to 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.590
 lack of information 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.170
 buyer often the seller also 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.880
 for being a mall shop that guy 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.920
 do not understand anything by giving this research 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.810
 dinha in a specialized store will 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.970
 help a lot and will cut a path 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.280
 cool for those who have starting from scratch 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.860
 So for those who already walk, you'll know the 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.590
 channels so it gets easier not to 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.580
 Can I buy the iscte any store? 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.300
 from surfistinha shopping 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.459
 then take a look at the seller 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.799
 on the ideal wheel the ideal size for those who 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.290
 will want to do this if the wheel will have the 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.080
 round ball Saturday will have the ball 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.120
 square that are the most racing or for 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.640
 someone who needs more grip more 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.980
 see the detail of the width of the 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.590
 tank will be compatible with shape 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.989
 these small details as they are already 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.819
 more specific but in the end leaves 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.650
 hot weather asked if you will have a 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.440
 spacer that will leave the wheel 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.170
 no slack that most stores 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.660
 understands nothing and neither sells nor 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.720
 which is also to see the width of the shape 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.329
 ideal in downhill are usually 10 10 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.430
 inch wide of a chip with a 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:22.209
 good proportional width for 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.010
 had a two-meter face in shape 34 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.310
 inches long will stay the 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.250
 then take a look with the 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.980
 alderman in the real one does not have much what 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.209
 explain here why who will do this 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.380
 Work will be the seller. 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.940
 specialized store and that's it folks 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:44.350
 Any questions can send a message 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:47.200
 here the guys from here the next theme is 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.510
 command if you kill a lot of people buy 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.880
 skateboard longboard to take a river and goes 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.160
 to the rock slope the tank descends straight 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.010
 falls and hurts is a sport that is not 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.030
 easy any questions here also on the river 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.650
 January I work on hot music 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.769
 im here 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.519
 Then you can send a message on facebook 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:11.319
 The site is not on the air because I am 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.950
 disorganized as fucking 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:17.190
 but soon will be and any doubt 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.190
