00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:10.030
 do if they also want to give messages 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.700
 if the partner that is but that does not 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.360
 of harming and the message of others 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.980
 people 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.680
 that's the problem 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.500
 and clear with respect and is that respect 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.779
 is that they do this kind of thing that is not 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.599
 is that they follow the people who 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.119
 constant way from day to day we are 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.460
 giving the debates of the university and in 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.800
 the work of the university in the country already 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.640
 that looks at me tells me more than this 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.370
 note 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.920
 it tells me more a graffiti like that 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.260
 made to the race that a person who 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.960
 he starts to make a fool of himself 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.570
 way simply to discredit the 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.210
 message that organizations are giving 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.940
 and even unorganized people we are 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.780
 giving the faculty at the University 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:01.210
 and it is that feeds of expression is not that 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.210
 I shit on others because they are booksellers 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.800
 there are many 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:28.610
 and is that another person expresses no 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.610
 problem but if they do not listen they are 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.269
 attacking a message to what they want 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.650
 do what you want but for there to be 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.330
 freedom of expression there is a 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.190
 fundamental principle and is the discussion 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.519
 because there must be equality 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.519
 parts 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.960
 and that can not be discussed, for example 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.640
 I could not get myself to argue with 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.340
 you good how to kill me with such 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.650
 coursing he hugged my head not the 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.450
 debates imply equality and that 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.310
 equality and effectively respect for 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.510
 the differences but that's not a 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.770
 respect for differences are a 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.770
 aggression and part of this 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:29.850
 there is censorship the freedom of 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.520
 expression at the national university of 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.140
 Colombia can not see is politicize the 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.170
 university you can not politicize the 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.170
 education 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:54.830
 liberal is important the university 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:11.430
 if we build together from 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:16.769
 of the differences hide this because 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:19.130
 this mural 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.130
 Help me 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.900
 in the news than in the pedagogical
