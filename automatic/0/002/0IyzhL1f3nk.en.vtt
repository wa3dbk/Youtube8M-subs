00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960

every<00:01:04.680> time<00:01:04.920> too<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:06.710> this<00:01:10.429> those<00:01:11.429> two<00:01:11.459> pieces

00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:11.819 
every time too but this those two pieces

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:13.639 
every time too but this those two pieces
in<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.209> pieces<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.689> take<00:01:12.929> off<00:01:13.109> every<00:01:13.439> time

in this pieces I take off every time
after<00:01:13.859> I'm<00:01:14.130> done<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:16.219> it<00:01:17.219> helps<00:01:17.639> like<00:01:18.359> this

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
after I'm done but it helps like this

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.149 
after I'm done but it helps like this
little<00:01:18.869> piece<00:01:19.079> here<00:01:19.109> it's<00:01:19.560> really<00:01:19.740> hard<00:01:20.009> to

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
little piece here it's really hard to

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.410 
little piece here it's really hard to
get<00:01:20.369> clean<00:01:20.609> really<00:01:21.420> clean<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:23.119> basically<00:01:24.119> if

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:40.609 
up through the tip here

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:42.949 
up through the tip here
