00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
about values and edges and how that

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.900 
about values and edges and how that
relates<00:00:08.969> to<00:00:09.090> drawing<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:09.900> really<00:00:10.849> how<00:00:11.849> to

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.320 
use value in edges to portray a
realistic<00:00:15.330> image<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.020> just<00:00:16.439> have<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:17.330> self

day something really quickly and from a
photograph<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.450> probably<00:00:24.660> spent<00:00:25.020> fifteen

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
photograph I probably spent fifteen

photograph I probably spent fifteen
minutes<00:00:25.980> tops<00:00:26.579> on<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.800> it's<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.860> small<00:00:29.160> sketch

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.459 

but<00:00:34.050> there<00:00:34.440> are<00:00:34.559> some<00:00:34.769> few<00:00:35.190> things<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.640> want<00:00:35.879> to

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
but there are some few things I want to

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.590 
but there are some few things I want to
talk<00:00:37.469> about<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.219> its<00:00:38.879> value

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
talk about and that its value

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.880 
talk about and that its value
first<00:00:40.289> of<00:00:40.469> all<00:00:40.530> value<00:00:42.199> so<00:00:43.199> value<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.739> how

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
first of all value so value is this how

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.250 
first of all value so value is this how
light<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.339> dark<00:00:44.579> things<00:00:44.879> are<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.960> use<00:00:46.109> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
light and dark things are and I use the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.220 
light and dark things are and I use the
number<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.800> 2b<00:00:47.579> pencil<00:00:47.609> for<00:00:48.359> this<00:00:48.480> whole<00:00:48.989> entire

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
number a 2b pencil for this whole entire

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.930 
number a 2b pencil for this whole entire
entire<00:00:49.769> thing<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:52.620> there's<00:00:52.859> a<00:00:52.920> little<00:00:53.670> trick

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
entire thing so there's a little trick

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.119 
entire thing so there's a little trick
that<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.480> lot<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.170> artists<00:00:55.499> do<00:00:55.589> if<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.800> look<00:00:55.980> at

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
that a lot of artists do if you look at

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.139 
that a lot of artists do if you look at
paintings<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.909> all<00:00:57.359> kinds<00:00:57.839> of<00:00:57.929> art

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
paintings and all kinds of art

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.669 
paintings and all kinds of art
especially<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.510> portraits<00:01:00.929> you'll<00:01:01.289> notice

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
especially on portraits you'll notice

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.649 
especially on portraits you'll notice
that<00:01:01.859> where<00:01:02.129> there's<00:01:02.339> light<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.909> the<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
that where there's light on the on the

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.929 
that where there's light on the on the
face<00:01:04.760> wherever<00:01:05.760> there's<00:01:06.060> light<00:01:06.390> they<00:01:07.229> use<00:01:07.439> a

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
face wherever there's light they use a

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.060 
face wherever there's light they use a
darker<00:01:08.939> background<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:10.880> as<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.090> gets<00:01:12.270> darker

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
darker background and as it gets darker

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.469 
darker background and as it gets darker
you'll<00:01:14.070> see<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.430> sometimes<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:15.119> kind<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
you'll see this sometimes it's kind of a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.399 
you'll see this sometimes it's kind of a
noble<00:01:15.869> trick

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
noble trick

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.830 
noble trick
real<00:01:16.829> easy<00:01:17.009> trick<00:01:17.430> where<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.670> gets<00:01:17.880> dark<00:01:18.240> you

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
real easy trick where it gets dark you

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.050 
real easy trick where it gets dark you
kind<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.140> light<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.469> the<00:01:19.530> background<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:20.100> bit<00:01:20.130> so

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
kind of light in the background a bit so

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.910 
kind of light in the background a bit so
it<00:01:21.180> creates<00:01:21.479> some<00:01:21.659> contrast<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.649> that's<00:01:22.770> what

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
it creates some contrast and that's what

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.800 
it creates some contrast and that's what
I<00:01:22.950> have<00:01:23.250> going<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.390> where<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.689> all

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
I have going on here so where it's all

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.510 
I have going on here so where it's all
light<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.170> my<00:01:25.259> face<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:25.770> darken<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
light on my face I just darken the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.789 
light on my face I just darken the
background<00:01:27.200> I'm<00:01:28.200> wearing<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.500> dark<00:01:28.740> shirt

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
background I'm wearing a dark shirt

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.520 
background I'm wearing a dark shirt
there<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.610> my<00:01:30.240> face<00:01:30.509> really<00:01:30.780> comes<00:01:31.110> forward

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
there so my face really comes forward

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.249 
there so my face really comes forward
and<00:01:31.860> also<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.030> dark<00:01:33.299> area<00:01:33.719> here<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
and also the dark area here in the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.350 
and also the dark area here in the
shadow<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.969> my<00:01:35.969> hair<00:01:37.880> due<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.149> light

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
shadow of my hair due to the light

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.420 
shadow of my hair due to the light
background<00:01:39.899> here<00:01:40.049> now<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.799> could<00:01:41.340> have

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
background here now you can I could have

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.730 
background here now you can I could have
let<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.850> dark<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.509> really<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:43.289> my<00:01:43.469> hair

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
let that dark and really have my hair

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.880 
let that dark and really have my hair
kind<00:01:44.039> of<00:01:44.189> fade<00:01:44.909> into<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.359> background<00:01:45.890> so

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
kind of fade into the background so

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.679 
kind of fade into the background so
there's<00:01:47.159> not<00:01:47.310> really<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.759> set<00:01:48.060> rule<00:01:48.359> or

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
there's not really a set rule or

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.539 
there's not really a set rule or
anything<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:50.340> playing

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
anything like that it's just playing

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.219 
anything like that it's just playing
around<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.030> finding<00:01:51.630> out<00:01:51.719> what<00:01:51.899> works<00:01:52.049> best

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
around and finding out what works best

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.810 
around and finding out what works best
for<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.250> could<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.549> made<00:01:53.700> this

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
for you but I could have made this

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.450 
for you but I could have made this
really<00:01:54.119> dark<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.659> my<00:01:54.810> hair<00:01:55.430> you<00:01:56.430> know

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
really dark and have my hair you know

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.660 
really dark and have my hair you know
blend<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.060> out<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.750> then<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:59.340> kind<00:01:59.609> of

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
blend that out and then that kind of

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.300 
blend that out and then that kind of
goes<00:02:00.390> into<00:02:00.689> edges<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.469> could<00:02:01.649> have<00:02:01.740> lost<00:02:01.920> that

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
goes into edges I could have lost that

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.399 
goes into edges I could have lost that
edge<00:02:02.369> completely<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.869> wouldn't<00:02:04.320> even

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
edge completely so you wouldn't even

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.139 
edge completely so you wouldn't even
seen<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> edge<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.159> my<00:02:05.340> hair<00:02:05.609> would<00:02:05.880> have<00:02:05.969> just

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
seen the edge of my hair would have just

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.150 
seen the edge of my hair would have just
blended<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:06.840> softly<00:02:07.320> into<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.679> background

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
blended in softly into the background

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.370 
blended in softly into the background
and<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.940> would<00:02:09.060> have<00:02:09.179> really<00:02:09.420> brought<00:02:10.170> this

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
and it would have really brought this

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.380 
and it would have really brought this
forward<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.160> pushed<00:02:11.490> to<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:11.790> back

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.910 

so<00:02:15.200> there's<00:02:15.320> different<00:02:15.410> ways<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.860> doing

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
so there's different ways of doing

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.550 
so there's different ways of doing
things<00:02:16.370> now<00:02:16.640> as<00:02:16.880> far<00:02:17.060> as<00:02:17.120> edges<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:17.930> I'm<00:02:18.410> just

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
things now as far as edges and I'm just

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.230 
things now as far as edges and I'm just
going<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.710> give<00:02:18.830> some<00:02:19.040> quick<00:02:19.190> explanations<00:02:20.060> we

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
going to give some quick explanations we

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.140 
going to give some quick explanations we
can<00:02:20.420> in<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:21.080> next<00:02:21.110> few<00:02:21.680> videos<00:02:21.850> we<00:02:22.850> can<00:02:23.000> go

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
can in the next few videos we can go

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.790 
can in the next few videos we can go
into<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.450> little<00:02:23.750> bit<00:02:23.870> more<00:02:23.990> do<00:02:24.350> a<00:02:24.380> whole<00:02:24.590> video

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
into a little bit more do a whole video

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.100 
into a little bit more do a whole video
on<00:02:24.950> edges<00:02:25.400> or<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.000> whole<00:02:26.180> video<00:02:26.480> on<00:02:26.510> value<00:02:26.960> and

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
on edges or a whole video on value and

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.690 
on edges or a whole video on value and
show<00:02:27.350> some<00:02:27.590> different<00:02:27.740> images<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.550> and

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
show some different images and and

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.520 
show some different images and and
really<00:02:29.390> demonstrate<00:02:29.630> things<00:02:30.170> but<00:02:30.440> I<00:02:30.470> just

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
really demonstrate things but I just

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.510 
really demonstrate things but I just
wanted<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.890> bring<00:02:31.070> this<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.400> guys

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
wanted to bring this to you guys

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.400 
wanted to bring this to you guys
attention<00:02:31.880> that<00:02:32.210> with<00:02:32.330> drawing<00:02:32.660> it's<00:02:32.900> it's

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
attention that with drawing it's it's

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.680 
attention that with drawing it's it's
really<00:02:33.530> about<00:02:33.710> values<00:02:33.770> and<00:02:34.340> edges<00:02:34.730> you<00:02:35.660> know

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
really about values and edges you know

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.970 
really about values and edges you know
with<00:02:35.930> painting<00:02:36.940> there's<00:02:37.940> four<00:02:38.330> things<00:02:38.980> my

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
with painting there's four things my

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.440 
with painting there's four things my
main<00:02:40.190> videos<00:02:40.459> are<00:02:40.610> about<00:02:40.730> painting<00:02:41.120> so<00:02:41.330> the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
main videos are about painting so the

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.730 
main videos are about painting so the
four<00:02:41.660> things<00:02:41.840> that<00:02:42.020> I<00:02:42.170> go<00:02:42.350> through<00:02:42.380> our

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
four things that I go through our

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.020 
four things that I go through our
drawing<00:02:43.100> value<00:02:43.930> color<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.320> edges<00:02:45.740> but<00:02:46.250> for

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
drawing value color and edges but for

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.760 
drawing value color and edges but for
drawing<00:02:48.070> you<00:02:49.070> only<00:02:49.190> have<00:02:49.459> drawing<00:02:50.270> and<00:02:50.770> value

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
drawing you only have drawing and value

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.540 
drawing you only have drawing and value
in<00:02:51.920> edges<00:02:52.360> you<00:02:53.360> have<00:02:53.390> proportions

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
in edges you have proportions

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.350 
in edges you have proportions
composition<00:02:55.550> a<00:02:55.670> lot<00:02:55.850> of<00:02:55.970> different<00:02:56.239> things

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
composition a lot of different things

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.510 
composition a lot of different things
same<00:02:56.720> as<00:02:56.840> painting<00:02:57.230> but<00:02:57.470> drawing<00:02:58.070> is<00:02:58.310> just

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
same as painting but drawing is just

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.949 
same as painting but drawing is just
more<00:02:58.700> of<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:58.940> basic<00:02:59.300> foundation<00:02:59.840> the

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
more of the basic foundation the

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.260 
more of the basic foundation the
structure<00:03:00.470> of<00:03:00.739> a<00:03:00.830> painting<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:04.280> when<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.120> comes

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
structure of a painting so when it comes

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.000 
structure of a painting so when it comes
to<00:03:05.450> edges<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.140> know<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.260> could<00:03:06.500> have<00:03:06.560> lost<00:03:06.800> that

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
to edges you know I could have lost that

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.740 
to edges you know I could have lost that
entire<00:03:07.400> edge<00:03:09.580> so<00:03:10.580> what<00:03:10.760> it<00:03:10.880> means<00:03:10.910> with<00:03:11.300> with

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
entire edge so what it means with with

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.020 
entire edge so what it means with with
edges<00:03:12.140> is<00:03:12.320> either<00:03:12.590> soft<00:03:13.010> or<00:03:13.220> hard<00:03:13.280> or<00:03:13.760> lost

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
edges is either soft or hard or lost

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.350 
edges is either soft or hard or lost
lost<00:03:14.750> completely<00:03:15.230> just<00:03:15.560> means<00:03:16.239> you<00:03:17.239> know

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
lost completely just means you know

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.530 
lost completely just means you know
there's<00:03:17.630> no<00:03:17.810> hard<00:03:18.140> line<00:03:19.120> you<00:03:20.120> know<00:03:20.209> like<00:03:20.239> the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
there's no hard line you know like the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.420 
there's no hard line you know like the
outline<00:03:20.840> of<00:03:20.870> my<00:03:21.049> face<00:03:21.320> here<00:03:21.590> is<00:03:21.709> a<00:03:21.739> very<00:03:22.040> hard

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
outline of my face here is a very hard

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.570 
outline of my face here is a very hard
line<00:03:23.290> so<00:03:24.290> if<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.940> but<00:03:25.940> an<00:03:26.299> area<00:03:26.750> like<00:03:26.930> my<00:03:27.140> nose

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
line so if I but an area like my nose

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.949 
line so if I but an area like my nose
you<00:03:28.580> know<00:03:28.670> that's<00:03:28.880> a<00:03:29.000> thing<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.570> lot<00:03:29.720> of<00:03:29.810> people

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
you know that's a thing a lot of people

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.440 
you know that's a thing a lot of people
have<00:03:30.049> trouble<00:03:30.440> drawing<00:03:30.709> noses<00:03:31.370> it's<00:03:32.150> because

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
have trouble drawing noses it's because

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.449 
have trouble drawing noses it's because
they're<00:03:32.630> really<00:03:32.930> they're<00:03:33.230> a<00:03:33.260> soft<00:03:33.650> edge<00:03:34.040> it's

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
they're really they're a soft edge it's

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.120 
they're really they're a soft edge it's
not<00:03:34.700> this<00:03:34.940> hard<00:03:35.330> line<00:03:35.480> if<00:03:35.840> you<00:03:35.959> went<00:03:36.140> sketch<00:03:36.680> a

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
not this hard line if you went sketch a

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.830 
not this hard line if you went sketch a
whole<00:03:37.400> line<00:03:37.640> around<00:03:38.000> my<00:03:38.180> nose<00:03:38.239> all<00:03:38.660> these

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
whole line around my nose all these

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.050 
whole line around my nose all these
lines<00:03:39.110> it's<00:03:39.799> going<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.010> look<00:03:40.160> funny<00:03:40.459> so<00:03:41.030> you

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
lines it's going to look funny so you

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.280 
lines it's going to look funny so you
kind<00:03:41.269> of<00:03:41.299> have<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:41.510> rub<00:03:41.720> those<00:03:41.900> out<00:03:42.110> a<00:03:42.140> little

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
kind of have to rub those out a little

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.830 
kind of have to rub those out a little
bit<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:42.860> blend<00:03:43.040> them<00:03:43.370> down<00:03:43.640> and<00:03:44.360> make<00:03:44.690> them

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
bit and blend them down and make them

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.699 
bit and blend them down and make them
softer<00:03:45.470> so<00:03:46.070> I<00:03:46.100> don't<00:03:46.549> really<00:03:46.670> even<00:03:46.790> have<00:03:47.709> any

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
softer so I don't really even have any

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.590 
softer so I don't really even have any
lines<00:03:49.100> on<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.489> nose<00:03:49.700> here<00:03:50.000> on<00:03:50.209> the<00:03:50.299> bridge<00:03:50.570> of

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
lines on the nose here on the bridge of

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.740 
lines on the nose here on the bridge of
the<00:03:51.110> nose<00:03:51.160> it's<00:03:52.160> basically<00:03:52.640> just<00:03:52.760> different

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
the nose it's basically just different

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.590 
the nose it's basically just different
values<00:03:54.230> different<00:03:54.410> shades<00:03:54.920> so<00:03:55.420> that's<00:03:56.420> what<00:03:56.570> I

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
values different shades so that's what I

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.080 
values different shades so that's what I
mean<00:03:56.780> by<00:03:56.840> edges<00:03:57.410> is<00:03:57.560> sometimes<00:03:58.010> it's<00:03:58.910> just

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
mean by edges is sometimes it's just

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.530 
mean by edges is sometimes it's just
going<00:03:59.269> to<00:03:59.330> be<00:03:59.480> a<00:03:59.510> value<00:04:00.049> shift<00:04:01.150> you<00:04:02.150> know<00:04:02.180> for

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
going to be a value shift you know for

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.840 
going to be a value shift you know for
shadows<00:04:02.989> and<00:04:03.170> stuff<00:04:03.380> some<00:04:04.250> shadows<00:04:04.670> are

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
shadows and stuff some shadows are

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.250 
shadows and stuff some shadows are
really<00:04:05.239> soft<00:04:05.709> so<00:04:06.709> it's<00:04:07.130> just<00:04:07.870> using<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:08.959> soft

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
really soft so it's just using the soft

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.199 
really soft so it's just using the soft
hand<00:04:09.650> and<00:04:09.830> penciling<00:04:10.579> that<00:04:10.730> in<00:04:10.910> and<00:04:11.299> maybe

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
hand and penciling that in and maybe

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.890 
hand and penciling that in and maybe
blending<00:04:14.209> that<00:04:14.329> out<00:04:14.390> a<00:04:14.540> bit

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
blending that out a bit

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.699 
blending that out a bit
so<00:04:15.890> when<00:04:16.070> you<00:04:16.190> have<00:04:16.900> these<00:04:17.900> variation<00:04:18.590> of

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
so when you have these variation of

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.259 
so when you have these variation of
edges<00:04:19.100> that's<00:04:19.310> what<00:04:19.489> creates<00:04:19.820> a<00:04:19.970> realistic

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
edges that's what creates a realistic

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.980 
edges that's what creates a realistic
image<00:04:21.010> so<00:04:22.010> I<00:04:22.040> have<00:04:22.510> variations<00:04:23.510> here<00:04:23.660> I<00:04:23.900> have

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
image so I have variations here I have

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.830 
image so I have variations here I have
the<00:04:24.200> outline<00:04:24.229> of<00:04:24.710> my

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
the outline of my

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.770 
the outline of my
my<00:04:27.800> head<00:04:28.070> and<00:04:28.280> face<00:04:28.520> but<00:04:28.820> then<00:04:29.030> on<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.240> inside

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
my head and face but then on the inside

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.320 
my head and face but then on the inside
there's<00:04:30.620> a<00:04:30.710> lot<00:04:30.919> of<00:04:31.070> just<00:04:31.280> soft<00:04:31.550> edges<00:04:32.060> and<00:04:32.270> a

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
there's a lot of just soft edges and a

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
there's a lot of just soft edges and a
lot<00:04:32.990> of<00:04:33.020> softer<00:04:33.560> things<00:04:33.860> going<00:04:34.250> on<00:04:35.110> as<00:04:36.110> far<00:04:36.169> as

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
lot of softer things going on as far as

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.129 
lot of softer things going on as far as
sheeting<00:04:36.830> and<00:04:36.949> things<00:04:37.690> so<00:04:38.690> getting<00:04:39.020> the

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
sheeting and things so getting the

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.290 
sheeting and things so getting the
values<00:04:39.530> correct<00:04:39.919> getting<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.400> edges<00:04:40.820> correct

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
values correct getting the edges correct

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.409 
values correct getting the edges correct
that's<00:04:41.930> what's<00:04:42.229> going<00:04:42.380> to<00:04:42.410> give<00:04:42.620> you<00:04:43.419> an

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
that's what's going to give you an

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.409 
that's what's going to give you an
overall<00:04:44.860> interesting<00:04:45.860> image<00:04:46.220> and<00:04:46.490> that's

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
overall interesting image and that's

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.890 
overall interesting image and that's
what's<00:04:47.720> going<00:04:48.020> to<00:04:48.820> create<00:04:49.820> realism<00:04:50.630> if<00:04:50.750> you're

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
what's going to create realism if you're

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.930 
what's going to create realism if you're
looking<00:04:51.260> for<00:04:51.440> that<00:04:51.530> or<00:04:51.830> getting<00:04:52.130> it<00:04:52.340> to<00:04:52.490> look<00:04:52.699> a

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
looking for that or getting it to look a

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.010 
looking for that or getting it to look a
little<00:04:53.120> bit<00:04:53.330> realer<00:04:54.160> more<00:04:55.160> real<00:04:55.750> so<00:04:56.750> a<00:04:56.780> lot<00:04:56.990> of

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
little bit realer more real so a lot of

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.600 
little bit realer more real so a lot of
people<00:04:57.290> if<00:04:57.410> you're<00:04:57.530> drawing<00:04:57.830> you're<00:04:58.370> trying

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
people if you're drawing you're trying

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.050 
people if you're drawing you're trying
to<00:04:58.669> draw<00:04:58.850> people<00:04:59.270> there's<00:04:59.479> a<00:04:59.540> lot<00:04:59.720> of<00:05:01.060> plenty

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
to draw people there's a lot of plenty

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.490 
to draw people there's a lot of plenty
of<00:05:02.150> folks<00:05:02.360> out<00:05:02.600> there<00:05:02.630> that<00:05:02.840> like<00:05:03.169> drawing

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
of folks out there that like drawing

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.920 
of folks out there that like drawing
anime<00:05:03.979> and<00:05:04.190> cartoons<00:05:04.400> and<00:05:05.090> coming<00:05:05.720> up<00:05:05.810> with

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
anime and cartoons and coming up with

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.540 
anime and cartoons and coming up with
your<00:05:05.960> own<00:05:06.080> original<00:05:06.680> characters<00:05:07.160> and<00:05:07.400> things

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
your own original characters and things

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.659 
your own original characters and things
of<00:05:07.790> that<00:05:07.910> nature<00:05:08.740> I'm<00:05:09.740> not<00:05:10.010> really<00:05:10.220> into<00:05:10.639> that

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
of that nature I'm not really into that

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.460 
of that nature I'm not really into that
but<00:05:11.120> I<00:05:11.150> will<00:05:11.389> tell<00:05:11.630> you<00:05:11.810> if<00:05:11.930> you<00:05:12.020> want<00:05:12.200> it<00:05:12.350> to

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
but I will tell you if you want it to

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.230 
but I will tell you if you want it to
look<00:05:12.590> a<00:05:12.740> little<00:05:12.889> bit<00:05:13.160> more<00:05:13.400> realistic<00:05:13.790> you

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
look a little bit more realistic you

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.960 
look a little bit more realistic you
need<00:05:15.050> to<00:05:15.260> add<00:05:15.470> some<00:05:15.800> shading<00:05:16.070> soften<00:05:16.790> some

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
need to add some shading soften some

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.969 
need to add some shading soften some
edges<00:05:17.389> or<00:05:17.570> at<00:05:17.660> least<00:05:17.840> soften<00:05:18.260> some<00:05:18.410> edges<00:05:18.800> I

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
edges or at least soften some edges I

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.129 
edges or at least soften some edges I
mean<00:05:19.789> you<00:05:19.880> can<00:05:20.030> have<00:05:20.120> a<00:05:20.180> line<00:05:20.479> drawing<00:05:20.840> and

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
mean you can have a line drawing and

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.469 
mean you can have a line drawing and
line<00:05:21.350> drawing<00:05:21.620> only<00:05:21.889> and<00:05:22.280> if<00:05:22.639> you<00:05:22.760> just<00:05:23.000> soften

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
line drawing only and if you just soften

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.270 
line drawing only and if you just soften
some<00:05:23.630> edges<00:05:23.930> using<00:05:24.139> a<00:05:24.289> tissue<00:05:24.500> or<00:05:24.680> a<00:05:24.830> blending

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
some edges using a tissue or a blending

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.460 
some edges using a tissue or a blending
stump<00:05:25.310> or<00:05:25.820> something<00:05:25.880> of<00:05:26.750> that<00:05:26.780> nature<00:05:26.900> and

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
stump or something of that nature and

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.379 
stump or something of that nature and
just<00:05:27.949> soften<00:05:28.370> some<00:05:28.520> of<00:05:28.580> your<00:05:28.760> edges<00:05:29.090> you<00:05:29.210> can

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
just soften some of your edges you can

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:34.450 
just soften some of your edges you can
really<00:05:29.780> create<00:05:30.139> a<00:05:32.590> focal<00:05:33.590> area<00:05:33.919> of<00:05:34.070> focal

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
really create a focal area of focal

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.950 
really create a focal area of focal
points<00:05:34.850> so<00:05:35.030> it's<00:05:35.180> also<00:05:35.360> important<00:05:35.780> to<00:05:35.840> have<00:05:35.870> a

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
points so it's also important to have a

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.140 
points so it's also important to have a
focal<00:05:36.320> point<00:05:36.350> in<00:05:36.650> your<00:05:36.770> drawing<00:05:37.100> and<00:05:37.400> figuring

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
focal point in your drawing and figuring

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.700 
focal point in your drawing and figuring
out<00:05:38.240> what<00:05:38.389> that<00:05:38.419> is<00:05:38.600> before<00:05:39.110> you<00:05:39.169> even<00:05:39.320> start

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
out what that is before you even start

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.760 
out what that is before you even start
drawing<00:05:40.010> so<00:05:40.310> really<00:05:40.580> having<00:05:40.789> the<00:05:40.880> preparation

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
drawing so really having the preparation

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.170 
drawing so really having the preparation
but<00:05:42.770> I<00:05:42.830> don't<00:05:43.010> want<00:05:43.160> to<00:05:43.220> get<00:05:43.310> two<00:05:43.460> more<00:05:43.700> to

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
but I don't want to get two more to

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.610 
but I don't want to get two more to
deepen<00:05:44.630> anything<00:05:44.990> I<00:05:45.080> just<00:05:45.289> want<00:05:45.410> to<00:05:45.470> talk

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
deepen anything I just want to talk

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.529 
deepen anything I just want to talk
about<00:05:45.889> values<00:05:46.760> and<00:05:46.940> edges<00:05:47.240> because<00:05:47.389> that's

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
about values and edges because that's

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.810 
about values and edges because that's
really<00:05:47.720> a<00:05:47.840> lot<00:05:48.139> of<00:05:48.169> what<00:05:48.440> drawing<00:05:48.800> is<00:05:49.010> is<00:05:49.220> about

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
really a lot of what drawing is is about

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.210 
really a lot of what drawing is is about
it's<00:05:50.419> about<00:05:50.630> value<00:05:51.139> and<00:05:51.380> edges<00:05:51.830> and<00:05:52.010> getting

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
it's about value and edges and getting

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.839 
it's about value and edges and getting
that<00:05:52.340> correct<00:05:52.960> so<00:05:53.960> anyway<00:05:54.349> I<00:05:54.620> just<00:05:55.610> want<00:05:55.760> to

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:55.849 
that correct so anyway I just want to

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:59.260 
that correct so anyway I just want to
make<00:05:55.970> a<00:05:56.000> quick<00:05:56.270> video<00:05:56.450> and<00:05:57.910> stay<00:05:58.910> tuned<00:05:59.150> for

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
make a quick video and stay tuned for

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.790 
make a quick video and stay tuned for
the<00:05:59.360> next<00:05:59.419> videos<00:05:59.960> I'm<00:06:00.229> going<00:06:00.380> to<00:06:00.470> start

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
the next videos I'm going to start
