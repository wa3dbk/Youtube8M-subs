00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.370 
I've had probably for a few years now
but<00:05:01.400> it's<00:05:01.550> really<00:05:01.930> probably<00:05:02.930> gotten<00:05:03.200> worse

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
but it's really probably gotten worse

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.900 
but it's really probably gotten worse
and<00:05:03.530> worse<00:05:03.680> and<00:05:03.740> exams<00:05:04.220> at<00:05:04.370> a<00:05:04.430> stage<00:05:04.640> where<00:05:04.880> I

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
and worse and exams at a stage where I

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.570 
and worse and exams at a stage where I
couldn't<00:05:05.210> couldn't<00:05:05.600> continue<00:05:05.900> so<00:05:06.430> it's<00:05:07.430> good

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580
