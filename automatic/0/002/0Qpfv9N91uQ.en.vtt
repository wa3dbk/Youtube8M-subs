 first sentence removes his 2 II and show objectively 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.630
 like you 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.810
 a Star Wars Battlefront 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.059
 Download the 2 drag free on clouds 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.989
 and it works so i click her on the first link in the description 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:29.609
 so 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.029
 with expires 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.029
 Animal thundered after 45 seconds 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.200
 So wait instead of clicking on download 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 if he does that hard then 6 91 meters far 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.690
 takes a bit 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.580
 around 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.550
 then he has next to raw files 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.700
 it looks like that 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.910
 here there 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.460
 Finally, right-click on their maps that is or files 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.440
 then he opens the folder so a folder 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.390
 then he goes on changed laps already has her first appearance in front 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.290
 that is the exe file 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.100
 if you like such a shortcut as I dented the test Clegg whose expert 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.620
 right-click 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.110
 Mouse grabbed 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.450
 on the premium increase 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.730
 to the file 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.350
 goes to foundations 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.620
 then she pulls open best 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.060
 and later never really wanted the name 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.420
 for a total of super problems with plates Franz 2 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.650
 namely while Lansdown drivers 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.790
 ours was brand new than that 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.010
 NWR NCI 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.280
 who made the games 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.880
 and that's why you either down here right miserably percent on the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.560
 escapee 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.000
 Recorders 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.520
 or 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.520
 because Control Panel as in Vista and Windows 7 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.430
 this is pretty much the same as our father and persistent 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.170
 then record name and then right click the activated direct 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.950
 Have ads 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.370
 with a body mix around 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.890
 activate 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.859
 then take over okay 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:13.559
 Danner the game strong if it does not work then so after the 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:17.669
 Main menu loading if you want more states next to it 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:21.129
 make that top and game is over so have 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.549
 because then you just go before a round starts buying options and 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.479
 Tutin sound quite a miracle 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.749
 and then there must be no problems 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:34.849
 So that was it again, I hope to play softly felled 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.420
 I hope but I liked it again please ask where 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.589
 please subscribe 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:43.379
 than in the past time 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.060
 not as you get down so it's really bad in your eyes all 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:50.059
 then also write PCR in the comments 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:51.919
 which was too bad 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:53.659
 around 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.959
 that was again and to offer the fleet until the next
