00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 problem 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.459
 hello everybody, the project that legalized the european center 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:16.810
 and today we will have some tips on cheese 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.810
 and in the end they are going to make a fuse with some that is what we have here 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.520
 the fundamental difference we have in the chin 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.949
 is in two properties the first with what it is made 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:27.789
 and then 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.779
 How long does it take to get ready? 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.470
 What he did to us can make the jaw drop. 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.710
 cow's milk goat's milk 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.920
 if it is made with cow's milk at the moment it has a taste a little more to it 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.050
 feel a little more 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.989
 the smaller one a little weaker 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.969
 goat's milk to manage with a little taste stronger what is more 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.430
 cheese is an example. 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.679
 on the other hand that is made with cow's milk 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:55.309
 and the cheese whatever that made with goat's milk the two games looked like the 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.150
 were because it is more pronounced 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.380
 The other difference we have about cheese is time 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.940
 wanted with is saved 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.750
 there are fresh cheeses that as its name says 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.460
 I did not stay very long. 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.670
 there we have a region range the ricotta that juninas and several others 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.289
 cheeses 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.040
 What are more toys? 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.840
 the cheeses that stay put for the longest they start to take a 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.490
 yellow coloring a slightly harder texture and a house min 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.560
 these queiroz 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.109
 they can stay six months or a year a year and a half stored 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:28.700
 to be able to add your flavors 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.510
 is the example of Parmesan cheese 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.830
 that there are thin people to put on top of various preparations 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.570
 this is what he is 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.740
 - cheeses strategic base for later in front of us 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.880
 here we have 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.679
 the gorgonzola cheese 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.030
 cheese based on 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.700
 and produced with some funds that are injected into the pt itself 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.290
 here we have a fresh cheese cheese type girls 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.090
 what we can use for example even to make a dessert 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.210
 because it has to take on another discomfort a little softer and 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.000
 often without salt the ricotta for example I do not think that the podiums to 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.730
 do the paper we have a goat cheese 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.569
 with a slightly more pronounced taste 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.869
 and not so much interest 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.869
 he is a little bit more white 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.260
 here another one the goat cheese 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.169
 he is more consistent 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:18.710
 is a little older 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.839
 we already see that he has a slightly more yellowish character 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:23.460
 When will we choose what to wear? 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.970
 we have to see all of this if the peel delete uniform 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.910
 if he will not have any death problems 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.709
 of rupture inside the taca scarpa 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.709
 get inside it 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.539
 contrary to what happened 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:41.089
 this cheese can not have holes and we have to look at all this in the power 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:42.729
 buy a pound of quality 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.410
 in the south had complained that today 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.519
 it's christmas 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.519
 other than the one we use as the basis for our own 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:50.589
 let's make the source 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:54.339
 good for us to make our fund from now I'll get the cheeses brie 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:55.499
 pimental 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:57.049
 I'll take off their shells. 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.469
 and I'll talk because it gets so much easier then I learned teresina for her 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:14.729
 and what we know today as fused and kardec is not the best known 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:19.379
 the first crisis that arose was also exactly shed of cheese 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.380
 that is eaten with the moldy bread 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.009
 wet exactly on that day 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:26.920
 now we have all the cheese 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.909
 Let's start the preparation. 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.969
 the first step is the people and the fire 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:34.279
 let her start to heat up 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:36.880
 you can make this preparation straight into the trash 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.819
 the director 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.199
 in the frying pan 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:43.629
 or make in a pot on the fire where he will see that is faster and then 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:44.999
 go through this 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:45.989
 I have here 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.799
 a daily ticket 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.129
 peeled 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.249
 I'm going to cut a little bit of it. 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:52.699
 He looks good every year. 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:56.709
 then preach daily surplus on the bottom of the pan and on the sides 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.119
 Why all this on board? 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:02.119
 I'm prepared from below 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:11.080
 Last year in the pot we're going to do it here 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.740
 but a bit 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.889
 to be able when our after this preparation 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.889
 so I'm going to put a little bit of white wine here 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:20.859
 a little bit of 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.859
 wedge here 

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:27.080
 a spoonful I came 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.080
 corn friend 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.699
 I'm going to mix 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.900
 for me he said 'I am to see and not to make dodges 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.759
 nothing in preparation 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.210
 I'll leave it here 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.419
 I'm going to have dinner at the catwalk now 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:42.759
 the two cheeses 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.909

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:48.110

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:59.930
 This prepared I made before. 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.040
 slowly 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.919
 on low heat 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.919
 let yourself be suddenly 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:12.370
