another reason why when he didn't have

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.649 
another reason why when he didn't have
to<00:01:28.609> be<00:01:28.700> here<00:01:28.850> because<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:29.119> team<00:01:29.299> has<00:01:29.329> been

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
to be here because the team has been

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.419 
to be here because the team has been
fantastic<00:01:30.109> and<00:01:30.619> they<00:01:30.709> know<00:01:30.829> what<00:01:30.979> she<00:01:31.099> wants

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
fantastic and they know what she wants

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:33.699 
fantastic and they know what she wants
but<00:01:31.939> it's<00:01:32.240> more<00:01:32.450> about<00:01:32.599> you<00:01:33.049> know<00:01:33.079> presenting

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:33.709 
but it's more about you know presenting

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:36.069 
but it's more about you know presenting
that<00:01:33.889> vision<00:01:34.429> of<00:01:34.609> what<00:01:34.880> this<00:01:35.389> collection<00:01:35.810> is

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
that vision of what this collection is

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.230 
that vision of what this collection is
and<00:01:36.380> who<00:01:36.529> we<00:01:36.709> are<00:01:36.889> for<00:01:37.219> the<00:01:37.340> for<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:37.819> season
