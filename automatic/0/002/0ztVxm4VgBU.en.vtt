 the Berlin landmark 80 years old

 so long there are a few not yet but for the fans is a true 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.579
 Concert always a journey into the past 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.830
 because even in Berlin, the Norwegian pop group starts with songs 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.840
 In the eighties, most fans have memories of classes 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.990

 the game tipped over by storm Joan hard when you keep repeating the same songs 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.560
 Games you lose contact with them 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.580
 then you just have to take something else there is on TV 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.580
 the first session certainly 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.700
