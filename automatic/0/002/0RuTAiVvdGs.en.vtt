00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
go I'd like to start off by saying that

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.439 
go I'd like to start off by saying that
the<00:05:39.289> Huffer<00:05:39.590> toy<00:05:39.800> closely<00:05:40.669> resembles<00:05:41.240> his

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449 
the Huffer toy closely resembles his

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.749 
the Huffer toy closely resembles his
generation<00:05:42.110> one<00:05:42.349> cartoon<00:05:42.830> counterpart<00:05:43.550> I

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 
generation one cartoon counterpart I

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.240 
generation one cartoon counterpart I
wouldn't<00:05:44.389> say<00:05:44.569> he<00:05:45.080> looks<00:05:45.319> exactly<00:05:45.740> like<00:05:46.009> it

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
wouldn't say he looks exactly like it

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.999 
wouldn't say he looks exactly like it
but<00:05:47.000> it's<00:05:47.180> it's<00:05:47.479> close<00:05:47.779> enough<00:05:47.840> that<00:05:48.380> he's<00:05:48.770> fun

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
but it's it's close enough that he's fun

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:50.469 
but it's it's close enough that he's fun
to<00:05:49.130> play<00:05:49.340> with<00:05:49.550> because<00:05:49.789> you<00:05:50.090> know<00:05:50.120> what

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
to play with because you know what

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.379 
to play with because you know what
character<00:05:51.020> it<00:05:51.169> is<00:05:51.849> maybe<00:05:52.849> I<00:05:52.969> would<00:05:53.150> have<00:05:53.240> liked

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
character it is maybe I would have liked

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:54.879 
character it is maybe I would have liked
to<00:05:53.419> seen<00:05:53.690> him<00:05:53.810> a<00:05:53.870> little<00:05:54.139> bit<00:05:54.229> bigger<00:05:54.590> but<00:05:54.830> then

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
to seen him a little bit bigger but then

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.999 
to seen him a little bit bigger but then
he<00:05:55.099> wouldn't<00:05:55.310> have<00:05:55.370> been<00:05:55.460> a<00:05:55.520> mini<00:05:55.789> bot<00:05:56.380> I<00:05:57.380> also

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009
