00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
signals and all that and then I

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.940 
signals and all that and then I
gradually<00:01:51.510> grew<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> little<00:01:52.470> bit<00:01:52.680> nice

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
northeastern and then I built one or two

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.720 
northeastern and then I built one or two
locos<00:02:00.150> myself<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:01.280> after<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.310> was<00:02:02.460> taught<00:02:02.700> how

locos myself and after I was taught how
to<00:02:02.910> do<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.650> and<00:02:04.970> we<00:02:05.970> got<00:02:06.150> it<00:02:06.210> built<00:02:06.660> two<00:02:07.200> or

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
to do it and we got it built two or

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.840 
to do it and we got it built two or
three<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.590> us<00:02:07.740> we<00:02:07.860> got<00:02:07.980> it<00:02:08.100> all<00:02:08.250> built<00:02:08.519> or<00:02:08.700> the

with<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:26.430> MM<00:02:27.239> one<00:02:27.500> because<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.530> looks<00:02:28.890> like

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
with the MM one because that looks like

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.759 
with the MM one because that looks like
the<00:02:29.220> bee's<00:02:29.400> knees<00:02:29.670> whereas<00:02:29.940> this<00:02:30.269> is<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.989> only
