is<00:03:02.269> 60<00:03:03.269> years<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:04.640> understanding<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.819> basic

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
is 60 years so understanding the basic

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.770 
is 60 years so understanding the basic
parameters<00:03:07.950> which<00:03:08.580> describe<00:03:09.350> this<00:03:10.370> cycle<00:03:11.370> is

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
parameters which describe this cycle is

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.530 
parameters which describe this cycle is
the<00:03:12.780> slam<00:03:13.140> process<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:15.120> course<00:03:15.150> this

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
the slam process and of course this

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.470 
the slam process and of course this
leads<00:03:15.840> us<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.230> our<00:03:16.260> ability<00:03:16.800> to<00:03:16.830> make

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
leads us to our ability to make

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.870 
leads us to our ability to make
long-range<00:03:18.480> climate<00:03:19.170> forecasts<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:20.459> this

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
long-range climate forecasts and this

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.670 
long-range climate forecasts and this
super<00:03:21.360> peak<00:03:21.570> of<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.810> number<00:03:22.019> of<00:03:22.140> things<00:03:22.440> is<00:03:22.650> a

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
super peak of a number of things is a

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.229 
super peak of a number of things is a
super<00:03:23.100> peak<00:03:23.310> which<00:03:23.549> means<00:03:23.850> we're<00:03:24.060> going<00:03:24.180> to

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
super peak which means we're going to

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.210 
super peak which means we're going to
have<00:03:24.299> a<00:03:24.450> general<00:03:24.810> decline<00:03:24.930> in<00:03:25.440> overall

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
have a general decline in overall

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.039 
have a general decline in overall
temperatures<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:26.940> bit<00:03:27.060> like<00:03:27.360> this<00:03:27.540> in<00:03:27.870> Reverse

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
temperatures a bit like this in Reverse

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.770 
temperatures a bit like this in Reverse
for<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.040> next<00:03:29.310> century<00:03:29.489> or<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:29.790> which<00:03:30.450> is<00:03:30.600> why

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
for the next century or so which is why

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.310 
for the next century or so which is why
we<00:03:31.019> are<00:03:31.049> predicting<00:03:31.440> will<00:03:32.220> call<00:03:32.579> it<00:03:33.320> though

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
we are predicting will call it though

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.530 
we are predicting will call it though
we're<00:03:34.530> also<00:03:34.769> coupling<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.459> with<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:36.329> need

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
we're also coupling that with the need

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.479 
we're also coupling that with the need
to<00:03:36.750> understand<00:03:37.290> what<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.590> Sun<00:03:37.860> itself<00:03:38.250> is

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
to understand what the Sun itself is

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.330 
to understand what the Sun itself is
going<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.790> do<00:03:38.940> in<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.829> in<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:40.980> next<00:03:41.100> 100

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
going to do in that in the next 100

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.069 
going to do in that in the next 100
years<00:03:41.610> which<00:03:42.030> of<00:03:42.180> course<00:03:42.209> is<00:03:42.510> why<00:03:42.720> we<00:03:42.870> work

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
years which of course is why we work

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.640 
years which of course is why we work
with<00:03:44.840> astrophysicists<00:03:45.840> dealing<00:03:46.290> directly

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
with astrophysicists dealing directly

with astrophysicists dealing directly
with<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.920> Sun<00:03:47.130> as<00:03:47.340> well<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:49.019> slam<00:03:49.410> is<00:03:49.950> a<00:03:50.010> big

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
with the Sun as well the slam is a big

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.380 
with the Sun as well the slam is a big

advance for weather action and we will

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.090
