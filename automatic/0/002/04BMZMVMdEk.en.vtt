just to go for the T wave and dancin and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.870 
just to go for the T wave and dancin and
closer<00:01:11.810> which<00:01:12.020> can<00:01:12.289> take<00:01:12.500> ice<00:01:13.009> beams<00:01:13.369> really

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
closer which can take ice beams really

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.510 
closer which can take ice beams really
really<00:01:14.149> well<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:14.630> I'm<00:01:15.590> gonna<00:01:15.740> start<00:01:16.100> using
