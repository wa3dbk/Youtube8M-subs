why what betrayal I just brush my teeth
I<00:00:25.650> don't<00:00:25.859> understand<00:00:26.400> what<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.580> problem<00:00:26.880> is

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
think the reason is that brushing your

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.990 
think the reason is that brushing your
teeth<00:00:31.619> has<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.160> be<00:00:32.250> one<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.489> most<00:00:32.610> boring
