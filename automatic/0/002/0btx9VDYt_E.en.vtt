00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 games on highscreen hercules and so first 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.429
 gta san andreas don't know who is there 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.820
 complained that san andreas is coming 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.769
 somehow crooked with an error kind of see as you see on 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.660
 this video at 60 frames per second is not 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.660
 I can see no slowdowns 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.189
 I do not know at all how can of course 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.769
 the graphics are there if set to maximum 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.900
 then begins to lag but me basically 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.260
 quite satisfied with this schedule does not know not 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.300
 can he come here from the preposition but 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.669
 Now we will try again to do 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.030
 small such a burst che because there 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:48.090
 immediately so much stuff happens 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:50.579
 explosion time and see what will happen well 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.050
 here we are ready for the final chord 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.449
 to see performance 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.940
 now let's see there was no explosion 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.940
 slow down everything is fine the game is on 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.250
 ok on those settings on which 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.600
 the device itself offered 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.360
 in general, go to the next game and 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.860
 our next game 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.720
 implosion he i'm generally the first time of life 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.180
 run this game so try 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.740
 little play this novelty in this 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.170
 great cool game so 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.790
 just once praised as fighting 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:24.450
 muto forms a little further so so with him 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.670
 fight so dash use dodges 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.829
 after 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:33.299
 I understood, but now we are fighting like that 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:37.200
 We will beat him so neatly it chu 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.549
 I'm not fighting with a glow, but I guess 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.009
 hit cheer finally 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.110
 otherwise, a blow well, in general, a little bit 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.060
 slowed down or it seemed to me not 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.189
 forget the way to put each game 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.500
 your personal score on a 10 point scale 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.750
 how do you read how this game goes but here 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.460
 I will make slaves to this hercules 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.590
 that is, in my opinion basically goes 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.360
 pretty normal playable without 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.640
 any problems yes here all the same 8 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.049
 core processor 2 gigs iraq you 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.770
 why should n't they type great 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:14.090
 now before notice will enter now 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:18.070
 Muto all these forms will be decorated 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.800
 leave or not and why are you so long you 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.270
 such a cool slasher 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.860
 we must definitely not burn me such a review 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.440
 60 accurately principle I love such 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.350
 simple beautiful and interesting guides 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.420
 Sylvania 2 tomato so hearing 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.030
 cool that is, in principle, there is a game 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.570
 normal play can be great graphics 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.170
 go to the next and the next game 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.530
 Champions 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.290
 so we in the game were light slow down 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.490
 as I see the graphics are not at least 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.830
 There are different special effects in the back. 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.100
 small brakes they are hiding 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.800
 there is no need to hide it but in principle 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.740
 basically everything goes quite 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.530
 oh oh oh oh that you go quite all 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.680
 okay vessel earn cool here 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.260
 such a special effect and all the end of the fight 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.360
 the game is quite normal therefore 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.150
 go to the next well and last on 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.720
 today the game will be dan john hunter 5 well 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.640
 here's the game we play I think 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.200
 slows down a little or it seems to me 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.530
 friends must write in the comments 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.930
 your scores every game and if your me 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.820
 it's not always interesting for me 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.290
 hear your opinion how do you think how 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.730
 It works this game seems to me 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.230
 slow down a little bit of the look 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.240
 in combat and so what levels can 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.590
 the second time to go here is level 9 I can 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.840
 pass for sure the second time now here 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.640
 so choose yourself a companion no it is not 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.280
 companion is me and I will not bother 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:54.940
 there's nothing to take this normal 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:57.920
 This type and suffered now look 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.440
 so here we are inside the combat level 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.780
 it seems to have helped 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:08.180
 Smaller objects probably don't look like 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:11.270
 something that slows down but again, I always 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.650
 I am pleased to know your opinion that is 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.609
 write comments on this 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:19.270
 why do you think it slows down or not I 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.010
 blessing recording 60 frames a second to 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:24.680
 nothing left a few 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.450
 from your eyes if you donâ€™t see 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.610
 60 frames a second wait youtube 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.720
 ship it when you see this here if 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.360
 one of the first to go there 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:37.640
 youtube has not time to process 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.980
 Video principle I do not know I do not know normally 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.380
 all but there is some kind of doubt 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.420
 still sort of like 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.440
 something a little bit here what you is 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.130
 you know for dorenko such a thing from black 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.250
 slabs 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.290
 all all black plates and there is some other 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.940
 black herman 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.830
 yes strangely a lot too black 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.410
 for pass them to the mortar a little bit 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.510
 progruz one revolution 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:06.710
 their system has weakened or figs it knows 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.180
 why it happened I will not find in any 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.530
 case you can play quite 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:15.320
 camphor comfortable and pretty 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.540
 high-quality graphics right now 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.620
 I will go into this darkness now quickly 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:24.460
 fill up all the rage of the soul what soul who 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.680
 such a soul so now all overwhelmed and 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.440
 Now we will try and not all are not all 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.770
 now try to go from here to here everything 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.540
 not very good but no, that's all yes here 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.630
 steps to see not progruzilis but 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.770
 Clearly there are steps such a thing to 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.830
 Some of the textures are somehow not 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.260
 I did not know why in general 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.900
 this is how benjen hunter 5 works 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.180
