00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
and then you go from CDMA slash LTE

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.780 
and then you go from CDMA slash LTE
that's<00:01:37.740> what<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.189> gonna<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.490> currently

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
that's what it's gonna be currently

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.319 
that's what it's gonna be currently
checked<00:01:39.119> at<00:01:39.270> -<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.259> have<00:01:40.409> 4G<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.329> go

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
checked at - so you can have 4G you go

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.740 
checked at - so you can have 4G you go
down<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.840> CDMA<00:01:43.680> only<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.490> that'll<00:01:45.450> give<00:01:45.630> you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
down to CDMA only and that'll give you

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.020 
down to CDMA only and that'll give you
3G<00:01:47.630> then<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:48.990> exit<00:01:49.490> it<00:01:50.490> automatically

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
3G then you just exit it automatically

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.289 
3G then you just exit it automatically
makes<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.869> change<00:01:52.079> from<00:01:52.439> 3G<00:01:53.280> see<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.880> lost

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
makes a change from 3G see it lost

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.600 
makes a change from 3G see it lost
reception<00:01:54.600> because<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.680> just<00:01:55.979> made<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.369> change

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
reception because I just made the change

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.700 
reception because I just made the change
but<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.149> gonna<00:01:57.270> kick<00:01:57.600> back<00:01:57.810> into<00:01:58.049> 3G<00:01:58.530> right

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
but it's gonna kick back into 3G right

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.340 
but it's gonna kick back into 3G right
now<00:01:59.090> but<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.240> would<00:02:00.420> give<00:02:00.450> me<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.780> constant

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
now but that would give me a constant

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.719 
now but that would give me a constant
