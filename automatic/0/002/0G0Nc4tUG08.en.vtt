result now over 2 million BMW 1-series
and<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:20.220> think<00:00:20.820> we<00:00:21.029> were<00:00:21.180> always<00:00:21.510> convinced

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
and I think we were always convinced

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.000 
and I think we were always convinced
that<00:00:22.560> we<00:00:22.740> have<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.369> unique<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.529> print<00:00:25.529> typical

product offer in the compact segment and

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.209 
product offer in the compact segment and
I<00:00:28.680> think<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.099> BMW<00:00:29.699> 1-series<00:00:30.080> deliver<00:00:31.080> our<00:00:31.439> BMW

looks

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.330 

on<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.769> front<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.880> new<00:01:06.150> LED<00:01:06.690> technology

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
on the front we have new LED technology

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.399 
on the front we have new LED technology
which<00:01:08.340> enabled<00:01:08.790> us<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.909> make<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.840> front<00:01:10.170> light

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
which enabled us to make the front light

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.600 
which enabled us to make the front light
slimmer<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:11.670> course<00:01:11.970> we<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.630> typical

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
slimmer of course we have the typical

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.580 
slimmer of course we have the typical
BMW<00:01:14.610> double<00:01:15.000> round<00:01:15.240> headlamps<00:01:15.690> the<00:01:16.350> shape

car<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.830> where<00:01:19.979> you'll<00:01:20.159> find<00:01:20.220> our

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
car and this is where you'll find our

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.660 
car and this is where you'll find our
iconic<00:01:21.240> BMW<00:01:22.140> kidney<00:01:22.470> grille<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:23.220> had<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> new

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
iconic BMW kidney grille we had the new

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.090 
iconic BMW kidney grille we had the new
engines<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.869> requires<00:01:25.560> more<00:01:25.890> air

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
engines and this requires more air

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.950 
engines and this requires more air
because<00:01:26.460> they're<00:01:26.640> very<00:01:26.880> efficient<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.840> we

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
because they're very efficient so we

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.870 
because they're very efficient so we
made<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.320> kidneys<00:01:28.710> larger<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.460> makes<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
made the kidneys larger this makes the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.430 
made the kidneys larger this makes the
front<00:01:30.119> end<00:01:30.330> sport<00:01:30.600> here<00:01:30.930> because<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
front end sport here because of the

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.499 
front end sport here because of the
larger<00:01:31.860> openings<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.880> particular<00:01:33.090> I'm

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
larger openings and in particular I'm

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.770 
larger openings and in particular I'm
very<00:01:33.750> proud<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.920> very<00:01:35.220> three-dimensional

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
very proud of the very three-dimensional

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.889 
very proud of the very three-dimensional
sculpted<00:01:36.780> kidney<00:01:37.560> blades<00:01:38.210> beneath<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.660> have

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
sculpted kidney blades beneath we have

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.040 
sculpted kidney blades beneath we have
very<00:01:40.380> precise<00:01:40.830> lines<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.580> poetic<00:01:42.450> surfaces

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
very precise lines and poetic surfaces

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.109 
very precise lines and poetic surfaces

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
of the car we also have new LED lights

of the car we also have new LED lights
with<00:02:02.220> this<00:02:02.310> technology<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:03.000> are<00:02:03.300> able<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.690> make

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
with this technology we are able to make

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.200 
with this technology we are able to make
the<00:02:04.020> rear<00:02:04.229> lights<00:02:04.470> slimmer<00:02:05.220> and<00:02:05.490> we<00:02:05.789> gave<00:02:06.000> it

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
the rear lights slimmer and we gave it

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.710 
the rear lights slimmer and we gave it
that<00:02:06.590> characteristic<00:02:07.590> BMW<00:02:08.340> L<00:02:08.520> shape<00:02:08.910> in

that characteristic BMW L shape in
particular<00:02:10.050> with<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.709> LEDs<00:02:11.190> we're<00:02:12.000> able<00:02:12.209> to

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
particular with the LEDs we're able to

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.320 
particular with the LEDs we're able to
make<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.840> ray<00:02:13.110> unique<00:02:13.680> light<00:02:14.069> signature<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:14.880> it

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
make a ray unique light signature and it

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.750 
make a ray unique light signature and it
gives<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.840> very<00:02:15.870> clear<00:02:16.590> identity<00:02:17.430> at

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
gives it a very clear identity at

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.440 
gives it a very clear identity at
nighttime<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:19.680> horizontal<00:02:20.400> lines<00:02:20.640> create

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
nighttime the horizontal lines create

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.540 
nighttime the horizontal lines create
width<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.020> sportiness<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.280> flared

width and sportiness and the flared
wheel<00:02:23.730> arches<00:02:24.000> give<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.050> solid<00:02:25.440> stance

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
wheel arches give it that solid stance
