fire<00:02:23.050> punch<00:02:23.320> again<00:02:23.680> hopefully<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.340> should

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
fire punch again hopefully that should

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.350 
fire punch again hopefully that should
be<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.610> 20<00:02:24.850> KO<00:02:25.090> as<00:02:25.330> well<00:02:28.860> yep<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.190> for<00:02:31.180> some

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
be a 20 KO as well yep and for some

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.090 
be a 20 KO as well yep and for some
reason<00:02:31.390> it's<00:02:31.810> using<00:02:32.140> fire<00:02:32.350> punch<00:02:32.590> even<00:02:33.010> though

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
reason it's using fire punch even though

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.360 
reason it's using fire punch even though
it<00:02:33.250> has<00:02:33.370> Thunder<00:02:33.970> punch<00:02:34.710> which<00:02:35.710> would<00:02:36.160> do

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
it has Thunder punch which would do

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.420 
it has Thunder punch which would do
neutral<00:02:37.470> least<00:02:38.470> I'm<00:02:38.650> guessing<00:02:39.280> as

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
neutral least I'm guessing as

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.990 
neutral least I'm guessing as
thunderpunch<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.270> know<00:02:40.360> it<00:02:40.480> has<00:02:40.570> ice<00:02:40.780> punch<00:02:42.000> and

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
thunderpunch I know it has ice punch and

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.240 
thunderpunch I know it has ice punch and
