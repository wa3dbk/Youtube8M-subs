 [music] 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:16.190
 hello with you igor gorozhankin and in 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.470
 this program I want to tell you about 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.310
 one very famous in italy but little 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.350
 fishing methods known in Russia 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:30.460
 this is a way of catching essentially using 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:32.270
 bombards came up with this way of catching father 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.530
 six times world champion 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:41.210
 had u colombo geth after the war and he 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.670
 used first for trout fishing in 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.480
 deep lakes of italy 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.520
 but this method turned out to be very catchy 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.640
 very effective very simple 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.250
 mastering and therefore now apply 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.840
 in almost any place what 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.980
 is such a bombard 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.850
 bombard is a special float 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.560
 which has the float body itself and 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.439
 parents extension cord 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.439
 to make the bombard take 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.959
 position in the water and the body it means 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.649
 intended to cast 

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:18.829
 long away 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.420
 bait and hold while wiring 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:23.299
 lure at a certain depth 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.029
 a certain horizon that's all the beauty 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:29.299
 the bombers are what is it 

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:32.869
 tackle provides us a long cast 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.299
 spinning and catch fly fishing on 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.319
 that is, you can fly maximum 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.659
 throw bait on 20-30 meters 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:43.669
 long long time we swing 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.109
 cord spinning god you can 

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:47.209
 throw bait it more far 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:50.569
 meters by 7 to 8 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:52.039
 There is a case of up to 100 meters but the bait 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.950
 there will be a very big fish on it will 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.779
 very bad catch bomber let's tackle 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.270
 you can pick up a little bait 

00:01:56.779 --> 00:02:01.270
 like my little fly 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.720
 little twister 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.990
 or a small bead even zero 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.780
 size you can pick up everything be 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.800
 far and carry out as when using 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:24.070
 fly fishing very slowly bombards 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.360
 the bombard lineup they come in 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.640
 Generally not in appearance 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.410
 they are not different from each other but they 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.060
 there are floating here bombards 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:38.770
 top slowly sinking and fast sinking 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.970
 they are designed to catch all as well 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.820
 would all tiers bed 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:48.130
 floating we catch chub means 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:52.000
 slowly sinking we burn perch and pike 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.440
 and fast sinking we are just like with 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.820
 using jack spinning we can fish 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.239
 the deepest horizon of water and in that 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.130
 among knock on the bottom and for pawn shops 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.790
 and catching is better to use special 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.070
 rods 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.090
 this rod is in many ways remind us 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:13.150
 ordinary fishing pole with rings 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:18.970
 but unlike ring fishing she 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.620
 has a cast and his bait weight here 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.230
 you can see throwing meat with 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.170
 15-30 5 grams that is like a spinning and 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.080
 this rod she has a special build and 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:34.090
 intended to throw like 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.130
 spinning throw bait for on far 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.680
 distance 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.320
 the length of these rods is defined in the rules 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.209
 sport fishing and ranges from three 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:48.430
 whole 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:52.620
 and 8 tenths of meters to 4.8 meters and 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:55.480
 the test of these rods should be from 0 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.630
 up to 80 grams 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.239
 why rods and why not spinning or 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.880
 some other tackle because the length 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:07.750
 leash for proper fishing with bombards 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:11.319
 should be a half two meters and we 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:16.060
 ordinary spinning even length 3 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:18.400
 meters will not be able to correctly throw in and 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.229
 bombard and to her letters dangling 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.160
 the lead 2 meters therefore apply 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.260
 special rods 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.479
 In addition, these rods provide 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.360
 correct bait wiring and started 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:31.419
 even when choosing rods for bombardy 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.610
 very important means peculiar 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.130
 staging of rings i mean you see here 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.590
 many rings called english 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.070
 setting rings i have some 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.540
 rings 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:49.660
 stand not only on the knees themselves but also on 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:54.100
 special floating getting glasses 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:57.100
 which is set upon parsing 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:03.010
 in the midst of the knee in this way on every 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:05.050
 the knee does not have to be 2 to 3 inserts 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.300
 it unloads the rod 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.860
 that is, the more the ringlets will be 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.680
 more will be destroyed were carried out during 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.500
 casting and vyvazhivaniya time 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.930
 The second feature of these rods is that 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:22.930
 they are right in general, its pretty 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:26.260
 hard build have a very flexible whip 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.350
 he shows us a bite and he doesn't 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:33.220
 breaks even when rods are bent 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:37.380
 to a scientist like a big value like this 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.380
 everything works so we 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:44.189
 open the rod put the coil 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.680
 we pass through a ring we insert into 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:51.909
 bombard 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.680
 here you can install a rubber ring 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:57.150
 to mitigate the impacts of bombards 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.789
 swivel 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.759
 after that the swivel is tied 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:08.770
 swivel remains special means he 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:11.259
 consists of three swivels which 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:15.279
 connected are connected together and by 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:17.129
 they ensure that during fishing 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:19.479
 our bait is very bad 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:22.810
 twisted and only triple 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:26.199
 swivel saves us from this well and 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.900
 when catching with bombard use 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:31.120
 fluorocarbon y 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:35.050
 fishing line she is not copper invisible for for fish 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:38.139
 in water and therefore allows you to do this 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.550
 tackle is even more catchy and as 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:44.789
 bait can be as i said 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:48.879
 use in flies streamers can 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:51.990
 common worm on the hook can 

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:51.990
 little spinners and 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:59.440
 small little twister who hasn't yet 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:07:03.009
 caught in the help of bombers I advise you 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:07.029
 use this kind of fishing because he 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:10.349
 very catchy and very simple in this in 

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:13.150
 handling it allows using 

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:16.589
 uncomplicated tackle throw small 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:19.569
 lure for a long distance 

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:23.409
 but unlike fly fishing gear 

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:25.930
 which requires a very long mastery 

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:28.030
 sometimes it takes years 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.590
 in order to correctly cast this 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.650
 a small lure for a long distance 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:34.900
 and also allows you to throw 

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:37.750
 bait of the most awkward positions 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:40.570
 from behind the bushes from behind the trees and catch 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:44.400
 careful fish with you was igor 

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:44.400
 city ​​dwellers lucky you fishing 

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.850
