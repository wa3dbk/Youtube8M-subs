00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
you can see this is all collapse now now

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.290 
you can see this is all collapse now now
I'm<00:02:07.490> going<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:07.670> just<00:02:07.820> take<00:02:08.000> it<00:02:08.149> out<00:02:10.000> try<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.060> get

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
I'm going to just take it out try to get

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.630 
I'm going to just take it out try to get
every<00:02:11.600> bit<00:02:11.720> out<00:02:11.900> of<00:02:12.080> it<00:02:12.260> now<00:02:13.100> going<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.460> add

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
every bit out of it now going to add

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.340 
every bit out of it now going to add
some<00:02:13.820> plain<00:02:14.060> flour<00:02:14.300> then<00:02:14.720> get<00:02:14.990> this<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.320> a

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
some plain flour then get this to a

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:24.760 
some plain flour then get this to a
rollable<00:02:15.800> kind<00:02:16.190> of<00:02:16.340> dough<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:24.170> this<00:02:24.320> is<00:02:24.440> coming

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
rollable kind of dough so this is coming

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.290 
rollable kind of dough so this is coming
all<00:02:24.920> together<00:02:25.100> like<00:02:25.490> a<00:02:25.520> dough<00:02:25.820> now<00:02:26.090> it's

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
all together like a dough now it's

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.630 
all together like a dough now it's
perfect<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.930> roll<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:27.230> out<00:02:27.410> and<00:02:27.590> in<00:02:28.160> total<00:02:28.370> I

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
perfect to roll it out and in total I

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.220 
perfect to roll it out and in total I
have<00:02:28.700> taken<00:02:28.970> about<00:02:29.210> half<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.810> cup<00:02:29.930> of<00:02:30.110> plain

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
have taken about half a cup of plain

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.010 
have taken about half a cup of plain
flour<00:02:30.350> so<00:02:30.890> more<00:02:31.370> or<00:02:31.490> less<00:02:31.660> completely<00:02:32.660> depends

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
flour so more or less completely depends

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.350 
flour so more or less completely depends
upon<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.350> moisture<00:02:33.740> content<00:02:34.040> in<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:34.520> so<00:02:35.210> now

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
upon the moisture content in that so now

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.840 
upon the moisture content in that so now
I'm<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.660> roll<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.960> out<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:37.370> I'm<00:02:37.490> going<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.670> take

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
I'm to roll it out so I'm going to take

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.520 
I'm to roll it out so I'm going to take
a<00:02:37.910> rolling<00:02:38.180> pin<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:38.720> give<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:38.990> a<00:02:39.020> light<00:02:39.200> roll

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
a rolling pin and give it a light roll

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.900 
a rolling pin and give it a light roll
around<00:02:44.800> so<00:02:45.800> this<00:02:45.950> is<00:02:46.100> about<00:02:46.370> half<00:02:46.610> an<00:02:46.790> inch

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
around so this is about half an inch

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.490 
around so this is about half an inch
thick<00:02:47.060> I'm<00:02:47.420> going<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:47.630> take<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:47.840> glass<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.380> can

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
thick I'm going to take a glass you can

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.140 
thick I'm going to take a glass you can
use<00:02:48.560> any<00:02:48.920> cookie<00:02:49.250> cutter<00:02:49.430> if<00:02:49.610> you<00:02:49.700> wish<00:02:49.820> to<00:02:49.850> or

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.979 
a doughnut cutter and I'm going to make
rounds<00:02:55.000> now<00:02:56.000> I'm<00:02:56.239> going<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.480> take<00:02:56.630> a<00:02:56.660> smaller

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
rounds now I'm going to take a smaller

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.290 
rounds now I'm going to take a smaller
cutter<00:02:57.290> this<00:02:57.830> is<00:02:57.890> basically<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.459> 1<00:02:58.730> inch<00:02:58.940> round

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
cutter this is basically a 1 inch round

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:09.280 
cutter this is basically a 1 inch round
a<00:02:59.510> bottle<00:03:00.440> cap

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
last phase and then we're going to keep

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.230 
last phase and then we're going to keep
it<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.440> proof<00:03:31.710> for<00:03:32.040> about<00:03:32.220> one<00:03:32.490> hour<00:03:32.520> so<00:03:33.210> that

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
to be fried so let's test the oil

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.850 
to be fried so let's test the oil
whether<00:04:50.059> it's<00:04:50.270> already<00:04:50.749> or<00:04:50.899> not<00:04:51.139> so<00:04:51.619> I'm<00:04:51.680> going

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
whether it's already or not so I'm going

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.010 
whether it's already or not so I'm going
to<00:04:51.919> take<00:04:52.009> a<00:04:52.099> smaller<00:04:52.399> chunk<00:04:52.879> of<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.659> dough<00:04:53.809> and

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
to take a smaller chunk of the dough and

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.350 
to take a smaller chunk of the dough and
add<00:04:54.619> it<00:04:54.800> to<00:04:55.009> the<00:04:55.249> oil<00:04:57.699> so<00:04:58.699> it<00:04:58.849> seems<00:04:59.149> all

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
add it to the oil so it seems all

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.929 
add it to the oil so it seems all
perfect<00:04:59.749> it<00:04:59.899> seizes<00:05:00.289> slowly<00:05:00.619> so<00:05:01.309> I<00:05:01.339> am<00:05:01.520> to<00:05:01.759> add

00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:01.939 
perfect it seizes slowly so I am to add

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:11.109

the donuts be very careful as the air

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:16.119 
the donuts be very careful as the air
might<00:05:11.389> come<00:05:11.689> out<00:05:14.229> so<00:05:15.229> I've<00:05:15.349> added<00:05:15.499> about<00:05:15.860> three
