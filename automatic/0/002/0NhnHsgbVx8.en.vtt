of like wooden blocks that would helps
another<00:00:26.180> by<00:00:26.390> a<00:00:26.419> string<00:00:26.869> in<00:00:27.110> that<00:00:27.259> string<00:00:27.529> I

common rope that was attached to all
these<00:00:32.029> wooden<00:00:32.329> blocks<00:00:32.509> but<00:00:33.350> eventually

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
these wooden blocks but eventually

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.860 
these wooden blocks but eventually
smokey<00:00:34.550> damaged<00:00:34.969> the<00:00:35.180> rope<00:00:35.360> and<00:00:35.690> it<00:00:35.750> all<00:00:35.840> just

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
smokey damaged the rope and it all just

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.020 
smokey damaged the rope and it all just
kind<00:00:36.200> of<00:00:36.230> fell<00:00:36.350> apart<00:00:36.469> so<00:00:37.309> what<00:00:37.460> I<00:00:37.489> took<00:00:37.579> what<00:00:38.000> I

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
kind of fell apart so what I took what I

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.819 
kind of fell apart so what I took what I
did<00:00:38.239> was<00:00:38.420> I<00:00:38.510> took<00:00:38.540> these<00:00:38.780> wooden<00:00:39.079> blocks<00:00:39.320> which

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
did was I took these wooden blocks which

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.160 
did was I took these wooden blocks which
I<00:00:40.280> didn't<00:00:41.000> know<00:00:41.059> what<00:00:41.180> to<00:00:41.270> do<00:00:41.360> with<00:00:41.540> and<00:00:41.750> I

I didn't know what to do with and I

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.870 
I didn't know what to do with and I
stuck<00:00:42.440> some<00:00:42.470> sunflower<00:00:43.070> seeds<00:00:43.100> inside<00:00:43.760> the

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
stuck some sunflower seeds inside the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.150 
stuck some sunflower seeds inside the
little<00:00:44.090> hose<00:00:44.240> now<00:00:45.230> on<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:45.500> blocks<00:00:45.740> they<00:00:45.980> have

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
little hose now on the blocks they have

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.590 
little hose now on the blocks they have
like<00:00:46.340> slightly<00:00:46.880> larger<00:00:47.270> holes

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
like slightly larger holes

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.050 
like slightly larger holes
I<00:00:47.750> just<00:00:48.410> stuff<00:00:48.620> like<00:00:48.829> um<00:00:49.040> a<00:00:49.280> pistachio<00:00:49.640> nut

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
I just stuff like um a pistachio nut

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.700 
I just stuff like um a pistachio nut
inside<00:00:50.390> so<00:00:50.900> you<00:00:50.960> can<00:00:51.079> do<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.320> same<00:00:51.470> thing

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
inside so you can do the same thing

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.750 
inside so you can do the same thing
forgiveness<00:00:52.280> to<00:00:52.430> them

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
forgiveness to them

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.940 
forgiveness to them
yeah<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:53.329> you'll<00:00:53.750> find<00:00:53.960> that<00:00:54.079> it<00:00:54.290> gonna<00:00:54.770> keep

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
yeah and you'll find that it gonna keep

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.440 
yeah and you'll find that it gonna keep
them<00:00:55.130> pretty<00:00:55.340> occupied<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:56.090> these<00:00:56.180> become

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
them pretty occupied and these become

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.970 
them pretty occupied and these become
really<00:00:56.720> good<00:00:56.870> foot<00:00:57.110> toys<00:00:59.170> another<00:01:00.170> example<00:01:00.350> is

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
really good foot toys another example is

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.400 
really good foot toys another example is
um<00:01:01.370> I<00:01:01.790> just<00:01:01.910> got<00:01:02.420> a<00:01:02.630> bunch<00:01:02.840> of<00:01:02.899> wooden<00:01:03.110> blocks

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
um I just got a bunch of wooden blocks

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.560 
um I just got a bunch of wooden blocks
and<00:01:03.860> this<00:01:04.519> one's<00:01:04.729> pretty<00:01:04.879> easy<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.299> make<00:01:05.420> if

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
and this one's pretty easy to make if

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.149 
and this one's pretty easy to make if
you<00:01:05.600> don't<00:01:05.689> have<00:01:05.990> like<00:01:06.229> wooden<00:01:06.470> blocks<00:01:06.680> ready

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
you don't have like wooden blocks ready

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.190 
you don't have like wooden blocks ready
I<00:01:07.270> would<00:01:08.270> suggest<00:01:08.390> buying<00:01:08.840> them<00:01:09.049> in<00:01:09.140> the

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
I would suggest buying them in the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.899 
I would suggest buying them in the
hardware<00:01:09.409> store<00:01:09.590> again<00:01:10.220> just<00:01:10.490> make<00:01:10.610> sure<00:01:10.640> that

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
hardware store again just make sure that

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.999 
hardware store again just make sure that
one's<00:01:11.060> not<00:01:11.299> treated<00:01:11.780> and<00:01:11.990> there<00:01:12.710> aren't<00:01:12.950> any

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
one's not treated and there aren't any

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:14.620 
one's not treated and there aren't any
chemicals<00:01:13.579> that<00:01:13.759> are<00:01:13.850> sprayed<00:01:14.090> on<00:01:14.329> the<00:01:14.420> wood

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
chemicals that are sprayed on the wood

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.959 
chemicals that are sprayed on the wood
but<00:01:15.319> once<00:01:15.799> you're<00:01:16.069> sure<00:01:16.100> that<00:01:16.520> you<00:01:16.729> can<00:01:16.850> just

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969 
but once you're sure that you can just

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:18.629 
but once you're sure that you can just
drill<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.270> bunch<00:01:17.389> of<00:01:17.539> holes<00:01:17.600> instead<00:01:18.170> of<00:01:18.319> what

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:18.639 
drill a bunch of holes instead of what

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:21.429 
drill a bunch of holes instead of what
let<00:01:19.639> them<00:01:19.789> stick<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:20.689> sunflower<00:01:21.109> seeds

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
let them stick the sunflower seeds

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:22.770 
let them stick the sunflower seeds
inside<00:01:21.859> the<00:01:22.009> holes

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
inside the holes

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.879 
inside the holes
the<00:01:23.780> important<00:01:24.170> thing<00:01:24.289> is<00:01:24.319> like<00:01:24.649> I<00:01:24.740> said

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:24.889 
the important thing is like I said

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:27.429 
the important thing is like I said
earlier<00:01:25.280> make<00:01:25.579> sure<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:25.880> holes<00:01:26.090> are<00:01:27.049> just

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
earlier make sure the holes are just

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.559 
earlier make sure the holes are just
small<00:01:27.920> enough<00:01:28.189> so<00:01:28.909> you<00:01:28.969> really<00:01:29.389> got<00:01:29.539> to

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
small enough so you really got to

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.510 
small enough so you really got to
squeeze<00:01:29.959> the<00:01:30.139> sunflower<00:01:30.560> seeds<00:01:30.799> inside<00:01:31.189> to

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
squeeze the sunflower seeds inside to

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.279 
squeeze the sunflower seeds inside to
stick<00:01:31.759> them<00:01:31.909> in<00:01:32.060> you<00:01:32.630> don't<00:01:32.869> want<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.079> make<00:01:33.139> it

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
stick them in you don't want to make it

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:34.840 
stick them in you don't want to make it
too<00:01:33.439> easy<00:01:33.469> for<00:01:33.950> your<00:01:34.069> bird<00:01:34.189> or<00:01:34.369> also<00:01:34.520> what<00:01:34.759> it

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
too easy for your bird or also what it

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.669 
too easy for your bird or also what it
would<00:01:35.149> defeat<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.479> purpose<00:01:35.630> of<00:01:36.170> a<00:01:36.229> foraging

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
would defeat the purpose of a foraging

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.919 
would defeat the purpose of a foraging
toy<00:01:36.909> so<00:01:37.909> this<00:01:38.090> way<00:01:38.240> since<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:38.630> holes<00:01:38.779> are

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
toy so this way since the holes are

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.149 
toy so this way since the holes are
really<00:01:39.020> small<00:01:39.289> your<00:01:39.499> bird<00:01:39.619> has<00:01:39.649> to<00:01:39.920> really

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
really small your bird has to really

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.209 
really small your bird has to really
work<00:01:40.340> to<00:01:40.700> get<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:40.969> seeds<00:01:41.209> out<00:01:41.359> and<00:01:42.039> again<00:01:43.039> this

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
work to get the seeds out and again this

helmand<00:03:27.450> I<00:03:27.600> can<00:03:28.110> take<00:03:28.260> any<00:03:28.470> kind<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.710> network

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
helmand I can take any kind of network

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.350 
helmand I can take any kind of network
do<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.310> want<00:03:29.460> to<00:03:29.520> do<00:03:29.580> seminar<00:03:30.000> seats<00:03:30.300> just

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
do you want to do seminar seats just

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.660 
do you want to do seminar seats just
make<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.750> holes<00:03:30.930> another<00:03:31.170> smaller<00:03:31.440> so<00:03:32.400> this

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
make the holes another smaller so this

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.890 
make the holes another smaller so this
is<00:03:32.790> really<00:03:33.000> cool<00:03:33.210> because<00:03:33.360> you<00:03:33.570> can<00:03:33.600> customize

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
is really cool because you can customize

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.350 
is really cool because you can customize
it<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.740> your<00:03:34.860> own<00:03:35.040> bird<00:03:35.310> but<00:03:35.550> also<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.150> type

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
it to your own bird but also to the type

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.080 
it to your own bird but also to the type
of<00:03:36.410> treats<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.710> you'll<00:03:37.860> be<00:03:37.980> using<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.550> I

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
of treats that you'll be using and I

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.670 
of treats that you'll be using and I
would<00:03:39.210> take<00:03:39.420> this<00:03:39.600> oh<00:03:39.810> man<00:03:40.020> I'll<00:03:40.140> just<00:03:40.170> drop<00:03:40.500> it

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
would take this oh man I'll just drop it

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.260 
would take this oh man I'll just drop it
in<00:03:40.770> again<00:03:41.160> you<00:03:41.280> can<00:03:41.400> see<00:03:41.580> that<00:03:41.790> since<00:03:42.090> the

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
in again you can see that since the

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.000 
in again you can see that since the
diameter<00:03:42.540> is<00:03:42.780> pretty<00:03:42.990> big<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.410> just<00:03:43.680> take<00:03:43.890> the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
diameter is pretty big and just take the

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.450 
diameter is pretty big and just take the
center<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:45.840> yes<00:03:46.230> our<00:03:46.380> wondering<00:03:47.100> what<00:03:47.280> of

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
center and yes our wondering what of

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.730 
center and yes our wondering what of
dynamic<00:03:48.090> PVC<00:03:48.570> pipe<00:03:48.780> music<00:03:49.200> this<00:03:49.320> is<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.470> one

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
dynamic PVC pipe music this is a one

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.480 
dynamic PVC pipe music this is a one
inch<00:03:49.950> PVC<00:03:50.250> pipe<00:03:51.150> diameter<00:03:51.660> I<00:03:51.980> would<00:03:52.980> not<00:03:53.250> go

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
inch PVC pipe diameter I would not go

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.340 
inch PVC pipe diameter I would not go
any<00:03:53.730> smaller<00:03:53.970> just<00:03:54.600> because<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:55.080> becomes

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
any smaller just because it becomes

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.990 
any smaller just because it becomes
really<00:03:55.740> hard<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.100> drill<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.400> holes<00:03:56.580> after

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
really hard to drill the holes after

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.260 
really hard to drill the holes after
that<00:03:57.320> then<00:03:58.320> with<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.220> open<00:03:59.550> down<00:03:59.790> I<00:03:59.970> found

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
that then with the open down I found

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.060 
that then with the open down I found
this<00:04:00.540> connector<00:04:01.080> piece<00:04:01.290> I<00:04:01.530> have<00:04:01.710> no<00:04:01.860> idea

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
this connector piece I have no idea

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.560 
this connector piece I have no idea
again<00:04:02.310> what<00:04:02.520> these<00:04:02.670> are<00:04:02.850> called<00:04:02.880> I<00:04:03.180> just<00:04:03.360> found

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
again what these are called I just found

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.230 
again what these are called I just found
with<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.900> hardware<00:04:04.200> store<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:05.030> it<00:04:06.030> looks

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
with the hardware store and it looks

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.760 
with the hardware store and it looks
like<00:04:06.360> this<00:04:06.570> so<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:09.750> cool<00:04:09.960> thing<00:04:09.990> is<00:04:10.380> that<00:04:10.650> so

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
like this so the cool thing is that so

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.890 
like this so the cool thing is that so
now<00:04:10.860> I<00:04:10.890> I<00:04:11.430> think<00:04:12.060> this<00:04:12.180> thing<00:04:12.360> is<00:04:12.390> really<00:04:12.630> cool

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
now I I think this thing is really cool

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.180 
now I I think this thing is really cool
so<00:04:13.050> everything<00:04:13.320> about<00:04:13.470> it<00:04:13.620> is<00:04:13.710> really<00:04:13.950> cool<00:04:14.130> to

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
so everything about it is really cool to

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.479 
so everything about it is really cool to
me<00:04:14.280> but<00:04:15.060> this<00:04:15.170> thing<00:04:16.170> can<00:04:16.500> actually<00:04:16.890> twist<00:04:17.160> in

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
me but this thing can actually twist in

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.370 
me but this thing can actually twist in
so<00:04:17.730> I<00:04:17.760> just<00:04:17.880> twist<00:04:18.330> this<00:04:18.540> in<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:20.900> now<00:04:21.900> all<00:04:22.320> I

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
so I just twist this in and now all I

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.850 
so I just twist this in and now all I
need<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.680> do<00:04:22.830> is<00:04:22.920> attach<00:04:23.250> any<00:04:23.670> small<00:04:24.630> hook<00:04:25.590> and

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
need to do is attach any small hook and

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.270 
need to do is attach any small hook and
then<00:04:26.370> I<00:04:26.400> can<00:04:26.640> just

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
then I can just

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.730 
then I can just
hang<00:04:27.520> this<00:04:27.640> in<00:04:27.820> southwark<00:04:28.090> age<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.600> I<00:04:29.470> would

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
hang this in southwark age and I would

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.410 
hang this in southwark age and I would
take<00:04:29.830> it<00:04:29.890> actually<00:04:30.310> this<00:04:30.430> way<00:04:30.640> that<00:04:31.120> way<00:04:31.270> she

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
take it actually this way that way she

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.760 
take it actually this way that way she
has<00:04:31.450> to<00:04:31.660> do<00:04:31.780> some<00:04:31.930> foot<00:04:32.110> kind<00:04:32.320> of<00:04:32.440> slide<00:04:32.650> it

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
has to do some foot kind of slide it

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.670 
has to do some foot kind of slide it
back<00:04:32.920> and<00:04:33.070> forth<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.690> get<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:34.840> almond<00:04:35.200> out<00:04:35.380> in

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
back and forth and get the almond out in

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.620 
back and forth and get the almond out in
most<00:04:36.490> parts<00:04:36.760> can<00:04:36.880> actually<00:04:37.180> just<00:04:37.360> chew

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
most parts can actually just chew

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.230 
most parts can actually just chew
through<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.490> truth<00:04:39.490> of<00:04:39.640> the<00:04:39.730> almond<00:04:40.060> through

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
through the truth of the almond through

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.690 
through the truth of the almond through
the<00:04:40.360> hole<00:04:40.540> on<00:04:40.870> here<00:04:41.260> I've<00:04:42.130> seen<00:04:42.370> a<00:04:42.400> lot<00:04:42.640> of

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
the hole on here I've seen a lot of

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.550 
the hole on here I've seen a lot of
parent<00:04:43.000> stamps<00:04:43.330> incorporated<00:04:44.170> use<00:04:44.290> a<00:04:44.320> PVC

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
parent stamps incorporated use a PVC

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.800 
parent stamps incorporated use a PVC
pipe<00:04:45.130> setup<00:04:45.940> so<00:04:46.150> this<00:04:46.180> should<00:04:46.450> be<00:04:46.480> safely

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
pipe setup so this should be safely

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.950 
pipe setup so this should be safely
diverted<00:04:47.260> use<00:04:47.410> and<00:04:48.240> again<00:04:49.240> what<00:04:49.450> I'm<00:04:49.660> really

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
diverted use and again what I'm really

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.390 
diverted use and again what I'm really
like<00:04:50.140> is<00:04:50.350> that<00:04:50.380> essentially<00:04:50.860> can<00:04:50.980> screw<00:04:51.250> this

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
like is that essentially can screw this

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.940 
like is that essentially can screw this
in<00:04:51.610> and<00:04:51.730> out<00:04:51.880> if<00:04:52.600> nubert<00:04:53.170> already<00:04:53.560> got<00:04:53.770> done

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
in and out if nubert already got done

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.790 
in and out if nubert already got done
with<00:04:54.070> it<00:04:54.220> you<00:04:54.340> can<00:04:54.460> just<00:04:54.610> easily<00:04:54.820> twist<00:04:55.570> us<00:04:55.810> pop

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
with it you can just easily twist us pop

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.770 
with it you can just easily twist us pop
it<00:04:56.980> out<00:04:57.070> and<00:04:57.400> then<00:04:58.030> add<00:04:58.210> some<00:04:58.240> more<00:04:58.450> treats

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
it out and then add some more treats

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.900 
it out and then add some more treats
inside<00:04:58.960> screw<00:04:59.950> back<00:05:00.160> up<00:05:00.370> and<00:05:00.550> give<00:05:00.669> it<00:05:00.760> back<00:05:00.790> to

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
inside screw back up and give it back to

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.250 
inside screw back up and give it back to
your<00:05:01.150> bird<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:04.360> whole<00:05:04.510> thing<00:05:04.750> you<00:05:05.140> can

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
your bird the whole thing you can

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.320 
your bird the whole thing you can
probably<00:05:05.470> make<00:05:05.590> several<00:05:06.130> these<00:05:06.490> offer<00:05:06.850> just<00:05:07.300> a

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
probably make several these offer just a

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.210 
probably make several these offer just a
couple<00:05:07.540> bucks<00:05:07.720> it's<00:05:08.110> really<00:05:08.470> inexpensive<00:05:08.710> to

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
couple bucks it's really inexpensive to

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.670 
couple bucks it's really inexpensive to
make<00:05:09.370> it<00:05:09.640> works<00:05:10.419> really<00:05:10.810> well<00:05:10.930> and<00:05:11.260> lasts<00:05:11.560> a

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
make it works really well and lasts a

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.150
