end kind of a growling squeaking type

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.669 
end kind of a growling squeaking type
noise<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:12.690> seems<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.200> increase<00:00:13.500> and

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
noise that seems to increase and

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.000 
noise that seems to increase and
decrease<00:00:13.710> with<00:00:14.250> rpm<00:00:15.049> so<00:00:16.049> what<00:00:16.379> we<00:00:16.529> did<00:00:16.710> here

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
decrease with rpm so what we did here

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.800 
decrease with rpm so what we did here
right<00:00:17.250> away<00:00:17.369> as<00:00:17.699> we<00:00:17.880> went<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.180> there<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.570> check

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
right away as we went in there and check

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.620 
right away as we went in there and check
the<00:00:18.960> condition<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.590> belt<00:00:20.270> got<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.480> old

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
the condition of the belt got the old

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.420 
the condition of the belt got the old
one<00:00:21.720> right<00:00:22.020> down<00:00:22.199> here<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:24.680> just<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:26.160> did<00:00:26.340> a

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
one right down here and just we did a

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.099 
one right down here and just we did a
little<00:00:26.609> inspection<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.869> it's<00:00:28.019> not

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
little inspection on it and it's not

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.650 
little inspection on it and it's not
it's<00:00:29.039> not<00:00:29.220> worn<00:00:29.460> all<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.880> bad<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.420> there's<00:00:30.570> a

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
it's not worn all that bad and there's a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.510 
it's not worn all that bad and there's a
few<00:00:30.840> bad<00:00:31.019> spots<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.650> but<00:00:31.890> what<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.160> noticed

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
few bad spots in it but what we noticed

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.310 
few bad spots in it but what we noticed
right<00:00:32.610> away<00:00:32.759> was<00:00:33.469> is<00:00:34.760> it<00:00:35.760> still<00:00:36.110> showed<00:00:37.110> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
right away was is it still showed a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.080 
right away was is it still showed a
factory<00:00:37.770> part<00:00:38.040> number<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.579> might<00:00:38.730> be<00:00:38.879> hard

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
factory part number that might be hard

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.299 
factory part number that might be hard
to<00:00:39.149> see<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:39.420> there's<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.469> factory<00:00:40.860> part<00:00:41.100> number

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
to see but there's a factory part number

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.660 
to see but there's a factory part number
salon<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.850> from<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.989> my<00:00:43.829> best<00:00:44.070> guess<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.550> this

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
salon it from so my best guess is this

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.529 
salon it from so my best guess is this
was<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.600> vehicle<00:00:46.079> from<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> factory<00:00:46.920> so

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
was on this vehicle from the factory so

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.970 
was on this vehicle from the factory so
then<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.690> came<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.110> here<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.940> a<00:00:51.710> half<00:00:52.710> inch

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
then we came in here and a half inch

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.790 
then we came in here and a half inch
breaker<00:00:53.280> bar<00:00:53.610> we<00:00:54.539> took<00:00:54.750> our<00:00:54.989> belt<00:00:55.199> tensioner

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
breaker bar we took our belt tensioner

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.930 
breaker bar we took our belt tensioner
and<00:00:57.199> we<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.469> there's<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.829> square<00:00:59.370> bar<00:00:59.640> right

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
and we just there's a square bar right

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.520 
and we just there's a square bar right
where<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.480> see<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> head<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.140> breaker

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
where you see the head of the breaker

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.640 
where you see the head of the breaker
bar<00:01:01.739> usually<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.850> most<00:01:03.750> vehicles<00:01:04.379> there<00:01:04.589> are

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
bar usually on most vehicles there are

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.920 
bar usually on most vehicles there are
3/8<00:01:05.129> inch<00:01:05.400> size<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.180> particular<00:01:06.540> one

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
3/8 inch size on this particular one

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.840 
3/8 inch size on this particular one
this<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.439> diesel<00:01:07.830> engine<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.490> and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
this is the diesel engine and this and

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.289 
this is the diesel engine and this and
this<00:01:09.180> had<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> half<00:01:09.960> inch<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.700> stuck<00:01:11.939> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
this had a half inch so we just stuck a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.450 
this had a half inch so we just stuck a
half<00:01:13.020> inch<00:01:13.170> breaker<00:01:13.439> bar<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.010> seemed<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.310> do

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
half inch breaker bar on it seemed to do

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.260 
half inch breaker bar on it seemed to do
pretty<00:01:14.670> good<00:01:16.009> and<00:01:17.009> then<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:17.640> were<00:01:17.790> doing<00:01:17.939> some

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
pretty good and then we were doing some

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.600 
pretty good and then we were doing some
inspection<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.170> found<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.130> top

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
inspection and we found that the top

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.270 
inspection and we found that the top
this<00:01:20.939> vehicle<00:01:21.420> has<00:01:21.509> two<00:01:21.720> idler<00:01:22.080> pulleys<00:01:22.500> it's

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
this vehicle has two idler pulleys it's

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.270 
this vehicle has two idler pulleys it's
got<00:01:23.490> one<00:01:23.759> right<00:01:24.000> down<00:01:24.210> here<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.009> then<00:01:26.009> there's

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
got one right down here and then there's

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.100 
got one right down here and then there's
one<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.700> bolts<00:01:27.030> right<00:01:27.210> here<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.900> was

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
one that bolts right here and that was

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.770 
one that bolts right here and that was
the<00:01:28.140> one<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.619> we<00:01:28.740> found<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.220> be<00:01:29.250> bad<00:01:29.780> we'd

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the one that we found to be bad we'd

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.749 
the one that we found to be bad we'd
spin<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.259> by<00:01:31.439> hand<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.100> there<00:01:32.310> was<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> lot<00:01:32.729> of

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
spin it by hand and there was a lot of

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.600 
spin it by hand and there was a lot of
bear<00:01:33.570> there's<00:01:33.990> some<00:01:34.259> bearing<00:01:34.619> growling<00:01:35.189> then

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
bear there's some bearing growling then

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.850 
bear there's some bearing growling then
if<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.880> didn't<00:01:36.180> spin<00:01:36.420> smoothly<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.320> there

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
if you didn't spin smoothly and there

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.090 
if you didn't spin smoothly and there
was<00:01:37.979> some<00:01:38.159> side-to-side<00:01:38.579> play<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:40.170> they

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
was some side-to-side play and they

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.109 
was some side-to-side play and they
shouldn't<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.400> any<00:01:41.520> one<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:41.939> those

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
shouldn't have any one of those

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.999 
shouldn't have any one of those
characteristics<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:44.479> when<00:01:45.479> we<00:01:45.600> got<00:01:45.810> here<00:01:46.290> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
characteristics so when we got here and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.999 
characteristics so when we got here and
that's<00:01:47.220> our<00:01:47.430> old<00:01:47.610> one<00:01:48.170> it<00:01:49.170> might<00:01:49.439> be<00:01:49.590> tough<00:01:49.829> to

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
that's our old one it might be tough to

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.030 
that's our old one it might be tough to
hear<00:01:50.250> or<00:01:50.399> see<00:01:50.670> but<00:01:52.700> pretty<00:01:53.700> much<00:01:53.790> it

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.220 

it's<00:01:58.040> got<00:01:58.250> its<00:01:58.880> got<00:01:59.150> some<00:01:59.180> side-to-side<00:01:59.690> play

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
it's got its got some side-to-side play

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.710 
it's got its got some side-to-side play
here<00:02:00.620> you<00:02:01.400> can<00:02:01.580> wiggle<00:02:01.910> this<00:02:02.030> part<00:02:02.330> back<00:02:02.510> and

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
here you can wiggle this part back and

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.520 
here you can wiggle this part back and
forth<00:02:02.930> that's<00:02:03.110> kind<00:02:03.440> of<00:02:03.470> hard<00:02:03.620> to<00:02:03.680> see<00:02:03.920> but<00:02:05.530> and

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
forth that's kind of hard to see but and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.460 
forth that's kind of hard to see but and
it<00:02:07.100> doesn't<00:02:07.520> spin<00:02:07.850> smooth<00:02:08.210> and<00:02:08.509> free<00:02:08.869> like<00:02:09.259> it

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
it doesn't spin smooth and free like it

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.500 
it doesn't spin smooth and free like it
should<00:02:09.740> it<00:02:09.890> should<00:02:09.920> I<00:02:10.430> mean<00:02:10.880> it<00:02:11.000> should<00:02:11.210> spin

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
should it should I mean it should spin

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.720 
should it should I mean it should spin
and<00:02:11.840> this<00:02:12.020> one<00:02:12.200> does<00:02:12.380> spin<00:02:12.680> but<00:02:13.310> there's<00:02:13.490> a<00:02:13.580> lot

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
and this one does spin but there's a lot

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.110 
and this one does spin but there's a lot
of<00:02:13.880> noise<00:02:14.890> when<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.040> turn<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:16.460> you<00:02:16.610> can<00:02:16.820> feel

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
of noise when you turn it you can feel

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.180 
of noise when you turn it you can feel
there's<00:02:17.630> drag<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.320> you<00:02:18.410> can<00:02:18.590> feel<00:02:18.830> it's<00:02:19.040> not

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
there's drag and you can feel it's not

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.000 
there's drag and you can feel it's not
smooth<00:02:19.610> when<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:19.760> spin<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:21.170> one<00:02:21.410> it's

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
smooth when you spin it this one it's

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.740 
smooth when you spin it this one it's
got<00:02:22.130> about<00:02:22.420> 130,000<00:02:23.420> miles<00:02:23.570> on<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.290> our<00:02:25.750> new

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
got about 130,000 miles on it so our new

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.050 
got about 130,000 miles on it so our new
one<00:02:27.370> which<00:02:28.370> is<00:02:28.580> this<00:02:29.709> this<00:02:30.709> one<00:02:31.010> here<00:02:31.400> this

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
one which is this this one here this

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.890 
one which is this this one here this
spins<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.570> lot<00:02:32.750> smoother<00:02:33.340> there's<00:02:34.340> no<00:02:34.900> there's

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
spins a lot smoother there's no there's

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.050 
spins a lot smoother there's no there's
no<00:02:35.990> up-and-down<00:02:36.650> play<00:02:37.040> or<00:02:37.220> side-to-side<00:02:37.580> play

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
no up-and-down play or side-to-side play

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.430 
no up-and-down play or side-to-side play
when<00:02:38.270> it's<00:02:38.390> bolted<00:02:38.600> on<00:02:38.900> there<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.260> that's

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
when it's bolted on there and that's

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.620 
when it's bolted on there and that's
exactly<00:02:39.920> what<00:02:40.070> you<00:02:40.250> want<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.910> that's<00:02:41.420> what

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
exactly what you want and that's what

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.540 
exactly what you want and that's what
actually<00:02:42.020> what's<00:02:42.230> causing<00:02:42.410> noises<00:02:43.340> that

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
actually what's causing noises that

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:51.460 
actually what's causing noises that
growling<00:02:44.030> noise<00:02:44.240> and<00:02:46.900> so<00:02:49.000> we<00:02:50.000> got<00:02:50.870> this<00:02:51.080> and

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
growling noise and so we got this and

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.830 
growling noise and so we got this and
since<00:02:51.860> we<00:02:52.070> have<00:02:52.280> we<00:02:52.730> put<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.150> new<00:02:53.330> belt<00:02:53.540> on<00:02:53.720> it

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
since we have we put a new belt on it

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.900 
since we have we put a new belt on it
right<00:02:53.959> away<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.200> being<00:02:54.800> that<00:02:55.070> it<00:02:55.520> seemed<00:02:55.850> to

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
right away to being that it seemed to

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.880 
right away to being that it seemed to
look<00:02:56.120> like<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:56.540> original<00:02:56.570> factory<00:02:57.320> belt<00:02:57.560> and

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
look like the original factory belt and

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.640 
look like the original factory belt and
with<00:02:58.010> 135<00:02:58.820> thousand<00:02:59.330> miles<00:02:59.560> figured<00:03:00.560> it

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
with 135 thousand miles figured it

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.479 
with 135 thousand miles figured it
wouldn't<00:03:00.800> be<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.950> bad<00:03:01.160> idea<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.820> replace<00:03:02.380> so

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
wouldn't be a bad idea to replace so

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.920 
wouldn't be a bad idea to replace so
that's<00:03:04.489> about<00:03:04.760> all<00:03:05.000> it's<00:03:05.660> a<00:03:05.720> pretty

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
that's about all it's a pretty

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.750 
that's about all it's a pretty
straightforward<00:03:06.230> procedure<00:03:06.650> there's<00:03:07.400> just<00:03:07.610> a

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
straightforward procedure there's just a

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.759 
straightforward procedure there's just a
single<00:03:07.970> bolt<00:03:08.300> that<00:03:08.510> goes<00:03:08.690> through<00:03:08.930> this<00:03:09.110> it

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
single bolt that goes through this it

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:10.990 
single bolt that goes through this it
just<00:03:10.010> bolts<00:03:10.280> right<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.550> the<00:03:10.640> front<00:03:10.850> of<00:03:10.940> the

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
just bolts right to the front of the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.050 
just bolts right to the front of the
engine<00:03:11.680> another<00:03:12.680> tip<00:03:13.040> is<00:03:15.489> on<00:03:16.489> some<00:03:16.880> of<00:03:16.970> these

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
engine another tip is on some of these

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.850 
engine another tip is on some of these
vehicles<00:03:17.330> like<00:03:17.870> here<00:03:18.170> you<00:03:18.320> can<00:03:18.500> see<00:03:18.680> there's

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
vehicles like here you can see there's

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.670 
vehicles like here you can see there's
belt<00:03:19.130> routing<00:03:19.370> diagrams<00:03:20.120> if<00:03:20.930> yours<00:03:21.140> for<00:03:21.500> some

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
belt routing diagrams if yours for some

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.830 
belt routing diagrams if yours for some
reason<00:03:22.070> if<00:03:22.190> this<00:03:22.370> sticker<00:03:22.640> is<00:03:22.880> gone<00:03:23.120> I'm

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
reason if this sticker is gone I'm

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.570 
reason if this sticker is gone I'm
either<00:03:23.959> draw<00:03:24.350> yourself<00:03:24.410> a<00:03:24.860> picture<00:03:24.890> or<00:03:25.430> pay

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
either draw yourself a picture or pay

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.250 
either draw yourself a picture or pay
close<00:03:25.790> attention<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.300> how<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.510> belts<00:03:26.870> routed

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
close attention to how the belts routed

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.050 
close attention to how the belts routed
with<00:03:27.410> these<00:03:27.560> I<00:03:27.800> know<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.400> lot<00:03:28.580> of<00:03:28.610> people<00:03:28.970> they

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
with these I know a lot of people they

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.120 
with these I know a lot of people they
try<00:03:29.239> doing<00:03:29.420> this<00:03:29.630> sometimes<00:03:29.989> by<00:03:30.470> themselves

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
try doing this sometimes by themselves

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.930 
try doing this sometimes by themselves
and<00:03:31.630> you<00:03:32.630> know<00:03:32.750> they<00:03:33.709> take<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.010> belt<00:03:34.310> off<00:03:34.519> and

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
and you know they take the belt off and

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.100 
and you know they take the belt off and
then<00:03:35.060> they<00:03:35.209> go<00:03:35.300> to<00:03:35.360> put<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.690> new<00:03:35.810> one<00:03:35.959> on<00:03:35.989> and

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
then they go to put the new one on and

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.830 
then they go to put the new one on and
they're<00:03:36.350> not<00:03:36.380> exactly<00:03:36.980> sure<00:03:37.070> how<00:03:37.400> it's<00:03:38.269> routed

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
they're not exactly sure how it's routed

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.729 
they're not exactly sure how it's routed
so<00:03:39.080> just<00:03:39.440> something<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:40.400> kind<00:03:41.060> of<00:03:41.180> a<00:03:41.299> little

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
so just something to kind of a little

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.070 
so just something to kind of a little
note<00:03:42.739> to<00:03:42.769> keep<00:03:43.130> in<00:03:43.310> mind<00:03:43.549> so<00:03:44.000> that's<00:03:44.780> pretty

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
note to keep in mind so that's pretty

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.270 
note to keep in mind so that's pretty
much<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:45.470> it's<00:03:45.590> a<00:03:45.739> pretty<00:03:45.890> straightforward

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
much it it's a pretty straightforward

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.940 
much it it's a pretty straightforward
procedure<00:03:46.730> so<00:03:47.330> basic<00:03:48.140> hand<00:03:48.350> tools<00:03:48.440> can<00:03:48.799> do

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
procedure so basic hand tools can do

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.780 
procedure so basic hand tools can do
this<00:03:49.160> I<00:03:49.400> mean<00:03:49.700> -<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.690> breaker<00:03:50.900> bar<00:03:51.230> but<00:03:51.790> so

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
this I mean - the breaker bar but so

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.900 
this I mean - the breaker bar but so
that's<00:03:53.720> all
