 [Music] 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.090
 thanks for the pass from studios we 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.130
 we found in one of the hangars of the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.650
 force maintenance service 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.110
 air and the palms we are appreciating in 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.830
 these moments a control panel of 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.710
 a ship an instruction aircraft that 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.550
 is assembled here in our country with 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:40.110
 support that with the co-production of korea 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.829
 this is part of a project that 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.290
 includes work for personnel of the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.840
 air force and also for civilians and 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.150
 so you can tell us a little more about 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.520
 this project we are with the general 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.190
 Carlos Cavez, director of 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.870
 air force information with 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.250
 general how is rpp welcome 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.020
 news like so good morning halo 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.370
 good morning to all the Peru we 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.189
 we are very happy here because 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.360
 we are seeing crystallized already the first 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.860
 the first plane that we are like 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.990
 producing with korea and can you see 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.490
 the production line of three others 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.829
 aircraft that we are like producing 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.750
 at this moment and we feel ourselves 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.190
 very proud of the development 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.960
 technological and he 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.520
 jump to this new technology 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.020
 aeronautics that we are taking 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.140
 only with the co-production of 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.360
 aircraft parts and sub assemblies 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.760
 but with other important projects that 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.800
 are associated with this major project 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.410
 as are the industrial compensations 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.510
 offset that are properly this hangar 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.400
 where we found the transfer 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.020
 technology to make the manufacture of 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.760
 parties and in their assembly as we are 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.070
 seeing here the manufacture of a 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.570
 flight simulator and also the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.850
 manufacture of an aerial vehicle not 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.410
 manned and all within a framework 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.090
 of government government and are 20 aircraft 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.790
 are internal that when are they going to be 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.140
 submitted and on October 21 of 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.660
 next month it will be presented 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.030
 officially the system with the first 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.640
 aircraft that have already come from Korea and 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.620
 later throughout the year 2015 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.300
 we will be able to deliver to the people 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.670
 Peruvian and the air force service 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.679
 16 aircraft manufactured by hands 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.850
 Peruvian women in the hangars of the 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.710
 maintenance of the air force of 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.540
 Peru very well thank you very much General 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.150
 We are also Colonel Elisardo 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.989
 orchard forno he is boss of this 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.760
 Colonel co-production project as 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.390
 Tell us please 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.980
 we are seeing then the line of 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.510
 assembly of these planes so we are 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.519
 in hangar number 1 where is the 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.930
 assembly line where we can see the 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.510
 different phases in which it is 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.579
 distributed this work to the fund 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.159
 we have two aircraft in the phase 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:44.250
 first initial phase where the 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:46.980
 assembly of all systems within 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.200
 of the fuselages and the whole system 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.840
 electric systems fuels systems 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.000
 tires including the installation of 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.500
 engine later to the front we have 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.510
 two planes that count in the 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.459
 second phase in this are installed the 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.379
 wings are installed the surfaces of 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.659
 control and it's finished assembling 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.069
 completely the aircraft after 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.170
 this already in the last two phases 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.180
 do the functional tests and the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.370
 last phase which is the test flight in 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.670
 yes the aircraft very well now we see 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.409
 that work is giving people the 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.599
 air force but they also told us 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.700
 for civilian personnel this is 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.349
 as well they said we have a group 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.970
 of 50 people who were qualified in 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.560
 Korea but now we are 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.230
 complementing the work teams 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.790
 with military and civilian personnel not 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.150
 only force but also 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.069
 personal 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.140
 who is receiving the qualification and 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.750
 are giving very good results in the 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.909
 final assembly work which 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.040
 means a technological advance for the 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.349
 very gentle country then those words 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.510
 of Colonel Bizarre Orchard Boss the 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.359
 co-production project of these 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.299
 aircraft entered to finalize indicate 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:55.989
 that these ships are going to be presented on 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:04:00.189
 October 21 these ships are called k 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.959
 t 1 p because they are assembled in our 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:07.440
 country then this is the information to
