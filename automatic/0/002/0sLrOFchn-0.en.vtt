and can also harbor bacteria which

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.280 
and can also harbor bacteria which
nobody<00:02:38.280> wants<00:02:38.820> basically<00:02:39.450> with<00:02:39.630> like<00:02:39.840> typical

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
nobody wants basically with like typical

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.500 
nobody wants basically with like typical
electric<00:02:40.800> toothbrushes<00:02:41.460> they<00:02:41.640> oscillate<00:02:42.030> so

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
electric toothbrushes they oscillate so

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.330 
electric toothbrushes they oscillate so
that<00:02:42.660> actually<00:02:43.230> like<00:02:43.410> spins<00:02:43.860> like<00:02:44.100> the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
that actually like spins like the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.700 
that actually like spins like the
bristles<00:02:44.910> actually<00:02:45.420> spin<00:02:45.690> this<00:02:45.960> does<00:02:46.260> not<00:02:46.440> do

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
bristles actually spin this does not do

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.560 
bristles actually spin this does not do
that<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:47.040> actually<00:02:47.210> pulsates<00:02:48.210> which<00:02:48.420> is

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
that it actually pulsates which is

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.590 
that it actually pulsates which is
totally<00:02:49.200> different<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.740> so<00:02:50.370> much<00:02:50.700> gentler<00:02:51.270> on

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600

your mouth into four different quadrants

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.940 
your mouth into four different quadrants

and you're supposed to spend thirty

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.890 
and you're supposed to spend thirty
seconds<00:03:53.430> on<00:03:53.490> each<00:03:53.730> quadrant<00:03:54.060> so<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:54.450> total<00:03:54.780> of

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
seconds on each quadrant so a total of

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.870 
seconds on each quadrant so a total of
two<00:03:55.170> minutes<00:03:55.320> when<00:03:55.650> brushing<00:03:56.040> your<00:03:56.130> teeth<00:03:56.370> the

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.510 
first thing that I used this product I
literally<00:03:58.650> thought<00:03:58.860> that<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:59.100> was<00:03:59.190> brushing<00:03:59.490> my

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
literally thought that I was brushing my

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.910 
literally thought that I was brushing my
teeth<00:03:59.790> for<00:04:00.030> like<00:04:00.180> an<00:04:00.330> hour<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.960> I<00:04:01.500> realized

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
teeth for like an hour and I realized

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.250 
teeth for like an hour and I realized
wow<00:04:02.490> that<00:04:03.060> was<00:04:03.240> only<00:04:03.450> two<00:04:03.720> minutes<00:04:03.990> so<00:04:04.110> when

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
wow that was only two minutes so when

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.900 
wow that was only two minutes so when
I'm<00:04:04.350> actually<00:04:04.500> using<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:05.160> normal<00:04:05.310> toothbrush

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
I'm actually using a normal toothbrush

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.360 
I'm actually using a normal toothbrush
that<00:04:06.240> doesn't<00:04:06.630> do<00:04:06.810> that<00:04:06.990> I'm<00:04:07.650> probably<00:04:08.070> only

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
that doesn't do that I'm probably only

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.100 
that doesn't do that I'm probably only
brushing<00:04:08.760> my<00:04:08.940> teeth<00:04:09.120> for<00:04:09.360> like<00:04:09.480> thirty
