this<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.850> an<00:00:18.119> amazing<00:00:18.570> little<00:00:19.170> figure<00:00:19.590> here<00:00:19.970> it

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
this is an amazing little figure here it

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.810 
this is an amazing little figure here it
is<00:00:21.210> just<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:21.930> much<00:00:22.080> fun<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.439> hold<00:00:23.220> it's<00:00:23.580> so

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
is just so much fun to hold it's so

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.200 
is just so much fun to hold it's so
solid<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.480> Holt<00:00:25.380> exposes<00:00:25.980> really<00:00:26.279> well<00:00:26.490> when

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
solid and Holt exposes really well when

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.779 
solid and Holt exposes really well when
I<00:00:27.330> go<00:00:27.510> through<00:00:27.890> just<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.010> little<00:00:29.279> bit<00:00:29.400> about<00:00:29.640> it

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
I go through just a little bit about it

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.790 
I go through just a little bit about it
this<00:00:29.910> won't<00:00:30.119> be<00:00:30.240> long<00:00:30.390> cuz<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:30.720> not<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:31.260> lot<00:00:31.560> to

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
this won't be long cuz it's not a lot to

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.190 
this won't be long cuz it's not a lot to
the<00:00:31.920> figure<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.340> very<00:00:32.579> simple<00:00:32.969> but<00:00:33.930> that

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
the figure it's very simple but that

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.400 
the figure it's very simple but that
simpleness<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.920> really<00:00:35.460> great<00:00:36.200> so<00:00:37.200> here's

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
simpleness is really great so here's

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.959 
simpleness is really great so here's
what<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:37.649> got<00:00:37.800> going<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.250> here<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.760> want<00:00:38.910> to

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
check it out we got ball jointed head

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.200 
check it out we got ball jointed head
ball<00:00:43.500> jointed<00:00:43.860> shoulders<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> little<00:00:44.879> gap

in<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.840> shoulder<00:00:46.260> there<00:00:46.820> separately<00:00:47.820> jointed

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
in the shoulder there separately jointed

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.290 
in the shoulder there separately jointed
shoulder<00:00:48.660> pads<00:00:49.280> nicely<00:00:50.280> done<00:00:50.489> ok<00:00:50.969> let's<00:00:51.180> look

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
shoulder pads nicely done ok let's look

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.520 
shoulder pads nicely done ok let's look
at<00:00:51.390> range<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.780> motion<00:00:52.110> then<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.829> elbow<00:00:53.510> wrist

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
at range of motion then that elbow wrist

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:02.290 
at range of motion then that elbow wrist
bone<00:00:55.530> saw<00:00:55.980> kid<00:00:57.949> torso<00:00:58.949> joint<00:00:59.430> which<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.850> nice

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
far as accessories go there are a few

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.429 
far as accessories go there are a few
there<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.750> an<00:01:55.170> alternate<00:01:56.600> nozzle<00:01:57.600> for<00:01:58.350> the

end of her gun gun arm without this just
kind<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.850> goes<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.689> like<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:05.869> you<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:06.990> also

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
kind of goes in like so you can also

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.540 
kind of goes in like so you can also
attach<00:02:08.369> some<00:02:08.940> energy<00:02:09.390> blasts

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
attach some energy blasts

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.950 
attach some energy blasts
let<00:02:11.550> me<00:02:11.610> go<00:02:11.730> get<00:02:11.940> some<00:02:11.970> energy<00:02:12.300> blast<00:02:12.690> to

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
let me go get some energy blast to

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.990 
let me go get some energy blast to
attach<00:02:13.260> here<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:15.300> have<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.950> double<00:02:17.000> energy

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
attach here you have this double energy

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.730 
attach here you have this double energy
blasts<00:02:19.460> like<00:02:20.460> so<00:02:24.110> you're<00:02:25.110> every<00:02:25.320> single

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
blasts like so you're every single

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:34.880 
blasts like so you're every single
energy<00:02:26.130> blasts<00:02:29.060> like<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:33.590> it's<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.680> little<00:02:34.800> bit

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
energy blasts like so it's a little bit

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.700 
energy blasts like so it's a little bit
fit<00:02:35.220> here<00:02:35.630> really<00:02:36.630> tight<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.380> I'm<00:02:37.530> not

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
fit here really tight so I'm not

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.570 
fit here really tight so I'm not
fortunate<00:02:39.140> you<00:02:40.140> also<00:02:40.320> have<00:02:40.650> some<00:02:40.920> variant
