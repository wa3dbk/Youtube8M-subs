00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.219
 The crankcase vents is a 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.559
 inconspicuous but technically right 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.509
 demanding separator of the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.699
 Emission reductions of the engine 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:23.430
 Contributes to understanding what one 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.660
 crankcase vents is needed 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.710
 Let's take a look at the engine from the inside 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.650
 Combustion gases occur during the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.930
 working cycle due to leaks 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.829
 between pistons wrestling and running rifle 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.320
 in the crankcase over this from the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.960
 combustion process resulting gases 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.770
 have a similar composition as 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.340
 exhaust 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.280
 they are called blow by gase im 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.030
 crankcase becomes the exhaust blow 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.820
 by enriched with oil it is critical 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.010
 for the environment but it has to be constantly out 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.559
 the crankcase be evacuated 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.489
 an inadmissibly high pressure increase 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.489
 to avoid 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.260
 in the simplest case, this is done 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.049
 evacuation over an opening in the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.509
 crankcase but constantly 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.909
 Engine oil is lost and this is out 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.110
 environmental reasons no contemporary solution 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.299
 the better it is the global one 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.729
 via a sampling point of the engine like 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.880
 For example, the cylinder head hood too 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.810
 and about the highly efficient 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.430
 oil separator of the crankcase 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.430
 to lead vents 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.530
 The separator can be used as an open system 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.360
 The three are not blown 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.310
 by gases are delivered to the environment 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.010
 state of the art is the closed 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.710
 crankcase vents are here 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.200
 the blow by gas into the intake tract of the 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.300
 Motors re circulated and the 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.300
 combustion process fed again 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:08.190
 in the oil separator, the co becomes everything 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.530
 decays used for the deposition 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.870
 the blow by gas passes through the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.570
 medium smallest oil droplets accumulate 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.120
 on the fibers of the separator medium 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.190
 grow there drip at the exit 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.150
 page off and get into the oil pan 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.150
 recycled 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.670
 which is now cleaned in blow by gas 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.049
 are returned to the intake tract 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.310
 and independently sucked by the engine 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.159
 over the closed crankcase 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.739
 vents is the intake tract with the 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.200
 crankcase hydraulically connected 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.299
 therefore he had to change constantly 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.610
 pressure difference between intake tract 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.370
 and crankcase over one 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.859
 balanced and so on 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.909
 that is acceptable for the crankcase 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:04.079
 pressure level to be regulated 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:06.750
 due to the adjusting 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:09.359
 pressure conditions in the oil pan takes place 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.180
 the recirculation usually below 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.700
 oil boom adjusting oil 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.250
 column in the drainage line prevents 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:22.019
 then a short circuit on the drainage 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.599
 line to intake section if not 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.540
 possible or not desired can 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:30.480
 the recirculation optional above the 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.000
 mirrors are offered in this case 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.849
 man and bumblebee insert a valve in 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.109
 the drainage line to which this 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.109
 short circuit prevented 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.700
 as another option offers man and 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.400
 bumblebee with some crankcases 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.129
 vents an exhaust valve on 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.930
 which in case of malfunction of the engine 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:58.680
 an inadmissibly high pressure in 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.799
 crankcase prevents the maintenance of the 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.810
 oil separator it is very easy without 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.909
 tool only needs the lid of the 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.360
 crankcase vents open 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.230
 become 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.489
 Now the deposition element may be after 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.239
 Maintenance interval of the engine manufacturer 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.239
 be replaced
