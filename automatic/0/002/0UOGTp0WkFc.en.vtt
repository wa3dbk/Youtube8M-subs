00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
think that's really a question I think I

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.740 
think that's really a question I think I
drove<00:05:20.590> have<00:05:20.770> a<00:05:20.800> bad<00:05:21.010> cut<00:05:21.460> unless<00:05:22.330> it<00:05:22.479> was<00:05:22.570> odd

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750

haha<00:05:23.020> and<00:05:23.940> I<00:05:24.940> think<00:05:25.120> cut<00:05:25.960> because<00:05:26.830> I<00:05:26.919> think

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
haha and I think cut because I think

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.250 
haha and I think cut because I think
it's<00:05:27.220> easier<00:05:27.580> to<00:05:27.699> sort<00:05:27.880> out<00:05:28.090> I<00:05:28.479> think<00:05:28.990> if<00:05:29.110> you

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
it's easier to sort out I think if you

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260 
it's easier to sort out I think if you
have<00:05:29.409> a<00:05:29.440> bad<00:05:29.620> sure<00:05:29.949> actually<00:05:30.220> if<00:05:31.030> you<00:05:31.120> have<00:05:31.210> a

and stuff but i think i would be a bit
more<00:06:17.260> devastated

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
more devastated

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.390 
more devastated
if<00:06:17.990> I<00:06:18.080> couldn't<00:06:18.410> wake<00:06:18.590> up<00:06:18.800> and<00:06:18.949> check<00:06:18.979> Twitter

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
if I couldn't wake up and check Twitter

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.770 
if I couldn't wake up and check Twitter
so<00:06:19.789> YouTube<00:06:20.570> would<00:06:20.750> have<00:06:20.900> to<00:06:21.050> go<00:06:21.199> I<00:06:22.780> think

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
so YouTube would have to go I think

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.590 
so YouTube would have to go I think

this<00:06:44.840> is<00:06:44.990> a<00:06:45.020> very<00:06:45.229> last<00:06:45.560> question<00:06:46.160> where<00:06:47.060> is<00:06:47.210> it

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:47.389 
this is a very last question where is it

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:50.170 
this is a very last question where is it
they're<00:06:47.630> gay<00:06:47.870> and<00:06:48.550> would<00:06:49.550> you<00:06:49.699> rather<00:06:49.850> give<00:06:50.150> up
