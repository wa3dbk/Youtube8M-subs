00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 FC Bayern Munich vs Judaism Torino 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.660
 Champions League second april 2013 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.120
 rare she strange kensy weird kensy 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.500
 my tip victory for bayern munich bavaria 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.390
 munich juventus second april 13 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.090
 Champions League This cl quarterfinal 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.220
 mating is certainly the 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.640
 most interesting of all four cl 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.570
 because two real sizes 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.099
 the very many meet 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.830
 won trophies 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.960
 one of the two clubs will be the cl 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.030
 can not win but are for 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.460
 in their national leagues on the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.350
 the best ways to become masters are the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.360
 Munich certainly the German 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.550
 Master titles will be picking up during 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.010
 Juventus was still thrilled 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.960
 could be in the past 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.030
 They met six times in the cl 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.640
 on each other and the six games 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.350
 the turin bavarians were warned two 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:02.370
 games and a game ended goalless 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.320
 second april 2013 to 8 pm over 45 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.420
 the dominance of the munich in the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.939
 German Bundesliga we have more often 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.010
 Talked but last weekend 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.950
 they showed us something completely new 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.439
 they have the old ore rivals 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.930
 from Hamburg and have him with 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.560
 an incredible new to 2 from the place 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.020
 swept the result and not even one 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.509
 football game but rather a whole 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.119
 clear ice hockey triumphs but the performance 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.670
 the Munich is just extraordinary 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.490
 Thus, such a victory seems almost normal 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.860
 on average, they score almost three goals 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.810
 but they are even in Munich for one game 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.290
 at over three goals per game 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.030
 we are most fascinated by the fact 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.460
 that your trainer heynckes the startelf 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.430
 can change at will and still 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.680
 they are still very strong at this 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.020
 Saturday has front pizarro instead 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.180
 played mandzukic or gomez and the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.810
 Peruvian thanked the coach with four 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.729
 scored goals shaqiri also played with 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.700
 ribery and müller were only 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.039
 Substitute today is the use of 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.289
 alaba is questionable, but he should not 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.720
 play can be lame on the left 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.530
 page and rafinha on the right side 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.410
 from 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.290
 javi martinez is not synonymous 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.170
 while he is sitting out a card lock 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.360
 but luiz gustavo definitely needs it 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.209
 similarly strong player who adequately satisfies him 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.290
 can replace 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.610
 expected position bavaria 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:36.150
 new rafinha van boughtten dante lame luiz 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.790
 gustavo schweinsteiger ribéry kroos t 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.280
 müller man by juventus is not like that 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.350
 convincing as bavaria but the turiners 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.130
 also have a good lead 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.750
 on the pursuers in their national league 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.540
 the lead is nine 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.250
 points so you can already say that 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.650
 your title almost safe in your pocket 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.140
 have a big step direction 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.660
 you have a title on this 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.450
 Saturdays as they intervene in the middle of 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.269
 milan 2 1 have defeated 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.580
 This was her third league victory in a row 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.370
 and since the beginning of february they have no 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.220
 lost only game 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.410
 at the moment you have the best defense 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.989
 Italy and also have the most 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.820
 away goals scored in the player squad 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.790
 the situation is not as good as it is in bavaria 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.930
 because they have some important failures too 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.140
 have to complain 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.940
 on saturday, attacker vucinic was not 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.600
 here and today is his mission 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.690
 also questionable except vucinic missing 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.510
 definitely still betttner isla carlos and 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.150
 pepe in midfield we expect the 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.250
 return of bukva and pelosi the the 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.310
 middle row should strengthen 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.359
 the only tip he could coach 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.660
 will put up is quagliarella 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:58.310
 Expected formation of Judaism 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:02.250
 barzagli bonucci chiellini vital 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.350
 papadopoulos mario matt rhi quagliarella 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.390
 Here are two very good clubs 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.000
 and it is really hard 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.060
 to say which of the two unite that 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.310
 The semi-finals will be held in Munich 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.440
 However, we expect that the hosts 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.079
 dominate and that after touring with 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.299
 a tight victory mature except the 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.650
 home advantage speaks for the Munich 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.650
 the better game form
