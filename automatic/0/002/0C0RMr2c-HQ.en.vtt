00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
name of it for a second but it's a neat

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.510

get the kill and another thing I find

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.590 
get the kill and another thing I find
cool<00:04:42.590> about<00:04:42.770> this<00:04:42.889> is<00:04:43.070> that<00:04:43.220> say<00:04:44.180> an<00:04:44.240> enemy

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
cool about this is that say an enemy

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.620 
cool about this is that say an enemy
kills<00:04:44.930> your<00:04:45.139> teammate<00:04:45.500> from<00:04:45.680> across<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:46.160> map

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
kills your teammate from across the map

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.510 
kills your teammate from across the map
you<00:04:47.630> can<00:04:47.660> go<00:04:47.990> and<00:04:48.110> collect<00:04:48.289> your<00:04:49.070> teammates

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
you can go and collect your teammates

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.090 
you can go and collect your teammates
dog<00:04:49.789> tag<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:50.389> the<00:04:50.990> enemy<00:04:51.320> won't<00:04:51.560> get<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:51.889> kill

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
dog tag and the enemy won't get the kill

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.529 
dog tag and the enemy won't get the kill
for<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.520> which<00:04:52.729> I<00:04:52.880> thought<00:04:53.030> was<00:04:53.180> pretty<00:04:53.419> cool

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
for it which I thought was pretty cool

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.330 
for it which I thought was pretty cool
so<00:04:53.780> it<00:04:54.139> looks<00:04:54.740> like<00:04:54.889> they're<00:04:55.070> kind<00:04:55.280> of

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
so it looks like they're kind of

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.810 
so it looks like they're kind of
enforcing<00:04:56.139> like<00:04:57.139> a<00:04:57.169> non<00:04:57.620> camping<00:04:58.190> image<00:04:58.550> but

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
enforcing like a non camping image but

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.810 
enforcing like a non camping image but
we'll<00:04:58.970> see<00:04:59.120> how<00:04:59.240> that<00:04:59.300> plays<00:04:59.570> them<00:04:59.960> but<00:05:00.680> um<00:05:00.889> you

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820

we'll see how that plays them but um you
know<00:05:01.940> I<00:05:01.970> think<00:05:02.090> it's<00:05:02.449> going<00:05:02.660> to<00:05:02.720> be

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810
