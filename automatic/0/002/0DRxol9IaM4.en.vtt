00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
about the nature of reality sort of big

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.790 
about the nature of reality sort of big
philosophical<00:02:18.150> ideas<00:02:19.150> are<00:02:19.690> very<00:02:20.020> associated

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
philosophical ideas are very associated

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.730 
philosophical ideas are very associated
with<00:02:21.070> with<00:02:21.460> sagittarius<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.440> has<00:02:23.590> this

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
with with sagittarius so it has this

lovely wide-ranging feeling about it and

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.190 
lovely wide-ranging feeling about it and

and the night sky and and kind of blue

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.800 
and the night sky and and kind of blue
sky<00:03:08.830> if<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.340> like<00:03:09.550> about<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.420> nature<00:03:10.630> of

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
sky if you like about the nature of

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.350 
sky if you like about the nature of
reality<00:03:11.020> and<00:03:11.620> some<00:03:11.830> of<00:03:11.950> his<00:03:12.240> theories<00:03:13.240> of

reality and some of his theories of

reality and some of his theories of
universal<00:03:14.350> law<00:03:14.590> were<00:03:14.980> apparently<00:03:15.459> born<00:03:16.230> when

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
universal law were apparently born when

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.800 
universal law were apparently born when
he<00:03:17.320> have<00:03:17.500> those<00:03:17.709> those<00:03:18.370> visionary<00:03:19.030> moments<00:03:19.540> so

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
he have those those visionary moments so

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.360 
he have those those visionary moments so
there's<00:03:20.350> something<00:03:20.530> very<00:03:20.769> special<00:03:21.130> about

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
there's something very special about

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.440 
there's something very special about
this<00:03:22.350> in<00:03:23.350> addition<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:24.100> neptune<00:03:24.670> being<00:03:25.000> square

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
this in addition to neptune being square

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.040 
this in addition to neptune being square
the<00:03:25.660> sun<00:03:25.900> in<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.050> moon<00:03:26.820> neptune<00:03:27.820> also<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:28.750> few

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
the sun in the moon neptune also a few

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.470 
the sun in the moon neptune also a few
days<00:03:29.200> before<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.830> new<00:03:29.980> moon<00:03:30.010> on<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.940> 16th

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
days before the new moon on the 16th

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.530 
days before the new moon on the 16th
goes<00:03:32.200> what<00:03:32.560> is<00:03:32.739> called<00:03:33.010> stationary<00:03:33.540> direct

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
goes what is called stationary direct

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.690 
goes what is called stationary direct
and<00:03:35.050> that<00:03:35.800> means<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.190> planet<00:03:36.550> is<00:03:36.670> changing

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
and that means a planet is changing

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.210 
and that means a planet is changing
direction<00:03:37.269> so<00:03:37.720> Neptune<00:03:38.200> has<00:03:38.440> been<00:03:38.650> moving

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
direction so Neptune has been moving

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.729 
direction so Neptune has been moving
retrograde<00:03:39.820> for<00:03:40.090> quite<00:03:40.269> some<00:03:40.510> time<00:03:40.540> on<00:03:41.380> the

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
retrograde for quite some time on the

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.460 
retrograde for quite some time on the
16th<00:03:42.250> it<00:03:43.060> becomes<00:03:43.450> stationary<00:03:43.690> direct<00:03:44.290> and

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
16th it becomes stationary direct and

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.050 
16th it becomes stationary direct and
starts<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.430> move<00:03:45.580> forwards<00:03:46.440> in<00:03:47.440> Pisces<00:03:48.100> going

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
starts to move forwards in Pisces going

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.350 
starts to move forwards in Pisces going
to<00:03:49.120> be<00:03:49.209> in<00:03:49.269> Pisces<00:03:49.660> for<00:03:49.870> some<00:03:50.049> time<00:03:50.350> some<00:03:50.739> years

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
to be in Pisces for some time some years

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.170 
to be in Pisces for some time some years
so<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:52.810> planets<00:03:53.350> symbolism<00:03:54.190> is<00:03:54.610> always

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
so the planets symbolism is always

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.750 
so the planets symbolism is always
magnified<00:03:55.870> when<00:03:56.530> it<00:03:56.709> goes<00:03:56.920> stationary<00:03:57.430> direct

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
magnified when it goes stationary direct

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.539 
magnified when it goes stationary direct
so<00:03:58.030> with<00:03:58.180> Neptune<00:03:58.769> it's<00:03:59.769> the<00:04:00.010> planet<00:04:00.400> of

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
so with Neptune it's the planet of

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.620 
so with Neptune it's the planet of
spiritual<00:04:01.030> connection<00:04:01.660> of<00:04:02.010> intuition<00:04:03.010> of

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
spiritual connection of intuition of

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.660 
spiritual connection of intuition of
creativity<00:04:04.630> it's<00:04:05.530> very<00:04:05.709> much<00:04:05.799> about<00:04:06.010> tuning

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
creativity it's very much about tuning

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.199 
creativity it's very much about tuning
in<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:07.239> whether<00:04:08.170> you<00:04:08.260> tune<00:04:08.709> in<00:04:08.920> to<00:04:08.950> music<00:04:09.790> or

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
in and whether you tune in to music or

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.150 
in and whether you tune in to music or
nature<00:04:11.170> or<00:04:11.640> art<00:04:12.640> or<00:04:13.209> poetry<00:04:13.480> or<00:04:13.989> you<00:04:14.709> tune<00:04:15.010> in

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
nature or art or poetry or you tune in

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.000 
nature or art or poetry or you tune in
to<00:04:15.190> your<00:04:15.280> meditation<00:04:16.090> or<00:04:16.269> your<00:04:16.419> breath<00:04:16.660> work

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
to your meditation or your breath work

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.560 
to your meditation or your breath work
it's<00:04:18.010> it's<00:04:18.400> essentially<00:04:18.849> an<00:04:19.030> altered<00:04:19.539> state

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
it's it's essentially an altered state

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.180 
it's it's essentially an altered state
that<00:04:20.470> gives<00:04:20.739> us<00:04:20.919> a<00:04:21.039> sense<00:04:21.280> of<00:04:21.459> inner<00:04:22.060> peace

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
that gives us a sense of inner peace

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.800 
that gives us a sense of inner peace
so<00:04:23.370> that<00:04:23.760> symbolism<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.510> going<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:24.720> be

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
so that symbolism is going to be

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.080 
so that symbolism is going to be
heightened<00:04:25.410> on<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.890> sixteenth<00:04:26.340> and<00:04:26.610> for<00:04:27.000> the

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
heightened on the sixteenth and for the

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.920 
heightened on the sixteenth and for the
few<00:04:27.300> days<00:04:27.480> running<00:04:27.990> into<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.380> new<00:04:28.560> moon<00:04:29.930> in

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
few days running into the new moon in

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.100 
few days running into the new moon in
addition<00:04:31.250> Chiron<00:04:32.250> which<00:04:32.970> is<00:04:33.120> also<00:04:33.480> in<00:04:33.630> Pisces

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
addition Chiron which is also in Pisces

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.710 
addition Chiron which is also in Pisces
