have<00:04:21.739> our<00:04:21.979> little<00:04:22.400> r2<00:04:22.610> d2<00:04:23.150> which<00:04:23.570> is<00:04:23.720> a<00:04:23.750> little

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
have our little r2 d2 which is a little

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.279 
have our little r2 d2 which is a little
filter<00:04:25.130> pump<00:04:25.639> station<00:04:26.210> hidden<00:04:27.020> underneath

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
filter pump station hidden underneath

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.830 
filter pump station hidden underneath
the<00:04:27.500> bus<00:04:27.849> we've<00:04:28.849> got<00:04:29.000> a<00:04:29.030> whole<00:04:29.270> storage<00:04:29.570> space

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
the bus we've got a whole storage space

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.350 
the bus we've got a whole storage space
under<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.200> skirt<00:04:30.470> of<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.680> bus<00:04:30.889> and<00:04:31.729> we<00:04:32.240> do

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
under the skirt of the bus and we do

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.730 
under the skirt of the bus and we do
have<00:04:32.510> a<00:04:32.570> couple<00:04:32.840> barrels<00:04:32.990> in<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.349> back<00:04:33.530> we

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
have a couple barrels in the back we

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.879 
have a couple barrels in the back we
only<00:04:33.860> brought<00:04:34.070> one<00:04:34.130> right<00:04:34.550> now<00:04:34.700> and<00:04:35.860> well<00:04:36.860> we

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
only brought one right now and well we

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.980 
only brought one right now and well we
have<00:04:37.039> the<00:04:37.160> roof<00:04:37.370> rack<00:04:37.639> which<00:04:37.940> is<00:04:38.180> more<00:04:38.810> like<00:04:38.960> a

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
have the roof rack which is more like a

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.659 
have the roof rack which is more like a
second<00:04:39.410> floor<00:04:39.620> and<00:04:39.919> so<00:04:40.130> if<00:04:40.190> we<00:04:40.220> needed<00:04:40.580> to

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
second floor and so if we needed to

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.120 
second floor and so if we needed to
throw<00:04:40.880> some<00:04:41.150> weight<00:04:41.330> up<00:04:41.479> on<00:04:41.630> there<00:04:42.130> that's

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
throw some weight up on there that's

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.089 
throw some weight up on there that's
where<00:04:43.310> we'd<00:04:43.490> go<00:04:43.669> we<00:04:44.270> usually<00:04:44.750> try<00:04:45.680> to<00:04:45.770> bring<00:04:46.010> as

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
where we'd go we usually try to bring as

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:48.040 
where we'd go we usually try to bring as
much<00:04:46.220> oil<00:04:46.400> as<00:04:46.669> we<00:04:46.970> can<00:04:47.240> to<00:04:47.450> where<00:04:47.599> we're<00:04:47.720> going

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
much oil as we can to where we're going

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.490 
much oil as we can to where we're going
but<00:04:48.260> again<00:04:49.039> hitting<00:04:49.760> oil<00:04:50.180> is<00:04:50.389> not<00:04:50.599> an<00:04:50.930> easy

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
but again hitting oil is not an easy

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.190 
but again hitting oil is not an easy
task<00:04:51.950> here<00:04:52.490> and<00:04:52.700> so<00:04:52.880> we<00:04:53.510> get<00:04:53.780> as<00:04:53.870> much<00:04:53.990> as<00:04:54.050> we

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
task here and so we get as much as we

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.339 
task here and so we get as much as we
can<00:04:54.470> we<00:04:54.770> store<00:04:55.070> it<00:04:55.340> up<00:04:55.490> if<00:04:55.700> we<00:04:55.729> are<00:04:56.270> gonna<00:04:56.419> take

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
can we store it up if we are gonna take

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:59.379 
can we store it up if we are gonna take
a<00:04:57.410> long<00:04:57.650> trip<00:04:57.800> and<00:04:58.039> we<00:04:58.099> know<00:04:58.280> we're<00:04:59.240> going<00:04:59.270> to

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
a long trip and we know we're going to

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.740 
a long trip and we know we're going to
need<00:04:59.510> a<00:04:59.570> lot<00:04:59.720> of<00:04:59.750> oil<00:05:00.050> on<00:05:00.200> hand<00:05:00.470> but<00:05:01.599> we<00:05:02.599> also

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
need a lot of oil on hand but we also

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.420 
need a lot of oil on hand but we also
try<00:05:02.990> to<00:05:03.020> make<00:05:03.229> that<00:05:03.349> effort<00:05:03.530> wherever<00:05:04.190> we<00:05:04.400> go

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
try to make that effort wherever we go

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.659 
try to make that effort wherever we go
to<00:05:04.940> gather<00:05:05.720> up<00:05:05.930> oil<00:05:06.200> again<00:05:06.800> because<00:05:07.430> we<00:05:07.460> also

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
to gather up oil again because we also

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.110 
to gather up oil again because we also
carry<00:05:08.000> a<00:05:08.090> lot<00:05:08.270> of<00:05:08.300> weight<00:05:08.510> we<00:05:08.810> basically<00:05:09.410> are

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
carry a lot of weight we basically are

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.950 
carry a lot of weight we basically are
moving<00:05:11.120> workshop<00:05:11.630> we<00:05:12.410> are<00:05:13.900> asked<00:05:14.900> by

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
moving workshop we are asked by

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.200 
moving workshop we are asked by
communities<00:05:15.560> and<00:05:15.919> different<00:05:16.210> organizations

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
communities and different organizations

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.670 
communities and different organizations
social<00:05:17.479> organizations<00:05:18.169> that<00:05:18.410> are<00:05:18.560> in

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
social organizations that are in

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.529 
social organizations that are in
resistance<00:05:19.160> to<00:05:19.820> come<00:05:20.060> and<00:05:20.240> do<00:05:20.360> these

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
resistance to come and do these

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.550 
resistance to come and do these
workshops<00:05:21.020> in<00:05:21.409> this<00:05:22.070> thought<00:05:23.060> that<00:05:23.560> it's

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
workshops in this thought that it's

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.830 
workshops in this thought that it's
better<00:05:24.800> to<00:05:25.039> show<00:05:25.640> a<00:05:26.060> person<00:05:26.419> how<00:05:26.510> to<00:05:26.570> fish

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
better to show a person how to fish

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.180 
better to show a person how to fish
rather<00:05:27.200> than<00:05:27.380> just<00:05:27.530> give<00:05:27.680> them<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:27.979> fish

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
rather than just give them the fish

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.459 
rather than just give them the fish
until<00:05:28.430> we<00:05:28.700> go<00:05:28.909> and<00:05:29.120> do<00:05:29.240> workshops<00:05:29.510> on<00:05:29.960> bicycle

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:30.469 
until we go and do workshops on bicycle

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:33.130 
until we go and do workshops on bicycle
machines<00:05:30.880> compost<00:05:31.880> bathrooms<00:05:32.360> water

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
machines compost bathrooms water

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.589 
machines compost bathrooms water
catchment<00:05:33.560> systems<00:05:33.919> and<00:05:34.490> so<00:05:35.120> we<00:05:35.240> need<00:05:35.450> all

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
catchment systems and so we need all

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:38.350 
catchment systems and so we need all
that<00:05:35.870> space<00:05:36.080> and<00:05:36.289> all<00:05:36.770> that<00:05:36.979> extra<00:05:37.789> weight

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
that space and all that extra weight

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.490 
that space and all that extra weight
capacity<00:05:39.289> for<00:05:40.190> other<00:05:40.370> things<00:05:40.870> so<00:05:41.870> we<00:05:42.140> try<00:05:42.289> not

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
capacity for other things so we try not

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.110 
capacity for other things so we try not
to<00:05:42.560> wear<00:05:42.740> stuff<00:05:43.190> down<00:05:43.340> with<00:05:43.490> too<00:05:43.760> much<00:05:43.880> work

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
to wear stuff down with too much work

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.630 
to wear stuff down with too much work
usually<00:05:44.870> we<00:05:44.960> can<00:05:45.110> get<00:05:45.260> there<00:05:45.469> on<00:05:46.070> a<00:05:46.099> tank<00:05:46.370> too

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
usually we can get there on a tank too

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.990 
usually we can get there on a tank too
and<00:05:47.500> if<00:05:48.500> not<00:05:48.740> we<00:05:48.890> try<00:05:49.159> to<00:05:49.219> do<00:05:49.400> you<00:05:49.789> know<00:05:49.880> the

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
and if not we try to do you know the

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.450 
and if not we try to do you know the
best<00:05:50.120> we<00:05:50.240> can<00:05:50.360> to<00:05:50.479> gather<00:05:50.659> where<00:05:51.200> we're<00:05:51.380> at<00:05:51.460> we

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
best we can to gather where we're at we

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.700 
best we can to gather where we're at we
usually<00:05:53.000> don't<00:05:53.180> tell<00:05:53.810> people<00:05:53.870> about<00:05:54.409> the

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
usually don't tell people about the

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.440 
usually don't tell people about the
veggie<00:05:54.919> oil

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
veggie oil

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.450
