light back out to the sensor because

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.730 
light back out to the sensor because
that<00:01:42.180> beam<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.450> covering<00:01:42.990> multiple<00:01:43.140> fibers<00:01:45.740> so

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
that beam is covering multiple fibers so

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.649
