00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.620
 and not understand 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.260
 well what that means me not 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.209
 understand good because that means a lot 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.670
 Sometimes the video that we post on youtube 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.520
 in perfect bodies 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.289
 almost always there are comments about it 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.810
 d 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.079
 things that I did not say and they put on 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.480
 my mouth or things that I have explained from 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.079
 a certain way that they have not 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.510
 it is understood 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.429
 and they misunderstand and even say 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.559
 that I explained them wrong and that I do not know about 

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:41.960
 what I speak 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:45.049
 then the wine understand applies to 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.820
 those subjects who do not want to see see more 

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:48.820
 beyond their noses is to say 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.079
 because their limited intellect are 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.040
 unable to understand what they are 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:01.250
 explains many times or that even 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.830
 even having an intellect fairly 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.010
 by a negative predisposition towards me 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.750
 person want to understand what I have not 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.400
 saying 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.270
 and I will give an easy example 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.579
 in a program on glutamine 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.850
 I talked about glutamine being a 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.850
 amino acid 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.540
 Not essensial 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.600
 that is, our body makes it 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.900
 you do not need to ingest it from outside with the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.460
 food but that forms almost 70 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.510
 a 65 70% lean muscle fiber 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.580
 removing the water that contains that 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.930
 muscle fiber that is also 70% is 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.310
 say muscle fiber without water that the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.430
 contains 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.829
 It is almost 70% 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.450
 glutamine is therefore one of the most 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.280
 important and the most present in the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.390
 indispensable muscle for a tree 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.799
 ism because if we do not have the muscle 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.360
 full of glutamine is unable to 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.590
 absorb properly and solution to 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.409
 lucina from bali na that are three 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.640
 essential branched amino acids that 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.400
 they are the first ones that the body needs 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.259
 to regenerate arc mere there were people 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.080
 who said go to this guy does not have 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.590
 idea 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.090
 fix it says that muscle is 70% of 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.280
 glutamine does not find out but if the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.350
 muscle 70% water water as it goes 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:25.930
 have a 70% glutamine crucis account 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.930
 that means me not understanding 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.270
 if not 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.010
 two
