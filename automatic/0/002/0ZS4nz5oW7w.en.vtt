never wash their hair face body or teeth
now<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.280> honest<00:00:38.910> reason<00:00:39.180> why<00:00:39.629> people<00:00:40.160> assume

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
now the honest reason why people assume

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.180 
now the honest reason why people assume
that<00:00:41.550> or<00:00:42.180> wait<00:00:42.780> people<00:00:43.230> don't<00:00:43.680> do<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.010> is

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
that or wait people don't do that is

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.470 
that or wait people don't do that is
because<00:00:44.399> they're<00:00:44.969> bigger<00:00:45.329> they<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:47.480> like

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
because they're bigger they just like

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.950 
because they're bigger they just like
accuse<00:00:48.960> them<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.200> not<00:00:49.739> bathing<00:00:50.700> because<00:00:51.300> yeah

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
accuse them of not bathing because yeah

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.439 
accuse them of not bathing because yeah
they're<00:00:52.170> bigger<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.739> because<00:00:53.699> when<00:00:54.030> their

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
they're bigger and because when their

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.600 
they're bigger and because when their
skin<00:00:55.020> always<00:00:55.260> touches<00:00:55.920> all<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.100> time<00:00:56.399> like

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
skin always touches all the time like

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.369 
skin always touches all the time like
let's<00:00:56.850> say<00:00:56.969> if<00:00:57.030> their<00:00:57.210> chance<00:00:57.480> down<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.989> there

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
let's say if their chance down to there

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.880 
let's say if their chance down to there
of<00:00:58.980> course<00:00:59.280> if<00:01:00.030> you're<00:01:00.270> gonna<00:01:00.449> sweat<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
of course if you're gonna sweat and the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.460 
of course if you're gonna sweat and the
sweat<00:01:01.920> produces<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.000> smell<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.570> they

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
sweat produces the smell so they

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.530 
sweat produces the smell so they
probably<00:01:04.890> bathe<00:01:05.250> every<00:01:05.729> night<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:06.210> all<00:01:06.330> we

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
probably bathe every night for all we

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.760 
probably bathe every night for all we
know<00:01:06.689> um<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:08.210> that's<00:01:09.210> just<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.869> cause<00:01:10.260> and

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
know um and that's just the cause and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.539 
know um and that's just the cause and
with<00:01:11.100> their<00:01:11.280> breath<00:01:12.890> they<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.130> eat<00:01:14.280> really

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
with their breath they just eat really

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.490 
with their breath they just eat really
smelly<00:01:15.509> food<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.439> don't<00:01:16.890> know<00:01:17.119> number<00:01:18.119> two<00:01:18.570> that

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
smelly food I don't know number two that

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.980 
smelly food I don't know number two that
people<00:01:19.950> don't<00:01:20.430> believe<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:20.939> working<00:01:21.150> out<00:01:21.509> and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
people don't believe in working out and

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.420 
people don't believe in working out and
that<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.610> not<00:01:23.850> always<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.659> case<00:01:25.070> let<00:01:26.070> me<00:01:26.100> tell

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
that is not always the case let me tell

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.170 
that is not always the case let me tell
you<00:01:26.640> something<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.450> work<00:01:28.380> out<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.920> go<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.939> gym

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
you something I work out I go to the gym

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.890 
you something I work out I go to the gym
I<00:01:30.860> walk<00:01:31.860> around<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.880> I'm<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.020> fat<00:01:34.490> so<00:01:35.490> maybe<00:01:36.150> if

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
I walk around and I'm so fat so maybe if

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.620 
I walk around and I'm so fat so maybe if
people<00:01:37.220> just<00:01:38.220> keep<00:01:38.729> thinking<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.180> they

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
people just keep thinking that they

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.670 
people just keep thinking that they
should<00:01:39.659> probably<00:01:39.990> think<00:01:40.200> outside<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.650> box

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
should probably think outside of the box

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.969 
should probably think outside of the box
maybe<00:01:41.070> it's<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.329> person<00:01:42.689> into<00:01:42.899> genetics<00:01:43.500> that

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
maybe it's the person into genetics that

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.670 
maybe it's the person into genetics that
are<00:01:44.360> just<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.869> maybe<00:01:46.049> they<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.409> have

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
are just like that maybe they just have

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.560 
are just like that maybe they just have
a<00:01:47.450> really<00:01:48.450> slow<00:01:49.520> metabolism<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.909> they<00:01:51.420> just

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
a really slow metabolism and they just

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.690 
a really slow metabolism and they just
keep<00:01:51.810> dating<00:01:52.049> weight<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.979> when<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.430> game

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
keep dating weight and and when the game

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.609 
keep dating weight and and when the game
is<00:01:53.970> super<00:01:54.299> hard<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.540> lose<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.290> don't<00:01:55.470> know

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
is super hard to lose but you don't know

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.670 
is super hard to lose but you don't know
their<00:01:55.799> situation<00:01:55.920> but<00:01:56.909> that's<00:01:57.060> my<00:01:57.360> situation

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680

it doesn't drink a lot much yes you've

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.410 
it doesn't drink a lot much yes you've

jiggle<00:06:26.840> that<00:06:26.990> much<00:06:27.170> and<00:06:27.530> the<00:06:28.280> reason<00:06:28.700> why<00:06:28.940> I

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
jiggle that much and the reason why I

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.620 
jiggle that much and the reason why I
look<00:06:30.110> really<00:06:30.470> heavy<00:06:31.010> or<00:06:31.580> I<00:06:31.700> am<00:06:31.880> happy<00:06:32.420> is

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
look really heavy or I am happy is

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.960 
look really heavy or I am happy is
because<00:06:33.190> two<00:06:34.190> reasons<00:06:35.020> one<00:06:36.400> muscle<00:06:37.400> it<00:06:37.700> adds

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
because two reasons one muscle it adds

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:38.680 
because two reasons one muscle it adds
weight

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
weight

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.060 
weight
it<00:06:38.900> adds<00:06:39.970> bigness<00:06:40.970> and<00:06:41.390> the<00:06:42.110> second<00:06:42.500> reason<00:06:42.650> is

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.070 
it adds bigness and the second reason is

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.100 
it adds bigness and the second reason is
because<00:06:43.130> I<00:06:43.520> have<00:06:43.880> a<00:06:43.910> really<00:06:44.330> big<00:06:44.780> bone

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
because I have a really big bone

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.320 
because I have a really big bone
structure<00:06:45.740> and<00:06:45.770> this<00:06:46.190> I<00:06:46.460> have<00:06:46.760> no<00:06:46.940> control

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
structure and this I have no control

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.610 
structure and this I have no control
over<00:06:47.360> I<00:06:47.630> can<00:06:47.810> be<00:06:47.900> the<00:06:47.990> healthiest<00:06:48.290> person<00:06:48.410> in
