00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:16.490
 welcome to subscribers 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:18.810
 a commentator of football matches and 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.910
 a war that is called jumping towards 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.279
 hell and they see that it is hell and 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.449
 hell of eyes is about to say 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.769
 incense you know 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.849
 eye because it is worth it can fall little and 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.030
 then you can fall as I call 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.260
 go out and go fall more extremely worth of 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.579
 it suddenly exploded knows collisions 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.620
 collisions clouds in space 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.780
 university that is not space 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.010
 universal not the university space the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.329
 space of the universities so that 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.219
 confuse us say no 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.289
 to forget the kids forget it 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.609
 I forget sometimes I forget that 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:50.379
 I wanted to until the same thing that I have 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.390
 some kind of brain problem was going 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.620
 say cranial cranial of the same thing 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.909
 celebrated by the skull is what it wraps 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.219
 to the brain therefore cranial problem 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.049
 it would be a problem of bones boy how 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.960
 I explain here everything all the add it 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.549
 the astronomy of the body astronomy I think 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.259
 which is from outer space game da 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.909
 Like we do for sativa we are going to 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.680
 alleging of guys we are going to give him cane 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.060
 because we are here in this race that 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.590
 it's called jumping into hell it's 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.270
 I do not know if he lives in the emotional hell 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.090
 it takes me a lot that lives in that 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.159
 hell I do not really know but I think 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.549
 that if also reading words and how 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:25.479
 as dark and dense you see as the plan 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.429
 as bad for an eye that came in handy 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.440
 I came as strip has been removed 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.420
 half off of my way for guys to 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.770
 see eye because we first did not 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.909
 there is jumping here we are going up and 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.069
 platform platform 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.039
 this could be this could be a 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.600
 invention knows this could be like how 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.890
 one does good as a rope with fences 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.210
 must push that does not come out because I here 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.430
 come up later 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:52.380
 all this to the voice eyes that we follow 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.150
 I think very first but I think so 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.200
 Of course I did, but I was afraid because I 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.360
 pushed on board I yes I am like the 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.950
 calculators you know always multiplied you 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.130
 pushes me is one that multiplied by 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.130
 two 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.410
 and now men 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:27.440
 I do not have it so we're going to catch the 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.690
 point a little bit way 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.520
 we have well accumulate acrobatics and 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.010
 I'm serious, now I can not see why 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.630
 Stalinism but cool much that what 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.140
 It happens if you are driving palante while 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.610
 that you look back 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.260
 obviously if you are driving 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.860
 palante as well as the stones 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.860
 basically 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:58.070
 the kid talking about the brains and 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.070
 from the astronomy of the universities
