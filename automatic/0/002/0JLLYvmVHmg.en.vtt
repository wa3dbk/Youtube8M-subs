00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
really fast that's pretty much all they

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.840 
really fast that's pretty much all they
do<00:03:39.120> is<00:03:39.270> they<00:03:39.390> run<00:03:39.570> really<00:03:39.720> fast<00:03:40.020> and<00:03:40.640> this<00:03:41.640> is

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
do is they run really fast and this is

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.410 
do is they run really fast and this is
lagging<00:03:42.150> all<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.630> hell<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:43.110> I<00:03:43.260> never<00:03:43.410> like

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
lagging all the hell it I never like

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.510 
lagging all the hell it I never like
normally<00:03:45.440> so<00:03:46.440> I'm<00:03:46.560> pretty<00:03:46.830> sure<00:03:47.040> it's<00:03:47.160> because

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
normally so I'm pretty sure it's because

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.850 
normally so I'm pretty sure it's because
of<00:03:48.050> my<00:03:49.050> computer<00:03:49.440> can't<00:03:49.620> take<00:03:49.800> the<00:03:49.950> recording

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.530 
yes I will post my first attempt my
first<00:03:56.280> like<00:03:56.490> ever<00:03:56.700> live<00:03:57.000> game<00:03:57.300> I<00:03:57.330> actually

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
first like ever live game I actually

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.820 
first like ever live game I actually
recorded<00:03:58.050> that<00:03:58.170> but<00:03:58.320> the<00:03:58.380> sound<00:03:58.590> was<00:03:58.620> all

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
recorded that but the sound was all

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.460 
recorded that but the sound was all
screwed<00:03:59.100> up<00:03:59.360> which<00:04:00.360> sucks<00:04:00.690> because<00:04:00.960> I<00:04:01.230> think

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
screwed up which sucks because I think

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.170 
screwed up which sucks because I think
the<00:04:01.710> common<00:04:02.100> technique<00:04:02.460> was<00:04:02.610> better<00:04:02.850> cuz<00:04:03.090> I

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
the common technique was better cuz I

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.570 
the common technique was better cuz I
was<00:04:03.270> just<00:04:03.420> very<00:04:03.600> confused<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.460> commenting<00:04:05.460> on

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
was just very confused and commenting on

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.710 
was just very confused and commenting on
everything<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:05.970> now<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:06.180> just<00:04:06.210> all<00:04:06.480> seems

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
everything and now it just all seems

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.230 
everything and now it just all seems

court so I think it's based on using the

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:28.580 
court so I think it's based on using the
punchy<00:06:22.060> fists<00:06:22.300> to<00:06:22.510> kill<00:06:22.690> a<00:06:22.720> bunch<00:06:22.870> of<00:06:22.990> people
