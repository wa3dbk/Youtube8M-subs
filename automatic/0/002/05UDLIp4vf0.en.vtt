00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.690
 hello my name is alain I'm 27 years old 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.660
 and I want the sea ​​king beauty blog 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:18.040
 hello style my name is sabrina i 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.140
 21 years old I am a mother of a little 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.189
 3 year old boy named lohan but 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.439
 China big passionate cosmetics 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.240
 I tested the new ultra soft range 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.000
 of garnish which is intended to 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.350
 kinky and curly hair and I was 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.490
 pleasantly surprised because the 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.660
 war does not work very very well 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.330
 especially for the maintenance of horses at 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.860
 daily then its super affordable which 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.519
 are very very good and above all they are 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.410
 very effective 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:39.670
 I think the full range will be very 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.230
 relevant to sabrina and I found 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.050
 excellent for moisturizing hair 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.860
 everyday and so we will test from 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.860
 have to see what it gives 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.950
 I know I started with 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.950
 shampoos 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.500
 it 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.110
 in the second stage it's fishing in 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.579
 complain the man always in 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.430
 humanity so based on aloe vera is 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.370
 pile of shea leaders come in 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.990
 color and especially it will soften your tone 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.990
 hair and everything 2 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.149
 the cream of play in fact will allow 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.840
 to hydrate and she especially has to 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:31.469
 make styling easier so you're going to have 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.579
 it is super fluid ie 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.859
 that they penetrate very quickly from 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.030
 hair and even on the skin there's no 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:38.939
 sticky girls that can be found 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.840
 on other cream standing against the 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.840
 leaving there you must feel 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.439
 it 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.560
 I think that one of the biggest 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.729
 strengths of the range already is to be 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.900
 accessible to all because it's 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.700
 quite difficult to find products 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.780
 adapted to frizzy hair and 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.340
 very dry hair 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.659
 so it's true that the hall of power 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.549
 find them in the supermarket that's it 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.140
 practical and then it's cheap like you 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.970
 I said little, I know how I'm going 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.450
 test the range on our sons and to 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.740
 customs especially the cream the cream of 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.229
 day had really softened the hair 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.090
 and helped to facilitate hair styling 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.440
 what I preferred in the range me 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.900
 it was the after shampoo it's true that 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.120
 it facilitates disentangling him and it allows 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.030
 to style hair faster 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.790
 when I wear noan he cries more so 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.769
 so it makes it easier to disentangle the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.769
 styling we just know great for him
