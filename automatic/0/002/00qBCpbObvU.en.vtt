00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.599
 talk about frankly bad games 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.710
 always hard they always want 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.870
 to justify 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.780
 find some though small but all 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.340
 after all, someone really put 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.250
 to create them some effort 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.830
 or even a little talent so here in 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.830
 transformer immediately dark spark nothing 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.320
 no no effort no talent no 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.970
 the benefits so much that 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.850
 the accompanying movie game is practically 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.469
 a priori being recorded in category b is 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.190
 of course a few successful exceptions 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.649
 like 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.620
 x-men origin became in ryan but in general 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.350
 the situation does not change new transformers 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.059
 did not become an exception plot rights dark 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.950
 spark is built around the simplest 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.020
 fight concept nice guys 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.199
 autobots with bad guys up 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.730
 silicones for the dark spark itself dark 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.699
 spark is such an alternative 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.870
 autobot sky matrix leadership 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.230
 an artifact that gives their leader 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.149
 Optimus Prime access to all knowledge 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.739
 Transformers on the background of the battle 2 large 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.170
 fractions will periodically appear 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.970
 my not key lock down a rebellious 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.920
 whose transformer is certain 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.689
 moment even capturing the dark spark 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.400
 but especially the role in general 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.100
 standoff they don't play on 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.720
 14 pieces of company player 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.000
 will be constantly moving between 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.100
 doherty clones and autobots somewhere in 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.290
 the middle of the whole cease to perceive 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.420
 who do you play goals and character for 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.250
 Transformers are not registered with them 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.960
 there is no individuality 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.119
 the developers obviously put everything under 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.640
 those who have known so long ago 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.200
 starscream or bumbo embers for the rest 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.930
 these will be just some robots 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.659
 hunting for that violet thing 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.790
 Hurray from already dark spark simply no 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.180
 no narrative line you 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.229
 constantly throw in monotonous fights 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.149
 interspersed with scanty patches 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.280
 replicas of other transformers sometimes 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.689
 show videos in which either 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.700
 nothing but idle chatter 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.159
 it seems that the owner 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.689
 Transformers franchise simply banned 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.969
 tell any new in the game 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.640
 information or add that so old 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.039
 The game has two ground and land scenes. 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.989
 cybertron both look like an ordinary pile 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.650
 randomly placed stone blocks 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.390
 only with the difference 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.310
 what on earth of the species meet cars 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.680
 subway cars and several interactive 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.209
 objects new transformers looks like 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.909
 the result of experimenting with some 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.670
 time machine such a picture can 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:27.549
 meet 2008 and even then she will 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.290
 It looked outdated almost everything 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.299
 you will do it in a game in someone 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.040
 shoot you can of course fight in 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.930
 melee but health characters 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.689
 quite a few yes and ammo lying around 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.359
 literally everywhere there is no need 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:41.890
 go to fists but fire 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.659
 many weapons with different characteristics 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.819
 and behavior on the battlefield 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.739
 traditional plasma rifles are good 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.359
 on long distances and electronic 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.400
 gun though does great damage 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.799
 but for the shot you need to come close to 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.200
 goals and before this opponent you can 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.540
 pour over and such an acid fountain for 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.209
 gain subsequent damage it was all 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.650
 would be cool but unfortunately worthy of goals 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.109
 except for all this 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.879
 unique titanium and its septic tank before it 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.859
 and mercenaries are almost the same 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.500
 apart and have equally stupid 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.010
 artificial intelligence with bosses is different 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.139
 problem 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.030
 though they are constantly substituted by 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.519
 your blows but do so 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.010
 inadequately heavy damage given something 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.230
 far from dark souls on the fifth attempt not 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.180
 die a second beat bass game 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.970
 I just want to turn off 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.709
 unstoppable desire and turn off starts 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.409
 chase already literally half an hour 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.480
 after the start and even if you switched that 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:36.609
 time line it does not mean that 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.980
 then you get at least some 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.680
 pleasure fans of transformers in the morning 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.840
 fascinated by the use or he void the rest 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.599
 completely mediocre performance 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.819
 as we said talk about wright the 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.310
 dark spark is as hard as it is 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.010
 play have you liked the new movie 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.949
 better buy a cup or t-shirt they 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.299
 at least cheaper on it all good luck and 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:00.299
