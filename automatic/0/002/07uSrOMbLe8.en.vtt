00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:07.649
 Hello, we are again leafing sports 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.050
 page of our video magazine haribo 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.559
 should today's issue be dedicated 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.630
 both guys and girls but first 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.470
 queue girl because they are bigger 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:23.779
 totally wrong doing the exercise 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.400
 for such a muscle group as a press 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.160
 let's just let's dot above it 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.910
 the press is one target muscle 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.690
 no there is no lower press 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.649
 upper and middle 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.260
 there are abdominal muscles there is a lower part 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.870
 top engage one without the other 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.820
 almost impossible I'll tell you 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.879
 now as little as possible 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.200
 shift accents but remember if you 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.010
 someone says you can train 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.140
 top press 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.930
 bottom press is complete nonsense of such not 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.750
 there we start with the biggest mistakes 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.510
 what do many girls do when they want 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.550
 reduce waist 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.689
 begin to perform the dumbest in the world 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.310
 mind of birth is the most harmful stupid 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.600
 simply 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.570
 can not imagine if your coach 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.850
 instructor elite advise you to do it 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.659
 never talk to him again 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.789
 topic 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.340
 physical education do not listen to 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:21.799
 his advice he is either a fool or just 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.189
 really test you more money here 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.189
 this exercise 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:33.360
 take the dumbbell and start to perform on 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.860
 anyone in either empty 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.870
 why is it stupid 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.920
 because when exercise do 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.230
 because we will sew so yes yes but if 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.370
 you have fat here and you want it 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.380
 remove the slopes you just increase 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.570
 his waist why because he lives and 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.110
 will not go away but will be strengthened 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.630
 muscles that are in the cop skew 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.430
 muscles and train them separately do not need 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.200
 believe when you perform various 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.649
 squatting deadlifts 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.090
 they work very well and get 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.500
 your required load 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.260
 but come on extra 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.710
 your muscles will increase and fat is not less 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.530
 will become 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.340
 and your waistline will start to grow and you 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.290
 start thinking 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.750
 you will start thinking I have a wide bone 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.340
 something wrong with my body 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.310
 the gym turn me off 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.580
 man is such nonsense and if it is 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.700
 what do you make a mistake still have 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.880
 hyperextension that work on muscles 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.830
 buttocks and loins but many do too 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.350
 become god in this machine and 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.470
 you start doing such on the skin it is 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.590
 same stupid pastime as slopes 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.510
 with dumbbells, remember any inclinations 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.270
 the only thing you can do when you 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.870
 hang on a crossbar 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.260
 for themselves 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.940
 you can do a little god away from 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.020
 that they will not become more 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.360
 will reinforce another important mistake 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.940
 many do exercises in roman chair 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.880
 when many are fixed in the support 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.180
 rises the casing remember press 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.920
 doesn't work here if you know 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:19.150
 physiology of motion biomechanics then you 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.200
 you know that fixing the foot and performs 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:26.069
 the movement works not the press works and 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.709
 thighs and gluteus and lower back muscles 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.830
 the loin works in a very dangerous mode 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.230
 this exercise with a guarantee will lead you 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.060
 to fuck with a guarantee will lead you either to 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:41.040
 protrusion to either intervertebral hernia 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.959
 throw this exercise about want as 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.650
 you can do any exercises at all 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.849
 on press 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.370
 which required attaching the feet much 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:53.890
 more effectively in any room now there 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.340
 fitballs are the coolest exercise 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.270
 with enjoy very easy lie down 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.050
 roll back as far as possible 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.209
 finding 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.340
 balance on the newest practical model 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.550
 you need and see when we swing 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.160
 Ruth 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.120
 already we are doing flexion and the name of the 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.900
 press exercises 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.050
 twisted of you will make a heave 23 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.959
 percent all require lifting lifting it 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.840
 prince do not work stretched out 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.880
 see deflection back performed 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.169
 twisting lifting heels up 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:30.090
 your knees meet your shoulders 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:35.740
 exercises for twisting press and 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:40.060
 pulling yourself went to not cause injury 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.620
 cervical spine 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.290
 if you do all these right 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.260
 exercise load regulates your brain 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.419
 you will be worth the unbearable burning already 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.030
 inflict repeat them here remember this 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:57.490
 the best exercise for those who want 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:59.800
 purposefully pump the lower part 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:06.750
 press remember not lower press its not 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:07.900
 exists go to bed 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.570
 twist 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:15.520
 in this position, the abs muscles are tired 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.710
 go to the next motion put 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.409
 first hands palms down on 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.719
 and 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:24.059
 try to raise does she was 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:27.729
 this will not even mun voice 

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:30.249
 try to pull ideally we 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:31.960
 in general already able to climb almost 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:36.389
 on the shoulder blades can we really do it 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:39.599
 business down here the press works 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:43.930
 mostly don't wait for him 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:48.510
 part do not need to invent 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:53.380
 doing something here doing such see 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:55.810
 twist the pine climbs you will develop 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:59.010
 their abdominal muscles in their entirety but 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.780
 Do not forget about both loins 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.090
 hyperextension who have no opportunity 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:08.040
 walk the gyms she is now x 3 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:11.590
 do it at home very efficiently and 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:16.420
 even worse that's classic version 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:18.020
 home games can perform it 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:21.560
 what you want 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.599
 exercise is well developed and 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:28.129
 press 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:31.960
 so don't listen to stupid stupid people 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:35.060
 instructors always study the question and 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:38.060
 come to any question not only in 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.930
 training well as their food 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.099
