 Hi, this is Real. 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.900
 This lecture is as I predicted in Chapter 24 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.780
 I teach how to hold several events in one group. 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.440
 So let's get started! 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.160
 Right click on my costume - Click on the group to add it. 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.140
 Next, add the models to which you want to apply the events within the added group. 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.120
 I turned the flash on for reference, or let the model disappear when I took the crossbow. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.880
 Once you have added an event, give it to the parent group. 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.380
 Applying this format allows you to apply multiple events. 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.820
 Let's try it out. 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.140
 It works well! 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.220
 If you want to apply more than two events, 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.620
 You can arrange the groups and events appropriately in the form of Mat Ryishika. 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.840
 Let's add an event that disappears with a handgun this time. 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.400
 It works fine. 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.580
 This tutorial is here. 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.400
 Let's see it in chapter 26!
