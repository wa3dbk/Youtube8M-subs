if<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.420> figured<00:00:39.780> I'd<00:00:39.899> makes<00:00:40.079> them<00:00:40.230> up<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:40.500> fun

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
if I figured I'd makes them up for fun

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.530

greatest<00:00:44.520> song<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.899> figured<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.230> good<00:00:46.530> we

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
greatest song so I figured this good we

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.319 
greatest song so I figured this good we
have<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.829> lower<00:00:46.980> firing<00:00:47.430> rate<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.789> amble<00:00:48.120> count

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
have a lower firing rate and amble count

name would be the Schrodinger saw for
this<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.560> figured<00:01:13.979> something<00:01:14.540> ok<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.840> looks

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
this I figured something ok that looks

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.399 
this I figured something ok that looks
like<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.500> hurts<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:17.720> little<00:01:18.720> take<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> word

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
like it hurts a little take on the word

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
so many different ways to hurt you I

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.039 
so many different ways to hurt you I
figured<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.150> would<00:01:33.240> give<00:01:33.360> random<00:01:33.689> status

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
figured it would give random status

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.410 
figured it would give random status
effects<00:01:34.380> exchange<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.520> lower<00:01:35.700> attack<00:01:36.119> speed

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
effects exchange for lower attack speed

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.530

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
and less damage over all done this is

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.230 
and less damage over all done this is

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240
