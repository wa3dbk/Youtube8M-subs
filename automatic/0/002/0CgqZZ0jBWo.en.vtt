the nose and is bleeding everywhere and

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.400 
the nose and is bleeding everywhere and
I<00:02:46.500> set<00:02:46.799> to<00:02:46.829> go<00:02:47.040> from<00:02:47.220> my<00:02:47.340> pyramid<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:49.019> get<00:02:49.260> up

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.610 
and then I realized that no one's there
so<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.660> was<00:02:51.870> just<00:02:51.900> kind<00:02:52.019> of<00:02:52.140> put<00:02:52.320> my<00:02:52.410> foot<00:02:52.590> down

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
so I was just kind of put my foot down

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.650 
so I was just kind of put my foot down
and<00:02:53.040> just<00:02:53.130> keep<00:02:53.370> going<00:02:53.549> with<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.700> pyramid<00:02:54.090> but

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
and just keep going with the pyramid but

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.500 
and just keep going with the pyramid but
then<00:02:54.870> when<00:02:55.140> my<00:02:55.190> side<00:02:56.190> person<00:02:57.090> that's<00:02:57.360> the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
then when my side person that's the

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.830 
then when my side person that's the
bracer<00:02:57.959> Falls<00:02:58.560> she<00:02:59.370> hits<00:02:59.640> my<00:02:59.910> base<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:00.630> then

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
bracer Falls she hits my base and then

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.780 
bracer Falls she hits my base and then
that<00:03:01.019> knocks<00:03:01.230> me<00:03:01.530> over<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:02.160> then<00:03:02.370> when<00:03:02.519> we<00:03:02.610> try

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
that knocks me over and then when we try

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.840 
that knocks me over and then when we try
to<00:03:02.820> get<00:03:03.000> up<00:03:03.150> one<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.019> basis<00:03:04.410> for<00:03:04.590> my<00:03:04.850> bracer

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
to get up one of the basis for my bracer

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.900

that's<00:03:14.010> what<00:03:14.250> we<00:03:14.370> did<00:03:14.549> and<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.120> basically

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
that's what we did and I basically

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:16.390 
that's what we did and I basically
didn't<00:03:15.870> know<00:03:15.959> it<00:03:16.109> was

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
didn't know it was

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.059 
didn't know it was
going<00:03:16.549> on<00:03:16.700> so<00:03:17.239> it<00:03:18.049> just<00:03:18.319> felt<00:03:18.680> like<00:03:18.739> a<00:03:18.829> dream

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
going on so it just felt like a dream

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.800 
going on so it just felt like a dream
really<00:03:19.519> but<00:03:19.760> that's<00:03:19.939> what<00:03:20.180> happens<00:03:20.510> so

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
really but that's what happens so

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.339
