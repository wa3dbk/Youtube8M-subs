00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
was taken down so

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.420 
was taken down so
that<00:02:40.660> jumps<00:02:41.230> into<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.560> idea<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:41.920> I<00:02:42.069> had<00:02:42.100> of

depending of course on how many people
have<00:05:51.470> been<00:05:51.530> drinking<00:05:51.889> so<00:05:52.639> the<00:05:53.210> next<00:05:53.240> step<00:05:53.510> is

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
have been drinking so the next step is

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.480 
have been drinking so the next step is
to<00:05:53.780> actually<00:05:53.990> cover<00:05:54.410> the<00:05:54.590> Machine<00:05:54.919> and<00:05:55.160> then

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
to actually cover the Machine and then

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.450 
to actually cover the Machine and then
turn<00:05:55.760> it<00:05:55.790> on<00:05:56.120> um<00:05:56.680> the<00:05:57.680> machine<00:05:57.979> with<00:05:58.100> some<00:05:58.250> plug

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
turn it on um the machine with some plug

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.680 
turn it on um the machine with some plug
by<00:05:58.610> the<00:05:58.669> way<00:05:58.850> that's<00:05:59.000> why<00:05:59.180> the<00:05:59.240> light<00:05:59.419> didn't

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
by the way that's why the light didn't

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
by the way that's why the light didn't
go<00:05:59.810> on<00:05:59.990> so<00:06:00.320> I<00:06:00.910> plugged<00:06:01.910> it<00:06:02.000> it<00:06:02.440> anyways<00:06:03.440> now

the milk to the little machine adapter

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.430 
the milk to the little machine adapter
that<00:07:09.120> comes<00:07:09.300> out<00:07:09.510> on<00:07:09.750> the<00:07:09.870> side<00:07:10.080> that's<00:07:10.290> a

you're gonna see the milk is a little
bit<00:07:18.690> thicker<00:07:18.990> is<00:07:19.380> more<00:07:20.040> foamy<00:07:20.900> next<00:07:21.900> step<00:07:22.080> is

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:22.290 
bit thicker is more foamy next step is

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.470 
bit thicker is more foamy next step is
to<00:07:22.320> actually<00:07:22.590> at<00:07:22.860> the<00:07:23.220> coffee<00:07:23.550> to<00:07:24.120> the<00:07:24.150> pace

to actually at the coffee to the pace

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.420 
to actually at the coffee to the pace
that<00:07:24.660> you<00:07:24.810> just<00:07:24.990> made<00:07:25.230> you<00:07:25.860> see<00:07:26.070> it's<00:07:26.310> gonna

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.430 
that you just made you see it's gonna

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:28.470 
make that froth on top of it it's gonna

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.320 
make that froth on top of it it's gonna
make<00:07:28.680> it<00:07:28.800> thicker<00:07:29.040> it's<00:07:29.670> a<00:07:29.850> little<00:07:30.090> froth

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:30.330 
make it thicker it's a little froth

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.210 
make it thicker it's a little froth
that's<00:07:30.750> main<00:07:31.080> ingredient<00:07:31.740> of<00:07:31.800> how<00:07:31.950> to<00:07:32.010> make

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 
that's main ingredient of how to make

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.460 
that's main ingredient of how to make
goo<00:07:32.400> Cuban<00:07:32.820> coffee<00:07:33.030> has<00:07:33.450> to<00:07:33.600> make<00:07:33.840> that<00:07:33.870> froth

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:34.470 
goo Cuban coffee has to make that froth

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.620 
goo Cuban coffee has to make that froth
right<00:07:34.830> there<00:07:35.100> the<00:07:35.610> more<00:07:35.820> froth<00:07:36.150> the<00:07:36.420> more

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:36.630 
right there the more froth the more

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.110 
right there the more froth the more
sugar<00:07:36.810> you<00:07:36.960> have<00:07:37.080> to<00:07:37.350> add<00:07:37.670> and<00:07:38.670> the<00:07:38.820> stronger

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 
sugar you have to add and the stronger

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.900 
sugar you have to add and the stronger
it<00:07:39.240> is<00:07:39.510> so<00:07:40.410> you<00:07:40.860> mix<00:07:41.040> it<00:07:41.220> up<00:07:41.280> completely<00:07:41.490> and

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:41.910 
it is so you mix it up completely and

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.510 
it is so you mix it up completely and
this<00:07:42.300> is<00:07:42.540> the<00:07:42.720> final<00:07:43.080> product<00:07:43.320> right<00:07:43.620> here<00:07:43.680> you

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 
this is the final product right here you

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.580
