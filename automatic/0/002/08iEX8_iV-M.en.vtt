00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 ah 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:27.460
 I 'm remembered today for teaching you 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.099
 how to draw game pages 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.579
 so come on you will need a 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.620
 any support and a notebook 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.940
 first you will get your pencil 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.100
 and will lightly pass over your sheet 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.920
 Do not worry, we'll improve this. 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.290
 after 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.860
 second step was time with your 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.860
 fingers 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:58.799
 Step 3: Drawing a broken man 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.799
 I do not mind, I do not know how to draw 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.570
 You wrote back, and neither of the 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.570
 sides 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.490
 after having made several on 11 11 11 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.490
 11 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:49.030
 you rip your leaf and the maximum too 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:02:01.630
 well if necessary with a lot of wrist is day 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:02:05.670
 back and develops in our time 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.670
 not to seem like such a fake 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:17.010
 after saying that he knows how to reach 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.010
 campaign will look more or less like this 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.580
 not to the court 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.480
 so this was the art attack snider of 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.510
 shots are not today 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.620
 so that was the strong attack of team b 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.739
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.630

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.630
 night such 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.569
 I am 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.680
