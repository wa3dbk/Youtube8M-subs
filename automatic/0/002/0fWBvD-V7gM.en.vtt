00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
now let's comment out these hard-coded

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.520 
now let's comment out these hard-coded
links

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.410 

and<00:01:11.530> save<00:01:12.280> that<00:01:12.520> and<00:01:12.759> now<00:01:12.909> we<00:01:12.970> need<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.210> get

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
and save that and now we need to get

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.830 
and save that and now we need to get
into<00:01:13.659> the<00:01:13.810> main<00:01:14.229> nav<00:01:14.670> function<00:01:15.670> so<00:01:16.180> we<00:01:16.630> need<00:01:16.780> to

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
into the main nav function so we need to

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.749 
into the main nav function so we need to
get<00:01:16.990> into<00:01:17.170> that<00:01:17.500> and<00:01:17.890> that<00:01:17.950> would<00:01:18.220> be<00:01:18.340> in<00:01:18.549> the

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
get into that and that would be in the

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.649 
get into that and that would be in the
template<00:01:19.770> dot<00:01:20.770> PHP<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:21.970> functions<00:01:22.390> folder

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
template dot PHP of the functions folder

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:32.929 
template dot PHP of the functions folder
let's<00:01:23.590> change<00:01:23.829> this<00:01:24.009> to<00:01:24.070> navigation

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.999 

and<00:01:33.509> we're<00:01:33.869> gonna<00:01:33.960> skip<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> selected<00:01:34.799> part

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
and we're gonna skip the selected part

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.080 
and we're gonna skip the selected part
for<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.249> moment<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.299> let's<00:01:37.170> see<00:01:37.969> for<00:01:38.969> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
for the moment and let's see for the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.240 
for the moment and let's see for the
href<00:01:39.479> property<00:01:40.969> gonna<00:01:41.969> be<00:01:42.060> doing<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.600> URL

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.090 

label<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.399> stay<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.729> same

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
label can stay the same

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.440 
label can stay the same
now<00:01:50.100> select<00:01:50.549> it's<00:01:50.880> gonna<00:01:51.030> be<00:01:51.179> a<00:01:51.209> little<00:01:51.359> bit

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.730 
now select it's gonna be a little bit
different<00:01:51.750> because<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:51.990> don't<00:01:52.229> have<00:01:52.319> a<00:01:52.380> slug

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
pages table to check against it now

now let's just function and we'll just

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:37.390 
now let's just function and we'll just
call<00:02:25.410> this

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:49.240 

and<00:02:38.400> we're<00:02:38.730> gonna<00:02:38.819> need<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.209> DBC<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:45.950> URL

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
I'll explain what I'm gonna attempt here

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.809 
I'll explain what I'm gonna attempt here
and<00:02:51.780> what<00:02:51.900> we're<00:02:52.019> gonna<00:02:52.110> do<00:02:52.409> is<00:02:52.739> we're<00:02:53.700> gonna

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.660 
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
kind<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.090> dissect<00:02:55.610> this<00:02:56.610> URL<00:02:58.069> that's<00:02:59.069> saved<00:02:59.430> in

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
kind of dissect this URL that's saved in

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.949 
kind of dissect this URL that's saved in
the<00:02:59.790> navigation<00:03:00.540> table<00:03:00.989> okay<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.659> I'm<00:03:03.659> kind

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
the navigation table okay and I'm kind

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.420 
the navigation table okay and I'm kind
of<00:03:04.019> making<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.349> up<00:03:04.530> as<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:04.829> go<00:03:04.859> so<00:03:07.250> you<00:03:08.250> know<00:03:08.310> I

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
of making this up as I go so you know I

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.119 
of making this up as I go so you know I
often<00:03:08.670> do<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:09.150> because<00:03:09.569> I<00:03:09.840> think<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.290> gives

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
often do this because I think it gives

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.149 
often do this because I think it gives
you<00:03:11.190> an<00:03:11.280> insight<00:03:11.579> into<00:03:11.640> how<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.980> kind<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.040> learn

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
you an insight into how to kind of learn

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.759 
you an insight into how to kind of learn
how<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.370> tackle<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.849> problem<00:03:15.500> because<00:03:16.500> there's

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
how to tackle a problem because there's

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.339 
how to tackle a problem because there's
you<00:03:17.099> know<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.220> billion<00:03:17.459> different<00:03:17.700> ways<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.359> do

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
you know a billion different ways to do

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.949 
you know a billion different ways to do
one<00:03:19.620> thing<00:03:20.120> when<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.239> comes<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.569> programming

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
one thing when it comes to programming

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.809 
one thing when it comes to programming
so<00:03:22.739> my<00:03:23.099> first<00:03:23.370> thought<00:03:23.639> is<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:24.239> we<00:03:24.900> need<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:25.230> you

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
so my first thought is is we need to you

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.470 
so my first thought is is we need to you
get<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:27.090> slug<00:03:27.510> at<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.440> end<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.889> the<00:03:29.129> URL<00:03:29.579> what

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
get the slug at the end of the URL what

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.819 
get the slug at the end of the URL what
I'm<00:03:30.599> thinking<00:03:30.989> is<00:03:31.139> is<00:03:31.379> we<00:03:31.590> can<00:03:31.920> detect<00:03:33.829> where

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
I'm thinking is is we can detect where

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.069 
I'm thinking is is we can detect where
the<00:03:35.549> last<00:03:35.879> slash<00:03:36.560> is<00:03:37.560> in<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.639> URL<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.329> then

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
the last slash is in the URL and then

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.740 
the last slash is in the URL and then
remove<00:03:40.769> everything<00:03:41.609> either<00:03:42.120> either<00:03:42.359> remove

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
remove everything either either remove

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.330 
remove everything either either remove
everything<00:03:42.989> before<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:43.620> or<00:03:43.799> extract

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
everything before it or extract

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.879 
everything before it or extract
everything<00:03:44.669> after<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.329> and<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:46.410> my<00:03:46.560> thinking

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
everything after it and so my thinking

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.809 
everything after it and so my thinking
is<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.069> would<00:03:47.370> return<00:03:47.699> the<00:03:48.060> slug<00:03:49.669> so<00:03:50.669> let's

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
is that would return the slug so let's

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.119 
is that would return the slug so let's
give<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.150> whirl<00:03:51.329> we're<00:03:51.629> gonna<00:03:51.720> first<00:03:52.470> find

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
give that a whirl we're gonna first find

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.259 
give that a whirl we're gonna first find
the<00:03:53.849> very<00:03:54.120> last<00:03:54.389> occurrence<00:03:54.989> of<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:56.280> slash<00:03:56.579> so

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
the very last occurrence of the slash so

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.720 
the very last occurrence of the slash so
we're<00:03:57.419> gonna<00:03:57.510> do<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:57.840> it's<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:58.829> string<00:03:59.220> position

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
we're gonna do a it's a string position

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.210 
we're gonna do a it's a string position
function<00:04:00.120> of<00:04:00.209> its<00:04:00.440> string<00:04:01.440> reverse

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
function of its string reverse

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:11.830 
function of its string reverse
so<00:04:02.940> let's<00:04:03.090> first<00:04:03.329> get<00:04:03.599> that<00:04:03.629> position

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.990 

so<00:04:12.230> I<00:04:12.290> will<00:04:12.410> do<00:04:12.500> position<00:04:12.980> equals<00:04:13.690> string<00:04:14.690> our

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.030 

position<00:04:20.000> and<00:04:20.570> our<00:04:20.870> properties<00:04:21.410> are<00:04:21.440> the

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
position and our properties are the

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.890 
position and our properties are the
needle<00:04:22.639> in<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:22.790> haystack<00:04:22.970> or<00:04:23.240> paste<00:04:23.600> I<00:04:23.720> can

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
needle in the haystack or paste I can

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.350 
needle in the haystack or paste I can
needle<00:04:24.169> sorry<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.530> other<00:04:24.650> way<00:04:24.740> around

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
needle sorry the other way around

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:36.670 
needle sorry the other way around
so<00:04:26.360> haystack<00:04:26.900> being<00:04:27.230> the<00:04:27.350> URL<00:04:30.639> and<00:04:31.639> needle<00:04:35.680> be

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
so haystack being the URL and needle be

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:48.629 
so haystack being the URL and needle be
the<00:04:36.860> slash<00:04:37.130> character<00:04:41.020> will<00:04:42.020> close<00:04:42.290> that<00:04:46.870> then

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
the slash character will close that then

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.620 
the slash character will close that then
now<00:04:49.639> we<00:04:49.700> got<00:04:49.880> to<00:04:49.970> do<00:04:50.120> something<00:04:50.330> with<00:04:50.600> that

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
now we got to do something with that

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.110 
now we got to do something with that
information<00:04:51.520> so<00:04:52.520> now<00:04:52.669> we're<00:04:52.790> going<00:04:52.880> to<00:04:52.940> do

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
information so now we're going to do

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.860 
information so now we're going to do
what's<00:04:53.720> called<00:04:53.900> the<00:04:54.080> substring<00:04:54.770> function<00:04:55.040> and

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
what's called the substring function and

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.740 
what's called the substring function and
PHP<00:04:56.919> and<00:04:57.919> that's<00:04:58.430> gonna<00:04:58.580> allow<00:04:58.700> us<00:04:58.820> to<00:04:59.240> pretty

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
PHP and that's gonna allow us to pretty

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.930 
PHP and that's gonna allow us to pretty
pretty<00:04:59.930> much<00:05:00.080> extract<00:05:00.729> part<00:05:01.729> of<00:05:01.820> a<00:05:01.910> string<00:05:02.470> and

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
pretty much extract part of a string and

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.440 
pretty much extract part of a string and
do<00:05:04.940> it<00:05:05.120> from<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.900> certain<00:05:06.380> position<00:05:07.210> so<00:05:08.210> we'll

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
do it from a certain position so we'll

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:16.150 
do it from a certain position so we'll
call<00:05:08.900> this<00:05:09.110> slug<00:05:11.979> equals<00:05:12.979> then<00:05:13.370> sub<00:05:14.740> string<00:05:15.740> or

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
call this slug equals then sub string or

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.440 
call this slug equals then sub string or
STR<00:05:17.770> and<00:05:18.770> here's<00:05:19.610> our<00:05:19.700> parameters<00:05:20.210> we<00:05:20.330> have

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
STR and here's our parameters we have

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.940 
STR and here's our parameters we have
the<00:05:20.539> string<00:05:20.840> which<00:05:21.020> is<00:05:21.050> most<00:05:21.320> important<00:05:21.770> and

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
the string which is most important and

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.110 
the string which is most important and
then<00:05:22.340> we<00:05:22.760> have<00:05:22.910> start<00:05:23.450> and<00:05:24.640> then<00:05:25.640> we<00:05:25.729> also<00:05:25.910> have

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
then we have start and then we also have

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.440 
then we have start and then we also have
the<00:05:26.210> option<00:05:26.539> of<00:05:26.660> length<00:05:27.880> in<00:05:28.880> this<00:05:29.060> case<00:05:29.270> we're

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
the option of length in this case we're

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.140 
the option of length in this case we're
just<00:05:29.479> going<00:05:29.690> to<00:05:29.720> use<00:05:29.780> start<00:05:30.640> so<00:05:31.640> the<00:05:31.760> string<00:05:32.030> of

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
just going to use start so the string of

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.840 
just going to use start so the string of
course<00:05:32.390> is<00:05:32.539> going<00:05:32.660> to<00:05:32.720> be<00:05:32.780> URL<00:05:36.310> and<00:05:37.310> the

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
course is going to be URL and the

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.040 
course is going to be URL and the
starting<00:05:38.180> position<00:05:38.510> will<00:05:38.630> be<00:05:38.720> what<00:05:38.930> was

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
starting position will be what was

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.100 
starting position will be what was
returned<00:05:39.380> from<00:05:39.860> the<00:05:39.979> line<00:05:40.160> above<00:05:40.430> and<00:05:40.700> the

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
returned from the line above and the

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:50.050 
returned from the line above and the
string<00:05:42.110> reverse<00:05:42.440> position<00:05:42.919> function

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:06:01.870

and take advantage of that and echo out

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:47.170 
and take advantage of that and echo out
slug<00:06:43.780> so<00:06:44.780> uh<00:06:44.810> we'll<00:06:45.500> just<00:06:45.820> see<00:06:46.820> if<00:06:46.850> this<00:06:47.060> even

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
slug so uh we'll just see if this even

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:55.320 
slug so uh we'll just see if this even
worked<00:06:49.150> save<00:06:50.150> that<00:06:50.450> over<00:06:51.440> to<00:06:51.560> our<00:06:51.590> page<00:06:51.890> and

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.380 

refresh<00:06:57.940> look<00:06:58.940> at<00:06:59.030> that

00:06:59.380 --> 00:06:59.390 
refresh look at that

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:04.330 
refresh look at that
there<00:07:00.320> it<00:07:00.410> is<00:07:00.710> so<00:07:01.100> we<00:07:01.160> have<00:07:01.280> slash<00:07:01.610> home<00:07:02.710> now<00:07:03.710> we

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.340 
there it is so we have slash home now we

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.230 
there it is so we have slash home now we
don't<00:07:04.550> actually<00:07:04.730> want<00:07:04.880> the<00:07:05.150> slash<00:07:05.390> there<00:07:07.240> so

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 
don't actually want the slash there so

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.920 
don't actually want the slash there so
let's<00:07:08.930> go<00:07:09.110> back<00:07:09.140> really<00:07:09.590> quick<00:07:09.940> and<00:07:10.940> to<00:07:11.720> our

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
let's go back really quick and to our

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:17.260 
let's go back really quick and to our
sandbox<00:07:12.560> and<00:07:13.550> we're<00:07:13.970> gonna<00:07:14.060> do<00:07:16.090> substrate<00:07:17.090> but

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.270 
sandbox and we're gonna do substrate but

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.180 
sandbox and we're gonna do substrate but
then<00:07:17.420> it's<00:07:17.540> going<00:07:17.630> to<00:07:17.690> be<00:07:17.920> position<00:07:19.240> +1

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.190 
then it's going to be position +1

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.740 
then it's going to be position +1
because<00:07:22.190> the<00:07:22.550> position<00:07:22.970> being<00:07:23.150> returned<00:07:23.570> is

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:23.750 
because the position being returned is

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.950 
because the position being returned is
the<00:07:23.900> actual<00:07:24.260> position<00:07:24.410> of<00:07:24.800> the<00:07:25.120> slash<00:07:26.120> so

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 
the actual position of the slash so

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.330 
the actual position of the slash so
that's<00:07:27.080> going<00:07:27.230> to<00:07:27.290> be<00:07:27.410> included<00:07:28.100> in<00:07:28.220> our

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:28.340 
that's going to be included in our

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.670 
that's going to be included in our
substring<00:07:28.900> so<00:07:29.900> let's<00:07:30.020> save<00:07:30.200> this<00:07:30.380> and<00:07:30.440> we'll

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:30.680 
substring so let's save this and we'll

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:37.810 
substring so let's save this and we'll
try<00:07:30.860> it<00:07:30.890> again<00:07:33.160> refresh<00:07:36.010> awesome<00:07:37.010> so<00:07:37.370> now<00:07:37.400> what

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:37.820 
try it again refresh awesome so now what

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.440 
try it again refresh awesome so now what
we<00:07:37.910> can<00:07:38.060> do<00:07:38.210> is<00:07:38.450> hop<00:07:38.630> back<00:07:38.810> over<00:07:38.960> to<00:07:39.260> obtain<00:07:39.560> a--

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:40.450 
we can do is hop back over to obtain a--

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.990 
we can do is hop back over to obtain a--
put<00:07:41.450> a<00:07:41.480> template<00:07:41.900> dot<00:07:42.050> PHP<00:07:42.730> go<00:07:43.730> ahead<00:07:43.910> and
