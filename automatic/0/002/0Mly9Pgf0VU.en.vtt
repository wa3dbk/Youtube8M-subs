00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.570
 hello all greetings from mobile world 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.280
 barcelona congress from the stand of the 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.619
 axis where we want to present you the 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.930
 optimus that on the phone that will be the 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.450
 flagship of the company during 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.060
 less the first semester since 2013 it 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.680
 it's about a monoblock phone with a 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.329
 very careful design that follows the line 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.430
 aesthetic that the terminals already had 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.410
 of the axis in recent years thanks to 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.030
 collaborations for example purchased or at 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.170
 own company design of the 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.010
 own design studies of the 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.059
 company it is a telephone with 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.699
 8.45 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.960
 millimeters thick and it is also a 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.149
 phone with a screen of 4.7 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.710
 inches as we can see is a 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.050
 screen with very sharp colors 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.170
 you see this perfectly because it is 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.719
 the one that uses ips plus technology 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.460
 this ips plus technology what we 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.190
 allows to be more vivid colors but 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.229
 is that it also incorporates an advance of lg 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.969
 that is called 0 cap d'agde that what 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:07.630
 does is reduce the air layers between 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.430
 the touch panel and the lcd panel this makes 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.290
 that the tactile response is much more 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.140
 immediate and that colors are more 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.300
 natural 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.070
 by suppressing these layers of air 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.370
 what else is I can tell you then that 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.050
 It also has a snapdragon processor 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.850
 quad core this makes it a 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.980
 really powerful phone with a 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.130
 ability to respond to cancer in addition 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.040
 we have things like this functionality 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.840
 which is called that is what allows us 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.880
 decide the level of transparency and 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.740
 play with the video layer size 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.360
 or present yourself now using this 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.100
 multimedia table some of the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.590
 main functionalities of this lg 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.840
 optimus that like for example your light 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.360
 that allows us to be life news light 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.980
 it's a very good representation of the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.570
 multitasking capability of this phone 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.580
 because we can be using by 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.310
 example a messaging program 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.930
 and super put a layer of videos play 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.640
 with the size of this layer and with the 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.560
 transparency in this way we do not lose 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.260
 the reproduction of videos but we can 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.940
 simultanear with messaging program 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.250
 the same with the calendar we can 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.050
 do it also with the notebook that 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.660
 we also have to offer with this 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.160
 for example dual screen play that we 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.320
 basically serves to use the 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.090
 phone as multimedia center we send 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.630
 from the terminal itself a lady in 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.100
 a video signal to our smrtv and with 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.350
 this video signal 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.550
 what we do is leave it in 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.900
 reproduction within one 's own 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.940
 television and meanwhile we 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.150
 we can for example consult the mail 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.150
 electronic 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.220
 to see the path 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.340
 What else do we have, for example? 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.340
 we have the csu that is live your min 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.620
 that slide sum screen and it allows us 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.340
 while we are playing video 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.440
 zoom without stopping playback or 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.840
 we can see perfectly the play 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.580
 repeated if it was triple if it was not triple 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.390
 if it was offside if it was not out 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.070
 of the game 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.480
 we can really perceive all the 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:13.430
 Favorite actress details finally for 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.830
 highlight we have a 3 camera 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.360
 megapixels but it's not just a camera 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.060
 of 3 megapixels since this phone 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.460
 thanks to that processing ability can 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.790
 do things like record video and take out 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.799
 photos simultaneously 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.799
 This is going to see right now to see 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.810
 we put the terminal in video mode 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.630
 we started to record and here it appears 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.430
 a small option to take pictures of 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.050
 simultaneous way as we see the 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.840
 reproduction does not stop but yes that 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.640
 is taking the instances these would be 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.430
 some of the main functions that 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.810
 offers us this lg optimus that will be 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.330
 available in the Spanish market in 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.100
 spring and that is for sale with a 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.100
 649 free price 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.410
 two 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.410
 etc 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.900
 with other of the imagination the printer 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.049
 we have the photograph 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.049
 again 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.349
 three hours is transferred 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.750
 the coordination of the hand 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.199
 I would not leave 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.550
 why 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.720
 How are you
