well<00:00:05.190> we<00:00:05.339> got<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.670> point<00:00:05.790> that<00:00:05.940> we<00:00:06.029> need<00:00:06.060> to

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
well we got to the point that we need to

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.419 
well we got to the point that we need to
check<00:00:06.450> our<00:00:06.600> ph<00:00:07.049> level<00:00:07.440> on<00:00:07.620> our<00:00:07.680> soil

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429
