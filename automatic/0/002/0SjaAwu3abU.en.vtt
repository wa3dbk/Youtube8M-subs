it's<00:00:44.060> like<00:00:44.240> the<00:00:44.450> glass<00:00:44.660> is<00:00:45.020> just<00:00:45.050> no<00:00:45.830> glasses<00:00:46.070> I

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
it's like the glass is just no glasses I

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.370 
it's like the glass is just no glasses I
think<00:00:47.120> actually<00:00:47.240> it's<00:00:47.540> better<00:00:47.930> on<00:00:47.990> the<00:00:48.200> glass

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
think actually it's better on the glass

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.370 
think actually it's better on the glass
because<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:48.890> glasses<00:00:49.250> are<00:00:49.370> very<00:00:50.230> like<00:00:51.230> you're

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
because the glasses are very like you're

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.090 
because the glasses are very like you're
just<00:00:51.740> watching<00:00:51.950> layers<00:00:53.320> but<00:00:54.320> this<00:00:54.440> doesn't

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
just watching layers but this doesn't

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.190 
just watching layers but this doesn't
feel<00:00:55.160> like<00:00:55.220> they<00:00:55.490> are<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:55.880> much

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
really impressive I thought the 3d would

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.880 
really impressive I thought the 3d would
take<00:01:12.860> away<00:01:13.100> from<00:01:13.130> enough<00:01:13.960> from<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.290> graphics

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
take away from enough from the graphics

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:24.670 
take away from enough from the graphics
but<00:01:16.070> it<00:01:16.190> really<00:01:16.340> doesn't<00:01:16.610> at<00:01:16.820> all<00:01:23.530> it<00:01:24.530> was
