00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
field I used to think till I did my
workshop<00:06:37.810> with<00:06:37.960> Capra<00:06:38.410> I<00:06:38.440> used<00:06:38.620> to<00:06:38.680> think

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
movies are easy but I think even though

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820 
learned to swim until very simple if I

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.700 
learned to swim until very simple if I
wanted<00:06:49.030> nice<00:06:49.150> women<00:06:49.510> to<00:06:49.600> do<00:06:49.720> society<00:06:50.530> mother
