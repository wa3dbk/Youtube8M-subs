00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
thought the villain was intriguing

thought the villain was intriguing
enough<00:01:08.380> story<00:01:09.160> was<00:01:09.340> intriguing<00:01:09.700> enough<00:01:10.060> but

enough story was intriguing enough but

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.050 
enough story was intriguing enough but
here<00:01:10.690> it<00:01:10.840> was<00:01:10.930> just<00:01:11.140> a<00:01:11.200> simple<00:01:11.590> chess<00:01:12.580> match

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
here it was just a simple chess match

here it was just a simple chess match
villain<00:01:13.810> where<00:01:14.080> he's<00:01:14.260> like<00:01:14.410> I'm<00:01:14.590> thinking<00:01:14.980> two

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.930 
villain where he's like I'm thinking two
moves<00:01:15.610> ahead<00:01:15.700> oh<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:17.590> not<00:01:17.770> logical<00:01:18.460> type<00:01:18.820> of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
moves ahead oh I'm not logical type of

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.250 
moves ahead oh I'm not logical type of
thing<00:01:19.150> um<00:01:19.480> so<00:01:19.920> he's<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:21.070> very<00:01:21.460> I<00:01:22.080> don't<00:01:23.080> know<00:01:23.140> at

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
thing um so he's a very I don't know at

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.980 
thing um so he's a very I don't know at
least<00:01:23.320> how<00:01:23.700> Anarchy<00:01:24.700> was<00:01:24.850> portrayed<00:01:25.210> here<00:01:25.720> um

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
least how Anarchy was portrayed here um

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.250 
least how Anarchy was portrayed here um
he<00:01:26.440> was<00:01:26.590> just<00:01:27.430> very<00:01:27.550> simple<00:01:28.120> villain<00:01:28.510> and<00:01:29.140> then

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
he was just very simple villain and then

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.280 
he was just very simple villain and then
the<00:01:29.380> artist<00:01:29.830> villains<00:01:30.430> kind<00:01:30.730> of<00:01:30.880> or<00:01:31.300> kitty<00:01:32.020> I

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
the artist villains kind of or kitty I

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.290 
the artist villains kind of or kitty I
would<00:01:32.560> say<00:01:32.770> they<00:01:33.130> they<00:01:33.520> were<00:01:33.670> just<00:01:33.820> fillers

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
would say they they were just fillers

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.210 
would say they they were just fillers
there<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:35.170> know<00:01:35.290> they<00:01:35.470> were<00:01:35.530> needed<00:01:36.070> at<00:01:36.190> all

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
there you know they were needed at all

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.270 
there you know they were needed at all
um<00:01:36.880> I<00:01:37.720> guess<00:01:38.230> that<00:01:38.410> was<00:01:38.470> more<00:01:38.650> for<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:38.950> comedic

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
um I guess that was more for the comedic

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.280 
um I guess that was more for the comedic
relief<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.880> have<00:01:40.000> those<00:01:40.330> two<00:01:40.540> villains<00:01:40.960> but

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
relief to have those two villains but

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.720 
relief to have those two villains but
they<00:01:41.710> weren't<00:01:41.860> really<00:01:42.100> needed<00:01:42.520> in<00:01:42.610> this

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
they weren't really needed in this

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.200 
they weren't really needed in this
episode<00:01:43.060> um<00:01:43.510> I<00:01:44.380> was<00:01:45.010> somewhat<00:01:45.580> intrigued<00:01:46.030> by

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
episode um I was somewhat intrigued by

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.540 
episode um I was somewhat intrigued by
katana<00:01:46.600> story<00:01:47.080> trying<00:01:47.440> to<00:01:47.530> figure<00:01:47.740> out<00:01:47.830> who

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
katana story trying to figure out who

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.060 
katana story trying to figure out who
Bruce's<00:01:49.120> and<00:01:49.450> hopefully<00:01:49.870> have<00:01:50.080> that<00:01:50.380> team

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
Bruce's and hopefully have that team

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.100 
Bruce's and hopefully have that team
dynamic<00:01:51.700> I<00:01:51.910> think<00:01:52.660> that's<00:01:52.810> kind<00:01:53.050> of

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
dynamic I think that's kind of

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.950 
dynamic I think that's kind of
interesting<00:01:53.410> to<00:01:54.070> see<00:01:54.520> in<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.700> future<00:01:54.960> with

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
interesting to see in the future with

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.340 
interesting to see in the future with
that<00:01:56.140> character<00:01:56.620> am<00:01:56.980> I<00:01:57.220> really<00:01:57.580> do<00:01:58.060> I<00:01:58.350> want

katana figure it all out and you do I

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.240

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250

with<00:02:10.539> all<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.720> characters<00:02:11.230> here<00:02:11.410> I<00:02:11.440> think<00:02:11.620> the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
with all the characters here I think the

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.270 
with all the characters here I think the
only<00:02:11.920> character<00:02:12.489> we<00:02:13.319> know<00:02:14.319> somewhat<00:02:14.770> bout<00:02:15.010> or

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
only character we know somewhat bout or

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.490 
only character we know somewhat bout or
you<00:02:15.459> know<00:02:15.549> Batman's<00:02:15.969> Batman<00:02:16.900> we<00:02:17.200> know<00:02:17.349> who

Batman is um and then Alfred
uh<00:02:20.740> we<00:02:21.490> I<00:02:21.850> think<00:02:22.180> we<00:02:22.240> got<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.390> good<00:02:22.480> enough<00:02:22.720> back

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
uh we I think we got a good enough back

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.680 
uh we I think we got a good enough back
story<00:02:23.470> with<00:02:23.650> him<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:24.190> be<00:02:24.520> somewhat<00:02:25.270> intrigued

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
story with him to be somewhat intrigued

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.510 
story with him to be somewhat intrigued
but<00:02:25.930> katana<00:02:26.230> we<00:02:26.500> don't<00:02:26.710> really<00:02:26.890> know<00:02:27.160> much

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
but katana we don't really know much

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.160 
but katana we don't really know much
much<00:02:27.850> about<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.120> think<00:02:28.360> we<00:02:28.480> need<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:28.720> get<00:02:28.840> really

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
much about I think we need to get really

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.080 
much about I think we need to get really
maybe<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.650> whole<00:02:29.800> episode<00:02:29.980> just<00:02:30.370> dedicate<00:02:30.970> on

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
maybe a whole episode just dedicate on

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.280 
maybe a whole episode just dedicate on
her<00:02:31.270> character<00:02:31.690> that<00:02:31.870> white<00:02:31.990> we're

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
her character that white we're

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.770 
her character that white we're
interested<00:02:32.710> or<00:02:33.040> becoming<00:02:33.460> a<00:02:33.610> sidekick<00:02:34.120> I

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
interested or becoming a sidekick I

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.090 
interested or becoming a sidekick I
think<00:02:35.200> that's<00:02:35.350> something<00:02:35.470> they<00:02:35.680> really<00:02:35.800> need

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
think that's something they really need

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.590 
think that's something they really need
to<00:02:36.190> do<00:02:36.310> with<00:02:36.460> the<00:02:36.580> show<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:37.120> have<00:02:37.420> some

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
to do with the show is have some

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.050 
to do with the show is have some
character<00:02:37.990> development<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:39.220> know<00:02:39.850> it's<00:02:40.030> only

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
character development I know it's only

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.060 
character development I know it's only
been<00:02:40.210> three<00:02:40.450> episodes<00:02:40.930> but<00:02:41.110> i<00:02:41.170> think<00:02:41.440> is<00:02:42.010> the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
been three episodes but i think is the

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.010 
been three episodes but i think is the
future<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.910> show<00:02:43.150> I<00:02:43.180> think<00:02:43.540> really<00:02:43.720> needs

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
future of the show I think really needs

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.120 
future of the show I think really needs
that<00:02:44.170> for<00:02:44.590> making<00:02:45.460> us<00:02:46.210> fans<00:02:46.660> older<00:02:47.200> fans<00:02:47.410> more

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
that for making us fans older fans more

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.940 
that for making us fans older fans more
treat<00:02:48.430> with<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.640> show<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:50.410> art<00:02:50.560> was<00:02:50.740> still

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
treat with the show the art was still

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.370 
treat with the show the art was still
very<00:02:50.980> simple<00:02:51.610> there<00:02:52.240> is<00:02:52.330> really<00:02:52.660> crazy<00:02:52.960> scene

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
very simple there is really crazy scene

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.630 
very simple there is really crazy scene
with<00:02:53.710> the<00:02:54.640> sky<00:02:54.910> ramps<00:02:55.540> in<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:57.010> in<00:02:57.460> this

with the sky ramps in this in this
episode<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.660> could<00:02:58.780> have<00:02:58.870> been<00:02:58.960> really

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
episode and it could have been really

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.710 
episode and it could have been really
detailed<00:02:59.800> but<00:03:00.130> there<00:03:00.790> is<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:00.940> lot<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.210> detailed

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
narrow part of the picture but then the

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.590 
narrow part of the picture but then the
background<00:03:06.190> was<00:03:06.370> just<00:03:06.580> very<00:03:06.760> simple<00:03:07.270> and<00:03:07.480> not

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
background was just very simple and not
