00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.779
 hello friends in this tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:09.080
 teach how to plant tomato seeds 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.719
 we will need a cherry tomato here yo 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.919
 I 've cut it in half a knife 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.880
 two sheets of paper 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:20.540
 then I with the sheets of paper 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.990
 folded and I left about five 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.990
 centimeters 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.530
 to fold it again and that's how I've been 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.490
 stayed with 2 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.600
 the eyes 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.079
 then we will take 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.530
 the tomato we will break it in half 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:45.079
 OK 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:50.100
 that I already have it here we will open one 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:53.420
 we will take with the knife we ​​will press 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.810
 and we take everything 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.860
 the little seed 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.860
 already a lot out there 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.480
 well now we choose 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.990
 we open the jet 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.990
 a little 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.920
 and we will put 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.780
 like in an envelope first we put it like that 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.010
 uy 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.010
 but be careful not to fall 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.800
 now we take the little seeds 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.970
 we will crush a little bit so that the water 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.570
 leave faster 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.620
 all right 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.620
 now we open 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.210
 and we already have the seed 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.540
 where well clean now we take a 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.540
 cup 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.899
 any vessel, for example, can 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:14.290
 use any one we will take it by 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:16.760
 here we will take this piece of napkin 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.540
 we will do it 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.349
 no no need to we stand one 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.349
 little bit more 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.760
 the law now we will put it up 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:36.080
 the seeds we will leave a little like 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.740
 very strong and you see it stays stuck 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.310
 OK 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.310
 A) Yes 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.830
 A) Yes 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:08.810
 ok now we take it and in our three 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.940
 fingers of the hand 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:16.750
 we'll put it here and we'll go around 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.520
 according to depends on 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.740
 how wide the glass 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.620
 you see here I have to enter more or 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.350
 less easy to get to the bottom I would 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.950
 sing a little bit here you see that it is 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:34.660
 this here of envelopes that I can not go then 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.660
 he succeeded 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.400
 like two zeros 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.990
 iron 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.130
 with the little seed 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.130
 I licked everything done 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.780
 I open a little 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.600
 the moment in the soho 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.600
 okay now 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.090
 I'll take another paper 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:23.510
 we will put it as before I will talk more or 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:27.330
 less and I'll leave about 5 centimeters 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:30.889
 then I will 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.889
 well now I come here 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.800
 and the best 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:41.520
 8 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:45.750
 I know it's a paper and this error is 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.610
 more closed without seeds I will do it more 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.990
 strong because it will go in between then 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.990
 it has to go more closed 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.900
 come to the bottom 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:10.589
 well in the background live 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:14.879
 and here you see how the seeds are 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:18.050
 here we have one here we have two here 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:21.650
 they have us and here another voucher 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:25.800
 then what we will do here 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:28.890
 and as you see I have planted here too 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.320
 from the same method palm seeds 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:35.040
 I have one 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:40.180
 two and three seeds as you see is is 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:43.090
 putting wet and if you buy the 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.539
 the one left from the tree as for example 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.550
 this time it is wetter and that 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:51.789
 shortly it is going to shell 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.960
 this one and the roots and the center will come out 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:59.080
 little will start going out broke when 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:02.710
 burst will come out of the glass about 15 or 20 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.770
 we will take them out centimeters and then others 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:09.310
 years worth and then there 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:12.190
 I also have another one also planted with 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:17.580
 tomato tomato seeds yesterday we have 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:19.620
 three here 45 here another 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:23.610
 but as you see here I have been left 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:26.550
 better because one more glass 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:29.490
 rounder 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.370
 It is a glass that is rounder than the other and 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:35.160
 the rounder the better does not have to be 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.750
 not high but more or less small 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.100
 well here it's over at the real minute 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.100
 until another day
