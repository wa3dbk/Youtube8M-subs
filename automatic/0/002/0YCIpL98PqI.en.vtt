by<00:01:47.050> this<00:01:47.200> piece<00:01:47.500> of<00:01:47.650> artwork<00:01:47.950> this<00:01:48.729> came<00:01:48.909> from

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
by this piece of artwork this came from

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.430 
by this piece of artwork this came from
one<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.390> guys<00:01:49.540> on<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:49.750> animation<00:01:50.080> team

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440

one of the guys on the animation team
and<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:53.350> did<00:01:53.500> a<00:01:53.770> little<00:01:54.310> bit<00:01:54.460> of<00:01:54.490> backstory

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
and just did a little bit of backstory

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.490 
and just did a little bit of backstory
we<00:01:55.240> work<00:01:55.360> a<00:01:55.479> lot<00:01:55.509> of<00:01:55.690> late<00:01:55.840> hours<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:56.320> we<00:01:56.380> come

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
we work a lot of late hours and we come

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.700 
we work a lot of late hours and we come
up<00:01:56.680> with<00:01:56.830> some<00:01:57.119> alternate<00:01:58.119> ideas<00:01:58.810> for<00:01:59.500> the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
up with some alternate ideas for the

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.130 
up with some alternate ideas for the
cinematics<00:02:00.220> so<00:02:00.789> we<00:02:01.060> were<00:02:01.149> thinking<00:02:01.210> like<00:02:01.690> what

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
cinematics so we were thinking like what

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.440 
cinematics so we were thinking like what
a<00:02:02.170> trainer<00:02:02.470> was<00:02:02.770> so<00:02:02.950> badass<00:02:03.369> he<00:02:04.330> could

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
a trainer was so badass he could

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.690 
a trainer was so badass he could
headlock<00:02:04.780> a<00:02:04.810> hydralisk<00:02:05.320> and<00:02:05.530> drop<00:02:06.250> kick<00:02:06.490> as

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
headlock a hydralisk and drop kick as

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.249 
headlock a hydralisk and drop kick as

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.229 
ERG lane while nuke is going off in the
background<00:02:09.660> why<00:02:10.660> not<00:02:11.130> so<00:02:12.130> this<00:02:12.459> this<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.209> a

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239
