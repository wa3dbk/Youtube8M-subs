00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
it'll come up and then just kind of

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.349 
it'll come up and then just kind of
storage<00:02:22.340> your<00:02:22.459> hard<00:02:22.639> disk<00:02:24.730> up<00:02:25.730> says<00:02:26.180> it's

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
storage your hard disk up says it's

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.720 
storage your hard disk up says it's
corrupted<00:02:26.840> so<00:02:27.500> that's<00:02:27.650> why<00:02:27.889> it's<00:02:28.609> not<00:02:28.670> working

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
corrupted so that's why it's not working

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.670 
corrupted so that's why it's not working
too<00:02:29.150> well<00:02:29.180> any<00:02:29.780> press<00:02:29.959> ok<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:32.500> then<00:02:33.500> it

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
too well any press ok and then it

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.800 
too well any press ok and then it
restores<00:02:34.099> it<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.030> just<00:02:35.180> wait<00:02:35.359> about<00:02:35.660> a

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
restores it so you just wait about a

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.729 
restores it so you just wait about a
minute<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.560> half<00:02:36.590> two<00:02:37.010> minutes<00:02:37.569> and<00:02:38.739> then

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
minute and a half two minutes and then

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.860 
minute and a half two minutes and then
it<00:02:40.069> will<00:02:40.220> be<00:02:40.310> all<00:02:40.459> done<00:02:43.359> so<00:02:44.359> you<00:02:44.419> just<00:02:44.599> keep

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
it will be all done so you just keep

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.690 
it will be all done so you just keep
watching<00:02:45.349> it

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.050 

now<00:02:49.700> here's<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.510> thing<00:02:50.690> if<00:02:51.520> you<00:02:52.520> have<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.820> fat

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
now here's the thing if you have the fat

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.190 
now here's the thing if you have the fat
one<00:02:53.270> like<00:02:54.020> this<00:02:55.150> because<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.630> process<00:02:57.050> is

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
one like this because the process is

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
one like this because the process is
exactly<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.980> same<00:02:58.900> with<00:02:59.900> the<00:02:59.930> you<00:03:00.800> know<00:03:00.920> the

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
exactly the same with the you know the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
exactly the same with the you know the
manual<00:03:01.760> if<00:03:02.600> you<00:03:02.690> hold<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.020> down<00:03:03.200> twice<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.980> the

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
manual if you hold it down twice and the

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.710 
manual if you hold it down twice and the
anyway<00:03:05.530> same<00:03:06.530> thing<00:03:06.770> as<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:06.980> slim<00:03:07.220> so<00:03:07.600> if<00:03:08.600> you

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
anyway same thing as the slim so if you

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.680 
anyway same thing as the slim so if you
ever<00:03:08.810> run<00:03:08.930> into<00:03:09.230> problems<00:03:09.590> with<00:03:09.740> your<00:03:10.690> you
