00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 so the reasons for the monstrous plane crash 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.390
 under Shymkent last December 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.370
 steel instrument failure and wrong 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.630
 work altimeter today in 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.700
 Attorney General's Office announced 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.309
 Preliminary results of the investigation chepe 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.990
 which claimed twenty seven lives judging 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.240
 according to the data provided 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.970
 and audio recordings of the negotiations of the pilots 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.550
 aboard did not even understand what 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.420
 in a split second the plane will collide with 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.880
 the slope of a beard 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.949
 the pilots were sure that before the earth in that 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.080
 the moment was still a few hundred meters away and 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.189
 bart kept confident and declining 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.870
 Alexander Trukhachev 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.969
 about all the details the largest 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.420
 air crash in the history of Kazakhstan 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.190
 army military transport en 72 on 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.170
 which because of the camps Shymkent flew 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.539
 regional command officers south and 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.760
 country's border guards 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.620
 problems as it turned out were pursued with 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.079
 first flight minutes at first refused 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.539
 autopilot and the commander continued recruiting 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.699
 heights already in manual mode later still 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.739
 two and a half minutes main pilot 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.840
 For some reason, Rakhmetov handed over to Marat 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.649
 control of your aircraft 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.539
 assistant 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.790
 And this explained today in the prosecutor's office 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.890
 gross violation of transportation rules 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.510
 passengers 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.250
 autopilot failure was not 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.380
 the only problem in flight 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.630
 literally 10 seconds after 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.460
 the main pilot left the helm stopped 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.070
 work another important unit 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.049
 radio altimeter then something happened to 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.720
 baro metric and at long heights 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.869
 the device showed the distance to the ground with 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.920
 an error of 2000 meters crew body me 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.520
 continued flight 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.079
 when the AN-72 flew to the landing site 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.750
 Schengen airport dispatcher gave 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.850
 crew instructions calibrate barometer 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.130
 to match his testimony with 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.500
 real conditions consequence 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.570
 established that in the implementation 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.649
 landing 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.170
 the commander did not follow the instructions 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.870
 dispatcher about setting on 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.580
 barometric altitude of the world 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:58.070
 pressure of Shymkent airport as a result 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.270
 while decreasing show performance 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.390
 altimeter could have distortion from 385 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.310
 meters it all means that the crew when 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.830
 landing oriented on the instrument 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.350
 which did not show the correct height h 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.080
 in the conditions of the strongest fog to make out 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.360
 anything was almost impossible all 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.640
 Were sure that there are hundreds more 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.590
 meters first slope career which 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.110
 after a few seconds will break 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.810
 the plane saw one of the board mechanics 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.190
 his last cry was recorded 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.190
 onboard black box 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.710
 thanks to transcribed film to them 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.120
 investigators and managed to completely 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.640
 restore all circumstances 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.220
 last flight of an-72 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.200
 and today in the Prosecutor General's Office announced 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.680
 preliminary investigation results 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.980
 plane crash and the death of 27 people 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:56.660
 The first problems are onboard equipped 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.130
 airplanes this autopilot failure and 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.010
 radio altimeter 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:07.220
 malfunction of parametric devices

 height measurement 2 hr commander error 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.430
 crew while piloting the aircraft 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.420
 this is not turning on the system early 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.380
 land approach warnings 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.830

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.590
 why the crew did not fulfill the obligatory 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.660
 according to flight instructions requirements 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.760
 investigators have yet to figure out 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.950
 and to the law enforcement bodies of Ukraine from 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.840
 Astana has already sent a special 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.489
 document of inquiry 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.709
 Kazakhstan side asks colleagues 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.290
 to find out whether there is fault happened 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.700
 aircraft repair factory specialists on 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.090
 which last summer 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.750
 crashed an-72 was undergoing major 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.120
 repairs 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.860
