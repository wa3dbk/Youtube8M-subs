 let's see what this kid brings and good 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.189

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.509
 here that we have come out with a door in 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.040
 the hand I do not know what this means 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.779
 it seems to me that as always it is 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.000
 dying already to start as well as how 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.410
 the bread of every day not like I say good 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.970

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.550
 ass and good again let's see what 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.370
 brings us book 1 instructions and stops in 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.170
 that we are going to start reading and flight 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.489
 twice before going perfect worth serious 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.350
 you're on an obstacle map in the 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.610
 which will have to pass several 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.940
 situations now continues for this 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.080
 door and follow the adventure your box 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.370
 Spacers play easy do not break anything 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.410
 but it was on the map good and 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.270
 You know how to solve the same one 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.170
 God is like our Egyptian god is the 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.380
 god game or my mother 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.620
 go to sleep 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.030
 as of 12 because I put the rhythm of is 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.190
 what always happens to me like the one in 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:09.350
 the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:12.530
 because he's missing I do not know how to write perfect 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.530
 although there are bugs 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.729
 fear 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.110
 perfectly we needed to remove the 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.220
 good difficulty let's put the leg 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.869
 where are we going to see what series of tests 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.240
 or this man has been prepared is this 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.220
 mister parkour to see if to start 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.810
 He has already put us a pair because good not 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.830
 it seems to be very very complicated 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.830
 to see what this brings 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:52.560
 and that's like a slob of these hello 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:55.409
 bat say hey take me 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.439
 and he did not want me from murcia work 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.540
 system already here part 2 we have 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.829
 past part of the moment there is that 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.119
 since I have improved a little embarkation and 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.579
 grace people make me parkour 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.380
 facilitated that I am very bad and expensive as the 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.340
 thing has already improved a bit despite this 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.720
 test you have to decide with whom 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.300
 fight they chose eg the fence when 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.430
 you finish follow ahead do not fuck me 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.069
 if I 'm not going here nobody liked the 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.610
 difficulty is that it's a hangout or that 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.610
 it is below 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.400
 juca 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.800
 find out the night and I think that I 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.430
 I was passing 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.720
 this very short base you almost get to see 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.270
 from here put the game in pacific 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.840
 but if it's stay you can hear it I do not like it 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.060
 this I wanted to take away to put it in 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.850
 this in the pacific before the monsters 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.340
 I have gone a little alzheimer will 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.730
 see go with Valencian fm is garbage 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.980
 go go fail good let's see let's go 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.569
 leave palante fire 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.560
 and it is that although I have put water here 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.560
 that's also why we love each other 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.010
 the tail is set because I did not run 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.340
 I fled luckily that we have fallen in water 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.350

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.400

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.850

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.380

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.040

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.110
 should be kept in 30 frames or less 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.820
