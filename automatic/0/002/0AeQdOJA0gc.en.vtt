compressor what I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.830 
compressor what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:00:12.469> to<00:00:12.530> tilt<00:00:12.799> the<00:00:13.629> compressor<00:00:14.799> towards<00:00:15.799> me

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
going to tilt the compressor towards me

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.490 
going to tilt the compressor towards me
so<00:00:17.840> that<00:00:18.250> the<00:00:19.250> oil<00:00:19.520> will<00:00:19.640> drain<00:00:20.290> from<00:00:21.290> this

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
so that the oil will drain from this

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.790 
so that the oil will drain from this
drain<00:00:22.340> drainage<00:00:23.030> system<00:00:23.510> right<00:00:23.630> here<00:00:23.800> or

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
drain drainage system right here or

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.300 
drain drainage system right here or
drain<00:00:25.070> tube<00:00:25.990> if<00:00:26.990> I<00:00:27.110> don't<00:00:27.289> tilt<00:00:27.680> it<00:00:27.890> it's<00:00:28.190> gonna

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
drain tube if I don't tilt it it's gonna

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.560 
drain tube if I don't tilt it it's gonna
get<00:00:28.550> all<00:00:28.700> over<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:29.890> tank<00:00:30.890> and<00:00:31.119> this<00:00:32.119> is<00:00:32.239> a<00:00:32.270> fill

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
get all over the tank and this is a fill

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.410 
get all over the tank and this is a fill
tube<00:00:36.340> alright<00:00:37.340> I<00:00:37.370> simply<00:00:37.820> tilt<00:00:38.060> that<00:00:38.270> the

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
tube alright I simply tilt that the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.180 
tube alright I simply tilt that the
compressor<00:00:39.110> with<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.470> two<00:00:39.650> wheels<00:00:40.010> I<00:00:40.160> got

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
compressor with the two wheels I got

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.280 
compressor with the two wheels I got
with<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:42.010> compressor<00:00:43.010> kit<00:00:43.840> so<00:00:44.840> I<00:00:44.870> didn't

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
with the compressor kit so I didn't

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.580 
with the compressor kit so I didn't
actually<00:00:45.440> tilt<00:00:45.950> it<00:00:46.960> at<00:00:47.960> a<00:00:48.020> very<00:00:48.260> steep<00:00:48.560> angle

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
actually tilt it at a very steep angle

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.100 
actually tilt it at a very steep angle
just<00:00:51.590> enough<00:00:51.829> work<00:00:52.040> to<00:00:52.070> let<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:52.640> oil<00:00:52.670> flow<00:00:54.489> and

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
just enough work to let the oil flow and

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.639 
just enough work to let the oil flow and
I<00:00:57.110> think<00:00:57.559> it<00:00:57.620> takes<00:00:57.770> a<00:00:57.890> five<00:00:58.070> millimeter<00:00:58.340> allen

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
I think it takes a five millimeter allen

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:19.179 
I think it takes a five millimeter allen
socket<00:01:04.180> we<00:01:05.180> put<00:01:05.390> this<00:01:05.509> on<00:01:05.630> a<00:01:05.689> tripod<00:01:18.100> takes<00:01:19.100> a

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
socket we put this on a tripod takes a

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:25.719 
socket we put this on a tripod takes a
five<00:01:19.429> millimeter<00:01:19.700> socket<00:01:21.729> Allen<00:01:22.729> socket<00:01:24.729> so

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
five millimeter socket Allen socket so

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:38.319 
five millimeter socket Allen socket so
loosen<00:01:26.209> it<00:01:31.149> please<00:01:32.740> God<00:01:33.740> there<00:01:34.159> it<00:01:34.279> is<00:01:37.329> and

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
looks pretty clear to me look at that

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.590 
looks pretty clear to me look at that
looks<00:02:32.820> clear

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.490 

dude<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.840> don't<00:02:37.050> see<00:02:37.200> any<00:02:37.350> specs<00:02:39.170> well<00:02:40.170> maybe<00:02:40.380> I

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
know if it's because the the plastic

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.979 
know if it's because the the plastic
container<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:46.739> dirty

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
container is dirty

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:54.530 
container is dirty
that<00:02:50.900> looks<00:02:51.900> pretty<00:02:52.080> easy<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.440> change<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:54.300> oil

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
that looks pretty easy to change the oil

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.930 
that looks pretty easy to change the oil
that<00:02:54.690> is<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.200> it's<00:02:55.590> not<00:02:55.739> messy<00:02:55.920> oh<00:02:56.250> shoot<00:02:56.519> it

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
that is and it's not messy oh shoot it

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:14.760 
that is and it's not messy oh shoot it
is<00:02:57.090> messy<00:02:57.470> it's<00:02:58.470> dripping

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.960 

you<00:03:15.770> have<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:16.040> watch<00:03:16.190> out<00:03:16.340> for<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.610> leakage

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
you have to watch out for the leakage

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.580 
you have to watch out for the leakage
that<00:03:17.300> might<00:03:17.480> come<00:03:17.690> from<00:03:19.930> from<00:03:20.930> behind<00:03:21.320> here

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
that might come from from behind here

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.190 
that might come from from behind here
and<00:03:24.940> made<00:03:25.940> a<00:03:26.000> little<00:03:26.150> bit<00:03:26.240> of<00:03:26.330> a<00:03:26.450> mess<00:03:26.840> but<00:03:26.870> it's

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
and made a little bit of a mess but it's

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.560 
and made a little bit of a mess but it's
not<00:03:27.380> something<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:28.040> can't<00:03:28.310> clean<00:03:28.520> up<00:03:29.650> anyways

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
not something I can't clean up anyways

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.080 
not something I can't clean up anyways
that's<00:03:32.570> basically<00:03:33.050> all<00:03:33.800> there<00:03:34.490> is<00:03:34.880> to

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
that's basically all there is to

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.920 
that's basically all there is to
changing<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.540> oil<00:03:35.570> on<00:03:36.190> this<00:03:37.190> compressor<00:03:37.930> it's

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
changing the oil on this compressor it's

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.510 
changing the oil on this compressor it's
about<00:03:39.080> done<00:03:39.350> I<00:03:40.420> just<00:03:41.680> barely<00:03:42.680> made<00:03:43.100> it<00:03:43.310> in

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
about done I just barely made it in

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.000 
about done I just barely made it in
terms<00:03:43.790> of<00:03:44.080> getting<00:03:45.080> a<00:03:45.200> container<00:03:45.560> big<00:03:45.800> enough

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
terms of getting a container big enough

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.970 
terms of getting a container big enough
to<00:03:46.160> hold<00:03:46.280> all<00:03:46.430> this<00:03:46.580> oil
