00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.750
 others archer bar this may also be nice 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.219
 Enough never happened 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.410
 This should never happen losing one 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.940
 team that lower your vision is 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.870
 but matches like that are 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.000
 always in between 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.410
 she also sang live to see if it 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.099
 opponent you must make 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.180
 with sanne 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:23.039
 cut divide such surgery in between 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.600
 in that sense a good test case what that 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.320
 only concerns the outcomes 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.240
 fine yes we forced too little 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.869
 but yes it is definitely good for that 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.059
 us and 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.409
 to the preparation where came through 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.089
 what could you do and walked over 

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:38.339
 to calculate 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:40.260
 yes what I say they consciously good goal 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:43.170
 and then she went with them all 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.429
 and for us to be patient 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.589
 power 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:49.799
 many scratches tick that she is not 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:52.199
 Fortunately, that patience is anyway 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:55.649
 something you need in this preparation 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.449
 do your chance in the first weather and all 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.079
 as a basic player 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.779
 the seasons begin so he tries 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.420
 make the trainer as difficult as possible 

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:08.250
 every training again then is then a trainer 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.289
 whether he really oemmah me in town or not 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.149
 and I am forced to just keep going 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:14.369
 train hard and that the by the 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.049
 train come quickly what can you do in such a 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.640
 preparation for what manners you can 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.200
 you then leave your mark you are 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.429
 evenings you would score goals 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.630
 can easily say whatever on 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:23.329
 those trainings can go to specific 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.939
 when we impress such a trainer 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.940
 now therefore always doing what the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.590
 train your freight and 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.870
 at the moment you have to stand that you 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.930
 it must state whether it is 10 minutes out of 5 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.400
 minute or two minutes or the players up 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.350
 focus and for training you can do the 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.600
 put players on focus and then you can 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.710
 also a little release what say this 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.990
 kind of practice duels name is in the Netherlands 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.240
 we always say cia prepare it 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.860
 says nothing at all 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.290
 or think differently 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.080
 all we need to get you to go back though 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.780
 you become better at it and want it 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.490
 develop in the summer also put this 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.820
 to develop yourself and watch 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.220
 where you stand for me every hat 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.130
 unimportant is mainly the us or 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.570
 against ajax can also imagine that the 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.740
 the just his word and did you 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.450
 is eager 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.990
 that it is going to start playa certain again 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.280
 sense in the open day also or is this one 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.170
 to kill a blemish on the bridge 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.060
 well i do n't know i think for that 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.570
 briefly but tomorrow will be just again
