00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
August 21st so September 21st and I

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.790 
August 21st so September 21st and I
started<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:02.110> is<00:03:02.380> for<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:04.320> natural<00:03:05.320> blend

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
started that is for the natural blend

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.790 
started that is for the natural blend
I<00:03:05.860> used<00:03:06.100> that<00:03:06.280> alone<00:03:06.760> people<00:03:07.330> thought<00:03:07.800> the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
I used that alone people thought the

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.720 
I used that alone people thought the
result<00:03:09.310> wasn't<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.690> wasn't<00:03:11.290> lighting<00:03:12.070> but<00:03:12.550> I
