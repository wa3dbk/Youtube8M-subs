00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.180
 very good girls very good guys would go 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.549
 printed already know that any news 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.569
 that comes out on the next-gen the next 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.059
 generation of consoles 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:13.120
 we are here to count now this time 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.969
 it's official news from twitter and 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.850
 through John Carmack who believes that 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:22.930
 new playstation and xbox many games 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:25.210
 will continue at 30 fps the truth is that little 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.950
 or nothing you know really official of the 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.070
 Next generation consoles are all 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:34.239
 productive rumors etcetera etcetera and 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.859
 the rumored playstation 4 and xbox 720 are 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.070
 assumes that they will come between the end of 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:41.559
 2013 and early 2014 are supposed 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.620
 still nothing is known according to the 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.859
 latest data will offer clear 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.190
 games of higher visual quality something that 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:54.159
 it can be obvious and obvious 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.050
 really do not worry john carmack law 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.539
 of software that from twitter has 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:03.489
 confirmed he has doubted that many 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:04.870
 games give the jump of 30 fps to the 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.880
 60 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.700
 the new consoles that will come out 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.890
 according to the textual words, I quote 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.690
 misfortune can guarantee I can 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.050
 ensure that many new games 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.550
 generation will continue at 30 fps this is what 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.770
 explained by the designer who has 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.320
 worked on the doom series and on the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.640
 relatively recent rate only the 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.410
 time for nothing if the words of 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:32.140
 carmack that of hardware knows enough 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:35.640
 they are really true but he says 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.820
 what is a developer 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.100
 and is immersed in developing games of 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.750
 next generation because I think 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.020
 Sincerely, I hope at the beginning 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.300
 the games are going to work at 30 fps but 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.310
 and you tell me what you think you 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.250
 you think without directly the games already 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.380
 would have to be at 60 fps is minimal and 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.540
 nothing guys you already know like and favorites 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.040
 share and see you in the next 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.040
 news until next time
