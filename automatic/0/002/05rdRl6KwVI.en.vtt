00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.840
 to 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.820
 Well the kids are I see you and today you 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.039
 I bring a study a mini tutorial voucher 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.720
 to put it this way 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.630
 as now on the audio we are united 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.120
 over water without mounts or hacks 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.250
 nothing valuable legal and all this is worth 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:35.590
 in them a few requirements that will be 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:39.070
 first have 1000 gold two thousand gold 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.090
 not very easy and the second will have the dlc 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.910
 of dragon ball 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.590
 because as you see in sun stein is worth not 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.739
 we are in cairo we are out of 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:51.370
 skyrim vale is like this we are in sun this 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.309
 first covenant to come here cox mound 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.910
 born or as it is said is the rock of the 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.920
 body for once we are there is this 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.290
 ok we will have to find a name 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.720
 I think it is this that will tell us that 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.360
 we have to give a thousand gold to be able 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.120
 do an active excavation in the burial mound 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.390
 this and you that wait like three 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.040
 days and a messenger will come to you is the 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.680
 equality and sensors I have in skyrim 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.450
 several will come to you the best equally and 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.820
 will tell you that the entry is already 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.590
 is open and that we can go 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.710
 we will come here will tell us that there has been a 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.990
 problem that when they have opened this 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.549
 some dragon wars of these zombies 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.250
 of these devices your miners and 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.610
 we'll have to be inside and 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.130
 kill them bullet then when the nuances 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.850
 in good now let's hope that 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.120
 load 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.310
 but I took a lot 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.400
 and also that the times of writing 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.000
 I recommend it well because I think they are worth 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.060
 7 euros or 10 euros does not arrive 15 euros that 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.800
 we did it so super well are some cases 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.530
 times 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.160
 and good to see if this is already charged 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.160
 I keep explaining 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.220
 but in charge t 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.070
 matÃ­as and that charges so late 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.850
 mail is going to load you 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.230
 this is work there will be no money 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.180
 You will have to come down here 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.190
 we will have to vote for the bugs these 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.100
 the drone works wallerstein 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.740
 and good when the bateyes to see a 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.450
 moment when you would kill them you would have to 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.700
 there will be a skull over these 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.680
 close a skull a crack that if the 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.319
 you get out then that door will open 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.200
 will open this door here is worth 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.409
 and as you can see I know because they have fallen to 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.549
 see this problem because they will be over 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:56.739
 these boots plus truck boots on the 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:00.280
 Water 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:02.019
 in 0 99 pesos 9 kilos and have a value 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.069
 quite high enough to be about 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:09.969
 simple boots we take them a part for 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:13.240
 please and let's see is not true 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:16.730
 it's pretty egg 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.420
 let's see if they work 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.420
 and we go there 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.599
 also that when you catch it the uncles 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.730
 will give the option to pay him instead of a thousand 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.489
 two thousand and keep digging for it to 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.989
 see what's underneath I've done it 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.069
 and I'll have to wait a couple of days 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.480
 like like the first time they run out 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.080
 to dig and see that there to see if 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.150
 some treasure is worth I do not know 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.300
 and well let's see if the load is already 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.380
 and we go to the water to test them if according to 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.850
 they can be given on the water 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.850
 but that is loaded 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.990
 load 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.620
 I beat every day 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.730
 so late 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.350
 and come back with a bitter 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.280
 I think you've looked at the cameras money 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.789
 let's go to the water 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.210
 let's put the 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.120
 where are the weddings now worth boots 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.699
 of walking on water while walking 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.500
 on the over the waters if you take 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.270
 four relics that is to say if 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.129
 he also wants 100 points left 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.650
 enchantment if you have four relics 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:10.250
 or alan the hoops we equip and we have 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.250

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.820
 Okay there you are watching I do not know what the fuck 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.880
 is happening there but let's leave it 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.280
 soft and we are going to have to and if as you see 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.410
 we can walk on the water is worth this 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.880
 goes well with piranha in the proven because 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.920

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.470

 it's all right with these boots we can go 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.510
 above water is worth it and we can not 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.630

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.700

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.260
 It goes very, very well, they are very well 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.850
 these boots these to not be able 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.160
