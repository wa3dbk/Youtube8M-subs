00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.130 
it's it's a foot away from the stumps or
whether<00:01:49.910> or<00:01:49.970> not<00:01:50.060> it's<00:01:50.480> six<00:01:50.720> foot<00:01:50.870> away<00:01:51.020> from

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
whether or not it's six foot away from

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.050 
whether or not it's six foot away from
the<00:01:51.290> stumps<00:01:51.680> it's<00:01:52.310> important<00:01:52.730> that<00:01:52.790> you<00:01:52.940> look

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
the stumps it's important that you look

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.700 
the stumps it's important that you look
at<00:01:53.210> that<00:01:53.300> target<00:01:53.540> and<00:01:53.930> if<00:01:54.140> you<00:01:54.230> hit<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.470> target

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
at that target and if you hit the target

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.470 
at that target and if you hit the target
as<00:01:55.190> you're<00:01:55.460> practically<00:01:55.820> as<00:01:56.060> you've<00:01:56.240> done<00:01:56.360> in

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
as you're practically as you've done in

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.450 
as you're practically as you've done in
practice<00:01:56.660> so<00:01:57.020> many<00:01:57.170> times<00:01:57.410> hit<00:01:58.070> that<00:01:58.220> target

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
practice so many times hit that target

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
practice so many times hit that target
you've<00:01:58.730> got<00:01:58.820> a<00:01:58.850> greater<00:01:59.060> chance<00:01:59.240> of<00:01:59.330> taking

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
you've got a greater chance of taking

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.970 
you've got a greater chance of taking
wicket

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.170 

well<00:02:03.980> how<00:02:04.100> would<00:02:04.340> you<00:02:04.430> practice<00:02:04.880> see<00:02:05.000> what

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
well how would you practice see what

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.690 
well how would you practice see what
kind<00:02:05.600> of<00:02:05.720> targets<00:02:06.500> just<00:02:06.620> set<00:02:06.830> yourself<00:02:06.920> yeah<00:02:07.670> I

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
kind of targets just set yourself yeah I

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.190 
kind of targets just set yourself yeah I
think<00:02:07.940> I<00:02:08.000> think<00:02:08.210> the<00:02:08.300> store<00:02:08.510> walls<00:02:08.780> obviously

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
think I think the store walls obviously

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.780 
think I think the store walls obviously
you're<00:02:09.860> still<00:02:10.040> going<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.220> hit<00:02:10.280> your<00:02:10.400> length

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
you're still going to hit your length

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.270 
you're still going to hit your length
so<00:02:11.000> obviously<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:12.110> targets<00:02:12.500> for<00:02:12.530> length<00:02:12.860> they

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
so obviously the targets for length they

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.830 
so obviously the targets for length they
don't<00:02:13.490> change<00:02:13.760> they<00:02:14.060> still<00:02:14.390> look<00:02:14.540> at<00:02:14.660> those

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
don't change they still look at those

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.870 
don't change they still look at those
but<00:02:15.530> that<00:02:15.590> obviously<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.310> most<00:02:16.430> important

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
but that obviously the most important

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.430 
but that obviously the most important
thing<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.270> when<00:02:17.540> you<00:02:17.630> when<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:17.900> practice<00:02:18.290> in

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
thing is when you when you practice in

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.290 
thing is when you when you practice in
something<00:02:18.770> like<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:18.950> slower<00:02:19.280> ball<00:02:19.490> or<00:02:20.060> any

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
something like a slower ball or any

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.910 
something like a slower ball or any
delivery<00:02:20.780> you've<00:02:21.320> got<00:02:21.440> obviously<00:02:21.560> have<00:02:21.830> a

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
delivery you've got obviously have a

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.320 
delivery you've got obviously have a
purpose<00:02:22.280> you've<00:02:22.430> got<00:02:22.520> to<00:02:22.640> want<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.910> do<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.180> and

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
purpose you've got to want to do it and

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.210 
purpose you've got to want to do it and
it's<00:02:23.810> also<00:02:23.990> a<00:02:24.140> feel<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:24.530> actually<00:02:25.040> how<00:02:25.160> the

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
it's also a feel of actually how the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.250 
it's also a feel of actually how the
balls<00:02:25.490> coming<00:02:25.730> out<00:02:25.880> your<00:02:26.000> hand<00:02:26.180> sit<00:02:26.960> the<00:02:27.080> same

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
balls coming out your hand sit the same

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.320 
balls coming out your hand sit the same
arm<00:02:27.530> speed<00:02:27.710> fingers<00:02:28.670> crossed<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.060> when<00:02:29.240> I'm

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
arm speed fingers crossed that when I'm

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.420 
arm speed fingers crossed that when I'm
gripping<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.690> ball<00:02:29.810> tight<00:02:30.110> then<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.250> ball

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
gripping the ball tight then the ball

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.970 
gripping the ball tight then the ball
come<00:02:31.640> out<00:02:31.760> slower<00:02:32.060> as<00:02:32.450> for<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.650> one<00:02:33.770> at<00:02:33.890> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
come out slower as for the one at the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.320 
come out slower as for the one at the
back<00:02:34.130> of<00:02:34.160> your<00:02:34.310> hand<00:02:34.520> I've<00:02:34.790> just<00:02:34.970> started<00:02:35.180> to

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
back of your hand I've just started to

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.290 
back of your hand I've just started to
use<00:02:35.390> that<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.410> so<00:02:37.130> this<00:02:37.280> this<00:02:37.340> nettings<00:02:38.120> in

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
use that so so this this nettings in

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:47.440 
use that so so this this nettings in
place<00:02:38.540> of<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:38.900> just<00:02:39.170> be<00:02:39.290> careful<00:02:46.120> get<00:02:47.120> this<00:02:47.270> one

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
place of it just be careful get this one

00:02:47.450 --> 00:03:10.840 
place of it just be careful get this one
on<00:02:54.460> look<00:02:55.460> at<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.700> Hat

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.820 

because<00:03:11.850> if<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.120> see<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.600> again<00:03:13.260> as<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.470> cue

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
because if you see that again as a cue

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.010 
because if you see that again as a cue
you<00:03:13.980> can<00:03:14.160> see<00:03:14.420> something<00:03:15.420> different<00:03:15.840> happen

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
you can see something different happen

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.240 
you can see something different happen
if<00:03:16.110> he's<00:03:16.260> just<00:03:16.380> coming<00:03:16.620> out<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.830> front<00:03:17.070> of<00:03:17.160> the

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
if he's just coming out the front of the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.040 
if he's just coming out the front of the
hand<00:03:17.400> Courtney<00:03:18.030> Walsh<00:03:18.180> used<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.480> Bali<00:03:18.660> beauty

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
hand Courtney Walsh used to Bali beauty

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.760 
hand Courtney Walsh used to Bali beauty
he<00:03:19.770> could<00:03:19.950> just<00:03:20.130> not<00:03:20.310> pick<00:03:20.520> it<00:03:20.550> up
