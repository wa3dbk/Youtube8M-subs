00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.749
 There are two key points 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:20.079
 the way to the 2 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:23.079
 and give the way 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.839
 if you should decide 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.499
 St 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.120
 Vienna 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.120
 we 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 at the 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.280
 take these 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.560
 Dr 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.560
 how it works 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.570
 I just can not 6 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.150
 the cover firmly canceled 18 48 percent maybe is good now everything is 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.520
 that's already done ad hoc 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.030
 finished ca should 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.510
 I finished 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.890
 so z Hushovd can return, of course 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.450
 Not 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.950
 No, they agree 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.030
 Law 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.549
 now 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.640
 stronger finished 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.649
 finished 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:14.519
 2 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.519
 I do not give it 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.549
 it is far from everything 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:34.479
 No 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:37.479
 To be able to do the World Union one needs a strong will 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.069
 Barbecues are earned 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.229
 led by Henning Tillmann Telgte 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:46.909
 I always wanted the same race 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.909
 if own half 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:58.699
 a 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:01.219
 on 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.819
 first ripped Rheine 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.349
 Rheine 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.349
 realistic enough 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.459
 Haller 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.329
 on 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:21.889
 ca 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.249
 That's why we are currently seeing 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:30.120
 Bleser MdB is 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.419
 s 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.869
