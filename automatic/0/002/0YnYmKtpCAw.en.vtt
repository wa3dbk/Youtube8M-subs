Bulls emblem which is right there so I

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.050 
Bulls emblem which is right there so I
began<00:00:18.840> making<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.350> hoop<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.550> Miami<00:00:20.820> Heat

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
began making the hoop on the Miami Heat

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.140 
began making the hoop on the Miami Heat
logo<00:00:21.830> so<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.859> just<00:00:23.039> got<00:00:23.220> four<00:00:23.490> circles<00:00:23.939> turn

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
logo so I just got four circles turn

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.870 
logo so I just got four circles turn
them<00:00:24.240> into<00:00:24.359> ovals<00:00:24.779> with<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.830> order<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.340> black

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
them into ovals with the order of black

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.340 
them into ovals with the order of black
white<00:00:27.300> black<00:00:27.840> white<00:00:32.660> so<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.780> next<00:00:33.989> step<00:00:34.200> was

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
white black white so the next step was

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.380 
white black white so the next step was
making<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> three<00:00:34.980> flames<00:00:35.579> on<00:00:36.030> top<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
making the three flames on top of the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.750 
making the three flames on top of the
hoop<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.290> began<00:00:37.530> with<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> middle<00:00:37.980> one<00:00:38.010> which

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
hoop and began with the middle one which

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.709 
hoop and began with the middle one which
is<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> shortest<00:00:39.420> one<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:40.850> also<00:00:41.850> outlined<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
is the shortest one I also outlined the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.160 
is the shortest one I also outlined the
flame<00:00:43.309> by<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.550> copying<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.239> putting<00:00:46.079> it

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
flame by just copying it putting it

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.069 
flame by just copying it putting it
another<00:00:46.850> layer<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.180> then<00:00:48.750> click<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
another layer and then click on the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.750 
another layer and then click on the
start<00:00:49.320> button<00:00:49.379> which<00:00:49.770> could<00:00:50.039> outline<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.610> or

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
start button which could outline it or

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.350 
start button which could outline it or
you<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.120> make<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.270> bigger<00:00:51.570> around<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:53.360> so

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
you can just make it bigger around it so

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.689 
you can just make it bigger around it so
then<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.539> made<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.930> first<00:00:55.440> flame<00:00:55.829> which<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
then I made the first flame which is the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.029 
then I made the first flame which is the
fatter<00:00:56.969> one<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.379> has<00:00:58.469> like<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.680> double

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
fatter one but it has like a double

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.160 
fatter one but it has like a double
flame<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.510> had<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.809> make<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.079> with

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
flame on it so I had to make it with

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.420 
flame on it so I had to make it with
this<00:01:01.289> little<00:01:01.559> drop<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:01.859> then<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.219> made<00:01:02.399> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
this little drop and then I made the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.770 
this little drop and then I made the
little<00:01:02.760> outline<00:01:04.850> so<00:01:05.850> then<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.119> would<00:01:06.240> look<00:01:06.420> for

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
little outline so then I would look for

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:17.289 
little outline so then I would look for
the<00:01:07.110> top<00:01:07.830> part<00:01:08.159> which<00:01:08.340> kind<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.640> hooks

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:18.969 

like<00:01:17.899> and<00:01:18.049> I<00:01:18.109> made<00:01:18.259> all<00:01:18.380> these<00:01:18.530> outlines<00:01:18.859> just

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
like and I made all these outlines just

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.620 
like and I made all these outlines just
by<00:01:19.159> making<00:01:19.310> a<00:01:19.460> little<00:01:19.609> bigger<00:01:19.850> look<00:01:20.420> like<00:01:20.570> an

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
by making a little bigger look like an

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.419 
by making a little bigger look like an
r3<00:01:21.020> making<00:01:21.229> them<00:01:21.320> a<00:01:21.409> little<00:01:21.619> batter<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:27.710> last

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
r3 making them a little batter and last

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:30.969 
r3 making them a little batter and last
the<00:01:29.090> other<00:01:29.270> flame<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:30.020> little<00:01:30.530> bigger<00:01:30.710> than<00:01:30.799> the

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
the other flame a little bigger than the

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:38.459 
the other flame a little bigger than the
middle<00:01:31.219> one<00:01:35.259> it<00:01:36.259> was<00:01:36.380> actually<00:01:36.709> pretty<00:01:36.920> easy

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
middle one it was actually pretty easy

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:41.859 
middle one it was actually pretty easy
and<00:01:39.469> total<00:01:40.459> this<00:01:40.610> whole<00:01:40.850> emblem<00:01:41.420> took<00:01:41.689> me

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
and total this whole emblem took me

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:49.929 
and total this whole emblem took me
about<00:01:43.179> 15<00:01:44.179> to<00:01:44.390> 20<00:01:44.719> minutes<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.079> make<00:01:48.909> now<00:01:49.909> I

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
about 15 to 20 minutes to make now I

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.940 
about 15 to 20 minutes to make now I
have<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.119> make<00:01:50.209> the<00:01:50.329> little<00:01:50.709> part<00:01:51.709> where<00:01:51.739> the

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
have to make the little part where the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.160 
have to make the little part where the
ball<00:01:52.189> trails<00:01:52.970> through<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:54.020> hoop<00:01:56.110> so<00:01:57.110> I'll

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
ball trails through the hoop so I'll

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.279 
ball trails through the hoop so I'll
just<00:01:57.380> make<00:01:57.530> three<00:01:57.950> copies<00:01:58.189> of<00:01:58.399> this<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.289> just
