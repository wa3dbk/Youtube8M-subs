iMovie mobile project file and then the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.719 
iMovie mobile project file and then the
next<00:01:18.780> step<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.799> need<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.040> connect<00:01:20.460> this

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
next step is you need to connect this

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.340 
next step is you need to connect this
iPad<00:01:21.500> to<00:01:22.640> iTunes<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:24.000> save<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.600> file<00:01:24.810> we'll

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
iPad to iTunes to save that file we'll

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.110 
iPad to iTunes to save that file we'll
do<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.590> next<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.610> what<00:01:26.729> I'm<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.000> do

the<00:01:59.010> one<00:01:59.159> I'm<00:01:59.280> interested<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:00.030> iMovie<00:02:00.710> and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
the one I'm interested in is iMovie and

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.350 
the one I'm interested in is iMovie and
I<00:02:01.830> can<00:02:02.009> see<00:02:02.220> em<00:02:02.460> dot<00:02:03.420> iMovie<00:02:04.640> Mobile<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.820> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
I can see em dot iMovie Mobile is the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.850 
I can see em dot iMovie Mobile is the
actual<00:02:07.110> file<00:02:07.409> source<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.179> it's<00:02:09.860> 236

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
actual file source and it's 236

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.619 
actual file source and it's 236
megabytes<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.639> so<00:02:12.060> I'm<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.359> save<00:02:12.599> that

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
megabytes and so I'm going to save that

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.610 
megabytes and so I'm going to save that
and<00:02:13.700> in<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:14.909> example<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.749> student<00:02:16.169> is<00:02:16.439> in

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
and in this example this student is in

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.230 
and in this example this student is in
first

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
first

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.330

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
top here it's now copying that 236

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.740

megabyte file into that folder and you

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.130
