showing you how the launch pad works in
different<00:00:18.770> variations<00:00:19.460> today<00:00:19.760> I<00:00:19.789> wanted<00:00:20.150> to

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
different variations today I wanted to

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.570 
different variations today I wanted to
basically<00:00:20.810> go<00:00:21.230> through<00:00:21.650> the<00:00:21.830> three<00:00:22.220> different

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
basically go through the three different

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.359 
basically go through the three different
sizes<00:00:22.820> that<00:00:23.240> we<00:00:23.330> offer<00:00:23.570> in<00:00:23.869> the<00:00:24.160> hospital<00:00:25.160> your

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
sizes that we offer in the hospital your

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.910 
sizes that we offer in the hospital your
basic<00:00:25.850> cost<00:00:26.090> pad<00:00:26.390> which<00:00:26.660> is<00:00:26.689> a<00:00:26.869> half<00:00:27.320> inch<00:00:27.619> pad

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
basic cost pad which is a half inch pad

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.120 
basic cost pad which is a half inch pad
our<00:00:28.580> regular<00:00:29.539> cost<00:00:29.869> pad<00:00:30.170> in<00:00:30.380> the<00:00:30.500> one<00:00:30.740> inch<00:00:30.920> and

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
our regular cost pad in the one inch and

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.650 
our regular cost pad in the one inch and
then<00:00:31.369> the<00:00:31.519> big<00:00:31.699> one<00:00:31.849> in<00:00:31.970> front<00:00:32.180> of<00:00:32.300> me<00:00:32.390> which<00:00:32.510> is

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
then the big one in front of me which is

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.950 
then the big one in front of me which is
the<00:00:32.720> hospital<00:00:33.290> screen<00:00:33.970> you<00:00:34.970> can<00:00:35.180> see<00:00:35.449> from<00:00:35.780> the

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
the hospital screen you can see from the

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.090 
the hospital screen you can see from the
basic<00:00:36.890> it's<00:00:37.790> basically<00:00:38.329> nine<00:00:38.690> squares<00:00:39.260> half

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
basic it's basically nine squares half

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.549 
basic it's basically nine squares half
inch<00:00:40.430> in<00:00:41.710> depth<00:00:42.710> and<00:00:43.010> then<00:00:43.790> here<00:00:44.510> is<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:45.410> next

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
inch in depth and then here is the next

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.610 
inch in depth and then here is the next
level<00:00:46.040> up<00:00:46.190> again<00:00:46.879> very<00:00:47.180> similar<00:00:47.510> it's<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.440> 1

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
level up again very similar it's the 1

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.360 
level up again very similar it's the 1
inch<00:00:48.829> pad<00:00:49.180> again<00:00:50.180> 9<00:00:50.450> squares<00:00:51.110> but<00:00:51.739> you<00:00:51.950> can<00:00:52.070> see

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
inch pad again 9 squares but you can see

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.220 
inch pad again 9 squares but you can see
obviously<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:53.329> difference<00:00:53.840> in<00:00:53.989> thickness

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
obviously the difference in thickness

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.100 
obviously the difference in thickness
size<00:00:54.890> is<00:00:55.070> about<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:55.489> same<00:00:55.760> both<00:00:56.449> pads<00:00:56.750> in<00:00:56.930> fact

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
size is about the same both pads in fact

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.869 
size is about the same both pads in fact

moving up to the slightly bigger pad you

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.890 
moving up to the slightly bigger pad you
can<00:01:21.530> see<00:01:21.740> that<00:01:21.920> sighs<00:01:22.670> it's<00:01:23.270> good<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.420> move<00:01:23.630> for

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
can see that sighs it's good to move for

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.190 
can see that sighs it's good to move for
your<00:01:24.049> larger<00:01:24.890> RVs<00:01:25.420> your<00:01:26.420> midsize<00:01:26.720> RVs

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
anything that's got some stabilization

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.020 
anything that's got some stabilization
feed<00:01:29.960> then<00:01:30.680> we<00:01:30.799> move<00:01:31.009> on<00:01:31.220> to<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.850> hospital

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
stream this is our largest pad basically

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.679 
stream this is our largest pad basically
it's<00:01:35.570> a<00:01:36.100> slightly<00:01:37.100> wider<00:01:37.490> than<00:01:38.210> this<00:01:38.420> pad

still in the one-inch depth and this is

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
still in the one-inch depth and this is
use<00:01:42.200> for<00:01:42.680> your<00:01:43.040> large<00:01:43.869> armies<00:01:44.869> your<00:01:45.500> class<00:01:45.829> a

use for your large armies your class a
motor<00:01:46.340> homes<00:01:46.960> something<00:01:47.960> that<00:01:48.110> usually<00:01:48.229> has

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
motor homes something that usually has

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.249 
motor homes something that usually has
hydraulic<00:01:49.250> lifts<00:01:49.640> some<00:01:50.180> people<00:01:50.509> if<00:01:50.630> they<00:01:50.810> want

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
hydraulic lifts some people if they want

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.100 
hydraulic lifts some people if they want
a<00:01:51.350> little<00:01:51.500> extra<00:01:52.180> room<00:01:53.180> to<00:01:53.240> actually<00:01:53.570> put<00:01:53.930> the

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
a little extra room to actually put the

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.719 
a little extra room to actually put the
pad<00:01:54.439> down<00:01:54.470> they<00:01:54.890> don't<00:01:54.979> have<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.430> worry<00:01:55.610> about

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
pad down they don't have to worry about

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.429 
pad down they don't have to worry about
centering<00:01:56.420> like<00:01:56.600> you<00:01:56.720> would<00:01:56.899> on<00:01:56.930> this<00:01:57.200> band

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
centering like you would on this band

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.679 
centering like you would on this band
will<00:01:58.009> by<00:01:58.189> this<00:01:58.250> so<00:01:58.579> they<00:01:58.700> can<00:01:58.759> kind<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.509> just

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
will by this so they can kind of just

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.959 
will by this so they can kind of just
shove<00:02:00.020> it<00:02:00.140> under<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.500> trailer<00:02:00.829> and<00:02:01.219> put<00:02:01.250> it<00:02:01.820> on

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
shove it under the trailer and put it on

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:03.789 
shove it under the trailer and put it on
there<00:02:02.210> you<00:02:02.570> see<00:02:02.750> this<00:02:02.869> one<00:02:03.020> also<00:02:03.200> comes<00:02:03.680> with

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
there you see this one also comes with

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.550 
there you see this one also comes with
the<00:02:04.040> loop<00:02:04.219> flute<00:02:04.520> makes<00:02:04.729> it<00:02:04.880> really<00:02:05.060> nice

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
the loop flute makes it really nice

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.039 
the loop flute makes it really nice
these<00:02:06.560> pads<00:02:07.209> can<00:02:08.209> be<00:02:08.329> ordered<00:02:08.600> directly<00:02:08.660> from

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
these pads can be ordered directly from

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.200 
these pads can be ordered directly from
our<00:02:09.290> website<00:02:09.489> they<00:02:10.489> will<00:02:10.670> be

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
our website they will be
