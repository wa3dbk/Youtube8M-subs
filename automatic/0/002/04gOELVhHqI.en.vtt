00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.960
 today it's about the kion method and 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.940
 what is it 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.619
 how that works shows right on 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:20.339
 example and in advance if you 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.589
 you want to solve a slot 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:26.490
 at least in other free slot have 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:29.279
 So that's not solved the whole 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.480
 now so if one works in 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.720
 In our case, we already have the corner 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:38.910
 solved and want to rintun the edge and 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:43.290
 for the cinema we do as well as bring the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.360
 app to the place where the center wrong 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.010
 and where the etsch is already on it 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.240
 So that's not the colors here 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.460
 agree and we said yes 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.680
 that we need a free land then 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.690
 we have back and data here 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.630
 Now make use of that the cola is muscular 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.450
 is the corner bring one 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:08.130
 swap that we want to solve so that we 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:10.259
 here and now we grab the etsch 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.030
 Just here that's easy 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:17.579
 from so simple so that can easily 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.700
 turned on and now we bring the 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.920
 corner back so we have 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.749
 namely the corner you were in here 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.569
 not broken and anyway 

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:28.590
 inserted dieter and since the giro can 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:29.929
 now, of course, all sorts of things 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.020
 occur 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:37.319
 ie the thing happened look at the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.399
 what here on the other on the other 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:43.109
 center go is the finished corner and 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.759
 our free land is behind so he is 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:49.700
 in that case , he will once bring in the 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.850
 case mirrored to the first case 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.530
 and that the trainer is back so there 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.029
 Any kind of communication can do that 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.939
 you always solve the same scheme 

00:01:57.029 --> 00:02:02.249
 to dedicate the corner to the 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.600
 Free slot exchanges the edge entirely 

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:06.539
 normal clean and does the corner again 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.879
 in theory, you can turn that back 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.470
 probably also apply the other way and that 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.740
 when the apples are dissolved you can 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.770
 Corner solve with it 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.390
 this works so similar so in the 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:26.340
 This is actually taken as a basis 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:29.370
 used because for such cases but for 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.200
 the theory is it anyway times it 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.030
 works like a similar scheme 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.870
 just like ramstadt corner the simple 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.700
 idea that already knew videos swap 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.560
 so go out here with the Free State 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.320
 not with the corner this time but with 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.230
 the edge one can do that so that 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.950
 one makes a circle in which one 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:54.959
 direction that is whether or prices 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:03:01.650
 In any case, the corner quite normal purely 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:04.650
 which lets start at a total and turns 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.370
 the edge back again that was now 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.310
 the funny way one says so with 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.709
 Actually, the slice is so often something to me 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.360
 you can still do it 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.920
 I turn you can see it better and 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.160
 Although you can just the corner here 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.830
 it is rudi egger for shifts 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.980
 the whole thing that brings the corner 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:33.060
 the slot is good here because of ours 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:36.060
 there was free fire and the corner is coming 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.800
 just because it is here because if 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.860
 you see this here then come here 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.769
 this red-green corner purely so simple 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.930
 just do it small once you 're done all over again 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.930
 then you have turned back the finished per
