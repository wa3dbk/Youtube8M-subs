00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.309
 comb so there are no twitter minutes 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.800
 or take other times and then divide 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.800
 hair in a lake or in a side part 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.239
 my natural she shines here 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.940
 then do it a bit nice and is 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.270
 all you have to do is 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.899
 about a bit as thick as your thumb 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:08.640
 to grab on the side and I knew him 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:13.460
 from my ear and 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.460
 but behind the clics we pick up 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:23.939

 even do it on the bike 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.799
 if you go with lots of sunny bikes or 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.990
 otherwise in bus or just before we 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.729
 math lesson starts this hair is then got 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.470
 you wrap done within 5 minutes of fun 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.329
 room around a headband 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.070
 slide it into your hair and use it as well 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.900
 the pins to half a state 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.970
 to make 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.440
 I got this scarf from forever nobody 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.240
 just really comment what you are going to 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.640
 wrapped is actually sort of 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.700
 nice flower wreaths what I do is me 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.280
 make my brush a middle part 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:01.560
 and actually only at the front 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.990
 then I actually take the rest away 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.100
 the center of their heads 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.820
 a little bit behind and this one picks 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.240
 back up 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.240
 slightly 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.090
 since they think you know well this is 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.459
 pick those with your feminine 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.690
 now is the sting I feel I am behind 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.490
 my ear 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.000
 pretty simple make sense because you are there 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.000
 so in 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.410
 And so to pick you do n't fall behind 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.240
 my ears 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:39.180
 I quickly wear a bit loosely so not 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:42.300
 really not too tight and with the rest 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.040
 put on a pair of two pins with 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.170
 those who know very cute 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.730
 you too much my age but as a boy 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.390
 can easily with nice golden 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:55.110
 bow ties and then I take this part of 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.600
 my hair and then i play see here follows 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:03.930
 as a kind of small half- tail 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:05.519
 other stitch on the other side as 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.290
 the end result you really have it 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.080
 easily done within five minutes and 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.000
 so your kind of lana del ray ready now 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.950
 and the last is her style number three 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.080
 more chic and more businesslike 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.269
 it's a donut beat with 2 loose ones 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.160
 picking that are subordinated to 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.019
 a nice it's way for this you have 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.459
 needed a few foam games and 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.709
 donut and some hair spray 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.519
 we are going to start you divide your hair 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:33.480
 a middle part and then get 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.959
 your two pick at the front separately sweet 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.530
 about the same thickness and this one 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.480
 a fixed the small music and 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:47.239
 then you put it in a smooth one 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.239
 low tail to the rear 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:56.329
 we push the donut under tail 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:04:00.310
 I take a small donut and then 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.310
 are you going to make the button here 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:05.510
 the button is now neat and secure 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.280
 And then it's time to take the final step 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.890
 to do and that's you 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.049
 blocks I'm going to back up a little 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.049
 bottom of a slightly more volume 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:19.070
 I take it back to lock you up and I 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:20.599
 take him back and from that 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.250
 point and around glasses I also start via 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:28.250
 to argue slightly 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:29.990
 that pretty fit so twisted block 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.360
 all the way down to not too tight me 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.199
 you get nice nice romantic effect 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.710
 goes to a well you bring that joke 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:43.030
 you knot until your donut 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.030
 and that jokes that you fasten with a clip 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.220
 which I put fits again 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.860
 see if it is easiest to 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.199
 an above along offline just below 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.310
 secure the other mounting position 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:59.750

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.639

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.190
 gotta be really good at the end 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.930
 pin down our blood that almost looks like 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.789
 ready it is now only a matter 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.860
 from the front quite a bit 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.530
 careful what forms and with 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.599
 Emphasize on hull and then it is 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.080

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:26.030
 goal remains and then that is a you 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.979
