00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 bush 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.780
 perhaps that noise in football only 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.840
 This is a cameraman without a belt. 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.840
 safety 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.260
 This time we went to see the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.850
 jaguar xj engine v8 5.0 and of course i did 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.980
 what would everyone do 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.980
 I took a cone, did not try fast 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.420
 pressure and group does not like 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:59.940
 the price 540 thousand reais is not for everything 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.880
 pocket not 21 thousand and 600 reais 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.479
 Do you know what this ipva value means? 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.369
 of cars in the streets of são paulo is 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.720
 practically impossible to measure the 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.140
 car performance 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.440
 are 510 horsepower trapped in the 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.440
 Traffic 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.180
 Look at the traffic 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.580
 one of the lessons learned today 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.190
 matter the car you have to be from 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.240
 luxury if it's not you 'll always be a 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.280
 hostage of the traffic of são paulo always 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.350
 but in a car like this 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.149
 this is slightly mitigated because you 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.649
 You can relax just because it 's because here 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.770
 in that back seat 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.369
 there is a massager for the back 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.369
 not bad, right? 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.130
 good part of the engine and chassis is 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.240
 aluminum that leaves the car 150 pounds 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.970
 lighter 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.520
 the average consumption of gasoline 12.7 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:02.130
 kilometers per liter according to the jaguar 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.659
 by our accounts 11,9 look at this 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.030
 which is the key to the jaguar 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.560
 if you approach her with your 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.479
 one meter from the car the car 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.150
 automatically the same if you 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.150
 distance one meter the doors close 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.099
 one thing we realize is that there is 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.790
 now you have managed to balance very well 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.590
 two sportiness and luxury requirements you 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.170
 who responds with a very 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.829
 strong and at the same time is quite 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.829
 comfortable 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:43.129
 lesson number 2 supervision board 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.739
 electronics is the biggest enemy in this car 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.719
 the camera that is close to the bumper 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.599
 helps the driver to park when the 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:53.480
 marching related to the island only markings 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:56.239
 indicates an orange free path 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.909
 attention and red stopped stopped stopped 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.930
 knows what is harder to report 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.370
 like this 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.370
 back to my car later
