what you want to call it um be yeah I
usually<00:03:00.750> do<00:03:01.750> it<00:03:01.870> at<00:03:01.960> this<00:03:02.140> angle<00:03:03.120> sometimes

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
usually do it at this angle sometimes

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.280 
usually do it at this angle sometimes
they<00:03:04.270> go<00:03:04.390> a<00:03:04.420> bit<00:03:04.660> further<00:03:04.720> out<00:03:05.290> on<00:03:06.000> accident

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
they go a bit further out on accident

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.430 
they go a bit further out on accident
but<00:03:08.640> that's<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.910> angle<00:03:10.060> that<00:03:10.480> i<00:03:10.540> usually<00:03:10.930> do

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
but that's the angle that i usually do

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.440 
but that's the angle that i usually do
dia<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.460> cat<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:15.280> angle<00:03:15.640> from<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:15.970> outside

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.880 
of the nose to the outer corner of the
eye<00:03:18.520> and<00:03:18.970> if<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:20.080> remove<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:23.260> brush<00:03:23.590> you

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
eye and if I remove the the brush you

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.640 
eye and if I remove the the brush you
can<00:03:23.920> see<00:03:24.400> that's<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.360> angle<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:25.900> I<00:03:25.960> use<00:03:27.300> so

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
can see that's the angle that I use so

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.860 
can see that's the angle that I use so
depending<00:03:29.650> on<00:03:29.770> your<00:03:29.890> eyes<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:30.910> your<00:03:31.180> nose<00:03:31.210> and

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
everything like that your angle is going

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.430 
everything like that your angle is going
to<00:03:33.670> be<00:03:33.790> probably<00:03:34.540> completely<00:03:34.840> different<00:03:35.320> than

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440

I<00:03:49.980> get<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:52.230> angle<00:03:52.620> for<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:52.920> cat<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:54.440> let<00:03:55.440> me

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
I get the the angle for the cat I let me

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.860 
I get the the angle for the cat I let me
go<00:03:55.650> ahead<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:55.860> stop<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.670> find<00:03:57.330> out<00:03:57.510> my<00:03:57.629> stuff
