00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:12.860
 jo 19 here from the spins central now 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.090
 I have the avaloq sonho hard times 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.490
 on my with clownin carbon wood 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.130
 curious and of course the 05 to 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.450
 balance the 05 on the other side and 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:43.530
 I'm curious what but loks about it 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:45.800
 bidding but was looking forward to the wood 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.800
 mascher 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.990
 yes I have tested target in avaloq sonja 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.400
 but knew loks always only for 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.170
 wood for very good wood this 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.750
 have produced quite surprised 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.460
 even over the ball was through anyway 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.240
 picks up the hd version was a relative 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.130
 softer surface but with it 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.020
 above average much rotation 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.850
 grip on the surface unusual 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.670
 for such a very soft evidence for me one 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.700
 option for backhand because quite 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.470
 usable for passive game and with the 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.450
 also bear to take over that means 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.860
 he sometimes passively plays at the table 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.720
 want to exploit bock techniques 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.090
 want to have control in the ball change 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.650
 not immediately on the impact game 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.410
 This is on everyone 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.880
 case a very good offensive variant 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.440
 for the shape of the magic I was because 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.480
 you just do not like the very solid balls 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.739
 can play and certainly such a cover 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.780
 the so very soft between and 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.520
 takes something harder offensively covering is 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.070
 and accordingly for players like that 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.650
 Controlled offensive organ block game 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.830
 love with quite options also steam 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.830
 close
