00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 or the mind of youtube if you ask 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.170
 why did he use the loquendo I explain it in 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.000
 another good video today I come to talk 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.260
 of a movie that will be released in June 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.809
 called pixels 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.790
 before starting I need you to look at the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.130
 trailer to understand what I'm 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.180
 speaking good without more here is the 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.900
 trailer sorry that was not good now 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.900
 yes the trailer 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.080
 and very strong 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.630
 by fergie 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.670
 p 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.869
 since it is a 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.479
 Y 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.950
 at this moment I only think of one thing 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.930
 I just saw that you do not know what 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.180
 invent themselves they only make crap today in 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.160
 day it does not matter if it 's videogames 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.170
 it matters very little and just for this 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.600
 movie they had to put three subjects 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.130
 with the face of geeks the logic went to the 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.130
 shit I shit on the producers 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.640
 but well this is just a point of 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.980
 let's think on the positive side the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.280
 movie this video game and this 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.400
 video game and it's videogame 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.620
 well there's no way to process it anymore 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.470
 to analyze a bit what history is 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.170
 Apparently the NASA sends technology to 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.930
 space and with technology I mean 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.030
 video games the aliens take advantage of this 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.190
 information to make weapons of war and 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.830
 if the weapons are the characters of the 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.130
 video games and instead of thanking us 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.900
 They send us their creations to kill us 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.360
 that's all I know so far 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.220
 but I will continue investigating and I will continue to 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.830
 see the movie as bad as you can 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.470
 be and just after seeing it I will bring you 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.170
 a full review of the movie good 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.760
 without more hope you liked it 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.710
 give it a like if you want more videos 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.740
 well and in those that make reviews of the 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.520
 movies and subscribe here I say goodbye 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.520
