00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.490
 two 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.480
 hello friends I am has seen the 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.700
 welcome to another video of this stump 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.500
 and the work this is still super 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.029
 father I will teach you how to decorate your 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.800
 customers with good facts from 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.390
 Felt very easy to make you will 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.009
 love since you can make them your 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.559
 favorite colors and you can transform 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.989
 something so simple in something original like that 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:34.870
 let's start this video the materials 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.110
 that we will use in this occasion will be 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.840
 multi-colored felt clicks gun 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.600
 of silicone bars 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.820
 and finally scissors the first thing that 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.440
 we will need will be our filter choose 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.720
 the color that you like and we are going to 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.150
 draw three strips the first one will be a 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.510
 centimeter wide by six long the 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.489
 second one by 4.5 and finally one 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.199
 more than half a centimeter wide by 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.520
 four long 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.520
 now let's cut them 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.400
 once you have them ready we are going to 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.619
 use the largest strip in a 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.299
 extreme with what the icon is and stick it 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.760
 in this way so that we have more 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.890
 little 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.320
 when you have something like that with a 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.240
 little with the center impresses more 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.840
 edges with the fingers to shape 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.420
 our bun 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.080
 Now take the medium strip and fold the 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.180
 in half 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.920
 with the help of your scissors cut the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.280
 tips diagonally so that you 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.380
 stay this way 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.450
 since it is cut on the banks with 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.080
 silicone center alfredo pretty that 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.080
 we did previously 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.820
 with the smallest strip we are going to surround 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.740
 all the center of our bun first 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.440
 with silicon but only in the part of 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.090
 opposite as I am doing now 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.010
 have the strip trying to make it 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.010
 more focused work impresses a little 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.750
 to stick the back first 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.910
 we must submit a part of time 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.400
 up in one of the pieces 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.990
 last with silicone and but first the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.860
 end of the last clip 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.860
 and then the other 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.380
 to pick something as simple as a click 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.300
 we can give it an original super touch 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.760
 with the little monkeys made of felt 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.980
 They are also super easy to do and so 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.900
 You can decorate all you want with 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.819
 the colors that you like even 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.730
 you can combine the colors if you want or 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.290
 Use the 15 colors to combine 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.480
 apart it's a super practical since we 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.000
 you can use to group missing leaves 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.190
 of dividers for your books I hope you 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.230
