winning and the Atheist seem to have

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.359 
winning and the Atheist seem to have
this<00:00:30.420> attitude<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.140> they'll<00:00:31.679> quickly<00:00:31.980> point

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
this attitude and they'll quickly point

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.700

out to you Christianity is dying and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.819 
out to you Christianity is dying and

sometimes as a Christian I feel the same
way<00:00:38.210> um<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.530> guess<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.680> reason<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.280> because

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
way um I guess the reason is is because

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.900 
way um I guess the reason is is because

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
somewhere that I believe they go so they

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.789 
somewhere that I believe they go so they
can<00:01:28.640> take<00:01:29.640> part<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.299> some<00:01:30.780> camaraderie<00:01:31.079> with

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
can take part in some camaraderie with

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.620 
can take part in some camaraderie with
like-minded<00:01:32.159> people<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.000> that's<00:01:33.329> that's

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
like-minded people and that's that's

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.130 
like-minded people and that's that's
cool<00:01:34.170> that's<00:01:34.439> what<00:01:35.189> we<00:01:35.340> all<00:01:35.549> do<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:36.030> life<00:01:36.240> but

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
cool that's what we all do in life but

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.069 
cool that's what we all do in life but
