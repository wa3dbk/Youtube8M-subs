so it's an ultraportable it has windows

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.710 
so it's an ultraportable it has windows
8.1<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.770> real<00:01:08.010> windows<00:01:08.340> 8.1<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:09.119> has<00:01:09.299> system

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
8.1 the real windows 8.1 it has system

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.660 
8.1 the real windows 8.1 it has system
ram<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.080> 2<00:01:10.229> gigabyte<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.830> not<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> lot<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:11.310> in

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
ram of 2 gigabyte it's not a lot but in

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.109 
ram of 2 gigabyte it's not a lot but in
Windows<00:01:12.030> 8<00:01:12.299> 2<00:01:12.900> gigabyte<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.610> not<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.880> bad

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
Windows 8 2 gigabyte is not that bad

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.480 
Windows 8 2 gigabyte is not that bad
actually<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.320> hard<00:01:16.560> drive<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.950> 32

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
actually and the hard drive is a 32

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.260 
actually and the hard drive is a 32
gigabyte<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.590> solid<00:01:19.590> state<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.880> that's<00:01:21.060> why

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
gigabyte a solid state and so that's why

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.840 
gigabyte a solid state and so that's why
it's<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.450> small<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:22.680> if<00:01:22.799> your<00:01:22.979> are<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.640> know

just like you know doing email web stuff
it's<00:01:28.610> more<00:01:29.610> than<00:01:29.670> enough<00:01:30.060> for<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.329> lot<00:01:30.509> of
