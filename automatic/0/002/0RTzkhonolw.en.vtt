00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
steering wheel and there may be a little

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.620 
steering wheel and there may be a little
bit<00:00:16.859> comparable<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.940> sequential<00:00:18.330> gearbox

is from motorbikes except that our gear
changes<00:00:21.359> just<00:00:21.570> happens<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:22.199> much<00:00:22.380> faster

few years is what we call seamless
changes<00:00:31.640> that<00:00:32.640> means<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:33.090> change<00:00:33.120> from<00:00:33.540> one

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
changes that means we change from one

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.510 
changes that means we change from one
gear<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.320> next<00:00:34.680> without<00:00:34.829> losing<00:00:35.399> any

power from the engine we don't have to

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.810 
power from the engine we don't have to
dip<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> clutch<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.370> don't<00:00:38.520> have<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.700> lose

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
dip the clutch we don't have to lose

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.470 
dip the clutch we don't have to lose
Drive<00:00:39.149> what<00:00:39.930> we<00:00:40.020> actually<00:00:40.170> do<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:41.219> engage<00:00:41.700> both

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
Drive what we actually do is engage both

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.029 
Drive what we actually do is engage both
gears<00:00:42.840> at<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.140> same<00:00:43.320> time<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:45.829> 1-star<00:00:46.829> saw

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
gears at the same time a 1-star saw

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.440 
gears at the same time a 1-star saw
overtake<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> other<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.059> before<00:00:48.270> it

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
overtake the other and just before it

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.880 
overtake the other and just before it
becomes<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.899> problem<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.320> other<00:00:49.440> one<00:00:49.620> pulls

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
becomes a problem the other one pulls

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.270 
becomes a problem the other one pulls
out<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:50.940> get<00:00:51.090> seamless<00:00:51.829> acceleration

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.529 

first<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.430> all<00:00:56.550> there's<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.910> gear<00:00:57.090> ratios

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
first of all there's the gear ratios

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.330 
first of all there's the gear ratios
which<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.960> need<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> tune<00:00:58.440> from<00:00:58.680> one<00:00:58.949> track<00:00:59.160> to

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
which you need to tune from one track to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.520 
which you need to tune from one track to
another<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.879> then<00:01:00.629> there's<00:01:00.809> also<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.350> way

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
another and then there's also the way

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.229 
another and then there's also the way
the<00:01:01.710> shifts<00:01:02.039> happen<00:01:02.370> because<00:01:02.760> very<00:01:03.090> often

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the shifts happen because very often

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.579 
the shifts happen because very often
you're<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.660> middle<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> corner<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
you're in the middle of the corner and

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.200 
you're in the middle of the corner and
you<00:01:04.710> have<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.949> shift<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.820> need<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.060> make

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
you have to shift so you need to make

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.490 
you have to shift so you need to make
sure<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.600> shift<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.960> very<00:01:07.200> smooth

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
sure that this shift is very smooth

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.770 
sure that this shift is very smooth
otherwise<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.490> could<00:01:08.640> snap<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.330> rear<00:01:09.479> away

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
otherwise it could snap the rear away

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.840 
otherwise it could snap the rear away
and<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.049> could<00:01:10.200> spin<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.860> could<00:01:11.040> you

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
and you could spin and you could you

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.550 
and you could spin and you could you
could<00:01:12.000> be<00:01:12.119> off<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.390> track<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:13.049> requires<00:01:13.470> a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
could be off the track that requires a

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.070 
could be off the track that requires a
lot<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.860> detailed<00:01:14.220> work

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.540 

there<00:01:18.080> are<00:01:18.140> also<00:01:18.230> very<00:01:18.710> tough<00:01:19.010> little<00:01:19.340> things

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
there are also very tough little things

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.230 
there are also very tough little things
there<00:01:19.880> they<00:01:20.720> weigh<00:01:20.930> around<00:01:21.290> 35<00:01:21.980> kilos<00:01:22.400> but

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
there they weigh around 35 kilos but

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.110 
there they weigh around 35 kilos but
they've<00:01:23.360> got<00:01:23.540> to<00:01:23.570> take<00:01:23.840> 750<00:01:24.710> horsepower<00:01:24.980> and<00:01:25.370> a

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
they've got to take 750 horsepower and a

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.150 
they've got to take 750 horsepower and a
huge<00:01:26.330> amount<00:01:26.420> of<00:01:26.600> torque<00:01:26.810> from<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.020> engine

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
huge amount of torque from the engine

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.040 
huge amount of torque from the engine
350<00:01:28.160> Newton<00:01:28.370> meters<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.300> they're<00:01:29.600> they're

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
350 Newton meters so they're they're

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.560 
350 Newton meters so they're they're
really<00:01:30.080> nice<00:01:30.560> pieces<00:01:30.920> of<00:01:31.270> engineering<00:01:32.270> almost

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
really nice pieces of engineering almost

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.900 
really nice pieces of engineering almost
like<00:01:32.810> Swiss<00:01:33.560> watchmaking<00:01:34.370> when<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:34.790> look

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
like Swiss watchmaking when you look

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.610 
like Swiss watchmaking when you look
inside<00:01:35.090> them<00:01:35.450> but<00:01:35.600> great<00:01:36.350> piece<00:01:36.590> of

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
inside them but great piece of

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.580 
inside them but great piece of
engineering<00:01:40.180> in<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.330> typical<00:01:41.750> race<00:01:41.960> I<00:01:42.230> might

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
engineering in the typical race I might

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.800 
engineering in the typical race I might
shift<00:01:42.890> about<00:01:43.340> three<00:01:44.090> thousand<00:01:44.540> one<00:01:44.660> hundred

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
shift about three thousand one hundred

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.720 
shift about three thousand one hundred
times<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:45.860> can<00:01:45.980> imagine<00:01:46.130> that<00:01:46.340> all<00:01:46.460> I'm

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
times so you can imagine that all I'm

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.340 
times so you can imagine that all I'm
doing<00:01:47.030> all<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.240> time<00:01:47.420> is<00:01:47.570> like<00:01:47.720> shifting<00:01:48.140> and

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
doing all the time is like shifting and

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.140 
doing all the time is like shifting and
at<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.770> same<00:01:48.979> time<00:01:49.220> I<00:01:49.280> need<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.610> change<00:01:49.760> brake

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
at the same time I need to change brake

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.510 
at the same time I need to change brake
balance<00:01:50.600> switch<00:01:51.410> on<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.740> curves<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.310> rear
