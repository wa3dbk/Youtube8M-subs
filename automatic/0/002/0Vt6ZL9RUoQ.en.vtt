I'm<00:00:41.940> making<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.270> character<00:00:42.690> as<00:00:42.840> fast<00:00:43.140> as

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
I'm making the character as fast as

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.500

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
possible Sonic would often run so fast

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.150 
possible Sonic would often run so fast
he<00:00:45.870> would<00:00:45.990> outrun<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.470> screen

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
he would outrun the screen

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.950 
he would outrun the screen
I'm<00:00:47.250> foreseeing<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.090> as<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.330> kid<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.810> just

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
I'm foreseeing that as a kid and just

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.290 
I'm foreseeing that as a kid and just
being<00:00:49.140> awestruck<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.130> how<00:00:50.280> amazing<00:00:50.880> that<00:00:51.030> was

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
being awestruck on how amazing that was

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.060 
being awestruck on how amazing that was
I<00:00:51.660> was<00:00:51.870> used<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.110> characters<00:00:52.560> running<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:52.980> a

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
I was used to characters running in a

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.690 
I was used to characters running in a
brisk<00:00:53.340> pace

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
brisk pace

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.970 
brisk pace
and<00:00:54.000> then<00:00:54.330> jumping<00:00:54.810> through<00:00:55.020> levels<00:00:55.380> so<00:00:55.830> like

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
and then jumping through levels so like

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.010 
and then jumping through levels so like
really<00:00:56.250> didn't<00:00:56.520> do<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.910> he<00:00:57.240> just<00:00:57.450> ran<00:00:57.660> as

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
really didn't do that he just ran as

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.540 
really didn't do that he just ran as
fast<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.380> he<00:00:58.470> could<00:00:58.650> and<00:00:58.890> hope<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.280> he<00:00:59.370> didn't

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
fast as he could and hope that he didn't

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.340 
fast as he could and hope that he didn't
run<00:00:59.700> into<00:00:59.940> an<00:01:00.060> enemy<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.570> sometimes<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.260> he

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
run into an enemy and sometimes if he

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.020 
run into an enemy and sometimes if he
was<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.650> ball<00:01:01.860> form<00:01:01.890> he<00:01:02.340> just<00:01:02.550> smashed<00:01:02.820> right

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
was in ball form he just smashed right

was in ball form he just smashed right
through<00:01:03.270> them<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.570> I'm<00:01:03.750> not<00:01:03.870> saying<00:01:04.080> there

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
through them so I'm not saying there

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.749 
through them so I'm not saying there
wasn't<00:01:04.350> any<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.650> those<00:01:04.769> jumping<00:01:05.129> areas<00:01:05.400> cuz<00:01:05.640> it

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
wasn't any of those jumping areas cuz it

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.249 
wasn't any of those jumping areas cuz it
really<00:01:05.970> was<00:01:06.180> especially<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.079> later

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
really was especially in the later

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:08.810 
really was especially in the later
levels<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.979> can<00:01:08.070> get<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> bit<00:01:08.400> annoying<00:01:08.579> as

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
levels you can get a bit annoying as

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.219

to<00:01:10.380> move<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.159> sense<00:01:11.370> of<00:01:11.490> speed<00:01:11.790> was

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
to move but the sense of speed was

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.060 
to move but the sense of speed was
almost<00:01:12.420> always<00:01:12.690> there<00:01:13.140> unlike<00:01:13.620> other<00:01:13.860> games

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
almost always there unlike other games

you were looking forward to advance you

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.969 
you were looking forward to advance you
in<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> game

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
in the game

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.350 
in the game
the<00:01:56.070> only<00:01:56.220> exception<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:56.940> will<00:01:57.150> be<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
the only exception of this will be the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.450 
the only exception of this will be the
water<00:01:57.540> levels<00:01:58.020> those<00:01:58.560> sections<00:01:59.010> killed<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
water levels those sections killed the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.039 
water levels those sections killed the
pace<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.760> the<00:01:59.850> game<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.390> often<00:02:00.750> would<00:02:00.840> feel

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
pace of the game and often would feel

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.539 
pace of the game and often would feel
out<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.260> place<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.979> game<00:02:02.190> is<00:02:02.310> about<00:02:02.490> a

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
out of place the game is about a

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.460 
out of place the game is about a
character<00:02:02.790> with<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.150> lot<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.479> speeds<00:02:03.780> not<00:02:04.200> about

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
character with a lot of speeds not about

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.080 
character with a lot of speeds not about
a<00:02:04.500> character<00:02:04.860> slowly<00:02:05.340> moving<00:02:05.850> underwater

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
a character slowly moving underwater

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.179 
a character slowly moving underwater
what<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:06.990> also<00:02:07.229> liked<00:02:07.470> about<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.799> levels<00:02:08.069> was

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:08.189 
what I also liked about the levels was

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:10.249 
what I also liked about the levels was
it<00:02:08.340> wasn't<00:02:08.519> a<00:02:08.759> set<00:02:09.000> path<00:02:09.299> most<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> time<00:02:09.959> there

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
it wasn't a set path most the time there

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.449 
it wasn't a set path most the time there
would<00:02:10.349> be<00:02:10.439> different<00:02:10.799> ways<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.099> get<00:02:11.189> to<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
would be different ways to get to the

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.550 
would be different ways to get to the
finish<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:12.209> made<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.480> replayability<00:02:12.900> very

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
finish that made the replayability very

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.110 
finish that made the replayability very
high<00:02:13.830> if<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.069> wanted<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.489> explore<00:02:14.790> all<00:02:14.970> the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
high if you wanted to explore all the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.880 
high if you wanted to explore all the
hidden<00:02:15.420> in<00:02:15.540> different<00:02:15.930> routes<00:02:16.140> while<00:02:16.740> the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
hidden in different routes while the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.140 
hidden in different routes while the
levels<00:02:17.190> were<00:02:17.280> different<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:17.760> each<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:18.060> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
levels were different in each of the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.910 
levels were different in each of the
zones<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.750> did<00:02:19.200> notice<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:19.560> there<00:02:19.740> were

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
zones I did notice that there were

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.320 
zones I did notice that there were
times<00:02:20.099> where<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.430> look<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.910> levels<00:02:21.209> were

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
times where the look of the levels were

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.059 
times where the look of the levels were
the<00:02:21.450> same<00:02:21.690> it's<00:02:22.200> like<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.440> little<00:02:22.560> creators

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
the same it's like the little creators

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.680 
the same it's like the little creators
copy<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.580> paste<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.970> over<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.390> over<00:02:24.599> again

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
copy and paste it over and over again

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.990 
copy and paste it over and over again
certain<00:02:25.349> level<00:02:25.680> designs<00:02:26.040> when<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.580> started<00:02:26.910> to

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
certain level designs when I started to

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.940 
certain level designs when I started to
see<00:02:27.180> one<00:02:27.360> part<00:02:27.599> of<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.810> level<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.530> tell<00:02:28.739> what

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
see one part of a level I can tell what

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.900 
see one part of a level I can tell what
the<00:02:29.099> next<00:02:29.250> part<00:02:29.459> was<00:02:29.580> gonna<00:02:29.670> look<00:02:29.849> like

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
the next part was gonna look like

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.790 
the next part was gonna look like
without<00:02:30.390> ever<00:02:30.569> playing<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.410> this<00:02:31.590> got

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
without ever playing it and this got

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.470 
without ever playing it and this got
very<00:02:32.069> obvious<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.819> later<00:02:33.000> parts<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:33.360> the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
very obvious in the later parts of the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.240 
very obvious in the later parts of the
game<00:02:33.660> now<00:02:34.200> if<00:02:34.349> you<00:02:34.440> know<00:02:34.560> my<00:02:34.739> reviews<00:02:35.069> I

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
game now if you know my reviews I

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.949 
game now if you know my reviews I
normally<00:02:35.610> don't<00:02:35.790> talk<00:02:35.940> about<00:02:36.209> music<00:02:36.569> but<00:02:36.900> I

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
normally don't talk about music but I

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.930 
normally don't talk about music but I
have<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.350> admit<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.980> music<00:02:38.280> in<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.489> game<00:02:38.700> was

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
have to admit the music in this game was

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:51.920 
have to admit the music in this game was
actually<00:02:39.300> really<00:02:39.600> good<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.110> catchy

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930

I<00:03:04.250> remember<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.280> was<00:03:05.459> actually<00:03:05.609> humming<00:03:06.090> it

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
I remember I was actually humming it

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.149 
I remember I was actually humming it

Sonic the Hedgehog was and still is a

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.619 
Sonic the Hedgehog was and still is a
fantastic<00:03:23.099> game<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.760> level<00:03:24.030> designs<00:03:24.389> of<00:03:24.569> the

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
fantastic game the level designs of the

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.569 
fantastic game the level designs of the
different<00:03:24.989> zones<00:03:25.019> were<00:03:25.409> pretty<00:03:25.650> good<00:03:25.859> even<00:03:26.489> if

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
different zones were pretty good even if

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:27.979 
different zones were pretty good even if
the<00:03:26.700> level<00:03:26.970> creators<00:03:27.299> got<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.510> little<00:03:27.689> bit<00:03:27.780> lazy

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
the level creators got a little bit lazy

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.929 
the level creators got a little bit lazy
and<00:03:28.290> making<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.709> levels<00:03:28.859> look<00:03:29.069> different<00:03:29.639> now

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 
and making the levels look different now

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:31.520 
and making the levels look different now
