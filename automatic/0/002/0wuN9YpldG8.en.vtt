playing this and i will explain to you

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.270 
playing this and i will explain to you
in<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.019> moment<00:01:04.199> when<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:04.680> actually<00:01:04.799> get<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
in a moment when we actually get to the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.010 
in a moment when we actually get to the
team<00:01:05.430> screen<00:01:05.700> what<00:01:05.970> happened<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:06.900> are

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
team screen what happened so we are

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.660 
team screen what happened so we are
getting<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.320> lot<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.530> duplicates<00:01:08.130> now<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:08.520> well

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
getting a lot of duplicates now as well

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.730 
getting a lot of duplicates now as well
which<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:08.880> quite<00:01:09.180> annoying<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.619> are

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
which is quite annoying and but we are

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.200 
which is quite annoying and but we are
getting<00:01:10.920> some<00:01:11.070> decent<00:01:11.430> poles<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.760> build<00:01:11.970> teams

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
getting some decent poles to build teams

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.480 
getting some decent poles to build teams
in<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.479> future<00:01:12.869> some<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.409> them<00:01:13.530> some<00:01:14.159> players

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
in the future some of them some players

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.950 
in the future some of them some players
you<00:01:14.640> won't<00:01:14.850> see<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.270> series<00:01:15.600> until<00:01:15.869> we

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
you won't see in the series until we

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.480 
you won't see in the series until we
actually<00:01:16.049> get<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.409> full<00:01:16.619> chemistry<00:01:16.979> team<00:01:17.130> are

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
actually get a full chemistry team are

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.030 
actually get a full chemistry team are
even<00:01:18.240> able<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.780> hybridize<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:19.860> hopefully

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
even able to hybridize it but hopefully

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.920 
even able to hybridize it but hopefully
that<00:01:20.369> will<00:01:20.460> come<00:01:20.700> sooner<00:01:21.150> rather<00:01:21.390> than<00:01:21.689> there

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
that will come sooner rather than there

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.830 
that will come sooner rather than there
so<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> final<00:01:23.189> pack<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:23.939> do<00:01:24.060> get<00:01:24.270> beretta<00:01:24.600> who

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
so the final pack we do get beretta who

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.840 
so the final pack we do get beretta who
is<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> Barcelona<00:01:25.979> centre-back<00:01:26.430> maybe<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:26.729> can

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
is a Barcelona centre-back maybe we can

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.219 
is a Barcelona centre-back maybe we can
use<00:01:27.000> him<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.180> chemistry<00:01:27.810> regions<00:01:28.110> as<00:01:28.200> well

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
use him for chemistry regions as well

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.090 
use him for chemistry regions as well
with<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.860> likes<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:30.409> feminine<00:01:31.409> I'm<00:01:31.560> Vermaelen
