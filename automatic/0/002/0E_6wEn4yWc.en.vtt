okay so I'm gonna take a look at the

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.860 
okay so I'm gonna take a look at the
whirlpool<00:00:08.490> chiller<00:00:08.790> here<00:00:09.059> that<00:00:09.210> I<00:00:09.300> just<00:00:09.510> put

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
whirlpool chiller here that I just put

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.459 
whirlpool chiller here that I just put
together<00:00:10.219> this<00:00:11.219> afternoon<00:00:12.049> we're<00:00:13.049> just

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
together this afternoon we're just

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.200 
together this afternoon we're just
coming<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.460> boil<00:00:14.820> now<00:00:15.560> and<00:00:16.560> we've<00:00:16.710> got<00:00:16.920> about

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
coming to a boil now and we've got about

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.010 
coming to a boil now and we've got about
47<00:00:18.210> liters<00:00:19.020> or<00:00:19.230> so<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.740> kettle<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:21.020> I'm

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
47 liters or so in the kettle and I'm

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.450 
47 liters or so in the kettle and I'm
pumping<00:00:22.560> already<00:00:24.470> back<00:00:25.470> up<00:00:25.680> into<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.250> wolf

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
pumping already back up into the wolf

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.479 
pumping already back up into the wolf
alarm<00:00:29.510> it's<00:00:30.510> kind<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.840> hard<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.019> see<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
alarm it's kind of hard to see the

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.790 
alarm it's kind of hard to see the
Whirlpool<00:00:32.489> going<00:00:32.790> but<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.660> down<00:00:33.899> there<00:00:34.110> so

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
Whirlpool going but it is down there so

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:43.910 
Whirlpool going but it is down there so
I'm<00:00:34.890> going<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.840> shut<00:00:36.840> off<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.170> gas<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:43.170> turn

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
I'm going to shut off the gas and turn

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:54.189 
I'm going to shut off the gas and turn
on<00:00:44.100> cold<00:00:44.910> water

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:03.889 

see<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.350> that's<00:00:55.469> started<00:01:00.410> the<00:01:01.410> timer<00:01:02.899> I'll

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
see that that's started the timer I'll

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:14.410 
see that that's started the timer I'll
see<00:01:04.110> how<00:01:04.260> fast<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.830> gets<00:01:04.949> down

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.469 

you<00:01:14.840> can<00:01:14.930> see<00:01:15.110> it's<00:01:15.200> already<00:01:15.320> down<00:01:15.530> to<00:01:15.619> 200<00:01:16.479> you

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
you can see it's already down to 200 you

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.030 
you can see it's already down to 200 you
can<00:01:17.540> really<00:01:18.049> see<00:01:18.229> how<00:01:18.320> fast<00:01:18.590> that's<00:01:18.770> moving

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
can really see how fast that's moving

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:27.810 
can really see how fast that's moving
down

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:35.940 

it's<00:01:28.750> 190<00:01:33.120> and<00:01:34.120> goal<00:01:34.570> is<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:34.960> get<00:01:35.050> it<00:01:35.170> below<00:01:35.350> 120

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
it's 190 and goal is to get it below 120

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:56.380 
it's 190 and goal is to get it below 120
as<00:01:36.190> quickly<00:01:36.460> as<00:01:36.640> possible

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.290 

I<00:01:56.650> tried<00:01:57.650> this<00:01:57.860> by<00:01:58.100> recirculating<00:01:58.940> using<00:01:59.180> my

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
I tried this by recirculating using my

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.960 
I tried this by recirculating using my
25-foot<00:02:00.290> counterflow<00:02:00.710> each<00:02:00.830> other<00:02:01.010> and<00:02:01.850> to

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
25-foot counterflow each other and to

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.120 
25-foot counterflow each other and to
about<00:02:02.150> eight<00:02:02.300> minutes<00:02:02.630> to<00:02:02.780> go<00:02:02.900> from<00:02:03.080> 212<00:02:03.680> to

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
about eight minutes to go from 212 to

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.560 
about eight minutes to go from 212 to
about<00:02:04.550> 190<00:02:06.430> that's<00:02:07.430> just<00:02:07.640> not<00:02:07.790> acceptable<00:02:07.880> to

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
about 190 that's just not acceptable to

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:35.760 
about 190 that's just not acceptable to
me<00:02:18.250> out<00:02:19.250> of<00:02:19.460> 160<00:02:20.200> we've<00:02:21.200> been<00:02:21.350> chilling<00:02:21.620> for

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:43.770 

still<00:02:36.770> kind<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.010> hard<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.250> see<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.520> world<00:02:37.730> war

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.570 

yeah<00:02:44.780> I<00:02:44.810> got<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.140> whirlpool<00:02:45.470> arm<00:02:45.680> kinda<00:02:45.980> not

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
yeah I got the whirlpool arm kinda not

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.280 
yeah I got the whirlpool arm kinda not
in<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.850> middle<00:02:47.150> of<00:02:47.270> it<00:02:47.390> it's<00:02:47.959> in<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.110> middle

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
in the middle of it it's in the middle

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.600 
in the middle of it it's in the middle
of<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.410> kettle<00:02:48.680> I<00:02:48.739> have<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:48.980> solder<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.520> the

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
of the kettle I have to solder it to the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:03:07.890 
of the kettle I have to solder it to the
side<00:02:50.080> at<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.230> bottom<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.590> chiller

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.970 

it's<00:03:08.900> still<00:03:09.110> 140<00:03:13.090> in<00:03:14.379> my<00:03:15.379> groundwater

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
it's still 140 in my groundwater

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.140 
it's still 140 in my groundwater
temperature<00:03:16.400> I<00:03:16.430> measured<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:16.849> before<00:03:17.120> I

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
temperature I measured it before I

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.710 
temperature I measured it before I
started<00:03:17.480> as<00:03:17.650> forty<00:03:18.650> eight<00:03:18.890> point<00:03:19.549> one<00:03:19.819> degrees

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
started as forty eight point one degrees

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:40.880 
started as forty eight point one degrees
Fahrenheit

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:04:12.110 

and<00:03:41.340> that's<00:03:41.520> 130

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.199 

I'm<00:04:13.120> just<00:04:13.329> using<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.659> runoff<00:04:13.959> water<00:04:14.200> to<00:04:15.209> clean

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
I'm just using the runoff water to clean

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:23.070 
I'm just using the runoff water to clean
some<00:04:16.419> kegs<00:04:21.509> let's<00:04:22.509> see

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
some kegs let's see

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.830 
some kegs let's see
so<00:04:23.770> that's<00:04:23.919> 120<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:24.639> we<00:04:24.759> got<00:04:24.940> down<00:04:25.090> to<00:04:25.150> 120<00:04:25.660> in

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
so that's 120 and we got down to 120 in

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.879 
so that's 120 and we got down to 120 in
3<00:04:26.289> minutes<00:04:26.729> and<00:04:28.259> 25<00:04:29.259> seconds<00:04:31.650> now<00:04:32.650> I<00:04:32.680> imagine

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
3 minutes and 25 seconds now I imagine

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.200 
3 minutes and 25 seconds now I imagine
it's<00:04:33.160> gonna<00:04:33.220> take<00:04:35.250> at<00:04:36.250> least<00:04:36.490> that<00:04:36.699> long<00:04:36.759> again

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
it's gonna take at least that long again

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:51.460 
it's gonna take at least that long again
to<00:04:37.389> get<00:04:37.509> down<00:04:37.770> to<00:04:38.770> pitch<00:04:38.949> ball<00:04:39.160> temperatures

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.260 

so<00:04:52.100> all<00:04:52.250> this<00:04:52.370> time<00:04:52.640> that<00:04:52.850> you're<00:04:53.000> using<00:04:53.030> the

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
so all this time that you're using the

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.810 
so all this time that you're using the
CFC<00:04:54.250> on<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.310> ten<00:04:55.550> gallon<00:04:55.700> batch<00:04:56.680> that<00:04:57.820> that

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
CFC on a ten gallon batch that that

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.490 
CFC on a ten gallon batch that that
kettles<00:04:59.180> staying<00:04:59.450> up<00:04:59.570> near<00:04:59.750> boiling<00:05:00.260> and

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
kettles staying up near boiling and

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.010 
kettles staying up near boiling and
you're<00:05:00.650> just<00:05:00.860> continuing<00:05:01.340> to<00:05:01.630> produce<00:05:03.520> DMS

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
you're just continuing to produce DMS

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:11.050 
you're just continuing to produce DMS
precursors<00:05:06.020> and<00:05:07.660> kind<00:05:08.660> of<00:05:08.750> eroding<00:05:09.110> the<00:05:10.060> the

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
precursors and kind of eroding the the

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.400 
precursors and kind of eroding the the
aroma<00:05:11.540> of<00:05:11.890> the<00:05:12.890> last<00:05:13.100> hop<00:05:13.340> addition<00:05:13.790> the<00:05:14.090> zero

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
aroma of the last hop addition the zero

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.570 
aroma of the last hop addition the zero
minute<00:05:15.410> hop<00:05:15.560> addition<00:05:15.950> and<00:05:16.220> that's<00:05:16.370> what<00:05:16.490> I'm

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
minute hop addition and that's what I'm

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:26.260 
minute hop addition and that's what I'm
trying<00:05:16.790> to<00:05:16.820> avoid<00:05:16.940> here<00:05:25.090> anyway<00:05:26.090> I'm<00:05:26.240> not

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
trying to avoid here anyway I'm not

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.190 
trying to avoid here anyway I'm not
gonna<00:05:26.450> let<00:05:26.570> you<00:05:28.570> I'm<00:05:29.570> gonna<00:05:29.690> make<00:05:29.840> you<00:05:29.990> sit
