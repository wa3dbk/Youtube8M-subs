00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
we go like my personal opinion like

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.940 
we go like my personal opinion like
there's<00:01:39.060> nothing<00:01:39.450> else<00:01:40.079> about<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:40.890> just

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
there's nothing else about it it's just

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.639 
there's nothing else about it it's just
my<00:01:41.189> personal<00:01:41.640> opinion<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.210> basically<00:01:42.869> read<00:01:43.350> in

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
my personal opinion so basically read in

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.230 
my personal opinion so basically read in
phase<00:01:43.950> aren't<00:01:44.310> allowed<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.520> set<00:01:44.790> up<00:01:44.909> which<00:01:45.090> is

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
phase aren't allowed to set up which is

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.609 
phase aren't allowed to set up which is
completely<00:01:45.600> okay<00:01:45.930> with<00:01:45.960> me<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.259> don't<00:01:46.530> really

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
completely okay with me I don't really

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.109 
completely okay with me I don't really
have<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.860> problem<00:01:47.070> with<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.460> that's<00:01:47.670> fine<00:01:47.850> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
have a problem with it that's fine and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.260 
have a problem with it that's fine and
that's<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.960> think<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.259> kind<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.439> good<00:01:49.619> that

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
that's I think it's kind of good that

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.609 
that's I think it's kind of good that
phase<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> one<00:01:51.780> team<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.020> doesn't<00:01:52.350> set

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
phase is the one team that doesn't set

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.350 
phase is the one team that doesn't set
up<00:01:52.770> because<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.340> know<00:01:53.430> phases<00:01:53.820> like<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.119> top

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
up because you know phases like the top

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.380 
up because you know phases like the top
like<00:01:54.750> team<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.860> don't<00:01:56.219> know<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:57.210> would<00:01:57.299> only

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
like team and I don't know it would only

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.030 
like team and I don't know it would only
make<00:01:57.509> sense<00:01:57.659> for<00:01:58.049> them<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.380> not<00:01:58.710> set<00:01:58.920> up

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
make sense for them to just not set up

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.289 
make sense for them to just not set up
which<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.310> completely<00:01:59.549> fine<00:01:59.759> I<00:01:59.969> don't<00:02:00.149> have<00:02:00.210> a

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
which is completely fine I don't have a

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.090 
which is completely fine I don't have a
problem<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.719> at<00:02:00.840> all<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:01.079> teams<00:02:01.500> like<00:02:01.770> Oh

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
problem that at all but teams like Oh

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.990 
problem that at all but teams like Oh
base<00:02:02.430> or<00:02:03.649> synergy<00:02:04.649> like<00:02:05.369> they<00:02:05.520> all<00:02:05.640> hit<00:02:05.820> shots

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
base or synergy like they all hit shots

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.960 
base or synergy like they all hit shots
on<00:02:06.180> dummies<00:02:06.509> like<00:02:07.439> not<00:02:07.649> every<00:02:08.099> shot<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.340> set<00:02:08.819> up

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
on dummies like not every shot is set up

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.300

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
really good shots without setting up

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.500 
really good shots without setting up
just<00:02:49.980> because<00:02:50.100> everybody<00:02:50.550> does<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.940> like<00:02:51.360> the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
just because everybody does it like the

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.210 
just because everybody does it like the
standards<00:02:51.960> have<00:02:52.080> risen<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.620> point<00:02:52.860> which

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
standards have risen to that point which

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.460 
standards have risen to that point which
is<00:02:53.250> kind<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.580> why<00:02:53.730> like<00:02:53.970> phase<00:02:54.420> gets<00:02:54.780> some<00:02:55.200> sort

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
is kind of why like phase gets some sort

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.680 
is kind of why like phase gets some sort
of<00:02:55.590> like<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:56.040> backlash<00:02:56.790> from<00:02:57.240> their<00:02:57.450> shots

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
of like a backlash from their shots

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.020 
of like a backlash from their shots
because<00:02:57.990> they<00:02:58.680> don't<00:02:58.890> set<00:02:59.070> up<00:02:59.220> so<00:02:59.460> like<00:02:59.730> some

because they don't set up so like some

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.000 
because they don't set up so like some
of<00:03:00.150> their<00:03:00.210> shots<00:03:00.450> obviously<00:03:00.660> aren't<00:03:01.170> as<00:03:01.470> crazy
