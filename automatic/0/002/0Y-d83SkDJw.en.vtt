right here in the damage and then up
here<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.780> all<00:01:19.050> completely<00:01:19.500> see<00:01:20.070> all<00:01:20.190> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
here this is all completely see all the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.860 
here this is all completely see all the
damage<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.730> there<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.570> some<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
damage of there and so some of the

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.570 
damage of there and so some of the
things<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.080> we<00:01:22.260> recommend<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> co2

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
things that we recommend like a co2

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.640 
things that we recommend like a co2
laser<00:01:24.000> which<00:01:24.240> we're<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.660> see<00:01:24.810> they<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.590> a

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
laser which we're going to see they is a

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.450 
laser which we're going to see they is a
very<00:01:26.010> aggressive<00:01:26.370> laser<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.750> laser<00:01:28.460> goes

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
very aggressive laser this laser goes

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.240 
very aggressive laser this laser goes
deep<00:01:29.820> into<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.240> skin<00:01:30.390> breaks<00:01:31.350> down<00:01:31.530> collagen

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
deep into the skin breaks down collagen

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.740 
deep into the skin breaks down collagen
so<00:01:32.400> your<00:01:32.520> body<00:01:32.730> actually<00:01:32.909> tries<00:01:33.300> to<00:01:33.450> get<00:01:33.630> in

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
so your body actually tries to get in

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.500 
so your body actually tries to get in
and<00:01:33.990> he'll<00:01:34.440> that<00:01:34.740> by<00:01:35.550> doing<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:36.060> when<00:01:36.420> you

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
and he'll that by doing that when you

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.030 
and he'll that by doing that when you
get<00:01:36.659> an<00:01:36.750> increase<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.200> collagen<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.800> you'll

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
get an increase in collagen that you'll

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.180 
get an increase in collagen that you'll
see<00:01:38.690> over<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.810> next<00:01:39.900> three<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.590> nine<00:01:40.770> months

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
see over the next three to nine months

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.640 
see over the next three to nine months
your<00:01:41.430> continue<00:01:42.330> to<00:01:42.450> get<00:01:42.540> better<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.470> also

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
your continue to get better but also

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.460 
your continue to get better but also
retexturizing<00:01:44.720> so<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.990> when<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.230> put<00:01:46.440> your

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
retexturizing so that when you put your
