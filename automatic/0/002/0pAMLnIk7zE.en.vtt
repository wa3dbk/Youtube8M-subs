00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.049
 arachnids what are their prey 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.719
 in which they reproduce from growth as 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:14.030
 deep breath is composed of your body 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.030
 You Find Out Now On The Globe Reporter 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.090
 good night 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.250
 today we will explore the wonderful world 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.720
 from zero to 500 you know a little more 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.720
 about these wonderful creatures 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.500
 spiders ticks mites reviews 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.750
 scorpions among other animals 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.329
 part of the class was wanted and 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.329
 comprise more than 60 thousand species 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.940
 your eyes are simple being able to be 68 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.920
 have four pairs of injured legs you 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.730
 spoke twist beyond two more poles of 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.160
 appendix 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.009
 the first are the delights of the second 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.530
 lar the larvae on the cross have 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:17.690
 only six matches the last step is 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:19.429
 way in the phase of using it are 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.340
 and reproduced by fertilization 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:24.110
 and produce eggs from where they leave the 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.880
 videos and immature but anyway are 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.179
 similar to parents or not 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.179
 metamorphosis 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.439
 the arachnids stripped because the hotels 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.090
 also called lungs, 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.369
 which have lamellas that increase the 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.829
 surface of gas exchange in the individual 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.079
 spiders in addition to other ideas 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:52.240
 although some minor species 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:54.549
 inspiration would run the animals 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.350
 of this class are usually car books 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.539
 being all the predators 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.939
 some species have plans 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:04.119
 inoculant of this poison with which 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.459
 They can kill or mobilize their tusks 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:14.140
 They are captured and killed with his help 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:16.739
 asks for stages and that they digestion occurs 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.599
 partially out of the extracorporeal body 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.750
 occurring through enzymes that will make the 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:25.239
 pre- management is the poison that paralysis 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.650
 skin management facilitating the 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:31.720
 spider digestion has a wide 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:39.850
 inoculator of this poison for each 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:42.400
 it will be your abedi circulatory system 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.590
 that is, capillaries do not exist as 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.780
 we humans 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.790
 arachnids have thigh glands in the 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.930
 base of the faults communicates with the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.850
 eliminating inscriptions with 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.530
 to the poison the scorpions inject 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.020
 from the million 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:04.390
 the spiders through those days and the 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.390
 pseudo scorpion through the sped stage 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.920
 in relation to the most harmful of 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.650
 arachnids the most dangerous areas are 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.480
 those of the genre logo series more known 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.160
 with brown spider 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.030
 there are more than 30 species already 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.190
 cataloged only in america southern 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.260
 genus phoneutria the spiders armadeiras 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.720
 are composed of eight species 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:35.840
 found in the southern americas and 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:38.240
 central of the genus latrodectus the widows 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.440
 which includes 32 species already 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.180
 confirmed 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.310
 a curiosity about this 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.470
 genre is that the name of black grape derives 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.990
 the fact that most of the species 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.120
 gender have practiced sexual cannibalism 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.450
 being that the IMF is now the male after 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.450
 the copulation 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.930
 with regard to the most harmful champions 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.130
 are of the genus Titius the tityus serrulatus 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.010
 popularly known as scorpion 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.080
 yellow test type brazil and beyond 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.060
 also the tite strikes in science 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.950
 known as brown scorpion and 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.950
 found in east and central Brazil 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.479
 you can see in the pictures of a 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:22.609
 spider immobilizing by rolling prey on 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.609
 your web for then morale 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.880
 You travel to see the arachnid universe. 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.470
 end here 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.470
 Thank you for the audience and good evening.
