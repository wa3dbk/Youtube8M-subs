00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.810
 from a sketch to create sports cars 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.700
 is that the mastretta have become 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.370
 in a high production company 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.559
 automotive so talk Carlos 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.370
 mastretta within its participation in 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:20.500
 web 2003 we decided to look when the 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:24.040
 company had a technical strength and 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.590
 good financial we set ourselves the 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.370
 possibility of fulfilling a dream because 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.880
 also at the end of accounts 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:35.070
 to follow our passion was we want 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.210
 make a sports car that we can that 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.810
 we can manufacture and sell efficiently 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:47.320
 so 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:48.760
 we consider ourselves although conditions and high 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.809
 added value 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.480
 there we have examples of this 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:59.339
 industry the whole world the market 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.339
 Car world is like 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.100
 70 million for 1 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.170
 you will imagine that there is a 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.870
 amount of huge market niches 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:16.810
 for all the cars and we saw that 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.900
 more and more in the world there is a taste for 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.700
 niche sports cars and cars 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.380
 people really buy for the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.450
 entertainment more than for the 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.430
 transport and then we said the same thing 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.590
 of us may not be competitive 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.990
 because normally these are 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.200
 facts for tiny companies are 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.630
 medium-tech cars and 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.430
 design but made with techniques from 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.979
 argument and so we think we can be 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.450
 competitive that you see there all are 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.850
 products that is currently manufactured in 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.950
 the world and that many of them have 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.470
 very successful and if you are modern of 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.880
 business we can put into practice 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.070
 continue with old practices in the 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.440
 companies will not allow growth in 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.300

 that shoes fit better so that 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.440

 here we come to learn how to do more 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.070
