00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.040 
should actually tell you that the
vehicle<00:01:28.100> has<00:01:28.310> already<00:01:28.700> been<00:01:29.060> delivered<00:01:29.330> but

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
vehicle has already been delivered but

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.690 
vehicle has already been delivered but
you<00:01:30.200> actually<00:01:30.440> shouldn't<00:01:31.040> see<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.580> little

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
you actually shouldn't see the little

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.970 
you actually shouldn't see the little
icon<00:01:32.300> for<00:01:32.540> your<00:01:32.750> plane<00:01:33.110> or<00:01:33.350> helicopter<00:01:33.380> or

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
icon for your plane or helicopter or

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.160 
icon for your plane or helicopter or
whatever<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:34.370> is<00:01:34.400> on<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:35.270> map<00:01:35.450> if<00:01:35.600> you<00:01:35.720> do<00:01:35.930> see

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
whatever it is on the map if you do see

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.260 
whatever it is on the map if you do see
the<00:01:36.320> icon<00:01:36.740> for<00:01:36.770> it<00:01:37.130> on<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.340> map<00:01:37.610> you've<00:01:38.090> done

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
the icon for it on the map you've done

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.000 
the icon for it on the map you've done
it<00:01:38.330> wrong<00:01:38.540> you<00:01:38.720> will<00:01:38.810> need<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.170> start<00:01:39.500> again<00:01:39.710> so

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
it wrong you will need to start again so

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.050 
it wrong you will need to start again so
like<00:01:40.159> I<00:01:40.190> said<00:01:40.430> you'll<00:01:40.610> know<00:01:40.730> if<00:01:40.820> you've<00:01:40.940> done

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
like I said you'll know if you've done

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.910 
like I said you'll know if you've done
it<00:01:41.120> right<00:01:41.240> if<00:01:41.780> you<00:01:41.930> don't<00:01:42.200> see<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.470> icon<00:01:42.830> on

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
it right if you don't see the icon on

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.010 
it right if you don't see the icon on
the<00:01:42.950> map<00:01:43.159> and<00:01:43.370> Pegasus<00:01:44.330> tells<00:01:44.630> you<00:01:44.780> it's

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
the map and Pegasus tells you it's

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.020 
the map and Pegasus tells you it's
already<00:01:45.470> being<00:01:45.680> delivered<00:01:46.070> if<00:01:46.370> you're<00:01:46.760> doing

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
already being delivered if you're doing

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.880 
already being delivered if you're doing
the<00:01:47.090> plane<00:01:47.330> what<00:01:47.510> you<00:01:47.600> then<00:01:47.810> need<00:01:47.960> to<00:01:48.020> do<00:01:48.260> is<00:01:48.440> go

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
the plane what you then need to do is go

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.920 
the plane what you then need to do is go
to<00:01:48.950> any<00:01:49.370> of<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.670> spawn<00:01:49.970> locations<00:01:50.600> where<00:01:50.810> you

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
to any of the spawn locations where you

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.960 
to any of the spawn locations where you
can<00:01:51.110> spawn<00:01:51.440> and<00:01:51.860> you<00:01:52.130> just<00:01:52.310> need<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.670> search

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
can spawn and you just need to search

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.219 
can spawn and you just need to search
for<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.270> plane<00:01:53.420> because<00:01:53.780> it<00:01:53.900> won't<00:01:54.080> be

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
for the plane because it won't be

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.870 
for the plane because it won't be
appearing<00:01:54.530> on<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:55.010> map<00:01:55.159> because<00:01:55.430> you're<00:01:55.610> in<00:01:55.790> a

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
appearing on the map because you're in a

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.790 
appearing on the map because you're in a
glitch<00:01:56.270> but<00:01:56.960> the<00:01:57.260> plane<00:01:57.470> should<00:01:57.680> have

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
glitch but the plane should have

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.410 
glitch but the plane should have
actually<00:01:57.920> already<00:01:58.310> spawned<00:01:58.820> so<00:01:59.000> like<00:01:59.150> I<00:01:59.180> said

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
actually already spawned so like I said

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.210 
actually already spawned so like I said
search<00:01:59.990> around<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.350> airport<00:02:00.530> for<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.010> plane

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
search around the airport for the plane

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.800 
search around the airport for the plane
there's<00:02:01.460> three<00:02:01.729> possible<00:02:02.210> different<00:02:02.570> spawn

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
there's three possible different spawn

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.870 
there's three possible different spawn
locations<00:02:03.380> of<00:02:03.530> where<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.799> can<00:02:03.920> be<00:02:04.070> I<00:02:04.250> searched

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
locations of where it can be I searched

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.060 
locations of where it can be I searched
all<00:02:05.150> of<00:02:05.360> them<00:02:05.510> here<00:02:05.810> it<00:02:06.080> might<00:02:06.409> not<00:02:06.620> appear<00:02:06.979> the

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
all of them here it might not appear the

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.770 
all of them here it might not appear the
first<00:02:07.400> time<00:02:07.700> you<00:02:07.880> look<00:02:08.090> if<00:02:08.239> it's<00:02:08.390> not<00:02:08.599> that

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
first time you look if it's not that

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.660 
first time you look if it's not that
just<00:02:08.989> keep<00:02:09.409> going<00:02:09.679> around<00:02:09.769> from<00:02:10.159> each<00:02:10.310> spawn

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
just keep going around from each spawn

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.240 
just keep going around from each spawn
location<00:02:11.239> until<00:02:11.780> it<00:02:11.930> does<00:02:12.080> eventually<00:02:12.290> spawn

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
location until it does eventually spawn

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.490 
location until it does eventually spawn
once<00:02:13.909> the<00:02:14.060> vehicle<00:02:14.420> eventually<00:02:14.690> spawns<00:02:15.350> in

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
once the vehicle eventually spawns in

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.870 
once the vehicle eventually spawns in
which<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:15.830> found<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:16.280> what<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:16.490> then<00:02:16.700> need<00:02:16.819> to

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
which you found it what you then need to

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.059 
which you found it what you then need to
do<00:02:17.030> is<00:02:17.209> get<00:02:17.450> inside<00:02:18.050> of<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.410> just<00:02:18.770> drive

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
do is get inside of it and just drive

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.910 
do is get inside of it and just drive
away<00:02:19.280> from<00:02:19.670> it

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
away from it

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.830 
away from it
spawn<00:02:20.130> location<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:20.910> just<00:02:21.150> fire<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.360> little<00:02:21.720> bit

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
spawn location so just fire a little bit

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.839 
spawn location so just fire a little bit
away<00:02:22.050> from<00:02:22.080> its<00:02:22.770> spawn<00:02:23.040> location<00:02:23.580> so<00:02:23.790> you

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
away from its spawn location so you

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.089 
away from its spawn location so you
actually<00:02:24.030> can't<00:02:24.510> see<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.930> anymore<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.920> just

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
actually can't see it anymore so just

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.830 
actually can't see it anymore so just
like<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.250> said<00:02:26.520> fly<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.819> little<00:02:27.000> better<00:02:27.300> way<00:02:27.480> than

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
like I said fly a little better way than

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.210 
like I said fly a little better way than
what<00:02:27.989> you've<00:02:28.140> got<00:02:28.290> far<00:02:28.560> enough<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:28.890> just<00:02:29.069> need

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
what you've got far enough you just need

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.100 
what you've got far enough you just need
to<00:02:29.310> turn<00:02:29.489> around<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.000> go<00:02:30.060> back<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.690> its<00:02:30.840> spawn

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
to turn around and go back to its spawn

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.839 
to turn around and go back to its spawn
location<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.040> should<00:02:32.220> actually<00:02:32.370> notice

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
location and you should actually notice

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.790 
location and you should actually notice
it's<00:02:33.030> duplicated<00:02:33.660> itself<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.230> it's<00:02:34.560> still

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
it's duplicated itself and it's still

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.380 
it's duplicated itself and it's still
waiting<00:02:35.190> at<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.340> spawn<00:02:35.580> location<00:02:36.030> but<00:02:36.239> you

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
waiting at the spawn location but you

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.120 
waiting at the spawn location but you
are<00:02:36.540> already<00:02:36.959> in<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.319> jet<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.770> just<00:02:37.980> keep

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
are already in the jet and you just keep

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.280 
are already in the jet and you just keep
repeating<00:02:38.280> this<00:02:38.640> over<00:02:38.819> and<00:02:39.390> over<00:02:39.630> again<00:02:39.930> you

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
repeating this over and over again you

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.290 
repeating this over and over again you
get<00:02:40.500> back<00:02:40.680> in<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.920> jet<00:02:41.100> at<00:02:41.220> spawn<00:02:41.489> fly<00:02:42.060> away<00:02:42.090> a

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
get back in the jet at spawn fly away a

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.030 
get back in the jet at spawn fly away a
bit<00:02:42.540> come<00:02:42.810> back<00:02:43.020> you'll<00:02:43.470> notice<00:02:43.680> it's

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
bit come back you'll notice it's

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.979 
bit come back you'll notice it's
duplicated<00:02:44.670> itself<00:02:44.970> again<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.720> can<00:02:45.840> just

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
duplicated itself again and you can just

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.690 
duplicated itself again and you can just
keep<00:02:46.140> doing<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.470> over<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.800> over<00:02:47.010> again<00:02:47.400> you

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
keep doing it over and over again you

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.740 
keep doing it over and over again you
can<00:02:47.850> let<00:02:48.000> your<00:02:48.090> friends<00:02:48.480> get<00:02:48.600> in<00:02:48.630> the

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
can let your friends get in the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.720 
can let your friends get in the
duplicated<00:02:49.319> versions<00:02:49.709> even<00:02:50.340> if<00:02:50.459> they<00:02:50.580> don't
