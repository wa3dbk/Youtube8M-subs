00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.310 
this mice kind of style of this series
is<00:01:21.880> unique<00:01:22.390> just<00:01:22.659> because<00:01:22.930> I<00:01:23.049> go<00:01:23.170> into

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
is unique just because I go into

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.120

that<00:05:39.370> makes<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.819> series<00:05:40.270> unique<00:05:40.539> just

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
that makes the series unique just

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.740 
that makes the series unique just
because<00:05:41.050> you<00:05:41.410> know<00:05:41.530> it's<00:05:41.770> not<00:05:42.099> as<00:05:42.280> easy<00:05:42.629> and<00:05:43.629> I

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
because you know it's not as easy and I

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.710 
because you know it's not as easy and I
can<00:05:43.960> have<00:05:44.080> you<00:05:44.139> know<00:05:44.349> um<00:05:45.150> the<00:05:46.150> odds<00:05:46.300> against<00:05:46.629> me
