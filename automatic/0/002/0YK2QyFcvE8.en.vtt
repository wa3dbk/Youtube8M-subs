inches wide that's the end of the reason

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.920 
inches wide that's the end of the reason
for<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.850> that's<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.240> stock<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:10.490> so

what I want to do now is even though
this<00:01:18.960> maple<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.560> really<00:01:19.890> hard<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.720> it<00:01:21.720> still

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
this maple is really hard and it still

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.840 
this maple is really hard and it still
wears<00:01:22.320> out<00:01:22.619> especially<00:01:22.860> along<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.490> top<00:01:23.820> edge

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
wears out especially along the top edge

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.210 
wears out especially along the top edge
so<00:01:24.360> what<00:01:24.509> I'm<00:01:24.630> going<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.810> do<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.320> I'm<00:01:26.009> going<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
make a rabbet in the top of each each

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.280 
make a rabbet in the top of each each
jaw<00:01:30.509> all<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.530> way<00:01:31.740> one<00:01:32.479> about<00:01:33.479> an<00:01:33.869> inch<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.229> a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
jaw all the way one about an inch and a

jaw all the way one about an inch and a
half<00:01:34.320> deep<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.659> half<00:01:36.659> inch<00:01:36.900> thick<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.409> that

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
half deep and half inch thick and that

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.749 
half deep and half inch thick and that
part<00:01:38.729> will<00:01:38.850> get<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:40.579> screw<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.759> jaw<00:01:42.060> another

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
part will get a screw in jaw another

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.090 
part will get a screw in jaw another
sacrificial<00:01:44.759> piece<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.119> could<00:01:45.299> say<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:46.740> what

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
sacrificial piece you could say so what

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.910 
sacrificial piece you could say so what
happens<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.670> after<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.930> much<00:01:49.079> use<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.560> edge<00:01:49.740> of

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
happens is after so much use the edge of

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.069 
happens is after so much use the edge of
this<00:01:50.130> gets<00:01:50.399> worn<00:01:50.700> down<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.500> if<00:01:53.450> if<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.810> jaw<00:01:55.020> is

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
this gets worn down and if if the jaw is

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.340 
this gets worn down and if if the jaw is
a<00:01:55.290> one-piece<00:01:55.680> all<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.219> thing<00:01:56.430> like<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.820> then

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
a one-piece all the thing like this then

do<00:02:45.660> is<00:02:45.780> I'll<00:02:45.900> make<00:02:46.050> another<00:02:46.319> cut<00:02:46.590> this<00:02:47.310> way<00:02:47.550> to

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
do is I'll make another cut this way to

00:02:47.610 --> 00:03:02.090 
do is I'll make another cut this way to
remove<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.360> piece<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.900> material

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.980 

each<00:03:03.100> have<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.340> look<00:03:03.610> at<00:03:03.700> that<00:03:03.850> that's<00:03:04.120> that's

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
each have a look at that that's that's

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:24.170 
each have a look at that that's that's
good<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:05.590> like<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:21.690> that's<00:03:22.690> it<00:03:22.990> just<00:03:23.440> need<00:03:23.740> to

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
good I like that that's it just need to

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.700 
good I like that that's it just need to
cut<00:03:25.180> new<00:03:25.390> job<00:03:25.630> parts<00:03:26.050> that<00:03:26.230> go<00:03:26.350> in<00:03:26.500> there

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
cut new job parts that go in there

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.140 
cut new job parts that go in there
obviously<00:03:27.430> these<00:03:27.580> two<00:03:27.640> too<00:03:27.910> small<00:03:28.150> now<00:03:28.330> but

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
obviously these two too small now but

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.450 
obviously these two too small now but
gonna<00:03:31.150> be<00:03:31.330> like<00:03:32.200> three<00:03:32.470> screws<00:03:32.770> holding<00:03:33.160> it<00:03:33.250> in

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
gonna be like three screws holding it in

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.290 
gonna be like three screws holding it in
and<00:03:34.590> if<00:03:35.590> they<00:03:35.800> get<00:03:35.980> worn<00:03:36.220> out<00:03:36.430> or<00:03:36.670> beat<00:03:36.850> up<00:03:37.030> and

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
and if they get worn out or beat up and

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.100 
and if they get worn out or beat up and
I<00:03:37.360> can<00:03:37.540> just<00:03:37.720> replace<00:03:38.050> them<00:03:39.840> there<00:03:40.840> are<00:03:40.960> some

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
I can just replace them there are some

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.220 
I can just replace them there are some
of<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.350> major<00:03:41.530> parts<00:03:42.100> of<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.520> vise<00:03:43.390> that<00:03:43.900> make

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
of the major parts of the vise that make

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.070 
of the major parts of the vise that make
it<00:03:45.600> so<00:03:46.600> that<00:03:46.630> it's<00:03:47.080> quick<00:03:47.350> release<00:03:48.900> these<00:03:49.900> are

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
it so that it's quick release these are

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.270 
it so that it's quick release these are
the<00:03:51.180> jobs<00:03:52.180> made<00:03:52.420> previously<00:03:53.080> with<00:03:53.350> with<00:03:54.160> the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
the jobs made previously with with the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.180 
the jobs made previously with with the
nuts<00:03:54.490> I<00:03:54.820> cut<00:03:55.420> off<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.570> short<00:03:55.960> length<00:03:56.290> of<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.830> one

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
nuts I cut off a short length of the one

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.310 
nuts I cut off a short length of the one
inch<00:03:57.400> story<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.850> ride<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.210> foot<00:03:58.420> in<00:03:58.540> here<00:03:58.810> so<00:03:59.290> I

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
inch story to ride the foot in here so I

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.200 
inch story to ride the foot in here so I
can<00:03:59.470> get<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.710> proper<00:03:59.920> spacing<00:04:00.340> what<00:04:01.000> they<00:04:01.150> do

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
can get the proper spacing what they do

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.560 
can get the proper spacing what they do
is<00:04:02.280> just<00:04:03.280> sit<00:04:03.400> on<00:04:03.490> this<00:04:03.640> part<00:04:03.940> here<00:04:04.180> this<00:04:04.420> is

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
is just sit on this part here this is

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.199 
is just sit on this part here this is
actually<00:04:04.959> the<00:04:05.140> underside<00:04:05.700> this<00:04:06.700> would<00:04:06.940> be<00:04:07.090> the

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
actually the underside this would be the

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.330 
actually the underside this would be the
bottom<00:04:07.390> and<00:04:07.840> then<00:04:08.350> this<00:04:08.620> part<00:04:08.920> would<00:04:09.040> sit<00:04:09.220> on

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
bottom and then this part would sit on

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:19.620 
bottom and then this part would sit on
top<00:04:11.940> so<00:04:12.940> that<00:04:16.230> these<00:04:17.230> parts<00:04:17.940> these<00:04:18.940> parts<00:04:19.000> here

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
top so that these parts these parts here

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.330 
top so that these parts these parts here
the<00:04:19.810> jaws<00:04:20.080> would<00:04:22.050> I'm<00:04:23.050> calling<00:04:23.500> on<00:04:23.650> jaws<00:04:23.890> for

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
the jaws would I'm calling on jaws for

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.240 
the jaws would I'm calling on jaws for
for<00:04:24.700> want<00:04:24.910> of<00:04:25.090> a<00:04:25.210> better<00:04:25.240> term<00:04:25.810> I<00:04:26.440> mean<00:04:26.470> these

through this part and get double nothing
on<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:47.919> bottom<00:04:48.100> they<00:04:48.820> will<00:04:48.970> go<00:04:49.090> right<00:04:49.120> through

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
on the bottom they will go right through

will<00:04:55.120> pivot<00:04:55.480> on<00:04:55.600> it<00:04:55.750> and<00:04:56.820> they<00:04:57.820> go<00:04:58.440> 3/4<00:04:59.440> of<00:04:59.590> an

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
will pivot on it and they go 3/4 of an

will pivot on it and they go 3/4 of an
inch<00:04:59.830> in<00:05:00.100> from<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.430> edge<00:05:00.550> and<00:05:01.860> about<00:05:02.860> an<00:05:03.190> inch

inch in from the edge and about an inch

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.709 
inch in from the edge and about an inch
in<00:05:04.540> from<00:05:05.410> the

and it's not about it is actually an
inch<00:05:11.029> why<00:05:11.659> do<00:05:11.719> I<00:05:11.869> say<00:05:12.139> about<00:05:12.289> what<00:05:12.499> I<00:05:12.709> mean<00:05:12.979> is

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:16.269 

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:20.139 

precise<00:05:17.269> here<00:05:18.039> same<00:05:19.039> on<00:05:19.219> the<00:05:19.309> others<00:05:19.549> on<00:05:19.729> the

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:20.149 
precise here same on the others on the

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:22.509 
precise here same on the others on the
other<00:05:20.179> one<00:05:20.569> that's<00:05:20.749> got<00:05:20.959> the<00:05:21.110> same<00:05:21.369> kind<00:05:22.369> of

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:22.519 
other one that's got the same kind of

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:26.439 
other one that's got the same kind of
deal<00:05:23.679> now<00:05:24.679> what<00:05:25.099> I<00:05:25.129> need<00:05:25.249> to<00:05:25.519> do<00:05:25.669> is<00:05:26.029> I<00:05:26.239> need<00:05:26.419> to

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
deal now what I need to do is I need to

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.299 
deal now what I need to do is I need to
clamp<00:05:26.809> these<00:05:26.989> parts<00:05:27.409> together<00:05:27.589> and<00:05:27.889> then

00:05:28.299 --> 00:05:28.309 
clamp these parts together and then

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:30.909 
clamp these parts together and then
drill<00:05:28.639> half<00:05:29.479> inch<00:05:29.779> holes<00:05:30.019> right<00:05:30.409> through<00:05:30.739> this

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
drill half inch holes right through this

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.249 
drill half inch holes right through this
whole<00:05:30.979> thing<00:05:31.749> that's<00:05:32.749> going<00:05:32.959> to<00:05:33.019> be<00:05:33.110> the

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:33.259 
whole thing that's going to be the

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:36.459 
whole thing that's going to be the
easiest<00:05:33.559> way<00:05:33.799> to<00:05:33.829> line<00:05:34.189> it<00:05:34.219> up<00:05:34.459> so<00:05:35.229> I've<00:05:36.229> got

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:36.469 
easiest way to line it up so I've got

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:40.569 
easiest way to line it up so I've got
this<00:05:37.089> piece<00:05:38.089> of<00:05:38.300> plywood<00:05:39.050> clamp<00:05:39.709> that<00:05:40.039> put<00:05:40.459> in

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:40.579 
this piece of plywood clamp that put in

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:44.919 
this piece of plywood clamp that put in
here<00:05:40.939> just<00:05:41.869> as<00:05:42.019> a<00:05:42.050> spacer<00:05:42.679> I've<00:05:43.129> got<00:05:43.429> my<00:05:43.929> piece

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:44.929 
here just as a spacer I've got my piece

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:49.359 
here just as a spacer I've got my piece
of<00:05:45.139> threaded<00:05:45.469> rod<00:05:45.649> inside<00:05:47.259> to<00:05:48.259> give<00:05:48.860> them<00:05:49.039> the

00:05:49.359 --> 00:05:49.369 
of threaded rod inside to give them the

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:53.799 
of threaded rod inside to give them the
correct<00:05:49.639> spacing<00:05:49.939> also<00:05:51.789> these<00:05:52.789> really<00:05:53.539> should

00:05:53.799 --> 00:05:53.809 
correct spacing also these really should

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:58.449 
correct spacing also these really should
be<00:05:54.050> flush<00:05:54.669> with<00:05:55.669> the<00:05:55.849> back<00:05:56.029> here<00:05:57.099> flush<00:05:58.099> on<00:05:58.309> the

00:05:58.449 --> 00:05:58.459 
be flush with the back here flush on the

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:02.019 
be flush with the back here flush on the
end<00:05:58.639> and<00:05:59.919> then<00:06:00.919> what<00:06:01.219> I'll<00:06:01.339> do<00:06:01.489> is<00:06:01.519> I'll<00:06:01.759> clamp

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:02.029 
end and then what I'll do is I'll clamp

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:04.229 
end and then what I'll do is I'll clamp
these<00:06:02.300> together<00:06:02.509> and<00:06:02.899> I'll<00:06:03.019> drill<00:06:03.289> through

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:04.239 
these together and I'll drill through

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:06.579 
these together and I'll drill through
okay<00:06:05.239> I've<00:06:05.329> got<00:06:05.479> a<00:06:05.509> half-inch<00:06:06.019> Brad<00:06:06.319> point

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:06.589 
okay I've got a half-inch Brad point

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:10.389 
okay I've got a half-inch Brad point
drill<00:06:07.279> bit<00:06:07.489> in<00:06:07.669> the<00:06:08.559> drill<00:06:09.559> press<00:06:09.709> here<00:06:10.129> and

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:10.399 
drill bit in the drill press here and

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:12.489 
drill bit in the drill press here and
I'm<00:06:10.639> going<00:06:10.789> to<00:06:10.879> drill<00:06:11.209> through<00:06:11.959> these<00:06:12.169> I've

00:06:12.489 --> 00:06:12.499 
I'm going to drill through these I've

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:16.029 
I'm going to drill through these I've
got<00:06:12.579> these<00:06:13.579> clamp<00:06:13.969> down<00:06:14.239> with<00:06:14.599> serious<00:06:15.349> clamp

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 
got these clamp down with serious clamp

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:17.859 
got these clamp down with serious clamp
pressure<00:06:16.279> I<00:06:16.519> don't<00:06:16.579> want<00:06:16.939> these<00:06:17.089> to<00:06:17.300> move<00:06:17.509> and

00:06:17.859 --> 00:06:17.869 
pressure I don't want these to move and

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:19.449 
pressure I don't want these to move and
I<00:06:18.079> really<00:06:18.409> can't<00:06:18.619> get<00:06:18.800> back<00:06:18.949> there<00:06:19.219> with<00:06:19.249> the

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:19.459 
I really can't get back there with the

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:22.239 
I really can't get back there with the
clamp<00:06:19.729> and<00:06:19.969> it<00:06:20.569> closer<00:06:20.809> so<00:06:21.319> I've<00:06:21.919> got<00:06:22.129> these

00:06:22.239 --> 00:06:22.249 
clamp and it closer so I've got these

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:30.219 
clamp and it closer so I've got these
really<00:06:22.610> tightly<00:06:23.029> clamped<00:06:23.419> down<00:06:24.519> so<00:06:29.229> these

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
really tightly clamped down so these

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:33.790 
really tightly clamped down so these
really<00:06:30.619> need<00:06:30.949> to<00:06:31.129> be<00:06:31.249> straight<00:06:31.579> you<00:06:32.479> know<00:06:33.199> I'm

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
really need to be straight you know I'm

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.359 
really need to be straight you know I'm
not<00:06:34.099> talking<00:06:34.449> I'm<00:06:35.449> not<00:06:35.509> talking<00:06:36.050> nasa

00:06:36.359 --> 00:06:36.369 
not talking I'm not talking nasa

00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:39.519 
not talking I'm not talking nasa
precision<00:06:37.369> here<00:06:37.579> or<00:06:37.729> anything<00:06:37.999> but<00:06:38.529> straight

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:39.529 
precision here or anything but straight

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:41.959 
precision here or anything but straight
is<00:06:39.739> good

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:41.969 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:07:18.560 

you

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:18.570 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.510 

hopefully<00:07:19.570> that<00:07:19.780> would<00:07:20.190> it's<00:07:21.190> close<00:07:21.490> to

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 
hopefully that would it's close to

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.130 
hopefully that would it's close to
coming<00:07:21.880> through<00:07:22.180> I<00:07:22.240> can<00:07:22.510> finish<00:07:22.660> the<00:07:22.900> layout

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.140 
coming through I can finish the layout

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.610 
coming through I can finish the layout
by<00:07:23.350> hand<00:07:23.590> that's<00:07:24.430> not<00:07:24.640> a<00:07:24.670> big<00:07:24.910> deal<00:07:25.440> the<00:07:26.440> rest

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:26.620 
by hand that's not a big deal the rest

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:32.010 
by hand that's not a big deal the rest
of<00:07:26.770> the<00:07:26.830> whole<00:07:27.010> can<00:07:27.220> guide<00:07:27.430> it<00:07:30.750> let's<00:07:31.750> drill

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.020 
of the whole can guide it let's drill

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:37.260 
of the whole can guide it let's drill
the<00:07:32.170> other<00:07:32.200> one<00:07:35.550> okay<00:07:36.550> so<00:07:36.580> those<00:07:36.910> are<00:07:36.970> drill

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:37.270 
the other one okay so those are drill

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.760 
the other one okay so those are drill
most<00:07:37.510> of<00:07:37.660> the<00:07:37.750> way<00:07:37.840> through<00:07:38.050> I'll<00:07:38.260> put<00:07:38.440> this<00:07:38.560> in

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:38.770 
most of the way through I'll put this in

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.410 
most of the way through I'll put this in
that<00:07:38.950> in<00:07:39.160> the<00:07:39.310> hand<00:07:39.520> drill<00:07:39.730> and<00:07:40.000> I'll<00:07:40.120> drill

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:40.420 
that in the hand drill and I'll drill

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.900 
that in the hand drill and I'll drill
the<00:07:40.930> rest<00:07:41.110> of<00:07:41.260> the<00:07:41.320> way<00:07:41.440> through<00:07:41.800> to<00:07:42.550> complete

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:42.910 
the rest of the way through to complete

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.120 
the rest of the way through to complete
them
