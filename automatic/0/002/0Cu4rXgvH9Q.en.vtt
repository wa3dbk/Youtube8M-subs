method<00:00:03.300> of<00:00:03.689> developing<00:00:04.470> surfaces<00:00:05.100> this<00:00:05.940> is

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
method of developing surfaces this is

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.560 
method of developing surfaces this is
the<00:00:06.509> radial<00:00:06.990> line<00:00:07.259> development<00:00:07.890> method<00:00:08.519> it<00:00:09.360> is

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
the radial line development method it is

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.169 
the radial line development method it is
used<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.110> get<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.469> development<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.370> objects

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
etc here the apex of the object is

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.380
