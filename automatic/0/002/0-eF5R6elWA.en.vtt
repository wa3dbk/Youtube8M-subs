00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 to exemplify the integral form and 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.170
 technified in that it can be managed 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.480
 a farm we will know how to 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.300
 develops the swine activity in the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.730
 I build the silence where apart from 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.070
 having the right technology 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.590
 puts special emphasis on the management of 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.650
 waste and environmental conservation 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.650
 ambient 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.660
 this is a farm that has 260 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.690
 bellies 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.989
 is full cycle that means that 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.930
 we have the females 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.730
 here piglet is born and here it gets fat and it 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.760
 sends drag when it reaches its weight 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.580
 from the market we receive the female 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.530
 the mother of the improvement center 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.040
 genetic of apogua when it has 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.590
 around 14 weeks of age and enters 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.410
 to a quarantine process there is 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.199
 around three and a half months four 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.200
 months is getting caught up in his plan 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.680
 vaccination your vaccination program your 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.399
 feeding program and we take you 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.729
 all its controls that female enters the 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:14.369
 stone already as a breeding female 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:17.970
 when you have about 30 weeks of 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.210
 age has presented two jealousies and has 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.660
 around about 320 pounds in weight and 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.690
 It is a female that is going to be inseminated 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:31.050
 when he presents the third zeal 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.810
 from there we wait 21 days to see if we 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.410
 cycle again and we put a 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.320
 program in that data to calculate that 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:45.980
 she will have her first birth at 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:48.660
 114 days old I was already going to motherhood 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.870
 let me tell you before going to the 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:56.220
 maternity five days before that female 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:58.940
 is well bathed disinfected to go to the 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.040
 birthing room there in the delivery room 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.100
 has his attentions both the female 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.830
 like the day piglet is born with heat 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.700
 that heat we provide it 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.160
 of burning methane gas that is produced with 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.970
 the excreta to the zero here in the farm the 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.410
 lactation is around 19 to 21 days 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.930
 old 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.570
 after this the mother is removed and 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.550
 we realize what is the chaos or 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.440
 weaning 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.370
 the female returns to the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.910
 gestation and the piglet cited goes to the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.190
 weaning section from there the female is 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.000
 again served is a cycle 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.660
 closed at 114 days will give birth to another 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.130
 Once we believe that a good parameter 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.470
 reproductive is that female has 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:56.250
 about 2.3 2.4 deliveries per year and 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:59.730
 that we wean 11 piglets for each 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:03.570
 childbirth that has had after us 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:07.290
 we are going to the market with that 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:10.560
 pig around 22 to 23 weeks of 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:14.610
 age with an average weight of about 230 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.310
 240 pounds since the piglet was born 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.630
 third fourth day of age we already give what 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.280
 who is a pre-initiator 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.470
 that's about 18 days that the 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.550
 we supply then change to another 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:34.240
 phase each phase change involves a 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.070
 new concentrate that obviously between 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.900
 the animal grows its 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.390
 nutritional requirements go 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.270
 changing are different and each 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.750
 phase is elaborated with a content of 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:49.210
 different protein in some phases the 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.720
 animals allow one to go 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.790
 substituting those serials for some 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.850
 green plants that are highly 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:02.410
 nutritious here on the farm we 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:05.530
 we are trying to innovate towards those 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.620
 plants we use the chaya that also 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.460
 a plant is used in humans 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:16.239
 about 36% protein that 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:19.209
 we can use in pregnant animals as 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.950
 in animals in finalization also 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.650
 we have the ramirez that is around 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:28.030
 20 percent protein 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:32.169
 the mulberry and now we have just started 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.030
 to venture into the field of a plant 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.430
 that is called nacedero that is around 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.380
 of 21 percent protein 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.150
 in the case of this farm we can 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.580
 observe that solid rights and 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.170
 liquids are reused what we 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.300
 shows that if it is possible to be 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.970
 productive in a friendly way with the 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.790
 environment what for many people 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:56.570
 it can be a problem we have 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.940
 made of that a benefit let's talk about the 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.760
 excreta of the pig of the sow za el 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.760
 manure that produces the pig us 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.050
 we collect as much as possible in 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:12.310
 dry is to do dance has several ways 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:16.210
 as a fattening bovine ingestion as 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.210
 fertilizer in coffee plantations 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.650
 as part of the intake of the 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.590
 worms already when we wash 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.040
 the stretches that water we the 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:33.390
 We take biodigesters around 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:36.590
 of 8 biodigesters there what generates what 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:41.400
 that generate bacteria is methane gas 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:45.240
 we use it or in heating for 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.130
 the piglets of motherhood that yes 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.980
 they need heat because they when 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:53.790
 they are born are low in energy and also 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:56.550
 we use that methane gas to generate 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:59.990
 electrical energy from a generator that 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:04.190
 produces 35 kilowatt hours 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:08.270
 and also for combustion in replacing 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:10.670
 the wood in the kitchen of the farm that we 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:14.060
 has done to bring this first to have 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.950
 environmental awareness to care what 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.680
 God gave us to take care of the water table 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:21.830
 to take care of water sources like rivers 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.820
 and lakes be more efficient and respect 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.820
 our environment
