the country but I think we should expect
more<00:01:12.299> out<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.479> our<00:01:12.689> wrestlers<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.080> hopefully

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
more out of our wrestlers and hopefully

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.770

think you know
time<00:02:05.270> for<00:02:05.450> us<00:02:05.510> to<00:02:05.540> get<00:02:05.720> back<00:02:05.750> on<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.110> podium

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
time for us to get back on the podium

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.590 
time for us to get back on the podium
again<00:02:06.530> it's<00:02:06.920> time<00:02:07.100> for<00:02:07.340> us<00:02:07.430> to<00:02:07.460> you'll<00:02:08.240> lead<00:02:08.450> by

again it's time for us to you'll lead by
example<00:02:08.720> in<00:02:09.170> America<00:02:09.590> you<00:02:09.710> know<00:02:09.770> heavyweights

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
example in America you know heavyweights

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.650 
example in America you know heavyweights
have<00:02:10.280> always<00:02:10.550> been<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.880> big<00:02:11.060> dominant<00:02:11.510> group

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
have always been the big dominant group

have always been the big dominant group
and<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:12.080> think<00:02:12.590> it's<00:02:12.680> time<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:12.950> continue<00:02:13.340> that

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
and I think it's time to continue that

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.630 
and I think it's time to continue that
and<00:02:14.360> as<00:02:14.840> far<00:02:15.350> as<00:02:15.410> bringing<00:02:15.680> your<00:02:15.950> way<00:02:16.070> down<00:02:16.310> I

never done before in competition if it
works<00:04:56.080> here<00:04:56.560> those<00:04:57.280> could<00:04:57.520> be<00:04:57.550> the<00:04:57.699> techniques

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
works here those could be the techniques

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.610

that<00:04:58.240> you<00:04:58.419> use<00:04:58.449> at<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.050> Olympics<00:04:59.410> of<00:04:59.500> this

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
that you use at the Olympics of this

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.580 
that you use at the Olympics of this
year<00:04:59.770> in<00:04:59.860> 2012<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:00.850> so<00:05:01.180> I<00:05:01.419> think<00:05:01.900> a<00:05:02.080> term<00:05:02.410> like

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
year in 2012 and so I think a term like

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.710 
year in 2012 and so I think a term like
this<00:05:02.889> you<00:05:03.130> know<00:05:03.250> 23<00:05:04.210> months<00:05:04.360> before<00:05:04.630> the

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
this you know 23 months before the

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.029 
this you know 23 months before the
olympic<00:05:04.990> trials<00:05:05.169> is<00:05:05.380> something<00:05:05.710> good<00:05:05.889> because

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
olympic trials is something good because

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.040 
olympic trials is something good because
it<00:05:06.340> takes<00:05:06.520> all<00:05:06.729> the<00:05:06.880> pressure<00:05:06.910> off<00:05:07.300> you<00:05:07.570> now

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
it takes all the pressure off you now

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.270 
it takes all the pressure off you now
it's<00:05:08.260> just<00:05:08.320> an<00:05:08.500> opportunity<00:05:08.680> to<00:05:09.010> go<00:05:09.100> out<00:05:09.130> there

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
it's just an opportunity to go out there

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.000 
it's just an opportunity to go out there
and<00:05:09.610> try<00:05:10.120> things<00:05:10.270> that<00:05:11.260> hopefully<00:05:11.680> can<00:05:11.710> help

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
and try things that hopefully can help

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.600 
and try things that hopefully can help
you<00:05:12.100> win<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.610> make<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.300> Olympic<00:05:13.570> team
