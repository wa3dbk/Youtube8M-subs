00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.339 
my recommendations is to be very very
careful<00:04:08.019> whenever<00:04:08.890> you<00:04:09.280> fuel<00:04:09.640> your<00:04:09.670> car<00:04:10.349> to

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
careful whenever you fuel your car to

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.410 
careful whenever you fuel your car to
look<00:04:11.890> on<00:04:12.129> there<00:04:12.340> and<00:04:12.489> make<00:04:12.640> sure<00:04:12.790> you're

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
look on there and make sure you're

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.159 
look on there and make sure you're
pulling<00:04:13.629> the<00:04:13.780> right<00:04:13.959> lever<00:04:15.810> I'm<00:04:16.810> not<00:04:16.930> telling

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
pulling the right lever I'm not telling

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.140 
pulling the right lever I'm not telling
you<00:04:17.199> that<00:04:17.260> that's<00:04:17.470> a<00:04:17.650> fix<00:04:17.949> but<00:04:18.280> it's<00:04:19.079> it's<00:04:20.079> a

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
you that that's a fix but it's it's a

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.070 
you that that's a fix but it's it's a
something<00:04:22.150> that<00:04:22.330> you<00:04:22.419> can<00:04:22.570> do<00:04:22.690> until<00:04:23.020> you

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
something that you can do until you

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.180 
something that you can do until you
until<00:04:23.530> they<00:04:23.800> get<00:04:23.919> this<00:04:24.040> thing<00:04:24.100> remedied<00:04:25.979> and<00:04:26.979> I

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
until they get this thing remedied and I

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.029 
until they get this thing remedied and I
I'll<00:04:27.580> show<00:04:27.820> you<00:04:27.910> my<00:04:28.090> Nissan<00:04:28.479> my<00:04:29.229> Nissan<00:04:29.590> Altima

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
I'll show you my Nissan my Nissan Altima

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:41.340 
I'll show you my Nissan my Nissan Altima
here

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:55.780 

like<00:04:42.350> I<00:04:42.470> said<00:04:42.530> I<00:04:42.680> have<00:04:42.920> a<00:04:42.950> habit<00:04:43.570> 2014

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.120 

okay<00:04:56.790> what<00:04:57.000> it<00:04:57.120> is<00:04:57.270> is<00:04:57.570> the<00:04:57.900> older<00:04:58.290> models<00:04:58.680> the

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
okay what it is is the older models the

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.400 
okay what it is is the older models the
one<00:04:59.340> before<00:04:59.550> you<00:04:59.910> know<00:04:59.940> 2012<00:05:00.840> and<00:05:01.050> before

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
one before you know 2012 and before

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.970 
one before you know 2012 and before
would<00:05:02.310> have<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:03.290> would<00:05:04.290> have<00:05:04.410> the<00:05:04.560> hood<00:05:04.740> like

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
would have the would have the hood like

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.980 
would have the would have the hood like
that<00:05:05.010> have<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.610> hood<00:05:05.790> lever<00:05:06.060> here<00:05:06.450> will<00:05:06.870> have

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
that have the hood lever here will have

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.440 
that have the hood lever here will have
it<00:05:07.110> down<00:05:07.260> here<00:05:07.610> so<00:05:08.610> what's<00:05:08.760> happening<00:05:09.150> is<00:05:09.300> this

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
it down here so what's happening is this

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.970 
it down here so what's happening is this
with<00:05:09.660> the<00:05:09.780> new<00:05:09.900> these<00:05:10.110> newer<00:05:10.350> models<00:05:10.800> they've

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
with the new these newer models they've

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.790 
with the new these newer models they've
put<00:05:11.160> it<00:05:11.280> side-by-side<00:05:11.550> with<00:05:12.240> the<00:05:12.270> gas<00:05:12.620> and<00:05:13.620> so

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
put it side-by-side with the gas and so

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.050 
put it side-by-side with the gas and so
you<00:05:13.860> know<00:05:14.070> you're<00:05:14.310> going<00:05:14.460> to<00:05:14.550> the<00:05:14.670> pump<00:05:14.940> and

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
you know you're going to the pump and

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.100 
you know you're going to the pump and
you're<00:05:15.180> going<00:05:15.360> to<00:05:15.390> change<00:05:15.600> your<00:05:15.630> gas<00:05:15.870> you

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
you're going to change your gas you

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.580 
you're going to change your gas you
accidentally<00:05:16.590> hit<00:05:17.430> that<00:05:17.460> instead<00:05:18.380> and<00:05:19.380> then

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
accidentally hit that instead and then

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:37.550 
accidentally hit that instead and then
you're<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:19.950> then<00:05:20.070> you<00:05:20.400> pull<00:05:20.610> that

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.010 

okay

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:52.390 

all<00:05:42.650> right<00:05:42.830> so

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.350 

as<00:05:53.000> you<00:05:53.120> can<00:05:53.270> see<00:05:53.449> here<00:05:54.790> that's<00:05:55.790> the<00:05:56.000> safety

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
as you can see here that's the safety

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.860 
as you can see here that's the safety
latch<00:05:56.680> and<00:05:57.680> from<00:05:57.830> what<00:05:57.979> I'm<00:05:58.130> understanding

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
latch and from what I'm understanding

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:04.360 
latch and from what I'm understanding
this<00:05:59.870> thing<00:06:01.000> when<00:06:02.000> it<00:06:02.120> gets<00:06:02.270> dirty<00:06:03.370> could

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
this thing when it gets dirty could

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:11.230 
this thing when it gets dirty could
actually<00:06:04.490> stop<00:06:04.820> functioning

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.620 

so<00:06:12.520> keep<00:06:13.520> an<00:06:13.669> eye<00:06:13.759> on<00:06:13.789> that<00:06:14.090> make<00:06:14.330> sure<00:06:14.479> that

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
so keep an eye on that make sure that

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.340 
so keep an eye on that make sure that
that's<00:06:14.840> functioning<00:06:15.319> lubed<00:06:15.590> up<00:06:16.690> and<00:06:17.690> make

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
that's functioning lubed up and make

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.089 
that's functioning lubed up and make
sure<00:06:18.380> that<00:06:18.560> you<00:06:18.970> don't<00:06:19.970> accidentally<00:06:21.099> open

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:22.099 
sure that you don't accidentally open

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:23.589 
sure that you don't accidentally open
your<00:06:22.220> hood<00:06:22.310> up<00:06:22.550> while<00:06:22.729> you're<00:06:22.880> full<00:06:23.060> pull<00:06:23.509> on
