same overall I'm very impressed with

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.730 
same overall I'm very impressed with
this<00:01:48.240> case<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.869> tends<00:01:49.110> not<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.229> be<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.530> type<00:01:49.710> of

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
this case it tends not to be the type of

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.639 
this case it tends not to be the type of
case<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.340> use<00:01:51.090> but<00:01:51.930> for<00:01:52.079> those<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.229> do<00:01:52.590> I

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
case I use but for those that do I

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.440 
case I use but for those that do I
highly<00:01:53.040> recommend<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.670> largely<00:01:53.970> because<00:01:54.329> it

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
highly recommend it largely because it

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.580 
highly recommend it largely because it
does<00:01:54.630> allow<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.229> put<00:01:55.380> additional

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
does allow you to put additional

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.370 
does allow you to put additional
