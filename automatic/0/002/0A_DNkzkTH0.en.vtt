00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.760
 of a dream was already competing for two 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.870

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.040
 I already got the title of champion then 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.320
 It was a year that I joined the team 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.489

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.829

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.620
 I just received the magazine I gave 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.170
 one look and it will be another one of the 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.239
 magazines that will be part of the room 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.100
 waiting for an office where people 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.390
 there are four or five signatures and 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.030
 incredible as it always seems to be. 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.100
 flex magazine that ends up being the most 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.600
 read by my patients is a journal 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:09.070
 which is also full of information 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.109
 on the most varied themes and always 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.600
 with a very easy language to 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:16.419
 understand for anyone to understand the 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.239
 I'm not going to retire and give a 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:23.110
 My column that I wrote I want to see 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.000
 and really stayed on the level of the other 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.669
 last two of the magazines 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.819
 I tried to make it the easiest 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.819
 possible reading that ten people 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:36.940
 they understand what is free radical what is the 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:39.009
 oxidative stress what is an antioxidant 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.479
 which is a very frequent question of the 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.370
 office here so for those who did not read 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.250
 I still recommend reading the 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.440
 column fixed and meant bob bob 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.110

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.539
 That's why he became a goat and the love that 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.120
 no two and then more in front and 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:58.090
 the francisco iuv arrived and today we are 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:02.440
 more or less 78 components in fact 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.909
 We attend condominiums academies and 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.680
 everything is where you have a student 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:06.460
 pretend people will understand why 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.409
 wherever you are 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.819
 our goal is to produce activity 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.710
