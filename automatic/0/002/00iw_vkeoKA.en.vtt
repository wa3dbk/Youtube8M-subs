00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
let's go ahead and get started so this

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.359 
let's go ahead and get started so this
first<00:00:19.050> hairstyle<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:19.920> like<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> regular

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
first hairstyle is just like a regular

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.220 
first hairstyle is just like a regular
braid<00:00:20.760> but<00:00:21.060> it's<00:00:21.210> reversed<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.990> what<00:00:22.140> i<00:00:22.170> mean

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
braid but it's reversed and what i mean

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.990 
braid but it's reversed and what i mean
by<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.920> instead<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.310> taking<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.699> braid

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
by that is instead of taking the braid

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.279 
by that is instead of taking the braid
over<00:00:24.180> you're<00:00:24.570> gonna<00:00:24.630> be<00:00:24.750> taking<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.109> braid

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
over you're gonna be taking the braid

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.990 
over you're gonna be taking the braid
under<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:25.949> as<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.340> can<00:00:26.460> see<00:00:26.640> my<00:00:26.760> hair<00:00:26.939> is

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
under so as you can see my hair is

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.730 
under so as you can see my hair is
already<00:00:27.180> parted<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.840> side<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.500> i'm<00:00:28.619> just

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
already parted on the side and i'm just

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.189 
already parted on the side and i'm just
going<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.099> do<00:00:29.580> kind<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.330> like<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.510> plate<00:00:30.990> and

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
going to do kind of like a plate and

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.450 
going to do kind of like a plate and
then<00:00:31.349> i'm<00:00:31.470> going<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.650> bring<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.980> braid<00:00:32.189> down

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
then i'm going to bring the braid down

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.770 
then i'm going to bring the braid down
so<00:00:32.790> what<00:00:33.059> I'm<00:00:33.120> going<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.420> right<00:00:33.450> now<00:00:33.600> is

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
section and splitting it into three

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.790 
section and splitting it into three
parts<00:00:55.949> up<00:00:56.280> near<00:00:56.520> my<00:00:56.670> part<00:00:57.289> so<00:00:58.289> instead<00:00:58.739> of

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
parts up near my part so instead of

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.670 
parts up near my part so instead of
braiding<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> hair<00:00:59.430> like<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.820> normally<00:01:00.120> would

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
braiding the hair like I normally would

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.969 
braiding the hair like I normally would
going<00:01:01.680> over<00:01:01.920> with<00:01:02.850> each<00:01:03.059> section<00:01:03.570> like<00:01:03.750> this

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
going over with each section like this

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.219 
going over with each section like this
I'm<00:01:04.979> actually<00:01:05.939> going<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.510> completely

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
I'm actually going to do it completely

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.230 
I'm actually going to do it completely
opposite<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.890> go<00:01:08.070> under<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.880> instead<00:01:09.150> of

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
opposite and go under so instead of

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.580 
opposite and go under so instead of
starting<00:01:09.600> out<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> regular<00:01:10.049> braid<00:01:10.409> I'm

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
starting out like a regular braid I'm

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.590 
starting out like a regular braid I'm
going<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.799> take<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.250> strand<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.060> kick<00:01:12.479> it

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
going to take this strand and kick it

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.710 
going to take this strand and kick it
under<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.670> then<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.820> other<00:01:14.850> side<00:01:15.299> braid<00:01:15.570> I'm

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
under and then the other side braid I'm

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.210 
under and then the other side braid I'm
also<00:01:15.869> going<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.259> do<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.500> same<00:01:16.710> thing<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.159> I'm

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
also going to do the same thing so I'm

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.429 
also going to do the same thing so I'm
just<00:01:17.369> going<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> go<00:01:17.729> under<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
just going to go under and that is the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.710 
just going to go under and that is the
only<00:01:19.619> difference<00:01:20.159> with<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.430> braid<00:01:20.729> now<00:01:21.600> I'm

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
only difference with this braid now I'm

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.120 
only difference with this braid now I'm
just<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.140> pick<00:01:22.320> up<00:01:22.470> some<00:01:22.680> more<00:01:22.860> hair<00:01:23.100> on

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
just going to pick up some more hair on

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:48.950 
just going to pick up some more hair on
each<00:01:23.460> side

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.120 

so<00:01:49.960> if<00:01:50.050> you<00:01:50.170> want<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.410> bring<00:01:50.500> this<00:01:50.650> braid<00:01:50.920> down

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
so if you want to bring this braid down

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.740 
so if you want to bring this braid down
even<00:01:51.460> further<00:01:51.670> you<00:01:51.970> can<00:01:52.000> create<00:01:52.330> a<00:01:52.420> side

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
even further you can create a side

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.170 
even further you can create a side
ponytail<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:53.530> start<00:01:53.890> braiding<00:01:54.190> those<00:01:54.850> three

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
ponytail and start braiding those three

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.820 
ponytail and start braiding those three
