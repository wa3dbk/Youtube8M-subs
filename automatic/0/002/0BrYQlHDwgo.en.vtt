what is large l-arginine is a product
that<00:00:08.610> makes<00:00:08.910> nitric<00:00:09.450> oxide<00:00:09.840> which<00:00:10.080> is

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
that makes nitric oxide which is

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.620 
that makes nitric oxide which is
naturally<00:00:11.040> occurring<00:00:11.460> in<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.880> human<00:00:12.150> body<00:00:12.300> in

taking and if people would do a little

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.630 
taking and if people would do a little
research<00:01:27.750> they<00:01:28.170> would<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.770> impressed<00:01:29.040> well

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
research they would be so impressed well

slight<00:01:33.960> angina<00:01:34.530> when<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.100> walk<00:01:35.430> fast<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.939> stuff

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
slight angina when I walk fast and stuff

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.670 
slight angina when I walk fast and stuff
and<00:01:36.270> since<00:01:36.509> taking<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.110> don't<00:01:37.170> get<00:01:37.470> that

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
and since taking this I don't get that

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.300 
and since taking this I don't get that
mm-hmm<00:01:38.570> just<00:01:39.570> my<00:01:39.780> case<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:41.009> get<00:01:41.159> better

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
mm-hmm just my case you just get better

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.039 
mm-hmm just my case you just get better
blood<00:01:41.820> flow<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.119> when<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.540> get<00:01:42.659> better<00:01:42.840> blood

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
blood flow and when you get better blood

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.389 
blood flow and when you get better blood
flow<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.320> get<00:01:43.470> more<00:01:43.619> oxygen<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.369> muscles

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
flow you get more oxygen to the muscles

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.520 
flow you get more oxygen to the muscles
and<00:01:44.970> everything<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.659> know<00:01:45.689> even<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.200> simple

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.620 
years just by something you know that
simple<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.729> diet<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.600> exercise

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
simple and and the diet and the exercise

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.789 
simple and and the diet and the exercise
is<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.950> key<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.729> then<00:02:03.390> our<00:02:03.600> body<00:02:03.840> makes<00:02:04.350> nitric

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
is so key and then our body makes nitric

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.800 
is so key and then our body makes nitric
oxide<00:02:05.189> but<00:02:05.310> as<00:02:05.430> we<00:02:05.579> get<00:02:05.729> older<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:06.240> makes<00:02:06.509> less

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
oxide but as we get older it makes less

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.830 
oxide but as we get older it makes less
and<00:02:07.020> less<00:02:07.110> as<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.469> does<00:02:07.619> many<00:02:07.860> other<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.509> 11

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
and less as it does many other of the 11

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.860 
and less as it does many other of the 11
key<00:02:09.959> amino<00:02:10.319> acid<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.340> have<00:02:11.580> all<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.030> genes

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
key amino acid so you have all the genes

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.780 
key amino acid so you have all the genes
for<00:02:13.110> heart<00:02:13.319> disease<00:02:13.379> I<00:02:13.860> do<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.459> yeah

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
for heart disease I do you yeah
