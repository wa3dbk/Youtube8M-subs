00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.339
 and what happened kids we are going to learn 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:10.299
 this day how to navigate good how to play 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:12.540
 fastest in avengers' alliance is this 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.429
 game that we are passionate about, we are going to 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.130
 learn how to play faster and to 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:21.310
 this I ask you that the browser ages 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.020
 played that I left in the description of 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.960
 video so you can this 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.610
 and install it on our computer 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.150
 I could install it but this to 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.190
 would lengthen the video more when I already 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.150
 have installed we continue with the video 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.150
 really good it is assumed that they have already installed 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:46.050
 the juice and let's see how it works 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:50.370
 basically it's the same chroma the same 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:54.629
 google browser but it has a couple of 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.770
 aspects for pc gamers so video 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.380
 basically the same thing is the same and 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.989
 let's teach him how to go faster 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.180
 could teach in all the options that 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.980
 but what interests us in this 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:14.400
 the moment is this the rocket 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:17.880
 says to search at speed so we 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.190
 let's try to go out bars this 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.750
 Personally, I never took it down 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.200
 but it 's like that 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.620
 so let's give it a percentage of 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.530
 10 if you can catch and start to go more 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.420
 fast the game so nothing 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.170
 let's leave 10 to start 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.750
 run eye that this one 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.479
 the browser does not give you more than 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.880
 energy and a lot are going to start telling me 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.730
 what is to hear the truth is that no 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.490
 it is a hub in its 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.700
 well, it's not a check itself 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.670
 we are corrupting the game because it is not 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.330
 We are corrupting nothing of interest 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.630
 but we're just doing what 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.520
 faster so as you can see everything 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.100
 the game goes faster so let's go 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.080
 try to see how it goes in a 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.350
 battle and step 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.880
 Well, you can see that the truth is that if 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.630
 it's going pretty good 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.680
 in this way you can choose more good 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:25.400
 You can be lucky to have more 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:29.980
 command points and you can go increasing 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:34.840
 in if our heroes for what 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:37.360
 or serve as a bonus for the end of the pp 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.299
 but let's start playing just one 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.460
 little so you can realize that if 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.590
 the game goes a little faster 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.190
 let's choose someone who needs 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.860
 train I do not know who the fuck we're going to see 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.800
 someone who needs to train 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.080
 Well, good kids basically there is 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.030
 this trick that I know is going to 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.850
 serve a lot we will see how it 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.400
 behaves in the game if they are going to notice that 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.510
 the players are going to move from the site 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.440
 but this matters little because 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.660
 basically what we want is for the 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.750
 game go faster and thus save a 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.850
 little bit of time and then nothing is going to 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.380
 see basically like that I'm going to do my 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:24.860
 all my tutorials you can subscribe 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:28.160
 to my channel new channel by the way I went up 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.980
 the first video to another channel but this 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.209
 I use it to do this blogging and criticism 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.070
 of other things so I created this channel 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.050
 basically just for those to sell I think 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.430
 that goes a little bit slower that will be 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.740
 why 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:47.290
 I'm with the catcher of 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.610
 I think that's why you should not 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.410
 because I would have to go a little bit more 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:55.860
 fast just tried your luck and you will see what 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:00.220
 that yes or if it is of much use is of 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.930
 this guy and later I'm going to 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.790
 teach how to get a little more 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.830
 command points maybe it's not all 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.250
 the times you are there is not a trick in itself 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.980
 but it is something that we have not fixed with 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.830
 a couple of classmates and the truth to me 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.310
 it works and if it can not be but in my 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.350
 publications that I make on my wall to each 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.780
 As you can see, it did not take long, I do not think 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.900
 It took me a minute to kill this one 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.700
 that, well, nothing solves this 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.560
 life because they are host 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.230
 waiting for more that is a pretty game 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.180
 slow and as I told you I have more or 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.800
 less maybe six months of being 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.190
 worrying and even has not given me 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.920
 a bigger problem unless I get caught 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.810
 of playdom and delete me in the account but 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.790
 all that this happens because 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.950
 I'm not corrupting the game but 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.710
 explaining more speed to me 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.150
 will give more energy because the energy 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.850
 if it works with the internal 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.740
 playdom and that would be pretty good already 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.210
 we want everything that gives us more 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.270
 energy but not pussy that does not 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.919
 let's continue man sand man's 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.350
 sand is pretty good the truth is that 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:18.479
 I really like the guy what 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.479
 happens is that the pp I have not found 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.330
 I have not found your support but but the 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.520
 truth is that the rogue in story mode 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.480
 it's going quite well as you see that 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.150
 almost finished the plan 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.500
 the battle and well I am also going to 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.900
 be explaining how to train from the 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.930
 1 here in 12 12 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.170
 I owe a lot to the 12 12 I owe him 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.750
 As you can see, neither are the players 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:51.050
 but yes in the bars and if it is so 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:54.380
 that, well, kids, I think this is 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.050
 ended and then nothing or that was a bit 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.330
 faster is not because it's 300 but that 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.700
 the game runs faster should I go 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.640
 faster but I think this is because of the 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.100
 video capture at 12 12 I owe the 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.560
 half of my heroes so well nothing 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.170
 I 'm here to look and 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:16.310
 well what I do 30 should 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:19.280
 have updated at least this one 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.480
 at least it would have been 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.500
 restarted the present and do this 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.170
 kids 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.750
 I leave you this trick that I think 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.870
 that is going to work quite well and 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.330
 then nothing to continue forming that comes 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:36.690
 another special operation and congratulations to 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.940
 all those who remained in the adamantium 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.449
 and all the others or that other 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:45.319
 thirteen times then nothing kids 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:45.319
 subscribe
