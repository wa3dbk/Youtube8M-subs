00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.980
 then kids welcome to unboxing 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.430
 of the timecapsule 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.880
 the 2013 edition which has also changed 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.110
 now it's called and the port time capsule 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.790
 so this one came out here 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.000
 essentially yesterday's van was 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.670
 presented during the 2013 wwe 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.890
 was sent to me yesterday after having it 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.110
 purchased the same evening and a half is 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.610
 was then delivered today service 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.600
 also very fast for a product just 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.309
 released 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.620
 if you follow me on youtube you will know that I 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.879
 I took a time capsule 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.460
 essentially two weeks ago then 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.960
 I was lucky with the release of 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.180
 this water because they used to be 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.030
 also to make that there is precisely 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:01:02.660
 take the new one so let's go 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:01:07.869
 we proceed to unboxing then we have 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:13.180
 an essentially new format here 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.180
 that the boxes genuinely changed 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.950
 and here we are in front of this new one 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.170
 time capsules as you can see the name 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.220
 in fact it is the time capsule port ho 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.409
 got the 2 terabyte logo version 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.650
 apple on the right side 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.659
 on the back we find some information 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.369
 on the capacity of this timecapsule that 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.010
 compared to the previous one in this new one 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.570
 proper form for the arrangement a 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.700
 called apple of internal antennas 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.250
 on the top they guarantee 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.689
 however a use is an extension 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.009
 direct is greater 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.460
 in addition to this there is also the 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:52.060
 802.11 ac protocol that precisely 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.180
 essentially guarantees speed 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.909
 higher than the current 802.11 n 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.490
 on the back we find related information 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.040
 on the serial and on the left smog other 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.320
 place is therefore we proceed to the opening 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.700
 I think we should open from below a 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.700
 problem to cover the serial 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.290
 theoretically it will suffice here it is 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.549
 coming out 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.829
 sorry but as usual I am 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.930
 smear to position the tripod well 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.959
 and then when this thing is placed there is a form 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.359
 extremely particular that looks like one 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.090
 small tower or a nougat like me 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:50.560
 suggested 7 bits and here it is in this one 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:54.180
 really very particular logo format 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.560
 black apple on the front on the back 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:02.200
 connectivity now there is another envelope 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:04.980
 that we are going to raise sad with a 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.980
 adhesive 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:20.570
 here on the back another apple logo with 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.280
 it seems to me a good dissipation 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.020
 finally they abandoned with the 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.000
 rubber in fact the time capsule that 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.300
 I had recently received really warmed 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.220
 so much and we have the presence here below 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.590
 of some holes I don't know if with the 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.200
 camera I can a 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.350
 here they are, you can see they should 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.150
 guarantee a further dissipation 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.570
 also because they are placed at a certain 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.640
 height with respect to the point of support 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:49.670
 then power cable wan port 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.680
 usb port although it seems to me that it is 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.040
 still version 2 not version 3 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.200
 and 3 ethernet ports so we say the 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.300
 connectivity is like the model 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.680
 previous one 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.200
 let's go and pose this let's see what we have 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.100
 damage in the package 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.980
 inevitable apple in design and device 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.960
 california we have as simple first 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.760
 power cord picked up so 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:19.520
 really special and then the manuals 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.810
 related to import in capsule set up not 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.060
 we can see these things even more 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.090
 small compared to what we find 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.230
 inside ok English French German 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:33.110
 Spanish therefore not even Italian a 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.570
 want to pay what I can do 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.430
 now it's a quick comparison 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.650
 with the generation timecapsule 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.840
 previous because that still here so 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.850
 in short, to make you understand what they can 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.770
 be the ideal size of this di 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.510
 this turret and here they are the two 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.460
 generations compared here the old e 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.390
 here the new with regard to the 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.370
 old generation 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.900
 this one in particular is a third one 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.000
 generation but let's remember that the tim cup 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.530
 on with this design had already come out in the 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.140
 far 2008 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.630
 this model is the one of 2011 in 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.450
 2 floor version with the code 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.250
 produced at 14 09 this one on the right 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.110
 instead always in the 2 ground version but 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.810
 also available in a three version 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.730
 and the 14 70 model that it was 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.200
 released yards the differences are 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.690
 substantial already from the form 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.290
 in the old generation we found 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.780
 this sort of rubber on the lower side 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.580
 which has been criticized by many for 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.470
 be a kind of cork 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.150
 ventilation several different problems 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.190
 in fact models have had gods 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.410
 problems not really in the latter 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.450
 third generation but anyway 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.130
 especially the models of the first of the 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.290
 second were several times 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.970
 replaced by apple because they warmed up a 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.590
 in fact I have to admit that 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.960
 Also this here at this time and 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.210
 disconnected recently is really very hot 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.760
 as for the doors, they find them 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:54.060
 on the back of course we say so 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.550
 spread on the side 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.430
 back while instead with this 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:02.010
 new model essentially more one 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.860
 tower does not look like a little bit to a 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:08.040
 small mac pro we find however the 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.960
 doors placed vertically and 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.400
 so here is a very small button 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.280
 reset and power light 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.900
 I imagine you are very different here 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.180
 to the previous one 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.270
 precisely because it aligns more with 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:24.900
 what is that of apple tv then 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:27.690
 I will end the video here because I think 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:31.250
 it is useless to show you the connection 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.540
 since the utility ports have anyway 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.190
 had an update for both 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:38.040
 version s is for that for mac 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.450
 windows and so it simply was 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.400
 given compatibility with this 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.260
 model has remained almost everything 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.600
 unchanged found on my channel already one 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:50.610
 video guide on how to use it as 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.320
 router and I invite you if you ever had 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.770
 interest in knowing how to connect it e 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.750
 how to make it work 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.539
 I tighten my channel to see the video 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.860
 which I published earlier for the 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:02.660
 moment is everything I thank you as always 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.000
 you are always so much for the vision 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.460
 kindly I invite you to comment on the video 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.099
 when too much time I answer you 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:13.360
 for the rest I invite you to the next video 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:13.360
 thanks a lot to all bye
