00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.220
 we go 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.270
 we take advantage and you will see how delicious that 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.270
 healthy 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.990
 The first thing we have done has been to wash 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.200
 all right 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.660
 and now let's cut it to a 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.090
 size not too large since it 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.860
 let's put in a little arito and we do not want 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.860
 that is too exaggerated 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.080
 a measure 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.039
 regular 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:02.340
 and now it does not happen 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.650
 and also the same with tomato 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.600
 the same thing exactly not what we're going to 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.680
 do with the tomato is to make 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.150
 slices 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.150
 not too thick 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.049
 well more or less 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.049
 so we have bought 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.650
 we have already cut the tomato the spinach 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.940
 and also the cheese now let's move on to 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.190
 plating 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.980
 we have a breath this is going to be for a 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.650
 ration we will put first the tomato that 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.820
 we have also tomato that more or less is 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.150
 the size of the 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.870
 we will start putting the tomato 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:47.640
 then we will put the speed 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.640
 we will put quite a lot of spirals 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.260
 a piece of cava cheese that already 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.260
 we have cut what I have here 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.700
 we will put you here 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.690
 you also see is the size more or less 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.370
 let's just chat a little bit 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.370
 so that we have a little more d 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.330
 tomato 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.010
 again spinach 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.140
 we will be there a little bit taking advantage 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.140
 that the cheese does not stick to us 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.930
 and we will put another cover 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.940
 already to finalize 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.320
 let's make the line of areta 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.959
 we will put as a couple of teaspoons 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.959
 balsamic vinegar 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.019
 and olive oil we will put 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.319
 and oregano 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.069
 cool much better with this also we 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.939
 it will go well 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.939
 and we put there 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.250
 and this is the trick that I have what 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.250
 we wave 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.800
 and once it is well stirred we will have 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.800
 life 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.459
 we unmold 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.700
 watch out 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.700
 there 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.859
 and now we only have to add the 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.859
 vinaigrette so above is beautiful 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:10.270
 and the nuts in this case we have 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.300
 chosen the silken nuts we will put here 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.430
 above 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.430
 and we will have the finished dish 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.829
 where I liked it I love it
