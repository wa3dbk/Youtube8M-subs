00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
show it off got it for two years so this

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.640 
show it off got it for two years so this
is<00:05:07.520> where<00:05:07.820> we're<00:05:08.750> also<00:05:09.020> difference<00:05:09.470> in<00:05:09.560> your

what<00:05:09.800> am<00:05:09.860> I<00:05:09.890> looking<00:05:10.010> at<00:05:10.190> in<00:05:10.340> him<00:05:10.490> we<00:05:10.940> develop

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
what am I looking at in him we develop

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.050 
what am I looking at in him we develop
this<00:05:11.570> for<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.280> cipher<00:05:13.280> for<00:05:13.760> it's<00:05:13.880> a

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
this for the cipher for it's a

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.700 
this for the cipher for it's a
futuristic<00:05:14.990> filming<00:05:15.650> concept<00:05:17.260> we<00:05:18.260> developed

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
futuristic filming concept we developed

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.590 
futuristic filming concept we developed
the<00:05:18.800> liner<00:05:18.980> portion<00:05:19.490> of<00:05:19.610> its<00:05:19.820> Aerodyne<00:05:20.330> work

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
the liner portion of its Aerodyne work

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.710 
the liner portion of its Aerodyne work
on<00:05:20.810> the<00:05:20.930> shell<00:05:21.200> it<00:05:22.040> was

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
on the shell it was

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.270 
on the shell it was
supposed<00:05:23.110> to<00:05:23.140> be<00:05:23.230> pushing<00:05:23.500> the<00:05:23.680> boundaries<00:05:24.130> of

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
supposed to be pushing the boundaries of

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.879 
supposed to be pushing the boundaries of
one<00:05:25.060> impact<00:05:25.390> protection

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.580 

ballistic<00:05:28.580> performance<00:05:29.469> incorporating<00:05:30.469> a

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
ballistic performance incorporating a

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.960 
ballistic performance incorporating a
mandible<00:05:30.979> riser<00:05:31.520> that<00:05:31.909> were<00:05:32.030> they

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
mandible riser that were they

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.420 
mandible riser that were they
so<00:05:33.540> we<00:05:33.660> did<00:05:33.840> the<00:05:33.930> liner<00:05:34.140> component<00:05:34.830> and<00:05:35.310> that's

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
so we did the liner component and that's

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.770 
so we did the liner component and that's
the<00:05:35.580> end<00:05:35.700> of<00:05:35.730> that<00:05:35.790> project<00:05:36.090> we<00:05:36.480> got<00:05:36.630> this

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
the end of that project we got this

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.230 
the end of that project we got this
awesome<00:05:37.020> liner<00:05:37.470> but<00:05:38.190> nothing<00:05:38.670> really<00:05:38.880> to<00:05:39.060> put

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
awesome liner but nothing really to put

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.660 
awesome liner but nothing really to put
it<00:05:39.360> in<00:05:39.480> so<00:05:39.750> we<00:05:39.780> decided<00:05:40.290> to<00:05:40.800> when<00:05:41.190> excited<00:05:41.550> to

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:41.670 
it in so we decided to when excited to

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.040 
it in so we decided to when excited to
get<00:05:41.790> kind<00:05:42.030> of<00:05:42.060> back<00:05:42.240> into<00:05:42.450> the<00:05:42.570> helmets

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
get kind of back into the helmets

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.740 
get kind of back into the helmets
the<00:05:44.379> platform<00:05:44.889> around<00:05:45.009> it<00:05:45.370> and<00:05:45.879> this<00:05:46.389> is<00:05:46.509> kind

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
the platform around it and this is kind

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.379 
the platform around it and this is kind
of<00:05:46.840> a<00:05:46.900> the<00:05:47.620> seed<00:05:47.889> that<00:05:47.919> then<00:05:48.520> grew<00:05:48.849> into<00:05:48.879> all

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
of a the seed that then grew into all

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.120 
of a the seed that then grew into all
the<00:05:49.539> other<00:05:49.569> helmet

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
the other helmet

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.980 
the other helmet
so<00:05:51.640> what<00:05:52.270> kind<00:05:52.450> of<00:05:52.480> price<00:05:52.660> point<00:05:52.720> are<00:05:52.960> we

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
so what kind of price point are we

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.740 
so what kind of price point are we
looking<00:05:53.230> at<00:05:53.290> this<00:05:53.530> this<00:05:54.370> cell<00:05:54.580> is<00:05:54.970> this<00:05:55.240> carbon
