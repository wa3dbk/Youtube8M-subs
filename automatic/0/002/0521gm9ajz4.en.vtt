00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.500 
on your build number I'll hold time
times<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.399> then<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:32.700> going<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> say<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.480> are

are functioning correctly you're just
going<00:02:35.769> to<00:02:35.830> type<00:02:35.980> in<00:02:37.200> adb<00:02:38.459> device<00:02:39.459> don't

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
going to type in adb device don't

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.599 
going to type in adb device don't
capitalize<00:02:40.989> here<00:02:41.049> a<00:02:41.940> DB<00:02:43.290> devices<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.609> that's

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609 
capitalize here a DB devices and that's

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.259 
capitalize here a DB devices and that's
going<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:45.940> prove<00:02:46.209> that<00:02:46.239> your<00:02:46.810> device<00:02:47.530> is

alright so from here we're going to

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.970 
alright so from here we're going to
actually<00:03:03.910> reboot<00:03:04.569> into<00:03:05.049> bootloader<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:05.829> what

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
actually reboot into bootloader so what

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.780 
actually reboot into bootloader so what
we're<00:03:06.100> going<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.250> type<00:03:06.489> in<00:03:06.670> is<00:03:06.730> adb<00:03:07.890> adb

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.979 
correctly loader and that's going to
reboot<00:03:19.670> our<00:03:19.790> device<00:03:20.060> into<00:03:20.480> bootloader<00:03:20.689> mode

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
reboot our device into bootloader mode

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:34.969 
in bootloader mode so to test this code

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:37.690 
in bootloader mode so to test this code
so<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.629> test<00:03:35.900> this<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.469> what<00:03:37.189> you<00:03:37.310> may<00:03:37.459> need<00:03:37.579> to

so to test this and what you may need to

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.520 
so to test this and what you may need to
do<00:03:37.849> if<00:03:37.939> your<00:03:38.060> driver<00:03:38.299> your<00:03:38.420> fastboot<00:03:38.989> drivers

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
do if your driver your fastboot drivers

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.809 
do if your driver your fastboot drivers
don't<00:03:39.650> install<00:03:39.950> correctly<00:03:40.400> is<00:03:40.489> come<00:03:40.700> back

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
don't install correctly is come back

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.270 
don't install correctly is come back
here<00:03:41.120> do<00:03:41.720> that<00:03:41.900> run<00:03:42.379> this<00:03:42.620> again<00:03:42.950> and<00:03:43.099> make

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
here do that run this again and make

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.539 
here do that run this again and make
sure<00:03:43.430> these<00:03:43.549> drivers<00:03:44.000> are<00:03:44.090> installed<00:03:44.290> okay<00:03:45.549> so

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
sure these drivers are installed okay so

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:47.830 
sure these drivers are installed okay so
then<00:03:46.669> what<00:03:46.819> you<00:03:46.939> do<00:03:47.090> over<00:03:47.209> here<00:03:47.329> is<00:03:47.659> you<00:03:47.810> just

then what you do over here is you just

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:58.179 
then what you do over here is you just
type<00:03:48.200> in<00:03:49.359> fastboot<00:03:53.439> space<00:03:55.389> devices<00:03:56.389> and<00:03:57.189> it

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:58.189 
type in fastboot space devices and it

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.720 
type in fastboot space devices and it
checks<00:03:58.549> to<00:03:58.730> make<00:03:58.760> sure<00:03:59.319> your<00:04:00.370> here's<00:04:01.370> your<00:04:01.459> sir

this<00:06:11.020> is<00:06:11.080> it<00:06:11.410> just<00:06:11.590> booted<00:06:11.860> out<00:06:11.949> a<00:06:11.979> boot<00:06:12.220> loader

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
this is it just booted out a boot loader

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.249 
this is it just booted out a boot loader

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:14.259 
and boot it into here this should be

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.820 
and boot it into here this should be

is<00:06:22.990> booting<00:06:23.410> up<00:06:23.530> so<00:06:24.190> let's<00:06:24.550> see<00:06:24.789> what<00:06:25.539> happens

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
is booting up so let's see what happens

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.120 
is booting up so let's see what happens
once<00:06:26.199> it<00:06:26.380> boots<00:06:26.500> up<00:06:28.080> so<00:06:29.080> here<00:06:29.229> we<00:06:29.320> go<00:06:29.500> device<00:06:29.860> is

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
once it boots up so here we go device is

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:35.659 
once it boots up so here we go device is
booting<00:06:30.729> up<00:06:32.490> says<00:06:33.490> Android<00:06:34.150> is<00:06:34.300> upgrading<00:06:34.930> and

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:35.669 
booting up says Android is upgrading and

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.790 
booting up says Android is upgrading and
we're<00:06:36.669> back<00:06:36.849> on<00:06:37.090> so<00:06:37.539> let's<00:06:37.750> go<00:06:38.020> ahead<00:06:38.110> and<00:06:38.470> see

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
we're back on so let's go ahead and see

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.860 
we're back on so let's go ahead and see
if<00:06:38.830> we<00:06:39.039> have<00:06:39.250> root<00:06:39.669> access<00:06:39.880> on<00:06:40.389> this<00:06:40.570> device

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
if we have root access on this device

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.520 
if we have root access on this device
and<00:06:42.240> sure<00:06:43.240> enough<00:06:43.270> there<00:06:43.930> it<00:06:44.080> is<00:06:44.199> and<00:06:44.500> we

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
and sure enough there it is and we

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.170 
and sure enough there it is and we
didn't<00:06:45.220> even<00:06:45.280> wipe<00:06:45.669> out<00:06:47.400> the<00:06:48.400> device<00:06:48.729> because

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
didn't even wipe out the device because

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.370 
didn't even wipe out the device because
we<00:06:49.300> are<00:06:49.419> already<00:06:49.599> unlocked<00:06:50.020> this<00:06:50.169> thing

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
we are already unlocked this thing

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.129 
we are already unlocked this thing
obviously<00:06:50.530> comes<00:06:51.039> factory<00:06:51.789> default<00:06:52.570> unlocked

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:53.139 
obviously comes factory default unlocked

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:55.110 
obviously comes factory default unlocked
for<00:06:53.530> the<00:06:53.650> bootloader<00:06:53.949> which<00:06:54.250> is<00:06:54.460> just<00:06:54.849> wicked

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 
for the bootloader which is just wicked

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.300 
for the bootloader which is just wicked
cool<00:06:55.479> and<00:06:55.750> then<00:06:56.289> just<00:06:56.500> to<00:06:56.590> prove<00:06:56.770> we<00:06:56.979> have<00:06:57.130> root

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
cool and then just to prove we have root

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.000 
cool and then just to prove we have root
access<00:06:57.400> just<00:06:57.849> open<00:06:58.120> a<00:06:58.180> root<00:06:58.330> application<00:06:59.010> this

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.010 
access just open a root application this

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.200 
access just open a root application this
is<00:07:00.130> what<00:07:00.310> I<00:07:00.340> have<00:07:00.639> right<00:07:00.789> here<00:07:01.440> go<00:07:02.440> into<00:07:02.650> tools
