there looks pretty good so we're going

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.519 
there looks pretty good so we're going
to<00:00:23.580> go<00:00:23.730> slow<00:00:23.789> I'm<00:00:24.600> not<00:00:24.840> going<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.050> break<00:00:25.170> up<00:00:25.380> any

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
to go slow I'm not going to break up any

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.259 
to go slow I'm not going to break up any
drill<00:00:25.800> bits<00:00:26.099> I'm<00:00:26.640> not<00:00:26.789> gonna<00:00:26.910> put<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> lot<00:00:27.150> of

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
drill bits I'm not gonna put a lot of

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.439 
drill bits I'm not gonna put a lot of
pressure<00:00:27.420> on<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:28.640> let<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.760> work<00:00:29.939> at<00:00:30.150> its<00:00:30.269> own

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
pressure on it let it work at its own

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.920 
pressure on it let it work at its own
pace<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:31.969> might<00:00:32.969> even<00:00:33.149> put<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.390> little<00:00:33.420> bit<00:00:33.630> oil

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
pace I might even put a little bit oil

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.130 
pace I might even put a little bit oil
on<00:00:34.200> that

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.650 

hmm

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.410 

I<00:00:45.220> might<00:00:46.220> even<00:00:46.370> take<00:00:46.520> it<00:00:46.730> drill<00:00:46.970> bit<00:00:47.150> out<00:00:47.239> and

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
I might even take it drill bit out and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:01:51.370 
I might even take it drill bit out and
swap<00:00:47.660> it<00:00:47.840> for<00:00:47.870> a<00:00:48.050> sharper<00:00:48.470> line

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.660 

okay<00:01:52.380> that's<00:01:52.890> probably<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.400> most<00:01:53.520> difficult

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
okay that's probably the most difficult

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.490 
okay that's probably the most difficult
part<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.540> as<00:01:54.840> I've<00:01:55.020> drilled<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.470> hole

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
part of this as I've drilled a hole

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.250 
part of this as I've drilled a hole
completely<00:01:56.370> through<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.000> bolt<00:01:57.240> all<00:01:57.510> the<00:01:57.570> way

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
completely through the bolt all the way

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.610 
completely through the bolt all the way
down<00:01:58.650> and<00:01:59.160> it<00:02:00.090> came<00:02:00.300> out<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.720> other<00:02:00.750> end<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.500> I

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
down and it came out the other end and I

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.430 
down and it came out the other end and I
didn't<00:02:01.920> break<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.130> tiny<00:02:02.640> little<00:02:03.080> drill<00:02:04.080> bit

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
didn't break that tiny little drill bit

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.870 
didn't break that tiny little drill bit
so<00:02:04.740> all<00:02:04.830> I'm<00:02:04.950> going<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.100> do<00:02:05.190> is<00:02:05.310> go<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.730> the<00:02:05.850> next

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
so all I'm going to do is go to the next

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.440 
so all I'm going to do is go to the next
larger<00:02:06.450> size<00:02:06.720> and<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:08.610> next<00:02:08.880> larger<00:02:09.179> size<00:02:09.420> and

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
larger size and the next larger size and

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.140 
larger size and the next larger size and
the<00:02:09.990> next<00:02:10.229> larger<00:02:10.560> size<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.520> forth<00:02:11.850> until

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
the next larger size and so forth until

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.340 
the next larger size and so forth until
we<00:02:12.540> get<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:13.340> we<00:02:14.340> want<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.730> be<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.480> I'll

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
we get it we want it to be so I'll

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.500 
we get it we want it to be so I'll
change<00:02:16.680> drill<00:02:16.920> bits<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.520> we'll<00:02:17.940> come<00:02:18.150> back<00:02:18.180> at

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
change drill bits and we'll come back at

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.660 
change drill bits and we'll come back at
it
