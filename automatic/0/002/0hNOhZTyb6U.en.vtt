00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.570
 what is the key and today I come to 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.760
 share with you the tutorial of the 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.830
 look that I bring today in the 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.630
 eyes that I had already shown you 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.540
 photography on facebook and that is the same 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.669
 that is at the beginning of this video I hope 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.359
 that you like it if it is like this, accompany me to 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.359
 see the tutorial 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.110
 I will start as always with the 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.580
 test I'm going to use the 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.930
 combination of states that has been 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.930
 using lately 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.100
 just like always on the whole eyelid I'm going 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.630
 to use this shadow as a base or 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.800
 anyone who resembles the color 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.800
 natural of your skin 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.390
 of the palette we are going to use these 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:12.850
 man who is here 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.850
 with this brush that is round 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.990
 and I'm going to apply first in the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.990
 eye crease 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.080
 with a brush a little smaller I'm going to 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.850
 use the same row up 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.270
 Now that we use the one right now, I'm going 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.799
 to use is 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.479
 we arrived at the tip of can the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.870
 excess and we will apply more 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.010
 directly 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.010
 here in the fold 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.430
 they realize we are going from the color 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.920
 lighter to the darker color that 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.170
 we're going to use and that's just for 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.500
 go deeper here a little more 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.960
 the eyelid and fades to the color 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.729
 that we put the next color first 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.360
 that we are going to use is the last row 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.849
 of shadows is this as copper coffee 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.220
 but we're going to use this and the last one we're going 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.350
 to use this now transparency because 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.420
 you're the first and then the 500 is 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.760
 first on one side of the brush 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.430
 we grab the darkest color 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.939
 and we started to apply around the eyelid 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.939
 mobile 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.270
 with the opposite side of the same brush 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.430
 let's grab the second color that was 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.550
 the golden one and we're going to apply it to 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.560
 taps in the middle part 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.709
 only 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.810
 and it will give an effect as other hilux 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.260
 with a heart as separate issues 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.830
 I was hitting more light 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.830
 here 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.040
 more or less like that now we are going to return 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.340
 with the previous brushes for 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.340
 blur 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.730
 the line of these 2 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.730
 shades 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.780
 we can return with the first shadow 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.780
 what do we use 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.150
 more or less like that and now to blur 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:37.280
 this edge of this color 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.280
 let's use another shadow 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.890
 is the same one that he always used and is 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.790
 this capacity that sweeps another 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.280
 take advantage of a little you need 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.400
 except the express one and I go by all 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.400
 shore 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:57.940
 applying it gently lightly not 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.940
 we want the brown color to be noticed 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.650
 it's to blur 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.020
 just return with the first shadow 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.970
 that we use that is 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.020
 and we apply 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.680
 on the whole shore 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:17.019
 well below the eyebrow 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.380
 and it's helping us clean up yet 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:23.020
 more and to highlight 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.480
 that area 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.270
 we blur the inner part of the eye 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.409
 and if you have to shape or clean something 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.069
 here 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:36.539
 I'm going to use a black eyeliner now 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:39.300
 creamy and I'm going to use this organdy 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:42.629
 cake and I'll apply it in the part 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.039
 internal water line so much 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:46.039
 lower as superior 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:56.879
 and after that I'm going to start putting it 

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:56.879
 over here right now 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.720
 and I'm going to grab a brush 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.680
 just like this and I'm going to start 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.000
 blur 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.000
 drag the report 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.540
 we are going to pull it a little here 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.060
 because we are going to try to connect it with 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.770
 the top part with the outline that 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.360
 let's do up now let's 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:35.230
 delineate the top of the 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.230
 lash line 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.030
 Y 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.370
 let's start pegadito do not have to 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.840
 to be the perfect line because we're going 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.630
 to drag as we did in the 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.320
 line 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.320
 lower 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.820
 as yes 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.600
 and now with the same brush we are going to 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.600
 carve this line 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:11.340
 love her 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:14.090
 we will extend a little out 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.090
 and up 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.330
 and we are going to lengthen 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.830
 that part of the brush there with no 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.229
 exactly with the pencil so that 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.789
 be so marked and define that line if 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.759
 is that only with the pencil and kaka 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:38.340
 like a tallÃ³n if we could now what 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:40.510
 that we are going to give the black shadow that 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.720
 comes in this palette 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:47.810
 and it's a black shadow that has 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:49.580
 flashes silver color is this 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.060
 and with that we're going to seal all the 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.060
 delineated 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.569
 right answer I'm just going to 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.569
 return a little bit with the pencil to 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:11.900
 and intensify the delineated only what 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.360
 more attached to the possible tabs do not 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.099
 I'm going to go up and I just want here 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.090
 in the line of tabs there is a 

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:19.090
 little bit darker 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:28.910
 in the part of the line of the eyelashes 

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:31.530
 the eyeliner from the bottom 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.570
 apart from that we put that shadow 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.880
 black with flashes I will use a 

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:38.780
 little bit of the golden shadow that we put 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:42.949
 in the middle of the eyelid and I'm going to 

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.949
 apply with taps here 

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:49.090
 to help it look a little more 

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:51.130
 subtle more smoky more faded but 

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.410
 I like the combination that will leave 

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:56.380
 the tone of the golden shade with those 

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:58.750
 written with silver re more or less like that and 

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:01.690
 now you just have to turn on the 

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.280
 eyelashes and apply the mascara and if you guys 

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.530
 they are going to use false eyelashes because this 

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.960
 it would be time to apply them and this 

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.610
 would then be the result I hope that 

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.380
 if you like it, do not stop 

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:13.990
 qualify comment subscribe and 

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.650

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.610
