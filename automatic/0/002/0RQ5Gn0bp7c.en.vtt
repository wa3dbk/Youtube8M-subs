00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
hits the water in fact I should really

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.550 
hits the water in fact I should really
find<00:02:09.090> out<00:02:09.330> how<00:02:09.750> long<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:09.959> takes<00:02:10.289> I'm<00:02:10.440> not

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
find out how long it takes I'm not

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
soy protein dried and what you do here

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.240 
soy protein dried and what you do here
is<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.160> boil<00:03:41.669> water<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:42.090> dump<00:03:42.540> them<00:03:42.690> in<00:03:42.780> there

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
is you boil water you dump them in there

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.789 
is you boil water you dump them in there
for<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.280> while<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:45.510> have<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.900> read<00:03:46.079> that<00:03:46.260> further

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
for a while I have to read that further

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.339 
for a while I have to read that further
and<00:03:47.579> then<00:03:47.700> cool<00:03:48.000> it<00:03:48.030> off<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.660> then<00:03:48.780> squeeze

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
and then cool it off and then squeeze

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.309 
and then cool it off and then squeeze
the<00:03:49.709> water<00:03:49.889> out<00:03:50.069> before<00:03:50.489> you<00:03:50.609> use<00:03:50.849> it<00:03:51.260> so<00:03:52.260> it

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
the water out before you use it so it

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.809 
the water out before you use it so it
kind<00:03:52.470> of<00:03:52.500> brings<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:52.829> back<00:03:52.859> like<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.280> more<00:03:53.519> tofu

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
kind of brings it back like a more tofu

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.710 
kind of brings it back like a more tofu
like<00:03:54.120> flavor<00:03:55.040> and<00:03:56.040> then<00:03:56.190> this<00:03:56.400> is<00:03:56.849> a<00:03:56.910> vegetable

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
like flavor and then this is a vegetable

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.460 
like flavor and then this is a vegetable
soy<00:03:58.440> burger<00:03:59.480> in<00:04:00.480> tomato<00:04:00.870> sauce<00:04:00.989> so<00:04:01.290> it's<00:04:01.410> an

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
soy burger in tomato sauce so it's an

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.920 
soy burger in tomato sauce so it's an
actual<00:04:01.620> patty<00:04:02.220> in<00:04:02.549> there<00:04:02.730> very<00:04:02.760> small<00:04:03.389> but<00:04:03.690> I

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
actual patty in there very small but I

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.440 
actual patty in there very small but I
would<00:04:04.739> probably<00:04:04.859> eat<00:04:05.250> this<00:04:05.459> over<00:04:05.790> noodles<00:04:06.180> as

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
would probably eat this over noodles as

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.820 
would probably eat this over noodles as
well

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
well

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:14.150 
well
what<00:04:08.580> last<00:04:09.450> thing<00:04:11.360> ok<00:04:12.360> we<00:04:12.720> have<00:04:13.010> textured<00:04:14.010> soy

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
what last thing ok we have textured soy

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.130 
what last thing ok we have textured soy
protein<00:04:14.730> but<00:04:15.210> this<00:04:15.390> comes<00:04:15.630> with<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:15.870> little

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
protein but this comes with a little

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.310 
protein but this comes with a little
season<00:04:16.980> pack<00:04:17.160> it's<00:04:17.430> a<00:04:17.549> chicken<00:04:17.910> so<00:04:18.630> I'm

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
season pack it's a chicken so I'm

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.840 
season pack it's a chicken so I'm
actually<00:04:19.530> probably<00:04:19.920> going<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.220> use<00:04:20.489> this

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
actually probably going to use this

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.430 
actually probably going to use this
