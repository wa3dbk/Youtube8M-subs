00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:43.310
 only the same 31 is normal in your 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.380
 computer was bad people are not going to give 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.600

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.670
 computer was my goal 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.150
 you need to ask yourself why you 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.760

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.959

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:05.300

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:13.489
 My other computer, my computer and me 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:16.310

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:22.610
 noise with the channel 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:24.419
 There you are finally finally talking about the 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.620
 video 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.620
 Super mario galaxy 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:47.350
 the cec feet saw it will never record this game 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:51.310
 will never play civil recording 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:55.870
 maybe a lot of people will not be able to 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:59.530

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:03.520
 Left mouse and the right to not vague 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:08.650

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:11.850
 the two together happens in the game 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.850
 the two together do not 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:20.710

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:28.060

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:35.950
