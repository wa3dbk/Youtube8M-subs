00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:03.740
 now 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.840
 one of the subjects that best identify heroin 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.640
 is the optical disc in any of its formats cd vv 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.209
 they are supports of universal use 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.209
 that allow us to complete a world full of images 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.929
 tex eye music and information 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:24.279
 these optical supports 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.569
 They are composed of a thermoplastic base 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:27.829
 polycarbonate 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.229
 which represents 99 percent of its weight 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:34.490
 a layer of lacquer is deposited on it successively 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.490
 a meeting and silkscreen 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.820
 a standard disc has a diameter of 120 millimeters 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.940
 a minimum thickness like two millimeters 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.740
 and weighs 15 grams 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.330
 in the dvd the recording density has increased with respect to the cd 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.700
 At the same time, the reading and transfer technique of 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.500
 data 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.600
 This allows 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.420
 in the same physical dimensions 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.520
 contain between 7 x 26 times more information 15 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.450
 a DVD are two discs of zero point 6 millimeters thick glued so 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.380
 that reaches the normalized thickness 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.310
 and one like two millimeters 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.220
 each of these two discs 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.560
 is prepared to store digital information on one of its faces 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.140
 Thus 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.350
 They have two nice faces that are eligible by laser 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.690
 The versatility and ability hagen was used in our life 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.690
 daily domestic as well as professional 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.520
 its use grows day by day 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.520
 being millions the discs manufactured 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.439
 this mode has entered massively into the market causing the substitution 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:46.590
 almost definitive 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.670
 of magnetic media such as cassette tape 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.540
 the glass which biskek 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:00.200
 it is about 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.390
 the appearance of cedÃ© a little more than 20 years ago 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.590
 and later that of the dvd 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.790
 has resulted in a new residue there is to give a mean output 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.209
 environmentally correct 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.830
 Herrera has the action of polycarbonate is a source of raw material for a 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.249
 high technical value 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:21.849
 and a bet for a more correct way of management consistent with the 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:28.619
 recycling initiatives and sustainability as well after its 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:29.249
 use 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:33.169
 the process begins with a selective collection of the discs to be 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:35.140
 taken to the recycling company 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.140
 in which the following steps follow 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.819
 they are introduced in a mill to be crushed into small pieces 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:48.099
 Throughout this process samples are taken for quality control 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.159
 of the material 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.459
 once the materials are crushed and washed for cleaning and to remove 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.669
 remains of tape and labels 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:01.109
 later they are introduced in threads for drying 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.239
 this operation is favored by a continuous turning of the material 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.329
 already dry the material passes directly through pipes to the machines 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.919
 Extruders for mechanical recycling 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.899
 this operation consists of heating the material to the optimum temperature 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:19.619
 diffused 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:23.129
 the molten material is cut into small pieces the size of a 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.919
 lentil this was desired 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.969
 Once cold in the laboratory, the quality of the product is analyzed and confirmed. 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:32.109
 material 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.919
 The farm is in the house of machines in tumble dryers for its transfer to the 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:36.659
 Business 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.659
 they will use it as raw material in their manufacturing process 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:45.199
 this process consists of its injection molding in a mold to manufacture 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:49.519
 different oscar objects printers computers printers a 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:50.409
 distance 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.579
 alarm boxes lampposts 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.559
 the polycarbonate is a material of great benefits its main 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:04:00.459
 characteristics are its high transparency and its extraordinary 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.239
 mechanical properties especially its impact resistance 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.930
 The recycled material is also used in the automotive sector 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.959
 in applications such as door opening handles mechanisms parts 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.160
 internal carcasses of rear view mirrors festeras
