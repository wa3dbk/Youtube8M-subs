let's<00:01:32.869> go<00:01:33.049> to<00:01:33.110> a<00:01:33.229> magic<00:01:33.619> circle<00:01:33.770> look<00:01:34.670> at<00:01:34.759> this

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
let's go to a magic circle look at this

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.399 
let's go to a magic circle look at this
the<00:01:35.689> easy<00:01:36.079> way

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
move the number of objects let's take

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.740 
move the number of objects let's take
this<00:01:47.360> one<00:01:47.600> as<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:47.780> start<00:01:48.939> as<00:01:49.939> the<00:01:50.180> lines<00:01:50.420> are<00:01:50.719> not

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
this one as a start as the lines are not

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.170 
this one as a start as the lines are not
connected<00:01:51.500> take<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.250> Select<00:01:52.579> tools<00:01:52.820> and

connected take the Select tools and
connect<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.079> lines<00:01:54.320> simple<00:01:55.189> by<00:01:56.289> dragging<00:01:57.289> and

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
connect the lines simple by dragging and

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.359 
connect the lines simple by dragging and
dropping<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:59.180> lines<00:01:59.420> to<00:02:00.200> each<00:02:00.289> other<00:02:00.500> they

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
dropping the lines to each other they

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.859 
dropping the lines to each other they
point<00:02:01.789> to<00:02:01.939> each<00:02:02.060> other

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869

let's now save it and we save it we

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.229 
let's now save it and we save it we
export<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.620> as<00:02:19.739> a<00:02:19.769> DX<00:02:20.190> F<00:02:20.400> because<00:02:20.849> I<00:02:20.880> would<00:02:21.120> like

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
export it as a DX F because I would like

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.750 
export it as a DX F because I would like
to<00:02:21.420> use<00:02:21.599> it<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:22.050> computer<00:02:22.800> system<00:02:23.370> for<00:02:23.550> long

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
to use it in a computer system for long

to use it in a computer system for long
arm<00:02:24.060> growth<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:24.750> let's<00:02:25.019> call<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.470> star<00:02:27.349> just

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
arm growth this let's call it star just

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.390 
arm growth this let's call it star just
star<00:02:28.910> you<00:02:29.910> can<00:02:30.140> move<00:02:31.140> additional<00:02:31.769> information

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
star you can move additional information

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.020 
star you can move additional information
which<00:02:33.180> comes<00:02:33.450> with<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.780> design<00:02:34.640> okay<00:02:35.640> let's
