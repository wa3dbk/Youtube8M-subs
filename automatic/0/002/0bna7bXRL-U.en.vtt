00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.859
 hello many people are looking for me 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.519
 buy and give a sex vacuum ask me 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.650
 and the cars how does the cars do 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:17.359
 I usually talk to people as soon as 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.279
 I'll just make the handlebars 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.689
 But once in a while I get to do it. 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.539
 the cables are not 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.980
 When do we have time when 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.070
 convenient ne 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.830
 this here I'll explain that this video 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.890
 here is a technique for you guys 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:39.950
 build that terminal 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.890
 the famous fused terminal 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.570
 usually the people will ride this I 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.100
 I know I'm waquim I just go 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.890
 finish the twig break 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.980
 I do not have anything against it. 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.230
 very well but there are people who do not like 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.730
 do not like do not trust 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.940
 So how are you going to make mine? 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.309
 how does your handle get a 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.060
 wood 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:08.580
 There you make a furinho, it's a mouthful. 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.350
 as far as the terminal you need 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.350
 at the time you need 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:39.299
 but I developed a hole and with a 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:43.020
 to kiss and to shower with a 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:46.490
 little lead is strange to do 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:54.649
 electronic component balance 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:58.590
 let's cook it there, let the brf go 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:02.189
 take a sip was the godmother and then to 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.950
 complete if you put cadin cm safe for 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:09.829
 pressure to any air line 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.829
 any little thing has escaped 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.160
 Are you seeing a fused terminal here? 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.050
 Now what's the clever bit you'll get 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.690
 what to finish 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:37.540
 but resistance is equal to the purchased're 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:39.940
 the surface finish is reasonable and 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:53.970
 give a finish now with file it goes 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:59.040
 stay perfect is ready to use 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.040
 so with a hard bought one 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:13.220
 which already has a cable virtually assembled 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:18.860
 in the sales terminals and now I'm going 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:20.780
 put this here in the family but yes 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.770
 would be the cable inside the are with the 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:30.770
 family had spoken and the dump 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:36.020
 Spanish detained inside the well 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:37.880
 Here's the whole thing of 15 6 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.890
 minutes on fire 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.890
 then it gets very warm 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.840
 there is melting is wrong in exchange 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.040
 You have to leave a little on fire. 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.989
 after holding onto it go through that 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:02.110
 scene that comes within these strange 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.110
 here's part of electric wire 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:10.130
 look inside and also for sale 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.840
 resume the amount needed to 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.090
 fill the oven 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.250
 this process can not be done in two 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.669
 Steps are good 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:24.140
 it must be a blow 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:26.090
 a war not only with form I will 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:33.280
 putting right 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:33.280
 to be the burning so far is enough 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.760
 huh 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.350
 barbon pouring the leaf 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:05.940
 is not ok the rest there and I will use the background 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.520
 standard crucible having 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:14.790
 is something a little ball 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:17.160
 yes she left now it's just chilling that 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.840
 the godmother then you go on 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:25.980
 death without even the way is 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:27.030
 I'm good here, the car is already here. 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:36.660
 ready 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:41.030
 the teflon hose guinea and here it is 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.030
 the last terminal
