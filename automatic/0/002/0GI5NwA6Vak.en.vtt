basically<00:03:35.300> as<00:03:35.750> hand<00:03:36.080> cut<00:03:36.380> flowers<00:03:36.980> which<00:03:37.820> have

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
basically as hand cut flowers which have

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.120 
basically as hand cut flowers which have
been<00:03:38.300> sandwiched<00:03:38.990> in<00:03:39.380> between<00:03:39.560> two<00:03:39.890> fabrics

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
been sandwiched in between two fabrics

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.780 
been sandwiched in between two fabrics
and<00:03:40.610> then<00:03:40.960> fixed<00:03:41.960> so<00:03:42.890> that<00:03:42.920> it<00:03:43.130> it<00:03:43.490> doesn't

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
and then fixed so that it it doesn't

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.310 
and then fixed so that it it doesn't
really<00:03:43.910> move<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.390> this<00:03:44.510> could<00:03:44.870> again

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
really move and this could again

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.470 
really move and this could again
actually<00:03:45.860> I<00:03:45.890> think<00:03:45.950> is<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.220> much<00:03:46.430> firmer<00:03:46.640> sleeve

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
actually I think is a much firmer sleeve

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.170 
actually I think is a much firmer sleeve
shape<00:03:47.780> really<00:03:48.080> like<00:03:48.410> a<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:49.760> then<00:03:49.940> you<00:03:50.000> keep

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
shape really like a and then you keep

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.940 
shape really like a and then you keep
layering<00:03:50.420> those<00:03:50.810> same<00:03:51.140> shapes<00:03:51.410> around<00:03:51.590> till

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
layering those same shapes around till

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.980 
layering those same shapes around till
you<00:03:52.070> arrive<00:03:52.430> at<00:03:52.610> the<00:03:52.700> Scott<00:03:52.910> tilyard<00:03:53.300> skirt

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
you arrive at the Scott tilyard skirt

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.320 
you arrive at the Scott tilyard skirt
yeah
