00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:04.839
 this is the end of the season 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:10.810
 it's a good dynamic 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.699
 no 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:13.530
 two months ago 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.530
 after this match 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.859
 facing the recession 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.670
 there is a white list of the ocde 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.739
 it's worth a look 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.100
 it's already that 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.600
 16 hours 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.020
 at the end of the season 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.430
 I think it's a personal decision 

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:13.589
 Am I satisfied 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:32.500
 it's simple 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.299
 that's it
