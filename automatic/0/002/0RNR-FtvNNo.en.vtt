00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
right now this is a for like yeah I

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.980

think I'm doing okay at my grandfather's
stuff<00:05:42.919> I<00:05:43.100> think<00:05:44.020> be<00:05:45.020> like<00:05:45.440> being<00:05:45.740> as<00:05:45.860> memorial

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
stuff I think be like being as memorial

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.340 
stuff I think be like being as memorial
service<00:05:46.760> and<00:05:47.060> I<00:05:47.270> think<00:05:47.630> you<00:05:47.780> know<00:05:47.900> later<00:05:48.080> that

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
service and I think you know later that

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.080 
service and I think you know later that
thing<00:05:48.650> can't<00:05:49.130> kick<00:05:49.340> in<00:05:49.490> for<00:05:49.760> me

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
thing can't kick in for me

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.330 
thing can't kick in for me
and<00:05:50.570> the<00:05:50.720> realization<00:05:50.930> will<00:05:51.590> kind<00:05:51.979> of<00:05:52.040> settle

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
and the realization will kind of settle

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.830 
and the realization will kind of settle
in<00:05:52.580> but<00:05:54.370> until<00:05:55.370> that<00:05:55.400> is<00:05:55.700> kind<00:05:55.940> of<00:05:55.970> like<00:05:56.090> yeah<00:05:56.570> I

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
in but until that is kind of like yeah I

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.230 
in but until that is kind of like yeah I
think<00:05:57.680> the<00:05:57.860> head<00:05:58.070> knowledge<00:05:58.250> yeah<00:05:58.669> he's<00:05:59.090> gone

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
think the head knowledge yeah he's gone

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.370 
think the head knowledge yeah he's gone
okay<00:05:59.630> I<00:05:59.660> won't<00:06:00.020> see<00:06:00.410> him<00:06:00.530> but<00:06:01.460> um<00:06:02.030> you<00:06:02.300> know
