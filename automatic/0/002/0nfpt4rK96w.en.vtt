00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.800 

well<00:05:22.050> so<00:05:22.860> far<00:05:23.100> I<00:05:23.460> really<00:05:24.120> like<00:05:24.240> these<00:05:24.750> two

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
well so far I really like these two

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.690 
well so far I really like these two
figures<00:05:25.260> that<00:05:25.710> are<00:05:25.770> my<00:05:25.919> favorite<00:05:26.310> within<00:05:26.580> the

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
figures that are my favorite within the

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.010 
figures that are my favorite within the
line<00:05:26.940> I<00:05:27.300> don't<00:05:28.050> really<00:05:28.470> like<00:05:28.770> the<00:05:29.010> mega<00:05:29.220> clap

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
line I don't really like the mega clap

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.450 
line I don't really like the mega clap
but<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.940> punching<00:05:32.940> one<00:05:33.510> is<00:05:33.870> seems<00:05:34.860> to<00:05:35.040> be<00:05:35.130> okay

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
but the punching one is seems to be okay

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.210 
but the punching one is seems to be okay
because<00:05:36.390> he<00:05:36.570> actually<00:05:36.870> has<00:05:36.990> purple<00:05:37.590> pants<00:05:38.010> and

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
because he actually has purple pants and

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.750 
because he actually has purple pants and
then<00:05:38.910> they've<00:05:39.120> got<00:05:39.330> a<00:05:39.360> target<00:05:39.660> exclusive

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
then they've got a target exclusive

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.880 
then they've got a target exclusive
which<00:05:41.760> is<00:05:42.060> the<00:05:43.820> gamma<00:05:44.820> glow<00:05:45.210> which<00:05:46.169> i<00:05:46.530> think<00:05:46.590> is

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
which is the gamma glow which i think is

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.690 
which is the gamma glow which i think is
okay<00:05:47.850> which<00:05:48.810> his<00:05:49.350> veins<00:05:49.680> glow<00:05:50.130> in<00:05:50.250> the<00:05:50.340> dark<00:05:50.580> I

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
okay which his veins glow in the dark I

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.170 
okay which his veins glow in the dark I
might<00:05:50.910> get<00:05:51.030> that<00:05:51.090> one<00:05:51.419> so<00:05:53.000> okay

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
might get that one so okay

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.880 
might get that one so okay
