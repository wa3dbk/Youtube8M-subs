charge<00:01:15.759> of<00:01:15.939> our<00:01:16.090> nation<00:01:16.420> I<00:01:16.479> think<00:01:16.509> it's<00:01:16.780> only

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
charge of our nation I think it's only

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.990 
charge of our nation I think it's only
going<00:01:17.079> to<00:01:17.140> be<00:01:17.200> possible<00:01:17.729> perhaps<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:18.880> other

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
going to be possible perhaps the other

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.190 
going to be possible perhaps the other
biggest<00:01:19.360> talking<00:01:19.539> point<00:01:19.840> about<00:01:20.049> the

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
biggest talking point about the

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.990 
biggest talking point about the
Switzerland<00:01:20.649> game<00:01:20.799> it's<00:01:21.250> a<00:01:21.310> possibility<00:01:21.640> of

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
Switzerland game it's a possibility of

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.209 
Switzerland game it's a possibility of
it<00:01:22.090> being<00:01:22.119> David<00:01:22.539> Beckham's<00:01:22.930> 100<00:01:23.350> cap<00:01:23.590> we

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
it being David Beckham's 100 cap we

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.219 
it being David Beckham's 100 cap we
can't<00:01:24.460> preempt<00:01:24.969> the<00:01:25.060> score<00:01:25.299> I<00:01:25.329> guess<00:01:25.630> but<00:01:26.079> what

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
can't preempt the score I guess but what

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.170 
can't preempt the score I guess but what
would<00:01:26.380> it<00:01:26.530> mean<00:01:26.890> today<00:01:27.399> we<00:01:27.579> do<00:01:27.729> you<00:01:27.789> think<00:01:28.000> to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
would it mean today we do you think to

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.060 
would it mean today we do you think to
achieve<00:01:28.750> that<00:01:28.899> that<00:01:29.380> much<00:01:29.590> yeah<00:01:29.710> I<00:01:29.799> think<00:01:29.860> it

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
achieve that that much yeah I think it

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.490 
achieve that that much yeah I think it
means<00:01:30.159> an<00:01:30.369> awful<00:01:30.460> lot<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.840> go<00:01:32.079> back<00:01:32.259> to<00:01:32.289> his

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
means an awful lot you go back to his

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.980 
means an awful lot you go back to his
face<00:01:32.740> clapham<00:01:33.159> sure<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:34.390> seems<00:01:34.659> a<00:01:34.810> long<00:01:34.960> way
