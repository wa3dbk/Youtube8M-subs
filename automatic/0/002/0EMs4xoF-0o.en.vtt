videos on

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.190 
videos on
and<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.520> ended<00:00:08.760> up<00:00:08.850> deleting<00:00:09.150> it<00:00:09.390> for<00:00:10.050> personal

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
and I ended up deleting it for personal

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.290 
and I ended up deleting it for personal
reasons<00:00:10.500> but<00:00:11.340> my<00:00:11.430> videos<00:00:11.730> didn't<00:00:12.030> really<00:00:12.180> have

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
reasons but my videos didn't really have

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.210 
reasons but my videos didn't really have
any<00:00:12.450> point<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.720> them<00:00:12.809> it<00:00:12.990> was<00:00:13.080> just<00:00:13.290> me<00:00:13.410> talking

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:14.220 
any point to them it was just me talking

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.200 
any point to them it was just me talking
and<00:00:15.290> so<00:00:16.290> i<00:00:16.320> figured<00:00:16.650> for<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:17.010> account<00:00:17.640> I'm

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
and so i figured for this account I'm

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.140 
and so i figured for this account I'm
starting<00:00:18.689> off<00:00:18.779> fresh<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.400> I<00:00:20.400> figured<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.029> my

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
starting off fresh and I figured that my

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.330 
starting off fresh and I figured that my
video<00:00:21.480> should<00:00:21.660> have<00:00:21.810> some<00:00:22.020> point<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.980> them<00:00:23.099> and

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
video should have some point to them and

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.880 
video should have some point to them and
so<00:00:24.000> today<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.270> wanted<00:00:24.780> to<00:00:24.840> talk<00:00:24.960> about<00:00:25.080> looking

think there should be more diversity in

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.790 
think there should be more diversity in
schools<00:01:10.470> about<00:01:10.830> books<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:12.680> automatically<00:01:13.680> I
