00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.660
 question number 1 comes this time from ahmed 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.219
 eleven years young from duisburg the boy 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.440
 husband was with his family in 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.389
 Austria on vacation and then has with 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.980
 his dad the first cologne in 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.380
 visited training camp and asks now 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.840
 actually do this training camp 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.220
 not at home so in the case of the fc too 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.170
 home in cologne there is 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.539
 different reasons are sometimes 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.070
 climatic conditions okay that need 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.900
 not necessarily better in Austria 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.610
 But being in Germany often plays 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.860
 for example if 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.809
 bundesliga clubs during the winter break 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.960
 then there is already a role in the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.910
 south, but also training grounds travel 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.579
 In Austria, for example, you can do well 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.020
 Mountain runners organize all that plays 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.239
 a role and maybe you have too 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.250
 a bit more calm than when the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.920
 held on billy goat home in cologne 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.739
 who wants to become eleven years young from nüsttal 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.870
 know coaching professional footballer 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.030
 actually on vacation, that's all 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.890
 so easy to answer who that depends 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.739
 a little bit of what happened 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.430
 for example, this year 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.049
 Football World Cup and if you go there 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.220
 it was and properly used 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.680
 The body then needed above all else 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.090
 one calm regeneration call that the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.350
 doctors of sports medicine and 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.420
 Of course we recommend that too 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.710
 someday even on vacation they have to 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.750
 Of course, guys will see that again 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.909
 to a certain fitness level in 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.140
 a certain form is coming and going 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.780
 then sometimes jogged 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.220
 but running the right operating the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.850
 happens later in the training camp 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.710
 The 6 year old Nina from Rottenburg wants to 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.290
 know if nationwide coach Joachim Löw 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.790
 now has free until the next big one 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.479
 that would be the championship 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.490
 european championship 2016 in france 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.740
 Of course that's not the case 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.579
 start now soon the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.170
 qualifying games for the 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.299
 European Championship in the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.950
 september and another 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.689
 Joachim Löw did a lot more tasks 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.689
 watch players 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.090
 to co-operate in junior concepts co 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.350
 trainers are looking for all this 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.329
 of course be done 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.799
 it would just be in 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.390
 quotes at big games 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.380
 to sit on the bench and the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.780
 coaching the team 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.420
 So you do not become world champion matthias 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.180
 comes from Konstanz and is eight years 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.590
 old and would like to know how is that 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.670
 because now really like players 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.030
 philipp lame are from the 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.530
 football national team 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.300
 resigned 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.980
 you can not see them in now either 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.459
 the football bundesliga matches as well 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.290
 no more 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.209
 no worries matthias philipp lahm has 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.410
 that also explains he does not want more 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.500
 want to play in the national team 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.870
 focus on his role in 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.910
 Bayern Munich plays in the football 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.349
 bundesliga So you see the philips 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.690
 In any case, the same applies to 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.849
 other resigned national player 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.470
 miroslav klose, for example, still hangs 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.209
 at least one year in the 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.860
 club football and also per 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.450
 mertesacker also from the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.550
 national team is resigned 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.860
 continue playing in the club at arsenal 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.629
 So do not worry the boys play 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.160
 continue football 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.620
 jannis from karlsruhe is a bit 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.849
 surprised and surprised in the 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.069
 football bundesliga will be back 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.690
 But we played in our club in 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.310
 his case in Karlsruhe 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.769
 they do not play again why is 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.830
 that's just jannis it 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.750
 you have to wait and see what happens 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.269
 simply the holidays have to be around otherwise 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.860
 is sure there you can miss schiri 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.760
 then we can not get there with players 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.379
 be because you are on vacation 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.849
 opponents are not there 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.440
 and of course everyone will 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.230
 federation with you it is the 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.970
 Baden always after the holidays 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.830
 resume play is yet 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.010
 clear or with the bundesliga nothing 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.010
 to do 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.440
 stick in nature
