00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
and the zombies don't run or you can

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.109 
and the zombies don't run or you can
have<00:01:22.770> always<00:01:23.009> run<00:01:23.400> like<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.729> explained<00:01:24.090> before

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
have always run like I explained before

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.880 
have always run like I explained before
and<00:01:24.659> then<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.960> doesn't<00:01:25.140> matter<00:01:25.320> if<00:01:25.560> there's<00:01:25.770> no

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
and then it doesn't matter if there's no

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.130 
and then it doesn't matter if there's no
difference<00:01:26.159> between<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.400> day<00:01:26.520> at<00:01:26.640> night<00:01:27.140> player

icons<00:01:28.729> we<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.720> see

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
icons we have this on so we can see

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.140 
icons we have this on so we can see
where<00:01:31.020> each<00:01:31.049> other<00:01:31.290> are<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.860> map<00:01:32.060> so<00:01:33.060> it

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
where each other are on the map so it

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.399 
where each other are on the map so it
gives<00:01:33.270> us<00:01:33.390> an<00:01:33.479> idea<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.110> know<00:01:34.200> where<00:01:34.380> our

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
gives us an idea of you know where our

buddies are generally you would turn

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.740 
buddies are generally you would turn
this<00:01:36.869> off<00:01:37.110> only<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:39.090> were<00:01:39.180> doing<00:01:39.360> PvP

this off only if you were doing PvP
there's<00:01:40.049> no<00:01:40.170> point<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.500> having<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.829> off

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
there's no point in having it off

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.190 
there's no point in having it off
otherwise<00:01:41.040> block<00:01:41.850> durability<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.960> set

otherwise block durability you can set
how<00:01:43.439> tough<00:01:43.799> blocks<00:01:44.130> are<00:01:44.399> now<00:01:45.299> that's<00:01:45.509> tough

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
how tough blocks are now that's tough

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.569 
how tough blocks are now that's tough
all<00:01:45.930> around<00:01:46.290> those<00:01:46.560> because<00:01:46.920> zombies<00:01:47.070> will<00:01:47.490> be

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
all around those because zombies will be

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
dumb blocks to break through them but it

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.429 
dumb blocks to break through them but it
also<00:01:50.670> sets<00:01:51.060> how<00:01:51.210> tough<00:01:51.450> blocks<00:01:52.020> are<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.350> you

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
also sets how tough blocks are for you

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.569 
also sets how tough blocks are for you

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.490 
is nice but a five minute day/night
cycle<00:02:06.570> is

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
cycle is

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.670 
cycle is
ridiculous<00:02:09.090> drop<00:02:10.090> on<00:02:10.270> death<00:02:10.479> if<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:10.959> die<00:02:11.200> what

hotbar down below same as in Minecraft

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.600

your hotbar

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.280 
your hotbar
so<00:02:30.640> that's<00:02:30.849> depending<00:02:31.840> on<00:02:31.930> what<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.170> prefer

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
so that's depending on what you prefer

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.259 
so that's depending on what you prefer
we<00:02:32.920> go<00:02:33.040> for<00:02:33.220> tool<00:02:33.340> belt<00:02:33.519> only<00:02:33.670> because<00:02:34.090> that's

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
we go for tool belt only because that's

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.550 
we go for tool belt only because that's
the<00:02:34.450> setting<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.019> game<00:02:35.140> started<00:02:35.530> with

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
the setting that the game started with

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.490 
the setting that the game started with
it's<00:02:35.920> what<00:02:36.099> we're<00:02:36.250> used<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:36.849> it<00:02:37.410> won't<00:02:38.410> we

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
it's what we're used to and it won't we

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.070 
it's what we're used to and it won't we
set<00:02:38.739> it<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:38.920> nothing<00:02:39.459> for<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.760> while<00:02:39.900> no<00:02:40.900> one

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
set it to nothing for a while no one

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.479 
set it to nothing for a while no one
cared<00:02:41.290> if<00:02:41.410> they<00:02:41.530> died<00:02:41.680> because<00:02:42.100> you<00:02:42.310> didn't

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
cared if they died because you didn't

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.800 
cared if they died because you didn't
lose<00:02:42.640> anything

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
lose anything

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.930 
lose anything
so<00:02:44.200> tool<00:02:44.530> belt<00:02:44.739> means<00:02:44.920> there<00:02:45.190> is<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.700> penalty

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
so tool belt means there is a penalty

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.820 
so tool belt means there is a penalty
for<00:02:46.269> dying<00:02:46.450> because<00:02:47.140> you<00:02:47.290> can<00:02:47.440> still<00:02:47.560> go<00:02:47.680> pick

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
for dying because you can still go pick

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.680 
for dying because you can still go pick
up<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.010> others<00:02:48.220> before<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.549> D<00:02:48.700> spawn<00:02:49.000> but

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
up the others before the D spawn but

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.059 
up the others before the D spawn but
there's<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.290> possibility<00:02:50.440> than

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
there's the possibility than

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.759 
there's the possibility than
disappearing<00:02:51.610> drop<00:02:52.480> on<00:02:52.660> quit<00:02:52.959> that's

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
disappearing drop on quit that's

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.530 
disappearing drop on quit that's
interesting<00:02:54.459> option<00:02:54.730> they<00:02:54.819> put<00:02:54.970> in<00:02:55.090> if<00:02:55.360> you're

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
interesting option they put in if you're

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.220 
interesting option they put in if you're
if<00:02:55.810> you're<00:02:55.930> having<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.349> public<00:02:56.890> server<00:02:58.019> drop<00:02:59.019> on

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
if you're having a public server drop on

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.770 
if you're having a public server drop on
quit<00:02:59.590> would<00:03:00.130> be<00:03:00.280> actually<00:03:00.640> something<00:03:01.269> good<00:03:01.569> to

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
quit would be actually something good to

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.339 
quit would be actually something good to
have<00:03:03.180> most<00:03:04.180> people<00:03:04.450> would<00:03:04.540> probably<00:03:04.750> set<00:03:05.200> it

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
have most people would probably set it

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.809 
have most people would probably set it
to<00:03:05.500> everything<00:03:05.950> but<00:03:06.280> that<00:03:06.340> way<00:03:06.610> somebody

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
to everything but that way somebody

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.180 
to everything but that way somebody
can't<00:03:07.090> come<00:03:07.299> into<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.599> public<00:03:08.260> server<00:03:08.470> take

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
can't come into a public server take

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.400 
can't come into a public server take
some<00:03:09.670> high-value<00:03:09.880> materials<00:03:10.720> they<00:03:10.900> find<00:03:11.170> and

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
some high-value materials they find and

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.110 
some high-value materials they find and
then<00:03:11.769> just<00:03:11.980> quit<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.400> leave<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:12.940> never<00:03:13.000> come

then just quit and leave and never come

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.360 
then just quit and leave and never come
back<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.959> know<00:03:14.079> therefore<00:03:15.010> destroy

those materials we have a sense of
nothing<00:03:18.970> obviously<00:03:19.269> because<00:03:19.480> we<00:03:19.600> we<00:03:19.870> play

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
nothing obviously because we we play

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.009 
nothing obviously because we we play
with<00:03:20.560> just<00:03:20.920> our<00:03:21.130> group<00:03:21.660> but<00:03:22.660> that<00:03:22.870> would<00:03:22.989> be

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
with just our group but that would be

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.720 
with just our group but that would be
something<00:03:23.350> good<00:03:23.620> to<00:03:23.680> keep<00:03:24.220> in<00:03:24.370> mind<00:03:24.549> in<00:03:24.700> case

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
something good to keep in mind in case

playing PvP or anything

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.710 
playing PvP or anything
I<00:04:35.070> suppose<00:04:36.070> if<00:04:36.250> we<00:04:36.340> were<00:04:36.460> playing<00:04:36.580> PvP<00:04:36.850> or

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
I suppose if we were playing PvP or

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.780 
I suppose if we were playing PvP or
something<00:04:38.680> like<00:04:38.740> that<00:04:38.800> we<00:04:39.220> we<00:04:39.490> could<00:04:39.640> probably

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
something like that we we could probably

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.500 
something like that we we could probably
set<00:04:40.150> it<00:04:40.180> to<00:04:41.070> normal<00:04:42.070> or<00:04:42.220> fast<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:42.880> fast<00:04:43.330> is

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
set it to normal or fast and fast is

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.740 
set it to normal or fast and fast is
half<00:04:43.690> time<00:04:45.090> so<00:04:46.090> you<00:04:46.330> know<00:04:46.420> that's<00:04:46.570> the

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
half time so you know that's the

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.560 
half time so you know that's the
settings<00:04:47.340> but<00:04:48.340> for<00:04:48.730> the<00:04:48.880> most<00:04:49.030> part<00:04:49.300> I<00:04:49.510> don't

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
settings but for the most part I don't

like<00:04:49.810> crafting<00:04:50.320> timers<00:04:50.710> it's<00:04:50.920> just<00:04:51.310> tedious

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
like crafting timers it's just tedious

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.350 
like crafting timers it's just tedious
it<00:04:51.910> creates<00:04:52.180> downtime<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:54.400> only<00:04:54.760> plus<00:04:55.060> side

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
it creates downtime the only plus side

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.720 
it creates downtime the only plus side
of<00:04:55.510> it<00:04:55.600> in<00:04:55.750> this<00:04:55.960> game<00:04:56.200> is<00:04:56.530> that<00:04:56.830> if<00:04:57.490> you<00:04:57.670> start

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
of it in this game is that if you start

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.150 
of it in this game is that if you start
crafting<00:04:58.480> something<00:04:58.720> in<00:04:59.170> your<00:04:59.440> inventory

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
crafting something in your inventory

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.120 
crafting something in your inventory
it'll<00:05:01.030> keep<00:05:01.270> crafting<00:05:01.800> while<00:05:02.800> you're<00:05:03.010> moving

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
it'll keep crafting while you're moving

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.470 
it'll keep crafting while you're moving
around<00:05:03.340> so<00:05:03.580> you<00:05:03.670> can<00:05:03.760> go<00:05:03.850> around<00:05:03.940> doing<00:05:04.330> other

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
around so you can go around doing other

around so you can go around doing other
stuff<00:05:04.600> while<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.470> stuff<00:05:05.650> you<00:05:05.800> started

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
stuff while the stuff you started

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.680 
stuff while the stuff you started
crafting<00:05:06.250> it<00:05:06.610> is<00:05:06.730> crafting<00:05:07.240> inside<00:05:07.510> of<00:05:07.600> your
