00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.850
 in this case we are going to talk about the 103rd 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.560
 that is a light vehicle the light ones 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.390
 has a category until 20 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.040
 tons exceeded 20 tons and 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.529
 up to 40 tons 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.320
 we talk about medium vehicles like the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.170
 who saw the tam this pst of 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.940
 Argentine manufacture and exceeded 40 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.489
 tonnes entered the range of 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.460
 heavy that our army does not have 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.739
 of none within its envelope of 20 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.010
 It is a motor of 5,200 centimeters 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.409
 Cubic may seem small displacement 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.839
 for the force that develops 210 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.960
 horsepower but being an engine 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:56.460
 two-stroke has a high 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.320
 number of revolutions per minute that 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.269
 does not need a fuel transfer pump for 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.280
 the whole work is 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:06.369
 in the same body 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.750
 luminaries of ports and four valves 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.750
 exhaust by cylinders 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.500
 in particular m113 is a vehicle that 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.659
 designed USA in the 50s that 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.170
 had the purpose of transporting his 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.539
 staff of large grounds in little 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.789
 time with a particularity that what 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.260
 can do inside this environment with 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.970
 aggressive chemicals 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.950
 What this vehicle has is that it can 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.770
 go through that of that environment with 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.540
 aggressive chemicals and can not operate 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.190
 characteristic that the bsp of the family 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.980
 so if you can do this vehicle is 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.350
 designed with a system that you can can 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.300
 make your crew subsist without 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.120
 problems because it filters the air then 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.280
 as I told you this engine is connected to 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.040
 an allison speed house 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.170
 automatic where you have four regimes 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.180
 forward gear and a reverse 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.070
 beyond everything has its peculiarity 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.840
 what is anfield is a vehicle that can 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.729
 enter the water and float by their 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.740
 features to enter and exit the 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.300
 water is used at the lowest speed and 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.400
 good in the water is little maneuverable 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.880
 but has the ability to be able to reach 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.880
 let's move 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.720
 the current of the river that must cross 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.240
 the obstacle 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.380
 you have to cross does not have superior to 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.090
 three meters per second 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.160
 the water current exceeds three 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.940
 meters per second if you take them and you 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.940
 it becomes ungovernable 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.600
 the differential the ridiculous that caterpillar 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.790
 apart from the specific function of 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.910
 difference that is to distribute the power 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.130
 motor around 2 to 20 gas 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.500
 in the caterpillar vehicles it is also used 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.690
 as a direction since by means of 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.920
 controls an output of the 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.140
 differential 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.910
 and all the engine power goes to the 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.220
 another place like that is like the drug vehicle 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.140
 is handled the crew is divided into 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.970
 two teams that we call them the 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.550
 vehicular equipment that is the personnel that 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.739
 goes with the vehicle and does not disembark in 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.170
 this case we talk about the prompter of 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.270
 vehicle and the driver and the party 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.250
 maneuver that is the part that touches us 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.680
 us who is the infantry in this 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.220
 mechanized case that disembarks the crankcase 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.890
 of the engine has 18 liters of lubricant 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.019
 and lubrication despite being a 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.850
 vehicle of a two-stroke engine is 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.350
 a common lubrication as we can 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.930
 find in another type of engine with 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.730
 pressure oil pump and the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.340
 differential that we see here is all this 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.319
 set this set of leads 19 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.239
 liters of oil of the same one that the 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.519
 engine the main weapon that has the 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.930
 Support is a 12 7 caliber machine gun 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.670
 millimeters 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.849
 has an effective ground reach 1000 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.620
 meters and 750 yearning for a novation is 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.500
 interesting for what is the group of 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.810
 infantry shooters after for 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.850
 cool down this whole set gets a 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.520
 fan on top 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.230
 he puts air inside the compartment and 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.420
 being closed everything has no where 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.840
 get out that air comes out through the 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.420
 radiator and keeping the engine to a 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.790
 Working temperature suitable for not 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.790
 I got to have no damage 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.959
 we are very close to the end of the program 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.630
 but do not worry I will not let you 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.480
 so I'm going to present you the third 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.850
 battleship this yes is already the last one like this 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.020
 that takes this note very much because of 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.020
 here you can learn 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.300
 the tower n dry I feel 5 has a 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:56.240
 aiming device which is called s 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:59.530
 129 is an infrared device which 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.890
 Allows you to see the vehicle at night 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.740
 propelled by a powerboat 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:10.850
 called esteller 7 ugly 6 cylinders 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:13.280
 online and it's the turbo powered said 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.500
 engine is specifically constituted 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.660
 to move this vehicle around 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.650
 type of land as endowment 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:25.520
 armament has the ms the amg uses it 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.590
 as coaxial while coaxial remains or is 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.070
 can use as our sovereignty 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.620
 air with a displacement of 9 thousand 981 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.610
 cubic centimeters and a power of 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.610
 320 hp 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.460
 the distant boss 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:53.730
 possesses its 735 sighting apparatus owns two 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.340
 eyepieces to perform a view with 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.050
 better panorama has a house capacity 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.150
 tanks in the army 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.940
 Argentine we consider it a vehicle 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.680
 lightweight supported by a 105- barrel 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.040
 millimeters that has a capacity of 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.669
 effective range of 2000 meters can 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:15.440
 shoot projectiles explosive charges 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:15.440
 incendiary fumigant perforators 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.030
 also consists of 6 projectiles that 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.650
 They serve to create a smokescreen 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.630
 approximately 25 meters in front of 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.390
 vehicle by the bearing system 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:32.120
 of the vehicle is basically composed 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.820
 by five pairs of bearing wheels 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:38.900
 of support rollers on the first wheel 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:41.120
 of bearing we have a shock absorber and 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.640
 a truncated cone spring which is what 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.210
 allows in case the vehicle hits 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:50.570
 what supports all the weight has a 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:53.710
 fuel tank with 350 liters of 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:57.440
 gasoil this gives you autonomy 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:07:00.890
 520 kilometers the box that uses the 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:04.220
 vehicle are 6 speeds and one 

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.810
 speed reversing speed in 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:10.389
 highway 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.389
 at 65 kilometers per hour
