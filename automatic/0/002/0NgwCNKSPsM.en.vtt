raised up and this actually provides for

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.280 
raised up and this actually provides for
some<00:01:43.580> shock<00:01:43.909> absorption<00:01:44.540> if<00:01:44.900> you<00:01:45.020> were<00:01:45.140> to

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290

some shock absorption if you were to
drop<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.799> phone<00:01:46.009> it<00:01:46.340> puts<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.090> little<00:01:47.330> space

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
between the actual phone and the case

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.190

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
you're not going to have the case like

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.410

thing the only drawback to the design of
this<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:14.329> that<00:02:14.570> it<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:14.840> glossy<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:15.799> that<00:02:15.950> would

and<00:02:49.780> like<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:50.840> said<00:02:50.989> it<00:02:51.319> is<00:02:51.349> very<00:02:51.890> hard<00:02:52.220> even<00:02:52.430> to

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
and like I said it is very hard even to

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.009

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.199 
fits very very snuggly let's see here
one<00:03:02.599> drawback<00:03:03.200> with<00:03:03.829> this<00:03:04.099> being<00:03:04.819> that<00:03:05.060> it's

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
one drawback with this being that it's

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.190 
one drawback with this being that it's
on<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.750> device<00:03:06.470> with<00:03:06.680> an<00:03:06.799> extended<00:03:07.340> battery

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
on a device with an extended battery

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.720 
on a device with an extended battery
this<00:03:09.200> headphone<00:03:09.709> jack<00:03:10.069> when<00:03:10.250> I<00:03:10.280> went<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:10.519> plug

this headphone jack when I went to plug
in<00:03:10.879> some<00:03:11.090> of<00:03:11.239> my<00:03:11.389> headphones<00:03:11.780> now<00:03:12.370> my<00:03:13.370> car

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
in some of my headphones now my car

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.059 
in some of my headphones now my car
audio<00:03:13.970> cable<00:03:14.420> plugged<00:03:14.690> in<00:03:14.810> just<00:03:15.049> fine<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.530> my

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
extended battery kind of brings this

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.420 
extended battery kind of brings this
over<00:03:26.180> just<00:03:26.900> a<00:03:26.989> hair<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.500> it<00:03:27.980> just<00:03:28.129> makes<00:03:28.310> it

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
over just a hair and it just makes it

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.830

work<00:03:36.500> some<00:03:36.829> will<00:03:37.010> not<00:03:37.040> but<00:03:38.030> just<00:03:38.209> for<00:03:38.269> me<00:03:38.540> in<00:03:39.530> my

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
work some will not but just for me in my

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.890 
work some will not but just for me in my
experience<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:40.310> didn't<00:03:40.760> really<00:03:40.940> hold<00:03:41.569> me<00:03:41.780> up

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
experience that didn't really hold me up

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.159 
experience that didn't really hold me up
any<00:03:42.079> I<00:03:42.169> was<00:03:42.379> able<00:03:42.530> to<00:03:43.269> still<00:03:44.269> use<00:03:44.299> that<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:45.049> it

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
any I was able to still use that and it

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:46.689 
any I was able to still use that and it
still<00:03:45.410> functions<00:03:45.650> so<00:03:45.980> for<00:03:46.160> me<00:03:46.250> it<00:03:46.340> wasn't<00:03:46.519> an

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:46.699 
still functions so for me it wasn't an

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:47.979 
still functions so for me it wasn't an
issue<00:03:46.819> for<00:03:46.970> some<00:03:47.150> it<00:03:47.449> may<00:03:47.599> be<00:03:47.660> an<00:03:47.840> issue

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
issue for some it may be an issue

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.599 
issue for some it may be an issue
another<00:03:48.349> cool<00:03:48.650> thing<00:03:48.680> about<00:03:48.949> this<00:03:49.190> is<00:03:49.250> you<00:03:49.489> do

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
another cool thing about this is you do

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.059 
another cool thing about this is you do
have<00:03:49.760> these<00:03:49.879> rubber<00:03:50.290> buttons<00:03:51.290> that<00:03:51.650> overlay

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
have these rubber buttons that overlay

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.710 
have these rubber buttons that overlay
over<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.669> buttons<00:03:52.940> on<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.150> phone<00:03:53.359> so

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
over the buttons on the phone so

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.479 
over the buttons on the phone so
whenever<00:03:54.440> you<00:03:54.590> press<00:03:54.799> the<00:03:55.010> buttons<00:03:55.340> you're

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
whenever you press the buttons you're

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.339 
whenever you press the buttons you're
going<00:03:55.609> to<00:03:55.669> get<00:03:55.760> a<00:03:55.819> real<00:03:56.060> good<00:03:56.410> response<00:03:57.410> there

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
going to get a real good response there

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.930 
going to get a real good response there
so<00:04:00.349> those<00:04:00.500> are<00:04:00.530> very<00:04:00.739> tactile<00:04:01.280> and<00:04:01.609> they<00:04:01.699> feel

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
so those are very tactile and they feel

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.289 
so those are very tactile and they feel
very<00:04:02.120> good<00:04:02.359> there<00:04:03.549> overall<00:04:04.549> this<00:04:04.760> case<00:04:05.030> is

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
very good there overall this case is

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:06.729 
very good there overall this case is
awesome<00:04:05.750> this<00:04:05.840> probably<00:04:06.199> one<00:04:06.290> of<00:04:06.319> my<00:04:06.379> favorite

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
awesome this probably one of my favorite

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.470 
awesome this probably one of my favorite
cases<00:04:06.919> better<00:04:07.310> than<00:04:07.489> any<00:04:07.669> rocketfish<00:04:08.209> case

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
cases better than any rocketfish case

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.409 
cases better than any rocketfish case

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
this thing a 9 out of 10 just the just

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.020 
this thing a 9 out of 10 just the just
the<00:04:30.440> only<00:04:30.620> disadvantage<00:04:30.889> is<00:04:31.219> like<00:04:31.340> i<00:04:31.430> said<00:04:31.700> was

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
the only disadvantage is like i said was

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.610 
the only disadvantage is like i said was
the<00:04:32.240> glossy<00:04:32.479> finish<00:04:32.870> but<00:04:33.020> i<00:04:33.050> actually<00:04:33.200> like

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
the glossy finish but i actually like

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.559 
the glossy finish but i actually like
the<00:04:33.770> glossy<00:04:34.099> finish<00:04:34.370> so<00:04:34.520> for<00:04:34.700> me<00:04:34.849> even

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:35.569 
the glossy finish so for me even

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:36.939 
the glossy finish so for me even
if<00:04:35.629> it<00:04:35.719> did<00:04:35.899> get<00:04:36.020> scratched<00:04:36.379> it<00:04:36.559> is<00:04:36.710> white<00:04:36.919> so

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
if it did get scratched it is white so

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:38.350 
if it did get scratched it is white so
you<00:04:37.219> wouldn't<00:04:37.429> really<00:04:37.520> be<00:04:37.610> able<00:04:37.789> to<00:04:37.939> tell<00:04:38.149> very
