00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 I'm Lord Thomas 3 and today I'm going to talk about 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.480
 some of the worst games of the 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.820
 story for some final fantasy 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.950
 seventh is a masterpiece just like 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.360
 others think that zelda ocarina of time 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.340
 it is second to none 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.750
 no doubt the videogame industry 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.690
 has brought great works of art 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.550
 deserving of admiration but all 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.529
 it has its dark side and like 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.720
 great masterpieces have marked the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.490
 big aberrations industry too 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.160
 they have left their mark in one way or another 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.980
 in the world of electronic entertainment the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.309
 first and the extraterrestrial ran the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.739
 1982 and Steven Spielberg showed the 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.180
 world his movie et the extraterrestrial 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.730
 It did not take long to become a 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.100
 success of criticism and public in that 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.500
 then employers already knew the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.239
 pull that licenses could have like this 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.219
 that atari entered into negotiations with 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.809
 spielberg and universal pictures for 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.050
 make a game with the endearing 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.149
 alien as protagonist atari paid 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.100
 a millionaire got the rights and 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.160
 he set out to make an action game 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.290
 based on the movie unfortunately and 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.450
 just like it happens nowadays a 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.900
 license is not synonymous with quality but 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.780
 rather 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.060
 on the contrary we go that the game was 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.680
 frightful one of the worst titles of 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.230
 the story in addition to a brutal 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.390
 commercial breakdown in fact usually 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.190
 talk about the extra-terrestrial as 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.830
 one of the main causes of 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.960
 atari bankruptcy is at this point in the 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.090
 that reality begins to mix with 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.040
 the urban legend since many say 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.540
 that atari had so much hope in 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.160
 this video game that produced more 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.160
 cartridges that consoles had in the 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.410
 market is also counted that when the 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.180
 bump was already a reality between 10 and 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.369
 12 trucks moved thousands of 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.200
 cartridges from the extra-terrestrial to a 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.470
 landfill in the desert of new mexico 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.350
 where the second bus was buried and 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.630
 3 of the history and development of bugs and 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.430
 has some internet stink and that is 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.619
 was born as a platform whose mechanics 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.630
 of games closely resembled those of the 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.910
 most known characters of that time 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.650
 and that's why throughout his 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.720
 there had to dwell among the 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.000
 shadows without receiving too much attention 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.550
 on the part of the press and especially of 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.730
 few fans knew that this 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.260
 was going to change when in 1996 he took out the 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.659
 decides to present in society 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.790
 and three of which after being sentenced to 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.860
 ostracism in the two dimensions it 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.129
 betting fully on the nascent third 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.900
 dimension of the hand of a playstation 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:27.629
 it was so for the first time wuxi gave the 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.819
 jump to the 3d using a perspective on 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.650
 third person we controlled the lynx 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.780
 from the same point of view that already 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.209
 we had witnessed in games like tomb 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.099
 raider or crash bandicoot part of the 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.989
 charm of this gem consisted of 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.150
 pick up atoms instead of coins or 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.280
 rings jump on aliens or plane 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.290
 shoot them with our ammunition or the 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.379
 great super secret surprise of the game 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.389
 pick up parts of a rocket let's say that 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.639
 they were not too original mechanics 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:56.010
 but at least conceptually they had 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.019
 true merit but of course there was a 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.629
 small great detail that sent all 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.700
 these good ideas straight to the canyon and it's 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.340
 that control of wuxi was a nightmare 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.200
 If by itself it was already poorly implemented 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.180
 all this was aggravated by the fact 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.549
 that running a simple jump seemed 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.349
 something too complicated and you have to 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.870
 admit it if in a platform game 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.569
 the jumps are imprecise and tangled 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.780
 almost that is doomed to failure 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.879
 the third golden the corrupt agent that 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.680
 in the same game title appear the 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.840
 golden eye name accompanied by 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.329
 corrupt adjective was no longer a good sign 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.670
 if in addition behind was the modus 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.799
 luckily operandi forgotten 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.930
 you grow in the present generation a 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.719
 generation after the masterpiece of 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.709
 rave for nintendo 64 came to the worst 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:43.109
 of nightmares 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.849
 James bond wandered with more grief than 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.060
 glory for the generation of playstation 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.739
 2 game cube and xbox and with ado 2 and 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.439
 killzone in their respective consoles 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.260
 he arrived with golden eye under his arm and 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:57.719
 he put it in the linear market based only 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.909
 in cleaning enemy areas without 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:02.519
 nothing that would remember the universe by how 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:04.260
 situations gadgets and so on if you get 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.590
 to bad holder action game first 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.719
 person would have passed nothing one of their 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.489
 worst sins was to stain the name of 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.629
 golden eye on something so monotonous and 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.060
 foreseeable 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.859
 nacho ortiz touched him he has it clear 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.329
 corrupt one could think that it is 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.889
 any means you have approved 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.259
 similar atrocity 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.060
 if there was little pain that caused a 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.310
 souter full of clichÃ©s and elements 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.050
 stuck with shoehorn of sector that goes to 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.180
 dark side telekinesis and a 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.069
 superagent rechargeable shield to 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.439
 master boss but it is to see how it 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:37.050
 Mancilla goes a name like golden adds 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:39.300
 for the journalist to put the name for 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.819
 trying to sneak up on us was a ruse 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.439
 they were ready or nothing even though the game was not 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.439
 it was more than the mockery of the time
