you know it's obviously more complicated

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.350 
you know it's obviously more complicated

things like that if you want to read
that<00:01:22.310> in<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.369> key<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.820> actual<00:01:24.479> blacks

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
that in the key in the actual blacks

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.620 
that in the key in the actual blacks
enjoy<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.340> all<00:01:26.490> comes<00:01:26.759> with<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.119> case<00:01:27.299> you

have no screen shield or anything like
that<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:30.659> let's<00:01:30.810> take<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.170> off<00:01:32.119> put<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.210> to

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
that so let's take this off put it to

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.340 
that so let's take this off put it to
the<00:01:33.360> side<00:01:34.159> here<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.430> have<00:01:35.630> cable<00:01:36.630> normal<00:01:37.020> you

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
the side here you have cable normal you

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.289 
the side here you have cable normal you
know<00:01:37.409> mini<00:01:37.710> USB<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.310> USB<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:38.970> charge<00:01:39.150> it

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
know mini USB to USB you can charge it

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.210 
know mini USB to USB you can charge it
on<00:01:39.630> your<00:01:40.320> computer<00:01:40.650> or<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.780> normal<00:01:42.780> outlet

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.590 
on your computer or on a normal outlet
so<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.430> case<00:01:44.610> itself<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.479> see<00:01:45.570> right

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
now I did used to try this case with the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.810 
protective film on the back of the
iphone<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.799> wouldn't<00:01:56.070> fit<00:01:56.159> properly<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.790> i

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
iphone and it wouldn't fit properly so i

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.429 
iphone and it wouldn't fit properly so i
would<00:01:57.000> recommend<00:01:57.420> if<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.570> have<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.259> take

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
would recommend if you have that to take

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.580 
would recommend if you have that to take
it<00:01:58.560> off<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:59.549> know<00:01:59.670> it's<00:01:59.880> i<00:02:00.180> prefer<00:02:00.960> cases<00:02:01.439> that

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
it off you know it's i prefer cases that

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.649 
it off you know it's i prefer cases that
can<00:02:01.799> fit<00:02:02.130> with<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.610> protective<00:02:03.329> on<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.479> back

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
can fit with the protective on the back

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.560 
can fit with the protective on the back
but<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.170> know<00:02:04.290> what<00:02:04.469> can<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.710> do<00:02:05.329> most<00:02:06.329> cases

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
but you know what can you do most cases

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.850 
but you know what can you do most cases
actually<00:02:06.930> out<00:02:07.259> there<00:02:07.290> can<00:02:08.420> top<00:02:09.420> space<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:10.080> to

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
actually out there can top space to to

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.410 
actually out there can top space to to
have

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
have

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.199 
have
in<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.540> back<00:02:12.340> so<00:02:13.340> basically<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.849> put<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:14.120> in

don't<00:02:21.020> damage<00:02:21.230> them<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.709> then<00:02:22.310> just

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
don't damage them and then just

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.160 
don't damage them and then just
basically<00:02:22.880> just<00:02:23.090> push<00:02:23.360> it<00:02:23.390> in<00:02:23.569> like<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:23.750> and

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
basically just push it in like this and

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.059 
basically just push it in like this and
there<00:02:24.260> you<00:02:24.349> go<00:02:24.790> all<00:02:25.790> right<00:02:25.940> so<00:02:26.180> first<00:02:26.989> off<00:02:27.349> you

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
there you go all right so first off you

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.710 
there you go all right so first off you
can<00:02:28.190> see<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.489> top<00:02:28.670> it's<00:02:29.000> not<00:02:29.180> there's<00:02:29.450> nothing

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.990 
can see the top it's not there's nothing
there<00:02:29.900> so<00:02:30.080> it's<00:02:30.230> just<00:02:30.350> clipped<00:02:31.340> in<00:02:31.520> from<00:02:31.880> the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
there so it's just clipped in from the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.050 
there so it's just clipped in from the
sides<00:02:32.239> like<00:02:32.720> there<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.440> right<00:02:33.920> there<00:02:33.970> so<00:02:34.970> the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
sides like there and right there so the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.880 
sides like there and right there so the

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
right there does add some thickness the

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.900 
right there does add some thickness the
iphone<00:02:58.760> obviously<00:02:59.380> pretty<00:03:00.380> much<00:03:00.650> this<00:03:01.220> would

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
iphone obviously pretty much this would

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.809 
iphone obviously pretty much this would
be<00:03:02.090> from<00:03:02.600> there<00:03:02.900> halfway<00:03:03.260> there<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:04.400> there

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
be from there halfway there to there

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.229 
be from there halfway there to there
would<00:03:05.480> be<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.630> normal<00:03:05.989> case<00:03:06.230> like<00:03:06.739> you<00:03:07.220> know<00:03:07.340> we

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
would be a normal case like you know we

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.120 
would be a normal case like you know we
don't<00:03:08.390> want<00:03:08.660> iphone<00:03:09.530> case<00:03:09.739> that<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.010> would

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
don't want iphone case that you would

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.180 
don't want iphone case that you would
have<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.549> then<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.989> then<00:03:12.440> this<00:03:12.709> part<00:03:12.980> is

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
have and then and then this part is

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.830 
have and then and then this part is
pretty<00:03:13.310> much<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.519> keyboard<00:03:14.120> that<00:03:14.239> you<00:03:14.360> add<00:03:14.540> on

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
pretty much the keyboard that you add on

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.120 
pretty much the keyboard that you add on
to<00:03:15.230> that<00:03:15.260> um<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.720> bags<00:03:17.989> you<00:03:18.260> can<00:03:18.290> see<00:03:18.590> it

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
to that um and the bags you can see it

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.349 
to that um and the bags you can see it
is<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.640> pretty<00:03:20.510> deeply<00:03:20.959> recessed<00:03:21.410> there<00:03:22.359> for

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
is a pretty deeply recessed there for

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.599 
is a pretty deeply recessed there for
the<00:03:23.450> camera<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:24.100> then<00:03:25.100> you<00:03:25.250> have<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.459> box

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
the camera and then you have the box

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.060 
the camera and then you have the box
with<00:03:25.880> logo<00:03:26.299> right<00:03:26.600> there<00:03:26.709> maybe<00:03:27.709> you<00:03:27.950> know

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
with logo right there maybe you know

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.590 
with logo right there maybe you know
would<00:03:28.489> have<00:03:28.579> been<00:03:28.609> nice<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:28.850> maybe<00:03:29.120> see<00:03:29.390> like<00:03:29.570> a

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
would have been nice to maybe see like a

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.569 
would have been nice to maybe see like a
some<00:03:30.140> kind<00:03:30.380> of<00:03:30.440> design<00:03:30.769> on<00:03:30.920> there<00:03:31.100> but<00:03:31.280> I<00:03:31.310> mean

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
some kind of design on there but I mean

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.009 
some kind of design on there but I mean
I<00:03:31.730> guess<00:03:31.970> you<00:03:32.090> can<00:03:32.209> put<00:03:32.359> some<00:03:32.510> kind<00:03:32.720> of<00:03:32.750> sticker

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
I guess you can put some kind of sticker

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.190 
I guess you can put some kind of sticker
or<00:03:33.200> whatever<00:03:34.299> so<00:03:35.299> it<00:03:35.510> pretty<00:03:35.660> much<00:03:35.720> works<00:03:35.930> like

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
or whatever so it pretty much works like

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.660 
or whatever so it pretty much works like
this<00:03:36.320> you<00:03:36.530> take<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.829> iphone<00:03:37.160> you<00:03:37.310> just<00:03:37.459> slide

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
this you take the iphone you just slide

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.580 
this you take the iphone you just slide
it<00:03:37.820> out<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.209> then<00:03:38.239> yeah<00:03:39.049> so<00:03:39.200> this<00:03:39.350> is<00:03:39.470> the

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
it out and then yeah so this is the

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.190 
it out and then yeah so this is the
keyboard<00:03:40.010> a<00:03:40.160> very<00:03:40.970> nicely<00:03:41.269> functional

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
keyboard a very nicely functional

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.630 
keyboard a very nicely functional
keyboard<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:44.650> keys<00:03:45.650> are<00:03:45.920> kind<00:03:46.250> of<00:03:46.310> small<00:03:46.459> but

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
keyboard the keys are kind of small but
