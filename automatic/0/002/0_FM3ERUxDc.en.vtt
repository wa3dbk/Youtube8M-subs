00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.779
 There are such games having looked at which 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.310
 can't understand why so 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.000
 interesting at first glance the project is not 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.849
 it turns out will be printed success 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:27.599
 signs 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.050
 you have them there with similar parameters 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.669
 minutes wildly popular 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.719
 rhetorical this question slogans game 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.790
 baku passed away 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.190
 first glance in this case 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.820
 wrongly baku so their brainchild of korean 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.790
 killer companies published in two 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.610
 copies of the company itself 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.840
 on the street for american 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.240
 audience books in Europe 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.280
 at the same time on Saturday mora play you 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.860
 can only North American 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.130
 versions since Hamid 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.020
 blocked its copyright servers 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.150
 of rights 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.180
 Well, what about us if the servers 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.340
 the number of players playing in Baku is negligible 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.660
 little english war of life on 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.430
 deserted land only occasionally was 50 minutes in 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.820
 exclusion player 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.250
 plus there is only one 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.240
 every newbie here is pleased willow paste 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.540
 overwhelm the year 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.150
 let's consider the reason so much 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.350
 remembered the situation 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.450
 The answer is basically as simple as brigades 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.140
 some kind of ideal took 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.369
 mediocrity cried belts no neither 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.020
 one stands out 4 features which 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.869
 would keep the player if he knows what 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.050
 choose alternatives you know many 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.830
 so here is the English war clearly not 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.270
 competitive 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.220
 there are only two nice things that 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.020
 can force to abstain in the game 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.430
 more than five levels 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.160
 Ie up to 15 for example 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.710
 practice and flight if you still need 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.110
 beauty of diverse worlds 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.980
 on which you are traveling 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.690
 just take a look bar cafe scos just 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.980
 admire the views 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.520
 bright sunny valley misty mountains 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.950
 the openwork arches of the building are fantastic 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.119
 flying islands sea and sky 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.960
 all this will not leave you indifferent 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.040
 It is worth noting that the centralization of design 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.580
 game characters and items 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.740
 overall style is most likely 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.920
 nolan only 2 noticeably what is best 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.920
 nadybat artists worked animators 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.169
 games that are implemented 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:14.879
 the possibility of free flight we 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.689
 we know not too much 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.320
 the main thing is that how could its banks life of an 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.049
 vadim feet bank warth 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.069
 they all rushed populations 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.219
 hence the flight is not a guarantee 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:27.369
 good game style 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:29.639
 baku in 5 6 floor is possible from the first level 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.070
 using thick 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.090
 a sort of Iran resign initiatives 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.300
 the addressee level 28 is permanent nice 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:41.049
 There is nothing in Poland 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.389
 innovative interesting plot 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.429
 stood up as banal disgrace 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:47.469
 he live in the center part-time 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:49.979
 there were questions a hero man who would 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:51.349
 won out of a typo 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.609
 however, the dress is not waiting 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.659
 classics for example Voland can he 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.930
 divided the soul beforehand and now only 10 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.010
 thousand years later 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.110
 the second half is building grand 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.199
 plans to seize power 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:04.219
 what side will reproach the players do it 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:06.459
 this mystery is covered with darkness 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.219
 Stas and beat 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:11.819
 choosing your avatar high frequency exactly 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.879
 ordinary but not less depressing 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.519
 situations the choice of classes and 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.059
 character customization 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:18.399
 frankly 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.650
 bank poppy speech in the world for work stations 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.900
 and hairstyles three colors hairs regular 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.699
 stock are entered by the method or rather empty 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:28.129
 further class develops 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.319
 established system in the twentieth level 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.589
 need to choose a subclass of two 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:32.249
 options 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:34.579
 I can with the wizard clinic rangers 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.349
 Reserve and archers and so 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.919
 Further 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:38.749
 of course they are at least somehow different 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:41.049
 skills which by the way is negligible 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.299
 I can do little for example until the twentieth 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.019
 have to run two active with 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.429
 chores with one healing spell and one 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:48.579
 of the following 2 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.109
 death boredom 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.069
 skills learns and improve with passing 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.789
 books 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:55.099
 no tricks to diversify combat 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.079
 interactions of at least the same talents 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.219
 the developers have not provided 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.249
 it should remain clones in the cave 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:04.249
 korean fans just the same 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:07.079
 reached the level you have long and 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.259
 persistently because not even simple ones were killed 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:11.449
 Monsters are difficult and dangerous 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.019
 bar cafe with pumping without a group absolutely 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:14.819
 inefficient 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.159
 just eat well there already twentieth roots and 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.339
 ceases to be missed and the beloved begins 

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:22.339
 the occupation of our asian friends 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.900
 however, the above 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.139
 negative traits can be swept away if you 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.520
 you will not come to the game alone 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.310
 state-owned friends he can even 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.809
 formed pets 

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:33.969
 if the driver is the composition of the permanent group in 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:35.739
 Turkey can be a little different with 

00:04:35.739 --> 00:04:37.469
 passing four dungeons 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:39.709
 difficulty modes and children can even 

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:42.099
 owners of cities having for it a lot 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:44.509
 nice bonuses 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:47.039
 there is only one question why publisher 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.930
 games that almost no one 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.150
 plays which as we proved and is 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.289
 an example of mediocrity 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:53.999
 continues to maintain service 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:56.449
 that will get to do nothing the situation 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.659
 if desired, the Frenchman could have 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:00.080
 bring to mind and do just 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.900
 conflict 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.360
 even despite such competition 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.620
 current market 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.530
 no money 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.820
 time sense however we are not 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.620
 we will ask the tsars questions 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.440
 just vegetation arkhangelsk you
