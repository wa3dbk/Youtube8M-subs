creek or a river or something that had
flowing<00:00:11.820> water<00:00:12.360> because<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:12.870> can't<00:00:13.200> boil<00:00:13.440> water

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
flowing water because I can't boil water

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.760 
flowing water because I can't boil water
because<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.400> lost<00:00:14.580> my<00:00:14.730> flint<00:00:15.170> so<00:00:16.170> that's<00:00:16.619> where

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
because I lost my flint so that's where

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.990 
because I lost my flint so that's where
I<00:00:16.800> was<00:00:16.949> doing<00:00:17.160> right<00:00:17.310> now<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.670> came<00:00:17.880> across

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
I was doing right now and I came across

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.060 
I was doing right now and I came across
this<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.779> don't<00:00:19.199> even<00:00:19.289> know<00:00:19.529> what<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.830> want<00:00:19.980> to

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
this I don't even know what you want to

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.300 
this I don't even know what you want to
call<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.369> he's<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> big<00:00:21.510> rock

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
call it he's a big rock

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.939 
call it he's a big rock
most<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.519> woods<00:00:23.699> was<00:00:23.850> just<00:00:24.060> like<00:00:24.180> this

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
most of the woods was just like this

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.419 
most of the woods was just like this
terrible<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.070> walk<00:00:26.220> through<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:28.189> found<00:00:29.189> this

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
terrible to walk through but found this

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.640 
terrible to walk through but found this
right<00:00:29.640> here<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.060> think<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.599> what<00:00:31.560> I'm

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650

right here so I think that what I'm
gonna<00:00:31.830> do<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.399> I'm<00:00:32.880> gonna<00:00:33.030> find<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.360> little<00:00:33.540> flat

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
gonna do is I'm gonna find a little flat

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.610 
gonna do is I'm gonna find a little flat
rock<00:00:34.260> probably<00:00:34.649> one<00:00:35.550> like<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:36.410> I'm<00:00:37.410> gonna

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
rock probably one like this I'm gonna

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.940 
rock probably one like this I'm gonna
try<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.950> find<00:00:38.760> some<00:00:38.850> sticks<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.390> make<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> fire

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
try to find some sticks and make a fire

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.819 
try to find some sticks and make a fire
do<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> fashion<00:00:41.460> way<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:42.410> don't<00:00:43.410> really<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.800> a

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
do a fashion way I don't really have a

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.819 
do a fashion way I don't really have a
choice<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.460> want<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.820> drink<00:00:45.420> or<00:00:45.829> eat

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
choice if I want to drink or eat

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.560 
choice if I want to drink or eat
anything<00:00:47.160> without<00:00:47.520> feeling<00:00:48.030> sick<00:00:48.270> then<00:00:48.450> I'm

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
anything without feeling sick then I'm

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.200 
anything without feeling sick then I'm
really<00:00:48.930> gonna<00:00:49.170> need<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> fire<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.340> guess

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
really gonna need a fire so I guess

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.660 
really gonna need a fire so I guess
that's<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.510> plan<00:00:51.719> for<00:00:51.750> right<00:00:52.020> now<00:00:52.640> so<00:00:53.640> right

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
that's the plan for right now so right

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.400 
that's the plan for right now so right
now<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.559> want<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.710> find<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.100> dry<00:00:56.489> piece<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.879> wood

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
now I want to find a dry piece of wood

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.630 
now I want to find a dry piece of wood
because<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.440> think<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.949> cut<00:00:59.100> down<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.340> tree

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
because I think if I cut down a tree

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.849 
because I think if I cut down a tree
that's<00:00:59.940> alive<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:01.410> gonna<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.710> too

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
that's alive and it's gonna have too

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.170 
that's alive and it's gonna have too
much<00:01:01.980> moisture<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.640> these<00:01:02.789> some<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.059> these

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
much moisture and these some of these

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.299 
much moisture and these some of these
pieces<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.719> wood<00:01:03.989> they<00:01:04.710> were<00:01:04.769> lying<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
pieces of wood they were lying on the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.310 
pieces of wood they were lying on the
ground<00:01:05.489> like<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.960> have<00:01:06.960> been<00:01:07.110> sitting

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
ground like this have been sitting

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.780 
ground like this have been sitting
around<00:01:07.409> for<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.860> while<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.430> they're<00:01:08.580> nice<00:01:08.760> and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
around for a while and they're nice and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.899 
around for a while and they're nice and
dry<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.590> think<00:01:10.860> if<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.130> find<00:01:11.460> two<00:01:11.640> roads

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
dry so I think if I can find two roads

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.899 
dry so I think if I can find two roads
right<00:01:12.150> pieces<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.600> wood<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.670> generate<00:01:14.670> enough

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
right pieces of wood and generate enough

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.390 
right pieces of wood and generate enough
friction<00:01:15.119> then<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:16.650> get<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.799> little<00:01:17.100> spark

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
friction then I can get a little spark

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.070 
friction then I can get a little spark
own<00:01:17.580> at<00:01:17.729> least<00:01:18.380> but<00:01:19.380> uh<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.979> also<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.700> enough

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
own at least but uh I also have enough

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.730 
own at least but uh I also have enough
parachute<00:01:22.080> cord<00:01:22.670> to<00:01:23.670> make<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> little<00:01:24.030> fire<00:01:24.330> bow

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
parachute cord to make a little fire bow

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.480 
parachute cord to make a little fire bow
which<00:01:25.740> will<00:01:25.950> help<00:01:26.040> me<00:01:26.189> get<00:01:26.310> some<00:01:26.460> more

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
which will help me get some more

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.760 
which will help me get some more
leverage<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.180> I've<00:01:27.900> seen<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.259> done<00:01:28.409> before

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
leverage on it I've seen it done before

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.310 
leverage on it I've seen it done before
but<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:30.000> was<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.240> TV<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.900> guess<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.229> a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
but that was on TV and I guess it's a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.840 
but that was on TV and I guess it's a
lot<00:01:31.530> harder<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:32.360> person<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:35.329> see<00:01:36.329> how<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.540> goes

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
lot harder in person so see how it goes

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.440 
lot harder in person so see how it goes
so<00:01:39.350> here<00:01:40.350> are<00:01:40.470> my<00:01:40.500> supplies<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.369> think<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.270> got

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
so here are my supplies I think I got

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.139 
so here are my supplies I think I got
everything<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.899> need

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
everything I need

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.100 
everything I need
broke<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.360> off<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.619> gonna<00:01:46.829> be<00:01:47.100> my<00:01:47.280> main

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
broke this off this is gonna be my main

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.870 
broke this off this is gonna be my main
spindle<00:01:49.110> hopefully<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.829> can<00:01:50.340> get<00:01:50.579> this

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
spindle hopefully I can get this

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.510 
spindle hopefully I can get this
spinning<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.810> base<00:01:52.040> which<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> dry

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
spinning on the base which is a dry

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.420 
spinning on the base which is a dry
piece<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.850> bark<00:01:54.200> fast<00:01:55.200> enough<00:01:55.560> where<00:01:55.829> this

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
piece of bark fast enough where this

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.350 
piece of bark fast enough where this
would<00:01:56.670> generate<00:01:57.600> some<00:01:57.659> kind<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.140> spark<00:01:58.439> and

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
would generate some kind of spark and

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.630 
would generate some kind of spark and
I'm<00:02:00.360> gonna<00:02:00.509> make<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> bow<00:02:01.049> out<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.579> is

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
I'm gonna make a bow out of this this is

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.330 
I'm gonna make a bow out of this this is
a<00:02:02.790> true<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.119> cut<00:02:03.390> down<00:02:03.710> because<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.950> got<00:02:05.100> enough

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
a true I cut down because I got enough

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.980 
a true I cut down because I got enough
cord<00:02:05.579> left<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.149> that's<00:02:06.540> going<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.719> help<00:02:06.840> me

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
cord left and that's going to help me

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.100 
cord left and that's going to help me
spin<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.409> hopefully<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.720> this<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.869> just<00:02:10.020> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
spin it hopefully and this is just the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.680 
spin it hopefully and this is just the
top<00:02:10.760> so<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.819> doesn't<00:02:11.849> wear<00:02:12.120> out<00:02:12.180> my<00:02:12.450> hand

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
top so it doesn't wear out my hand

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.250 
top so it doesn't wear out my hand
whenever

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
whenever

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.309 
whenever
spinning<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:15.360> I'm<00:02:15.450> really<00:02:15.780> hoping<00:02:16.140> this

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
spinning it so I'm really hoping this

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:24.679 
spinning it so I'm really hoping this
works<00:02:18.170> go<00:02:19.170> ahead<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.409> make<00:02:19.500> my<00:02:19.530> bow<00:02:19.799> first<00:02:23.689> cut

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
works go ahead and make my bow first cut

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:29.990 
works go ahead and make my bow first cut
two<00:02:24.840> notches<00:02:25.019> where<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:29.400> rope<00:02:29.610> can<00:02:29.790> attach

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
two notches where the rope can attach

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:45.360 
two notches where the rope can attach
onto

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.250 

should<00:02:46.030> be<00:02:46.150> good<00:02:46.360> good<00:02:46.629> enough<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.900> keep<00:02:47.080> the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
should be good good enough to keep the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.440 
should be good good enough to keep the
rope<00:02:47.519> from<00:02:48.519> sliding<00:02:48.819> at<00:02:48.970> least<00:02:51.239> all<00:02:52.239> right

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
rope from sliding at least all right

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:20.350 
rope from sliding at least all right
let's<00:02:52.599> see<00:02:52.659> how<00:02:52.720> this<00:02:52.840> works

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.100 

so<00:03:21.360> there's<00:03:21.540> my<00:03:21.689> bow<00:03:23.750> looks<00:03:24.750> like<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.930> little

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
so there's my bow looks like a little

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.280 
so there's my bow looks like a little
bow<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.260> arrow<00:03:26.540> so<00:03:27.540> hopefully<00:03:27.810> that'll<00:03:28.019> work

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.130 

now<00:03:31.290> for<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:32.099> main<00:03:32.280> spindle<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:33.140> get

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
now for this the main spindle you get

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.490 
now for this the main spindle you get
this<00:03:34.260> nut<00:03:34.560> off<00:03:35.900> it's<00:03:36.900> actually<00:03:37.200> nice<00:03:37.470> and

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
this nut off it's actually nice and

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.130 
this nut off it's actually nice and
light<00:03:37.859> and<00:03:37.890> real<00:03:38.220> dry<00:03:38.549> so<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.659> want<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:39.989> make

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
light and real dry so and I want to make

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.390 
light and real dry so and I want to make
both<00:03:40.409> of<00:03:40.439> the<00:03:41.000> tips<00:03:42.000> not<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.480> point<00:03:42.900> but

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
both of the tips not a point but

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.319 
both of the tips not a point but
somewhere<00:03:44.400> where<00:03:44.609> it's<00:03:44.760> going<00:03:44.879> to<00:03:44.939> fit<00:03:45.150> in<00:03:45.239> the

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
somewhere where it's going to fit in the

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:54.080 
somewhere where it's going to fit in the
groove<00:03:45.599> so<00:03:52.250> that's<00:03:53.250> too<00:03:53.430> sharp<00:03:53.700> right<00:03:53.879> there

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
groove so that's too sharp right there

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:06.110 
groove so that's too sharp right there
we<00:03:54.870> get<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:55.019> nice<00:03:55.170> it<00:03:55.349> around<00:03:55.560> it<00:04:04.909> so<00:04:05.909> there's

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
we get a nice it around it so there's

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.440 
we get a nice it around it so there's
that<00:04:06.359> it's<00:04:06.989> actually<00:04:07.609> really<00:04:08.609> light<00:04:08.849> really

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
that it's actually really light really

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.410 
that it's actually really light really
dry<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:10.709> pretty<00:04:10.950> strong<00:04:11.280> so<00:04:12.139> should<00:04:13.139> work<00:04:14.420> now

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
dry and pretty strong so should work now

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.779 
dry and pretty strong so should work now
for<00:04:15.599> the<00:04:15.689> base<00:04:16.099> the<00:04:17.099> only<00:04:17.310> thing<00:04:17.459> I<00:04:17.549> need<00:04:17.729> to

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
for the base the only thing I need to

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:18.620 
for the base the only thing I need to
watch<00:04:17.940> out<00:04:18.150> for<00:04:18.329> us

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
watch out for us

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.129 
watch out for us
I<00:04:18.660> want<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:19.680> little<00:04:19.979> groove<00:04:20.630> so<00:04:21.630> this<00:04:21.870> thing

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
I want a little groove so this thing

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.240 
I want a little groove so this thing
will<00:04:22.590> fit<00:04:22.800> in<00:04:22.979> and<00:04:23.310> not<00:04:23.430> slide<00:04:23.669> around<00:04:25.220> so<00:04:26.220> I

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
will fit in and not slide around so I

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:35.120 
will fit in and not slide around so I
think<00:04:26.370> I<00:04:26.550> want<00:04:26.669> to<00:04:26.789> cut<00:04:32.570> all<00:04:33.570> right<00:04:33.750> so<00:04:34.130> that

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
think I want to cut all right so that

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.589 
think I want to cut all right so that
she'll<00:04:35.310> be<00:04:35.340> good<00:04:35.550> plus<00:04:35.849> whenever<00:04:36.240> I<00:04:36.300> start

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
she'll be good plus whenever I start

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.540 
she'll be good plus whenever I start
spinning<00:04:36.810> it<00:04:37.110> it'll<00:04:37.830> probably<00:04:37.860> make<00:04:38.159> its<00:04:38.400> own

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
spinning it it'll probably make its own

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.469 
spinning it it'll probably make its own
groove<00:04:38.789> naturally<00:04:39.360> so<00:04:39.570> that's<00:04:40.470> good<00:04:40.680> for<00:04:40.710> now

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
groove naturally so that's good for now

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.909 
groove naturally so that's good for now
now<00:04:42.479> this<00:04:42.659> part<00:04:42.930> where<00:04:43.110> I<00:04:43.139> hold<00:04:43.440> on<00:04:43.620> with<00:04:43.800> my

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
now this part where I hold on with my

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:59.370 
now this part where I hold on with my
hand<00:04:44.630> same<00:04:45.630> thing

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.080 

all<00:05:00.380> right<00:05:00.620> that's<00:05:01.220> it<00:05:01.340> let's<00:05:01.790> see<00:05:01.880> how<00:05:02.000> it

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
all right that's it let's see how it

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.270 
all right that's it let's see how it
works
