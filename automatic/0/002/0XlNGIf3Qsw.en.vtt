00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.550
 about to get to our station 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.189
 favorite who is the great bornand so 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.720
 them what they are and what they are there 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.480
 here is a nairobi gentleman was next 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.410
 from me and there we just bought some 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.550
 chocolate buns because we do not have 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.710
 did not eat at breakfast 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.359
 and then I hope we can have beautiful 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.070
 time question I'm snow it's been 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.000
 a little uncertain lately and there 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.649
 apparently it has snowed so 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.860
 I hope it's going to be nice so here 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.079
 stop at the granted a point in 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.270
 championship for me and then what 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.260
 call here in switzerland you're really going 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.640
 that they are two 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.679
 a kind of chocolate twist with 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.089
 the best pastry cream for my 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:50.800
 darling who is completely fond of her 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:52.600
 voice there we go on the road 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.829
 and as I told you we will be there 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.829
 says 6-1 world sales closely 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.590
 m 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.549
 I have a great end I like and -10 ° take 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.530
 it must also be so strongly that we think 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.030
 to ski because she has this is it's 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.440
 pretty covered but I see a lot of 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.240
 sun tobacco so I think it's going bad 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.240
 to discover oneself so that's it 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.830
 where we are in it is very rare that 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.070
 I ski with a cap but I think that 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.650
 it's so cold that the hat 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.910
 is needed and then we'll take the 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.570
 for those who know a big 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.110
 Bornand we took the small and appeals 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.190
 what I call eggs 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.360
 we took the small and ilk that we 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.729
 leads to play yesterday who has a domain 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.170
 tiny with tracking them very very 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.000
 simple and we like you start barça 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.720
 so here we come in not very 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.200
 long the cool thing is that 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.200
 that's beating 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.799
 I'm finished overall 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.790
 weather level but watch out you see 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.650
 there we are again in the hours for 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.230
 down something like 15 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.480
 hours I rattle at the weather level nickel 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.900
 because we had no snow at all 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.430
 there was not much to ask that 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.599
 does a lot 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.680
 well cloud to nothing at all so that was 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.819
 owl by cons it is in the 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.049
 movement and it's been a long time since 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.049
 I have not skied with so much rank 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.620
 when we were really in the mountains 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.880
 it was a bit awkward what we had 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.220
 really hard to move on and then bah 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.070
 it's not easy level at the level 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.580
 visibility and in fact there is almost 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.980
 no snow 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.990
 we were a bit in the infatuation with 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.310
 all we had heard the weather info 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.320
 etc who said there was there was 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.430
 huge snowfall so yes he 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.170
 there was huge snowfall there these 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.340
 two last two days but there is 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.870
 had nothing at all before his fame in 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.670
 does there we have land packs of 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.340
 pebbles at last finally gravel to 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.040
 bopa everywhere I'm fine 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.910
 well allow the expression of nickel 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.960
 skis ggc beware to watch out and then 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.520
 at times I have not seen with 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.080
 pebbles under small combes and then 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.730
 bah voila I am well fart this 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.690
 who in my opinion but hey I had 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.790
 so want to go skiing that bah 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.110
 it's in living me and so here we go 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.280
 return 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.620
 I'm going to take a bowl because 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.970
 the bath after skiing is that at 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.890
 So that's good god here we are in 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.610
 waters and we managed five minutes to 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.610
 village the big losers 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.710
 handbag and shoes 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.419
 and put in my place 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.500
 leaving the road 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.060
 we will avoid this headset 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.320
 how I managed with good snow 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:53.220
 so mines end of his wing that's 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:55.680
 better and it's like socks in 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.910
 more and as they arise the 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.260
 question actually are moonboots 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:04.440
 Versions slim version clogs 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.320
 1000 or 2000 which is what is 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.860
 unparalleled comfort and I think it 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.389
 supports temperatures by -50 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.700
 exaggeration I write your good here we are 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.540
 back from our day so what 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.300
 as promised 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.300
 finally as I promised myself I'll 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.340
 take a bath and actually we went 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.050
 pick up my parcels at the collar relay 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.220
 next side since I have not ordered 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.650
 bad of lush products i 'm going to you 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.310
 show it right now 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.600
 here I ordered down all full in 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.800
 the more I love their packaging of its 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.360
 matisse is for me too it will be 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.139
 yet sam then the neon pink like that 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.820
 I will be completely 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.110
 so that's what I ordered 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.479
 I made a lot of orders what 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.740
 I do not pass very often and if you 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.570
 ask the question i have a lush shop 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.360
 in Geneva when I even have two or 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.050
 three but in switzerland the prices are pretty 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.030
 astronomical so that's why I 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.800
 prefers to order on the internet and 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.539
 I do not have a lot of samples so that 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.050
 it's cool it's own audacity and 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:59.340
 samples 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.380
 so I'm going to test that and then 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.330
 what's the end of the day like he 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.650
 so the blog stops here 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.300
 I hope you will have a good 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.600
 moment in our company I you 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.380
