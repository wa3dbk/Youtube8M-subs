00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
of pure butter these need to be actually

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.180 
of pure butter these need to be actually
at<00:00:32.969> room<00:00:33.149> temperature<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.989> always<00:00:34.680> mix<00:00:34.950> these

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
at room temperature I always mix these

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.040 
at room temperature I always mix these
simply<00:00:35.670> by<00:00:35.820> hand<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.540> don't<00:00:36.719> want<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.899> use<00:00:37.020> a

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
simply by hand you don't want to use a

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.630 
simply by hand you don't want to use a
mixer<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.770> because<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.219> actually<00:00:38.370> adds

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
mixer on this because it actually adds

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.069 
mixer on this because it actually adds
too<00:00:38.910> much<00:00:39.090> air<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.510> makes<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.840> really<00:00:39.960> really

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
too much air and makes it really really

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.319 
too much air and makes it really really
fluffy<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.460> really<00:00:41.640> not<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.000> purpose

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
fluffy and this really not the purpose

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.549 
fluffy and this really not the purpose
of<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:42.930> want<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.110> mix<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.440> together

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
till it's really creamy after you free

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.260 
till it's really creamy after you free
the<00:00:46.950> butter<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> cream<00:00:47.520> cheese<00:00:47.760> really

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
the butter and the cream cheese really

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.420 
the butter and the cream cheese really
nicely<00:00:48.629> with<00:00:48.930> your<00:00:49.110> hand<00:00:49.320> we<00:00:49.530> always<00:00:49.829> add<00:00:50.039> six

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
nicely with your hand we always add six

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.750 
nicely with your hand we always add six
cans<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.969> corn<00:00:51.510> now<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.770> color<00:00:53.010> purposes<00:00:53.610> only

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
cans of corn now for color purposes only

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.790 
cans of corn now for color purposes only
and<00:00:53.969> not<00:00:54.180> necessarily<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:54.989> taste<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:55.620> just

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
and not necessarily for taste but just

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.610 
and not necessarily for taste but just
so<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.039> looks<00:00:56.280> better<00:00:56.660> always<00:00:57.660> use<00:00:57.960> three<00:00:58.320> cans

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
so it looks better always use three cans

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.889 
so it looks better always use three cans
of<00:00:58.829> white<00:00:59.280> shoot<00:00:59.760> dead<00:00:59.969> corn<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.600> drain

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
of white shoot dead corn and I drain

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.170 
of white shoot dead corn and I drain
those<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.949> then<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.100> use<00:01:02.399> three<00:01:02.730> cans<00:01:03.030> of

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
those and then I use three cans of

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.119 
those and then I use three cans of
yellow<00:01:03.600> niblet<00:01:04.199> corn<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.619> just<00:01:04.769> gives<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.040> a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
yellow niblet corn it just gives it a

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.420 
yellow niblet corn it just gives it a
