it<00:02:48.650> came<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:49.040> me<00:02:49.160> that<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.430> unique<00:02:49.700> physiology

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.060 
it came to me that the unique physiology
of<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.570> Metroid's<00:02:51.080> might<00:02:51.320> be<00:02:51.500> valuable<00:02:51.680> to

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.620 
the energy researchers so I took the
