or with 22 a tues um the stickers are
fairly<00:00:15.360> normal<00:00:15.599> quite<00:00:16.260> bright<00:00:16.560> which<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.310> good

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
fairly normal quite bright which is good

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.179 
fairly normal quite bright which is good
and<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:18.380> fair<00:00:19.380> bit<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.650> difference<00:00:19.830> between

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
and is fair bit of difference between

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.080 
and is fair bit of difference between
the<00:00:20.310> colors<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.880> there's<00:00:21.779> white<00:00:23.090> sneakers

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
not black the tumor to you has a fairly

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.950 
not black the tumor to you has a fairly
different<00:00:28.439> feel<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.460> die<00:00:30.320> into<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> two<00:00:31.650> um<00:00:32.960> it's

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
different feel to die into a two um it's

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.869 
different feel to die into a two um it's
a<00:00:34.290> bit<00:00:34.469> click<00:00:34.829> yeah<00:00:36.079> probably<00:00:37.079> not<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.800> much<00:00:37.980> as

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
a bit click yeah probably not so much as

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.930 
a bit click yeah probably not so much as
clicky<00:00:39.300> as<00:00:39.480> an<00:00:39.600> out<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.960> box<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.710> too<00:00:41.010> but

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
clicky as an out of the box we too but

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.010 
clicky as an out of the box we too but
it<00:00:42.120> definitely<00:00:42.270> doesn't<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> same

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
it definitely doesn't have the same

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.569 
it definitely doesn't have the same
smooth<00:00:43.530> feeling<00:00:43.920> as<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.399> Diane<00:00:46.430> you<00:00:47.430> can

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
smooth feeling as a Diane you can

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.670 
smooth feeling as a Diane you can
definitely<00:00:47.910> feel<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.940> young<00:00:50.989> penis<00:00:51.989> on

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
definitely feel the young penis on

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.029 
definitely feel the young penis on
crispiness<00:00:53.399> over<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.149> cube<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:55.350> still<00:00:55.920> very

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
crispiness over the cube it's still very

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.930 
crispiness over the cube it's still very
fast<00:00:56.399> are<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:59.030> kind<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.210> depends<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:01.940> your

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
fast are a kind of depends on your

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.119 
fast are a kind of depends on your
tensions<00:01:03.390> are<00:01:03.539> looming<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.110> general<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:04.979> is

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
tensions are looming the general it is

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.899 
tensions are looming the general it is
quite<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> fast<00:01:05.909> cube<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.330> turn<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:08.549> cube<00:01:08.820> is

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
quite a fast cube to turn the cube is

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.710 
quite a fast cube to turn the cube is
quite<00:01:09.360> good<00:01:09.510> at<00:01:09.659> corner<00:01:09.960> cutting<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:11.450> this<00:01:12.450> one

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
quite good at corner cutting on this one

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.880 
quite good at corner cutting on this one
can<00:01:13.590> do<00:01:13.710> 45<00:01:14.100> degrees<00:01:14.640> quite<00:01:15.299> easily<00:01:15.650> this<00:01:16.650> one

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
can do 45 degrees quite easily this one

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.429 
can do 45 degrees quite easily this one
can<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.479> reverse<00:01:18.479> corner-cutting<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.290> can

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
can to reverse corner-cutting you can

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.719 
can to reverse corner-cutting you can
also<00:01:19.590> do<00:01:19.830> well<00:01:24.650> something<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.979> about<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
also do well something I like about the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.370 
also do well something I like about the
linker<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.780> Roger<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:30.420> far<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.720> haven't<00:01:31.140> had

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
linker to Roger is so far I haven't had

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.380 
linker to Roger is so far I haven't had
any<00:01:31.560> pops<00:01:31.860> solving<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.850> haven't<00:01:33.090> done<00:01:33.180> here

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
any pops solving it I haven't done here

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.390 
any pops solving it I haven't done here
sir<00:01:33.570> souls<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.590> haven't<00:01:34.829> had<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.040> new<00:01:35.189> pond

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
sir souls that I haven't had a new pond

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.649 
sir souls that I haven't had a new pond
so<00:01:35.610> far<00:01:35.850> um<00:01:36.439> it<00:01:37.439> has<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:38.070> sort<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.909> Andy<00:01:39.270> popping

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
so far um it has a sort of Andy popping

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.539 
so far um it has a sort of Andy popping
mechanism<00:01:40.259> inside<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.799> which<00:01:40.920> seems<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.400> work

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
mechanism inside it which seems to work

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.499 
mechanism inside it which seems to work
well<00:01:42.320> kai<00:01:43.320> really<00:01:43.680> see<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:45.030> from<00:01:45.240> looking

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
well kai really see it just from looking

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.770 
well kai really see it just from looking
inside<00:01:46.490> but<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:48.030> very<00:01:48.210> rarely<00:01:48.360> get<00:01:48.869> pops<00:01:50.780> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
inside but you very rarely get pops the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.230 
inside but you very rarely get pops the
cube<00:01:52.079> does<00:01:52.680> lock<00:01:53.399> up<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> bit<00:01:54.320> like<00:01:55.320> Diane's

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
cube does lock up a bit like Diane's

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.520 
cube does lock up a bit like Diane's
barely<00:01:57.240> ever<00:01:57.360> block<00:01:57.930> off<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:01.020> Joseph<00:02:01.409> you

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
barely ever block off the Joseph you

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.959 
barely ever block off the Joseph you
turn<00:02:01.740> fast<00:02:02.070> these<00:02:03.079> can<00:02:04.079> be<00:02:04.290> really<00:02:04.740> key<00:02:04.920> not<00:02:05.850> as

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
turn fast these can be really key not as

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.500 
turn fast these can be really key not as
much<00:02:06.119> as<00:02:06.180> some<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.869> two<00:02:07.020> tattoos

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.860 

but<00:02:11.510> as<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:11.870> can<00:02:11.989> see<00:02:12.230> it's<00:02:12.770> just<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:13.099> few<00:02:13.430> times

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
but as you can see it's just a few times

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.559 
but as you can see it's just a few times
when<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:15.200> missed<00:02:15.860> out<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:16.129> bit<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.519> end<00:02:17.420> off

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
when I missed out a bit and end off

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.740 
when I missed out a bit and end off
walking<00:02:18.260> up<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:19.640> that<00:02:19.940> can<00:02:20.090> be<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.269> bit<00:02:20.599> of<00:02:20.629> a

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
walking up so that can be a bit of a

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.460 
walking up so that can be a bit of a
downside<00:02:25.480> as<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.690> can<00:02:26.780> see<00:02:26.989> during<00:02:27.260> that

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
downside as you can see during that

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.850 
downside as you can see during that
solve<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:28.819> link<00:02:29.150> i<00:02:29.300> did<00:02:29.569> lock<00:02:30.170> hop<00:02:30.349> fair<00:02:30.650> bit

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
solve the link i did lock hop fair bit

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.610 
solve the link i did lock hop fair bit
but<00:02:31.610> other<00:02:31.790> than<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:31.970> is<00:02:32.569> quite<00:02:33.050> a<00:02:33.110> fast<00:02:33.380> cube

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
but other than that is quite a fast cube

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.339 
but other than that is quite a fast cube
overall<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:34.640> don't<00:02:34.940> think<00:02:35.180> Murray<00:02:35.989> lean

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
overall I don't think Murray lean

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.949 
overall I don't think Murray lean
protein<00:02:36.739> rotary<00:02:37.010> is<00:02:37.160> as<00:02:37.370> good<00:02:37.549> as<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.790> dyin<00:02:38.150> you

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
protein rotary is as good as a dyin you

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.380 
protein rotary is as good as a dyin you
look<00:02:39.110> at<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.290> Diane<00:02:39.620> it<00:02:40.190> just<00:02:40.459> turns<00:02:41.120> very

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
look at the Diane it just turns very

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.870 
look at the Diane it just turns very
smoothly<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.140> effort<00:02:42.440> Lee<00:02:42.880> effortlessly

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880
