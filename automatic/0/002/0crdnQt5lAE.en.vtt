00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:08.760
 numbi cpu silicone protective cover so called 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.180
 this case for the iphone 5 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.210
 it is practically a kind of bumper with beck 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:19.259
 case if you want so and jordi 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.499
 It costs about six euros on Amazon 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.599
 Can we buy a volt to link to 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:27.239
 amazon where you directly this article 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.550
 can order and also with this 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.019
 youtube-channel supports you 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.809
 stop right under the video 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.109
 and yes, as you can see relatively 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.199
 black plain of the case behind with 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:44.399
 a red application of design ago 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.750
 is that really nice that that 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.079
 case there is nothing around it 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.309
 complain about my taste of the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.699
 processing ago 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.160
 Well, there you have to say how to get here 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.670
 Also , all the connections will see everything 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.949
 what's on the edges is that it was 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.050
 On the outside, they make the courses a bit softer 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.360
 was probably in the 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.800
 Production poured into a mold and that 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.160
 Unfortunately, it is not very clean 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.680
 So there are here and there and actually 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.810
 everywhere on the ropes they stop 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.300
 are processed relatively and clean 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.460
 you have to stop the price in the times 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.750
 have the back of the head 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.690
 from them would be the connections 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.790
 Simply so to speak looped through the 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.720
 silicone is simply thinner cast 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.200
 so that you can with external pressure also the 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:38.400
 can actually press Yes and 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.260
 from the back the design is relatively matt 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.180
 black looks relatively high quality from the 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.070
 pages are really glossy 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.620
 and that's just a matter of taste 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.720
 insert her or a einging is 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.250
 to pay attention that you with the side 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.990
 the volume control and one 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.720
 switch first and then turns 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.880
 virtually this soft silicone case over the 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.930
 corners drawn and just the last corner 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.580
 is then relatively strict and yes 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.650
 but you can be sure that the 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.720
 does not cover itself on the solves 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.050
 Handy pass as such by the measure 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.820
 very good 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.280
 the connections as you can see here 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.110
 are also good at reaching the envelope 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.090
 do not put on so much on the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.620
 pages processing also looks 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.290
 ugly out just when it is not so 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.420
 is processed clean and yes one sees 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.490
 just a few knew the buttons 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.380
 So far, the mute switch works 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:32.440
 You can also reach relatively well 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.420
 but a little problem is so 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.440
 volume goes plusminus is closed 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.370
 reach and will be accordingly 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.760
 recognized 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.980
 but one problem is that the keys 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.410
 not one hundred percent on the meet 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.480
 what is under this key is that is 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.330
 basically as I said loud and quiet 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.580
 But regulation is synonymous if one in the 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.910
 middle between the plusminus button 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.740
 one has to click and click 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.510
 hits something that's just when you are 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.570
 Blind operated the phone in the bag 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.980
 For example, you want the volume 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:09.550
 change something is that something awkward that 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.980
 net is that is on the front of the 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.450
 frame of the cover also still 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.950
 a certain distance is that means you can 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.110
 the mobile also without problems with the 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.390
 Put old glass on a table or 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.070
 also a flat surface so that 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.760
 Glass does not stop scratching 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.790
 can 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.959
 So all in all, this is for the iphone 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.550
 5 a wonderful protection with some 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.459
 Processing defects and especially on the 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.160
 Sometimes the cover is not 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.020
 100 percent close to so from the 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.130
 Processing who really is not so nice 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.989
 but relatively for the price 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.270
 appropriate if you like this video 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.190
 then just fell for thumb 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.760
 up and please leave a comment 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.890
 submit 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.450
 here it supports this channel and 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.700
 want to buy, as I said in the pocket 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.080
 please do it via the link in the video 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.080
 description thank you
