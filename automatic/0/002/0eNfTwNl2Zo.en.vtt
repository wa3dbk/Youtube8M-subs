well<00:00:01.050> here's<00:00:01.290> the<00:00:01.410> update<00:00:01.439> on<00:00:01.829> this<00:00:02.040> Cub

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
well here's the update on this Cub

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.660 
well here's the update on this Cub
project<00:00:02.820> for<00:00:03.000> a<00:00:03.030> night<00:00:03.350> took<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.620> pull<00:00:05.339> start

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
project for a night took the pull start

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.400 
project for a night took the pull start
off<00:00:07.849> this<00:00:08.849> comes<00:00:09.090> off<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.660> plate

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
off this comes off the plate

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.990 
off this comes off the plate
pull<00:00:10.710> star<00:00:10.950> stays<00:00:11.190> in<00:00:11.370> there<00:00:11.550> it's<00:00:11.700> just<00:00:11.790> four

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
pull star stays in there it's just four

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.169 
pull star stays in there it's just four
bolts<00:00:12.330> come<00:00:12.540> on<00:00:12.920> then<00:00:13.920> for<00:00:14.429> ten<00:00:14.759> millimeter

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
bolts come on then for ten millimeter

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.050 
bolts come on then for ten millimeter
bolts<00:00:15.420> hold<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:16.020> on<00:00:18.470> like<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.789> crank

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
bolts hold this on like in to the crank

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.120 
bolts hold this on like in to the crank
shaft<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.289> big<00:00:22.439> knot<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.830> goes<00:00:23.010> in

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
shaft and is it big knot that goes in

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.550 
shaft and is it big knot that goes in
the<00:00:23.220> center<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.390> pulled<00:00:24.660> all<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:24.990> off<00:00:25.199> what

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
the center so I pulled all that off what

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.109 
the center so I pulled all that off what
we're<00:00:25.740> left<00:00:25.920> with<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:27.769> crank<00:00:28.769> nut<00:00:29.119> which

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
we're left with is the crank nut which

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.830 
we're left with is the crank nut which
was<00:00:30.390> larger<00:00:30.960> than<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.260> one<00:00:31.880> on<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.600> Kohler

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
was larger than the one on the Kohler

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.639 
was larger than the one on the Kohler
motor<00:00:35.390> so<00:00:36.390> as<00:00:36.510> they<00:00:36.660> just<00:00:36.930> going<00:00:37.170> on<00:00:37.290> nuts<00:00:37.500> with

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
motor so as they just going on nuts with

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.040 
motor so as they just going on nuts with
machining<00:00:38.160> here<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.640> actually<00:00:39.149> took<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.629> step

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
machining here I actually took a step

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.200 
machining here I actually took a step
bit<00:00:40.760> like<00:00:41.760> I'm<00:00:42.110> Paul<00:00:43.110> jr.<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.700> just<00:00:44.700> read<00:00:44.969> that

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
bit like I'm Paul jr. and just read that

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.130 
bit like I'm Paul jr. and just read that
out<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.420> little<00:00:45.629> bit

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
out a little bit

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.709 
out a little bit
look<00:00:46.530> scrappier<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.190> actually<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:48.000> did<00:00:48.570> this

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
look scrappier it actually is I did this

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.330 
look scrappier it actually is I did this
step<00:00:49.020> bit<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.710> would<00:00:49.800> self<00:00:50.039> Center

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
step bit so that it would self Center

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.920 
step bit so that it would self Center
itself<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.350> then<00:00:52.350> there<00:00:52.949> was<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.699> dowel<00:00:54.090> right

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
itself and then there was a dowel right

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.650 
itself and then there was a dowel right
there<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.469> drilled<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.579> out<00:00:56.730> because<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.420> didn't

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
there I drilled it out because it didn't

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.709 
there I drilled it out because it didn't
line<00:00:57.840> up<00:00:57.870> with<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.940> bolt<00:00:59.940> holes<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.510> held

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
line up with the bolt holes that held

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.990 
line up with the bolt holes that held
that<00:01:00.780> pole<00:01:01.109> start<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.609> this<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.730> what<00:01:02.879> actually

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
that pole start on this is what actually

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.039 
that pole start on this is what actually
centers<00:01:03.629> are<00:01:04.080> actually<00:01:04.470> like<00:01:04.650> kinda<00:01:05.489> key<00:01:06.049> goes

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
centers are actually like kinda key goes

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.149 
centers are actually like kinda key goes
on<00:01:07.200> there<00:01:07.409> that's<00:01:07.619> what<00:01:07.710> keeps<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.010> from

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
on there that's what keeps it from

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.320 
on there that's what keeps it from
turning<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> crank<00:01:10.220> so<00:01:11.220> i<00:01:11.280> drilled<00:01:12.210> that

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
turning on the crank so i drilled that

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.850 
turning on the crank so i drilled that
out<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> hole<00:01:13.110> now<00:01:13.350> then<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.340> put<00:01:14.700> a

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
out so it's a hole now then I put a

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.950 
out so it's a hole now then I put a
monolith<00:01:16.860> thread<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.250> was<00:01:17.369> by<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.960> eight

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
monolith thread it was by like eight

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.350 
monolith thread it was by like eight
millimeter<00:01:19.439> or<00:01:19.619> something

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
millimeter or something

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.520 
millimeter or something
but<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.390> put<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.810> there<00:01:21.990> with<00:01:22.020> red<00:01:22.320> loctite

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
but I put it in there with red loctite

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.359 
but I put it in there with red loctite
on<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.100> cut<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> head<00:01:23.549> off<00:01:23.869> and<00:01:24.869> now<00:01:28.220> we<00:01:29.220> got

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
on it cut the head off and now we got

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.660 
on it cut the head off and now we got
that<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.590> fit<00:01:31.799> on<00:01:31.829> with<00:01:32.250> much<00:01:32.490> less

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
that so that you fit on with much less

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.859 
that so that you fit on with much less
work<00:01:32.939> than<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.180> expected<00:01:35.509> so<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.570> was<00:01:36.659> going<00:01:36.810> to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
work than I expected so I was going to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.810 
work than I expected so I was going to
tighten<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.530> see<00:01:37.680> how<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.829> looks<00:01:37.950> there

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
tighten it on and see how it looks there

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.260 
tighten it on and see how it looks there
we<00:01:38.909> go

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
we go

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.960 
we go
got<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.049> there<00:01:40.670> it's<00:01:41.670> not<00:01:41.790> really

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
got that on there it's not really

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.359 
got that on there it's not really
tighten<00:01:42.240> down<00:01:42.270> yet<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:43.110> how<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.649> proper<00:01:44.159> size

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
tighten down yet on how the proper size

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.810 
tighten down yet on how the proper size
socket<00:01:45.500> but<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.680> comes<00:01:46.920> out<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.220> there<00:01:47.369> now

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
socket but that comes out of there now

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.539 
socket but that comes out of there now
and<00:01:47.909> if<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.659> turn<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> motor<00:01:49.200> around<00:01:49.430> it'll<00:01:50.430> go

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
and if I turn the motor around it'll go

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.179 
and if I turn the motor around it'll go
down<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.939> shaft<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.619> few<00:01:52.770> people<00:01:52.979> were

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
down the shaft and a few people were

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.880 
down the shaft and a few people were
asking<00:01:53.939> yes<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.630> motor<00:01:54.899> does<00:01:55.229> turn<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.680> same

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
asking yes the motor does turn the same

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.580 
asking yes the motor does turn the same
direction<00:01:56.159> as<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.520> Kohler<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.439> that

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
direction as a Kohler it is just that

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.709 
direction as a Kohler it is just that
strange<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.399> doesn't<00:01:59.729> mount<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> logical

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
strange and doesn't mount to the logical

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.219 
strange and doesn't mount to the logical
output<00:02:00.899> shaft<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.649> mounts<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.340> flywheel

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
output shaft it mounts to the flywheel

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.569 
output shaft it mounts to the flywheel
same<00:02:04.229> with<00:02:04.350> did<00:02:04.500> Nicola<00:02:04.829> Kohler<00:02:05.219> turn

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
same with did Nicola Kohler turn

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.139 
same with did Nicola Kohler turn
standard<00:02:06.180> rotation<00:02:06.329> same<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.020> its<00:02:07.170> motor<00:02:07.409> I

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
standard rotation same as its motor I

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.639 
standard rotation same as its motor I
checked<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.450> other<00:02:09.569> Kohler<00:02:09.869> turn<00:02:10.500> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
checked on the other Kohler turn the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.460 
checked on the other Kohler turn the
starter<00:02:11.039> motor<00:02:11.250> turns<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.480> way

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
starter motor turns that way

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.650 
starter motor turns that way
so<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.250> can<00:02:14.400> verify<00:02:14.610> without<00:02:15.000> starting<00:02:15.540> the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
so I can verify without starting the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.930 
so I can verify without starting the
other<00:02:15.810> crap<00:02:16.290> :<00:02:16.680> motor<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.950> now<00:02:20.130> I<00:02:20.160> have<00:02:20.610> to

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
other crap : motor so now I have to

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.150 
other crap : motor so now I have to
notch<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.870> frame<00:02:23.000> lay<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.180> in<00:02:24.300> there<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:25.160> line

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
notch the frame lay it in there and line

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.380 
notch the frame lay it in there and line
up<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:27.140> crank<00:02:28.140> with<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.470> drive<00:02:28.710> shaft<00:02:29.330> so<00:02:30.330> you

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
up the crank with the drive shaft so you

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.320 
up the crank with the drive shaft so you
see<00:02:30.630> right<00:02:30.870> now<00:02:31.050> there's<00:02:31.320> quite<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.530> difference

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
see right now there's quite a difference

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.540 
see right now there's quite a difference
but<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.630> can<00:02:34.350> probably<00:02:34.500> drop<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:35.010> three<00:02:35.220> or<00:02:35.310> four

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
but I can probably drop it three or four

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.460 
but I can probably drop it three or four
inches<00:02:35.850> right<00:02:36.060> there<00:02:37.040> let's<00:02:38.040> just<00:02:38.130> see<00:02:39.290> at<00:02:40.290> the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
inches right there let's just see at the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.490 
inches right there let's just see at the
same<00:02:40.650> level<00:02:41.040> should<00:02:41.340> be<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.930> kind<00:02:43.410> of

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
same level should be and this kind of

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.440 
same level should be and this kind of
did<00:02:43.770> fall<00:02:43.980> down<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.220> little<00:02:44.490> bit<00:02:44.640> does<00:02:45.090> go<00:02:45.240> up<00:02:45.360> a

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
did fall down a little bit does go up a

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.220 
did fall down a little bit does go up a
bit<00:02:46.910> sound<00:02:47.910> like<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.060> vibration<00:02:48.630> damper<00:02:49.020> at<00:02:49.110> the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
bit sound like a vibration damper at the

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.380 
bit sound like a vibration damper at the
back<00:02:50.240> so<00:02:51.240> yeah<00:02:51.390> that's<00:02:52.020> that<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.210> next

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
back so yeah that's that so the next

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.760 
back so yeah that's that so the next
steps<00:02:54.630> cut<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.960> frame<00:02:55.200> we'll<00:02:55.500> see<00:02:55.650> what

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
steps cut the frame we'll see what

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.100 
steps cut the frame we'll see what
happens
