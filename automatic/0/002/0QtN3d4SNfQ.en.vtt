00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.760 
recommend going with a cream eyeshadow
because<00:02:13.850> it's<00:02:14.150> super<00:02:14.480> easy<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:14.930> blend<00:02:15.320> out<00:02:15.560> and

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
because it's super easy to blend out and

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.590 
because it's super easy to blend out and
apply<00:02:16.100> with<00:02:16.310> your<00:02:16.430> fingers<00:02:16.820> and<00:02:17.060> it's<00:02:17.450> really
