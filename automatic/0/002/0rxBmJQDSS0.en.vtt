00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
all right if you watched the last video

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.749 
all right if you watched the last video
you<00:00:02.700> remember<00:00:03.480> me<00:00:04.020> saying<00:00:04.430> it<00:00:05.430> was<00:00:05.549> kind<00:00:05.730> of

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
you remember me saying it was kind of

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.340 
you remember me saying it was kind of
stupid<00:00:06.000> how<00:00:06.299> they<00:00:06.450> crammed<00:00:06.690> all<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:07.200> the

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
stupid how they crammed all of the

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.100 
stupid how they crammed all of the
important<00:00:08.099> wiring<00:00:08.610> down<00:00:09.540> underneath<00:00:09.929> the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
important wiring down underneath the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.220 
important wiring down underneath the
hard<00:00:10.559> drive

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
hard drive

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.010 
hard drive
well<00:00:13.230> my<00:00:13.679> suspicions<00:00:14.250> were<00:00:14.340> correct<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:15.269> closed

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
well my suspicions were correct I closed

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.439 
well my suspicions were correct I closed
it<00:00:16.199> up<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.590> tried<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.980> turn<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.160> on<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.699> no

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
it up and tried to turn it on and no

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.960 
it up and tried to turn it on and no
boot<00:00:18.779> at<00:00:19.410> all

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
boot at all

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.750 
boot at all
I<00:00:21.000> was<00:00:21.930> worried<00:00:22.470> maybe<00:00:22.769> some<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.310> pins<00:00:23.519> and

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
I was worried maybe some of the pins and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.160 
I was worried maybe some of the pins and
the<00:00:23.820> processor<00:00:24.300> got<00:00:24.449> bent<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.779> checked<00:00:25.050> that

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
the processor got bent I checked that

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.839 
the processor got bent I checked that
it's<00:00:25.439> fine<00:00:26.150> I<00:00:27.560> go<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:29.039> check<00:00:29.340> all<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.670> wiring

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
it's fine I go to check all the wiring

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.429 
it's fine I go to check all the wiring
make<00:00:30.150> sure<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.420> all<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.720> place<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.140> it's

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
make sure it's all in place it's it's

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.650 
make sure it's all in place it's it's
all<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.769> was<00:00:31.890> all<00:00:32.009> plugged<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.340> fine<00:00:35.059> but<00:00:36.059> when

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
all it was all plugged in fine but when

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.810 
all it was all plugged in fine but when
I<00:00:36.690> tried<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.020> boot<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.530> wasn't<00:00:37.860> even<00:00:38.280> reading

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
I tried to boot it wasn't even reading

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.549 
I tried to boot it wasn't even reading
the<00:00:39.000> hard<00:00:39.180> drive<00:00:39.480> at<00:00:39.719> all<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:40.170> didn't<00:00:40.410> it

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
the hard drive at all it didn't it

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.900 
the hard drive at all it didn't it
thought<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:40.980> didn't<00:00:41.340> have<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> hard<00:00:41.670> drive<00:00:41.730> an

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
thought it didn't have a hard drive an

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.709 
thought it didn't have a hard drive an
inside<00:00:42.180> check<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:43.500> cable<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.360> just<00:00:45.360> as<00:00:45.600> I

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
inside check the cable and just as I

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.500 
inside check the cable and just as I
suspected<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:48.510> hardware<00:00:48.960> inside<00:00:49.410> smashed

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
suspected the hardware inside smashed

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.510 
suspected the hardware inside smashed
through<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.690> cable<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.410> metal<00:00:52.949> piece<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.399> it

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
through this cable a metal piece of it

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.380 
through this cable a metal piece of it
smashed<00:00:53.940> through<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:56.090> broke<00:00:57.090> some<00:00:57.360> of

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
smashed through and and broke some of

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.189 
smashed through and and broke some of
these<00:00:57.600> wires<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.530> here<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.930> you<00:01:00.930> know<00:01:01.109> you

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
these wires in here and you know you

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.490 
these wires in here and you know you
understand<00:01:01.829> why<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.370> was<00:01:02.820> saying<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:04.229> like

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
understand why I was saying that is like

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.289 
understand why I was saying that is like
the<00:01:04.739> stupidest<00:01:05.280> place<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.670> put<00:01:05.850> all<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.030> those

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
the stupidest place to put all of those

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.359 
the stupidest place to put all of those
wires<00:01:06.540> was<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.380> cram<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.710> underneath<00:01:08.070> all<00:01:08.220> that

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
wires was to cram it underneath all that

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.630 
wires was to cram it underneath all that
hardware<00:01:09.920> so<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:12.049> I<00:01:13.049> went<00:01:14.040> ahead<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.310> just

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
hardware so I I went ahead and just

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.429 
hardware so I I went ahead and just
popped<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.030> another<00:01:15.299> one<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.509> these<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:16.049> kind<00:01:16.409> of

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
popped in another one of these I kind of

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.960 
popped in another one of these I kind of
rearranged<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> wires<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.460> little<00:01:17.759> bit<00:01:17.939> I

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
rearranged the wires a little bit I

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.010 
rearranged the wires a little bit I
tried<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.479> put<00:01:18.630> him<00:01:18.750> around<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.950> hard<00:01:20.159> drive

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
tried to put him around the hard drive

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.359 
tried to put him around the hard drive
instead<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.140> going<00:01:22.439> like<00:01:22.470> all<00:01:22.710> underneath<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
instead of going like all underneath and

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.600 
instead of going like all underneath and
getting<00:01:23.640> smashed<00:01:24.830> there<00:01:25.830> was<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> little<00:01:26.220> metal

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
getting smashed there was a little metal

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.130 
getting smashed there was a little metal
prong<00:01:26.880> sticking<00:01:27.330> up<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.659> bottom<00:01:27.960> that's

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
prong sticking up on the bottom that's

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.569 
prong sticking up on the bottom that's
supposed<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.650> hold<00:01:28.799> something<00:01:29.220> down<00:01:29.400> but

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
supposed to like hold something down but

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.010 
supposed to like hold something down but
there<00:01:29.729> was<00:01:29.820> nothing<00:01:29.970> there<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> wires

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
there was nothing there so the wires

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.390 
there was nothing there so the wires
were<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.380> getting<00:01:31.590> squished<00:01:31.920> against<00:01:32.310> it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
were just getting squished against it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.789 
were just getting squished against it
and<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.820> cut<00:01:33.030> one<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.360> them<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.110> anyways<00:01:34.500> I

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
and it cut one of them so anyways I

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.910 
and it cut one of them so anyways I
avoided<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.030> closed<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.479> back<00:01:36.600> up<00:01:36.920> with

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
avoided that and closed it back up with

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.700 
avoided that and closed it back up with
the<00:01:37.979> new<00:01:38.280> wire<00:01:38.759> ribbon<00:01:39.450> thing<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.500> works

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the new wire ribbon thing and it works

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.800 
the new wire ribbon thing and it works
just<00:01:40.950> fine<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.490> check<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.600> it's

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
just fine and check this out it's

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.280 
just fine and check this out it's
actually<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.680> pretty<00:01:44.610> nice<00:01:44.909> computer<00:01:48.290> I'm

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
actually a pretty nice computer I'm

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.389 
actually a pretty nice computer I'm
actually<00:01:49.530> really<00:01:50.399> surprised<00:01:50.909> at<00:01:51.390> how<00:01:52.399> how

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
actually really surprised at how how

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.880 
actually really surprised at how how
fast<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.850> thing<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.090> for<00:01:54.509> being<00:01:54.930> six<00:01:55.740> or

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
fast this thing is for being six or

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.450 
fast this thing is for being six or
seven<00:01:56.130> years<00:01:56.280> old<00:01:58.939> it's<00:01:59.939> got<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.649> 2.6<00:02:01.649> gigahertz

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
seven years old it's got a 2.6 gigahertz

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.580 
seven years old it's got a 2.6 gigahertz
that's<00:02:04.060> okay<00:02:04.540> it's<00:02:04.720> just<00:02:04.900> saying<00:02:05.110> I<00:02:05.260> changed

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
that's okay it's just saying I changed

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:13.520 
that's okay it's just saying I changed
my<00:02:05.740> RAM<00:02:07.140> was<00:02:08.140> it<00:02:09.690> yeah<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:11.020> put<00:02:11.530> in<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.920> I<00:02:12.160> put<00:02:12.460> in<00:02:12.580> a

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
my RAM was it yeah I put in a I put in a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.230 
my RAM was it yeah I put in a I put in a
similar<00:02:14.530> Ram<00:02:14.710> it's<00:02:14.920> up<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.190> gig<00:02:15.460> now<00:02:15.640> not<00:02:16.030> a

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
similar Ram it's up to a gig now not a

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.760 
similar Ram it's up to a gig now not a
lot<00:02:16.450> but<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.780> know<00:02:16.960> for<00:02:17.380> an<00:02:17.440> old<00:02:17.560> system

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
lot but you know for an old system

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.100 
lot but you know for an old system
that's<00:02:18.160> plenty<00:02:21.360> 2.6<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.480> get<00:02:22.600> Hertz<00:02:22.780> opinion

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
that's plenty 2.6 to get Hertz opinion

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.199 
that's plenty 2.6 to get Hertz opinion
for<00:02:23.320> hyper<00:02:23.680> thread<00:02:24.100> so<00:02:24.490> it's<00:02:24.730> better<00:02:24.910> than<00:02:25.090> a

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
for hyper thread so it's better than a

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.320 
for hyper thread so it's better than a
regular<00:02:25.480> Pentium<00:02:25.959> for<00:02:26.230> about<00:02:27.010> 30%<00:02:27.370> faster<00:02:27.850> 30

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
regular Pentium for about 30% faster 30

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.900 
regular Pentium for about 30% faster 30
to<00:02:28.480> 50%<00:02:28.840> faster<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:30.070> you<00:02:30.550> can<00:02:30.730> actually

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
to 50% faster and you can actually

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.810 
to 50% faster and you can actually
notice<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.480> difference<00:02:32.190> it's<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.340> really

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
notice the difference it's a really

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.540 
notice the difference it's a really
peppy<00:02:34.180> actually<00:02:34.660> I<00:02:34.690> was<00:02:35.320> like<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:36.070> said<00:02:36.160> I<00:02:36.310> was

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
peppy actually I was like I said I was

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.930 
peppy actually I was like I said I was
surprised<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.720> starts<00:02:38.530> up<00:02:38.709> in<00:02:38.860> about<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.370> minute

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
surprised it starts up in about a minute

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.550 
surprised it starts up in about a minute
or<00:02:40.209> so<00:02:40.390> maybe<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:40.989> minute<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.350> half<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:43.560> just

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
or so maybe a minute and a half I just

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.370 
or so maybe a minute and a half I just
put<00:02:44.830> on<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:46.450> know<00:02:46.480> all<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.780> basic<00:02:47.110> essentials

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
put on you know all the basic essentials

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.380 
put on you know all the basic essentials

PDFs<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.020> stuff<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:54.370> installed<00:02:55.000> a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
PDFs and stuff and I installed a

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:02.400 
PDFs and stuff and I installed a
wireless<00:02:57.540> Wi-Fi<00:02:58.540> card<00:02:59.340> so<00:03:00.340> it's<00:03:00.610> online<00:03:01.410> I've

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
wireless Wi-Fi card so it's online I've

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.440 
wireless Wi-Fi card so it's online I've
it<00:03:03.120> Firefox<00:03:04.120> because<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.690> like<00:03:04.900> Firefox<00:03:06.360> but<00:03:07.360> it

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
it Firefox because I like Firefox but it

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.180 
it Firefox because I like Firefox but it
also<00:03:07.600> has<00:03:07.840> Internet<00:03:08.290> Explorer<00:03:08.620> that's<00:03:09.010> got

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
also has Internet Explorer that's got

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.979 
also has Internet Explorer that's got
Windows<00:03:09.430> Media<00:03:09.610> Player

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
Windows Media Player

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.699 
Windows Media Player
so<00:03:12.060> yeah<00:03:13.060> it's<00:03:13.299> actually<00:03:13.420> it's<00:03:14.290> worked<00:03:14.560> it

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
so yeah it's actually it's worked it

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.789 
so yeah it's actually it's worked it
worked<00:03:15.280> out<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.580> be<00:03:15.610> a<00:03:15.730> pretty<00:03:16.330> nice<00:03:16.799> system

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
worked out to be a pretty nice system

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:23.610 
worked out to be a pretty nice system
here<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.890> let<00:03:21.489> me<00:03:21.549> just<00:03:21.760> show<00:03:22.060> you<00:03:22.410> how<00:03:23.410> fast

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
here and let me just show you how fast

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.440 
here and let me just show you how fast
it<00:03:23.860> is<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.190> see<00:03:24.400> everything<00:03:24.970> just<00:03:25.000> everything

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
it is you see everything just everything

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.170 
it is you see everything just everything
loads<00:03:25.989> up<00:03:26.200> immediately<00:03:26.830> there's<00:03:27.519> virtually

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
loads up immediately there's virtually

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.750 
loads up immediately there's virtually
no<00:03:28.330> waiting<00:03:28.570> time<00:03:28.690> which<00:03:29.350> is<00:03:29.560> really<00:03:30.310> nice<00:03:30.519> oh

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
no waiting time which is really nice oh

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.860 
no waiting time which is really nice oh
and<00:03:31.000> I<00:03:31.060> found<00:03:31.299> out<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.750> hard<00:03:32.019> drive<00:03:32.290> is

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
and I found out the hard drive is

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.350 
and I found out the hard drive is
seventy<00:03:34.870> four<00:03:35.080> point<00:03:35.350> five<00:03:35.560> gigs<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:37.150> just

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
seventy four point five gigs and it just

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.610 
seventy four point five gigs and it just
has<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.570> little<00:03:37.870> bit<00:03:37.989> taken<00:03:38.260> up<00:03:38.440> by<00:03:38.560> the

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
has a little bit taken up by the

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.860 
has a little bit taken up by the
operating<00:03:39.010> system<00:03:39.430> in<00:03:39.549> basic<00:03:39.940> programs<00:03:40.630> and

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
operating system in basic programs and

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.729 
operating system in basic programs and
stuff<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:42.430> yeah<00:03:42.549> it's<00:03:42.970> um<00:03:43.239> it's<00:03:43.470> really<00:03:44.470> good

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
stuff so yeah it's um it's really good

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.030 
stuff so yeah it's um it's really good
it's<00:03:44.980> just<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.820> kind<00:03:46.810> of<00:03:46.930> poorly<00:03:47.560> designed

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
it's just the kind of poorly designed

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.430 
it's just the kind of poorly designed
with<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.670> way<00:03:49.329> they<00:03:49.570> crammed<00:03:49.900> all<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.230> wiring

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
with the way they crammed all the wiring

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.870 
with the way they crammed all the wiring
underneath<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.190> hardware<00:03:51.489> like<00:03:51.670> that<00:03:51.850> I

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
underneath the hardware like that I

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.660 
underneath the hardware like that I
would<00:03:52.269> have<00:03:52.769> made<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:53.799> wiring<00:03:54.250> a<00:03:54.310> little<00:03:54.549> bit

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
would have made the wiring a little bit

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.020 
would have made the wiring a little bit
longer<00:03:54.970> and<00:03:55.360> kind<00:03:55.780> of<00:03:56.820> rearranged<00:03:57.820> it<00:03:57.970> a

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
longer and kind of rearranged it a

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.750 
longer and kind of rearranged it a
little<00:03:58.799> but<00:03:59.799> I<00:03:59.829> guess<00:04:00.010> they<00:04:00.160> wanted<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.519> save

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
little but I guess they wanted to save

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.819 
little but I guess they wanted to save
time<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.180> money<00:04:01.360> or<00:04:01.600> something<00:04:01.959> but<00:04:02.290> other

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
time and money or something but other

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.430 
time and money or something but other
than<00:04:03.220> that<00:04:03.280> one<00:04:03.700> little<00:04:03.940> flaw<00:04:04.269> this<00:04:05.200> is<00:04:05.410> a

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
than that one little flaw this is a

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.220 
than that one little flaw this is a
really<00:04:05.860> good<00:04:06.010> system<00:04:06.220> it's<00:04:06.610> really<00:04:06.670> fast<00:04:07.230> and

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
really good system it's really fast and

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.860 
really good system it's really fast and
reliable<00:04:08.980> ID<00:04:09.549> I<00:04:09.880> guess<00:04:10.090> because<00:04:10.329> this<00:04:10.540> thing

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
reliable ID I guess because this thing

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.890 
reliable ID I guess because this thing
is<00:04:10.989> like<00:04:11.230> six<00:04:11.470> or<00:04:11.590> seven<00:04:11.620> years<00:04:11.980> old<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:12.340> it's

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
is like six or seven years old and it's

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.100 
is like six or seven years old and it's
fine<00:04:13.900> there's<00:04:14.200> nothing<00:04:14.500> wrong<00:04:14.620> with<00:04:14.680> it

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
fine there's nothing wrong with it

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.220 
fine there's nothing wrong with it
it<00:04:15.170> looks<00:04:15.560> really<00:04:15.980> good<00:04:16.190> it's<00:04:17.000> not<00:04:17.510> too<00:04:17.780> huge

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
it looks really good it's not too huge

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.210 
it looks really good it's not too huge
it's<00:04:18.680> heavy<00:04:18.950> though<00:04:19.239> but<00:04:20.239> yeah<00:04:20.920> that's<00:04:21.920> the

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
it's heavy though but yeah that's the

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.260 
it's heavy though but yeah that's the
