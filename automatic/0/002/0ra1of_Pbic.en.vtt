00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.840
 body so that's the first step will be 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.969
 to open in photoshop 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.099
 then we will click on file we will 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.960
 go into script and we'll go into 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.880
 loading files into a pizza 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.039
 bertras of m all the pictures in a 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.570
 single file we click on browse and 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.789
 there we go to get our photos month 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.590

 photos will load his request more 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.420
 or less time according to the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.550
 power of your your computer and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.200
 so we have all our photos and for them 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.820
 see just hide them one by one 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.070
 vigil closed there all the photos that 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.410
 were taken in burst thanks to the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.140
 mode forgiveness post doc waiting what are we going 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.640
 do it first with color here 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.829
 you have to select a black color 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.870
 is a white color imperatively 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.690
 then you will select a 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.149
 photo here you have to go to create one 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.010
 layer of fusions right there it creates a 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.620
 double-click layer on this layer 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.320
 that we click on inverted and we go 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.520
 by the way 70% say to themselves what allows to 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.110
 let appear the character of 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.909
 behind now what are we going to do 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.030
 is we going to go in brush just 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.090
 here death by sow you have to check 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.179
 that you are of course 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.810
 brush rather hard and that the hardness is to 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:16.909
 100% 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.130
 the opacity must be 100% 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.259
 is there and you just have to iron on 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.750
 our little character here my friend 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:29.000
 like that and we have it once we're done 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.890
 to go back on this one double click 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.030
 again on the fusion mask and one 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.990
 delivers 100% 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.000
 and there you see we had two 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.799
 characters in a row on the same picture 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.509
 we do the same thing for the photo 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.490
 next we create a merge layer 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:45.079
 double click on what she concludes on 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:49.030
 a verse is put back to 70% pretty much and 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.030
 we go back to this one 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.090
 then after according to the number of photos 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.110
 you have more or less precise parry 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.759
 of course if you have a lot 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.020
 characters and as a result he'll have to 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.819
 zoom in and be very careful 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.189
 another trick if ever for example without 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.659
 to do it on purpose I erase the feet of those 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.069
 of the character I am sent that leila 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.849
 no more foot it does not matter we can 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.890
 go back 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.260
 here just click on it for 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.549
 take the color black and go back to 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.799
 again on the feet you see that the 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.900
 folds feet reappear we go out 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.519
 well on the white color 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.120
 we start again in some fusion 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.160
 at 100% 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.660
 there we have three characters on the same 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.250
 photo we passed on the photo 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.850
 below we click on mask of 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.820
 fusion whose peak of su reverse 70% 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.850
 here and we go back on this little 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:41.460
 character 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:44.220
 that's not pretty like that 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.830
 like that now you just have to 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.750
 give this calculation back to 100% and you 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.400
 see we have all the characters in the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.810
 good continuation in fact I miss a 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.670
 character here compared to the picture I 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.550
 showed you because I missed 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.590
 photo is good it's the same 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.640
 it will be enough to m the last character 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.110
 yes that you do that could 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.180
 a lot of characters it will take 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.770
 just be more or less accurate according to the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.870
 number of people that there are in this 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.120
 picture otherwise for example because me the 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.560
 balloon after will appear here when 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.540
 the character here throws the balloon the 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.549
 balloon falls off and so it's going to have to 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.780
 I limit well my character is going 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.370
 do it roughly as I did 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.840
 so here is the game doom and game of 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.640
 limits exactly so that we 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.080
 can see the ball behind here 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.260
 so that's all then just do 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.730
 a rendering for that alerting you files 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.870
 to register souks and so choose the 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.909
 destination me I'll leave this 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.959
 folder there and we can render in the format 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.430
 where we want 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.870
 will we want to forgive me I like 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.810
 the png format so I leave to 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.500
 save ok you see that that 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.500
 record and we will find our 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.090
 picture right after I'm waiting for this 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.739
 fiction 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.510
 and here it is our picture you see that 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.799
 it does not hurt so 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.209
 can do a little editing 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.859
 improving a little bit the color and the 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.420
 contrast for that I invite you to 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.219

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.640
