00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.820 

here's<00:00:13.030> my<00:00:13.209> bike<00:00:13.629> bridge<00:00:13.900> made<00:00:14.589> out<00:00:14.710> of

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
here's my bike bridge made out of

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.109 
here's my bike bridge made out of
pallets<00:00:15.450> so<00:00:17.189> I'll<00:00:18.189> show<00:00:18.369> you<00:00:18.490> things<00:00:18.939> how<00:00:19.090> I

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
pallets so I'll show you things how I

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.009 
pallets so I'll show you things how I
put<00:00:19.750> it<00:00:19.779> together<00:00:20.189> how<00:00:21.189> simple<00:00:21.640> it<00:00:21.700> was<00:00:22.019> cheap

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:23.019 
put it together how simple it was cheap

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.120 
put it together how simple it was cheap
it<00:00:23.199> was<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:25.560> why<00:00:26.560> you<00:00:26.619> should<00:00:26.800> make<00:00:26.920> some

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
it was and why you should make some

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.240 
it was and why you should make some
connections<00:00:27.869> at<00:00:28.869> some<00:00:29.199> place<00:00:29.380> as<00:00:29.560> a<00:00:29.590> warehouse

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
connections at some place as a warehouse

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.060 
connections at some place as a warehouse
so<00:00:30.609> first<00:00:30.849> up<00:00:31.060> you<00:00:31.210> can<00:00:31.359> tell<00:00:31.570> it's<00:00:31.929> far<00:00:32.890> from

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
so first up you can tell it's far from

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.890 
so first up you can tell it's far from
perfect<00:00:33.160> and<00:00:33.879> that's<00:00:34.120> not<00:00:34.330> really<00:00:34.540> what<00:00:34.750> I<00:00:34.780> was

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
perfect and that's not really what I was

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.060 
perfect and that's not really what I was
going<00:00:36.750> yeah<00:00:37.750> I<00:00:37.989> mean<00:00:38.170> it<00:00:38.320> definitely<00:00:38.650> wouldn't

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
going yeah I mean it definitely wouldn't

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.670 
going yeah I mean it definitely wouldn't
if<00:00:39.309> I<00:00:39.430> just<00:00:39.699> this<00:00:39.940> to<00:00:40.120> see<00:00:40.299> it<00:00:40.449> and<00:00:40.690> look<00:00:41.530> at

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
if I just this to see it and look at

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.780 
if I just this to see it and look at
that<00:00:41.860> you<00:00:42.100> know<00:00:42.190> it<00:00:42.280> looks<00:00:42.430> like<00:00:42.580> it<00:00:42.640> was<00:00:42.760> just

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
that you know it looks like it was just

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.219 
that you know it looks like it was just
thrown<00:00:43.030> together<00:00:43.180> really<00:00:43.600> quickly<00:00:43.930> which<00:00:44.080> it

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:44.229 
thrown together really quickly which it

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:47.640 
thrown together really quickly which it
was<00:00:44.409> and<00:00:44.940> with<00:00:45.960> minimal<00:00:46.960> effort<00:00:47.080> which<00:00:47.500> it

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
was and with minimal effort which it

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.340 
was and with minimal effort which it
definitely<00:00:47.769> was<00:00:48.190> because<00:00:48.670> I'm<00:00:48.790> lazy<00:00:49.080> but<00:00:50.080> I

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
definitely was because I'm lazy but I

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.049 
definitely was because I'm lazy but I
didn't<00:00:51.280> really<00:00:51.460> want<00:00:51.610> to<00:00:51.640> make<00:00:51.790> something

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
didn't really want to make something

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.829 
didn't really want to make something
that<00:00:52.330> was<00:00:53.100> permanent<00:00:54.100> and<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:55.360> want<00:00:55.600> to<00:00:55.659> be<00:00:55.750> able

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
that was permanent and I want to be able

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:57.840 
that was permanent and I want to be able
to<00:00:55.960> just<00:00:56.229> pull<00:00:56.440> this<00:00:56.559> out<00:00:56.739> if<00:00:57.129> I<00:00:57.280> wanted<00:00:57.549> to<00:00:57.699> if

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
to just pull this out if I wanted to if

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.990 
to just pull this out if I wanted to if
it<00:00:57.970> was<00:00:58.059> messing<00:00:58.269> up<00:01:00.960> stream<00:01:01.960> here<00:01:03.000> which

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
it was messing up stream here which

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.880 
it was messing up stream here which
fills<00:01:04.449> up<00:01:04.629> quite<00:01:04.900> a<00:01:04.930> bit<00:01:05.199> right<00:01:05.470> now<00:01:05.500> it's

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
fills up quite a bit right now it's

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.149 
fills up quite a bit right now it's
completely<00:01:06.610> dry<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:07.900> this<00:01:08.409> fills<00:01:08.680> up<00:01:08.860> here

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
completely dry but this fills up here

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.620 
completely dry but this fills up here
and<00:01:09.250> I<00:01:09.310> don't<00:01:09.369> want<00:01:09.580> to<00:01:09.610> like<00:01:09.790> damn<00:01:10.000> this<00:01:10.240> up<00:01:10.450> if

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
and I don't want to like damn this up if

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.090 
and I don't want to like damn this up if
that's<00:01:10.750> what<00:01:10.990> that's<00:01:11.320> what's<00:01:11.530> gonna<00:01:11.649> happen

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
that's what that's what's gonna happen

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.810 
that's what that's what's gonna happen
and<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:14.619> fills<00:01:14.859> up<00:01:15.009> quite<00:01:15.219> a<00:01:15.250> bit<00:01:15.429> down<00:01:15.579> there

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
and that fills up quite a bit down there

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.389 
and that fills up quite a bit down there
and<00:01:16.090> almost<00:01:16.479> like<00:01:16.689> a<00:01:16.719> marshy<00:01:17.140> pond<00:01:17.409> you<00:01:18.310> know

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
and almost like a marshy pond you know

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.529 
and almost like a marshy pond you know
maybe<00:01:18.549> like<00:01:18.670> three<00:01:19.030> feet<00:01:19.210> deep<00:01:19.420> so<00:01:21.539> that's

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
maybe like three feet deep so that's

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.289 
maybe like three feet deep so that's
mainly<00:01:22.749> the<00:01:22.990> reason<00:01:23.109> I<00:01:23.350> haven't<00:01:24.210> put<00:01:25.210> it

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
mainly the reason I haven't put it

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.410 
mainly the reason I haven't put it
together<00:01:25.390> completely<00:01:26.850> but<00:01:27.850> right<00:01:28.119> now<00:01:28.270> it

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
together completely but right now it

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.700 
together completely but right now it
functions<00:01:28.840> well<00:01:29.140> enough<00:01:29.409> to<00:01:29.560> where<00:01:29.679> I

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
functions well enough to where I

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.050 
functions well enough to where I
probably<00:01:29.979> won't<00:01:30.219> even<00:01:30.520> bother<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.820> right<00:01:33.939> now

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
probably won't even bother so right now

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.399 
probably won't even bother so right now
I'm<00:01:34.149> just<00:01:34.299> gonna<00:01:34.390> walk<00:01:34.630> across<00:01:34.780> it<00:01:34.960> just<00:01:35.319> to

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
I'm just gonna walk across it just to

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:54.060 
I'm just gonna walk across it just to
show<00:01:35.590> you<00:01:35.649> how<00:01:35.890> stable<00:01:36.189> is

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.320 

see<00:01:55.070> right<00:01:55.189> there<00:01:55.340> I<00:01:55.369> just<00:01:55.430> tried<00:01:55.820> to<00:01:55.850> step<00:01:56.150> on

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
see right there I just tried to step on

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.770 
see right there I just tried to step on
every<00:01:56.710> piece<00:01:57.710> of<00:01:57.770> pallet<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.630> clearly<00:01:59.630> it's

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
every piece of pallet and clearly it's

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.160 
every piece of pallet and clearly it's
not<00:02:00.320> budging<00:02:01.540> really<00:02:02.540> all<00:02:02.659> I<00:02:02.690> did<00:02:02.899> was<00:02:03.020> just

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
not budging really all I did was just

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.210 
not budging really all I did was just
throw<00:02:03.350> a<00:02:03.409> bunch<00:02:03.560> of<00:02:03.680> rocks<00:02:03.830> underneath

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
throw a bunch of rocks underneath

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.229 
throw a bunch of rocks underneath
everything<00:02:04.460> just<00:02:04.820> take<00:02:05.360> a<00:02:05.390> bunch<00:02:05.600> of<00:02:05.720> the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:07.239 
everything just take a bunch of the

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:09.729 
everything just take a bunch of the
fairly<00:02:08.239> flat<00:02:08.509> rocks<00:02:08.840> around<00:02:09.170> here<00:02:09.319> and<00:02:09.679> just

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
fairly flat rocks around here and just

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.309 
fairly flat rocks around here and just
kind<00:02:10.009> of<00:02:10.069> shim<00:02:10.489> them<00:02:10.640> all<00:02:10.729> together<00:02:11.230> make<00:02:12.230> it

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
kind of shim them all together make it

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.770 
kind of shim them all together make it
all<00:02:12.580> uniform<00:02:13.580> as<00:02:13.700> much<00:02:13.850> as<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.000> possibly<00:02:14.090> could

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
all uniform as much as I possibly could

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.020 
all uniform as much as I possibly could
what's<00:02:15.590> cool<00:02:15.770> is<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:16.010> surrounding<00:02:16.250> area<00:02:16.700> just

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
what's cool is the surrounding area just

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.280 
what's cool is the surrounding area just
a<00:02:17.090> lot<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:17.620> really<00:02:18.620> thin<00:02:19.569> flat<00:02:20.569> rocks<00:02:20.900> just

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
a lot of really thin flat rocks just

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.050 
a lot of really thin flat rocks just
laying<00:02:21.500> around<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:23.410> too<00:02:24.410> much<00:02:24.590> but<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:26.030> know

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
laying around and too much but you know

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.520 
laying around and too much but you know
I<00:02:26.150> pulled<00:02:26.420> up<00:02:26.510> what<00:02:26.660> I<00:02:26.690> had<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.260> get<00:02:27.380> the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
I pulled up what I had to to get the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.100 
I pulled up what I had to to get the
bridge<00:02:28.069> as<00:02:28.190> stable<00:02:28.400> as<00:02:28.580> possible<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.780> like<00:02:30.019> I

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
bridge as stable as possible and like I

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.840 
bridge as stable as possible and like I
said<00:02:30.200> if<00:02:30.440> it<00:02:30.560> doesn't<00:02:30.590> if<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.160> starts<00:02:31.489> messing

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
said if it doesn't if it starts messing

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.680 
said if it doesn't if it starts messing
with<00:02:32.090> like<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:35.510> starts<00:02:35.750> method<00:02:36.140> messing<00:02:36.500> with

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
with like it starts method messing with

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.940 
with like it starts method messing with
you<00:02:38.690> know<00:02:38.780> how<00:02:38.930> much<00:02:39.080> this<00:02:39.290> fills<00:02:39.530> up<00:02:39.709> and<00:02:39.860> if

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
you know how much this fills up and if

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.970 
you know how much this fills up and if
it<00:02:40.069> creates<00:02:40.250> a<00:02:40.459> dam<00:02:40.780> then<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:42.350> know<00:02:42.440> I'll<00:02:42.799> pull

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
it creates a dam then you know I'll pull

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.009 
it creates a dam then you know I'll pull
it<00:02:43.069> all<00:02:43.190> apart<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.610> I<00:02:43.940> don't<00:02:44.420> just<00:02:44.600> have<00:02:44.959> to

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
it all apart and I don't just have to

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.650 
it all apart and I don't just have to
deal<00:02:45.230> with<00:02:45.380> it<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.590> get<00:02:45.739> better<00:02:45.860> at<00:02:46.040> biking

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
deal with it and get better at biking

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.199 
deal with it and get better at biking
right<00:02:47.660> now<00:02:49.000> it's<00:02:50.000> just<00:02:50.239> made<00:02:50.420> for<00:02:51.820> like<00:02:52.820> I

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
right now it's just made for like I

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.810 
right now it's just made for like I
would<00:02:53.540> say<00:02:53.690> intermediate<00:02:54.200> bikers<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:55.760> know

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
would say intermediate bikers you know

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.250 
would say intermediate bikers you know
people<00:02:56.209> that<00:02:56.299> aren't<00:02:56.420> afraid<00:02:56.600> to<00:02:56.780> go<00:02:56.959> across

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
people that aren't afraid to go across

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.530 
people that aren't afraid to go across
something<00:02:57.530> that<00:02:57.980> wide<00:02:58.430> which<00:02:58.670> is<00:02:58.700> it's<00:02:59.150> fairly

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
something that wide which is it's fairly

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.390 
something that wide which is it's fairly
wide<00:02:59.810> it's<00:03:00.049> not<00:03:00.170> like<00:03:00.290> you're<00:03:00.470> riding<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.190> cross

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
wide it's not like you're riding a cross

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.360 
wide it's not like you're riding a cross
across<00:03:01.910> a<00:03:03.700> easing<00:03:04.700> but<00:03:05.920> as<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:07.010> can<00:03:07.070> see<00:03:07.130> this

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
across a easing but as you can see this

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.170 
across a easing but as you can see this
is<00:03:07.519> literally<00:03:07.790> just<00:03:07.940> half<00:03:08.630> of<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:09.170> pallet<00:03:09.560> so

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
is literally just half of a pallet so

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.110 
is literally just half of a pallet so
this<00:03:11.180> is<00:03:12.130> let's<00:03:13.130> just<00:03:13.220> say<00:03:13.459> yeah<00:03:13.670> this<00:03:13.880> is<00:03:14.030> the

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
this is let's just say yeah this is the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.670 
this is let's just say yeah this is the
middle<00:03:15.100> support<00:03:16.100> I<00:03:16.190> guess<00:03:16.340> you<00:03:16.459> could<00:03:16.609> say

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
middle support I guess you could say

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.280 
middle support I guess you could say
middle<00:03:18.680> column<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.480> this<00:03:20.480> is<00:03:20.600> a<00:03:20.630> side<00:03:20.900> column

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
middle column and this is a side column

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.849 
middle column and this is a side column
so<00:03:21.470> what<00:03:21.620> I<00:03:21.650> did<00:03:21.739> was<00:03:21.950> just<00:03:21.980> take<00:03:22.310> a<00:03:23.620> Sol's<00:03:24.620> off

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
so what I did was just take a Sol's off

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.030 
so what I did was just take a Sol's off
just<00:03:25.579> sawed<00:03:25.790> off<00:03:25.820> close<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:27.079> edge<00:03:27.230> and

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
just sawed off close to the edge and

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.380 
just sawed off close to the edge and
then<00:03:28.250> I<00:03:28.280> had<00:03:28.519> another<00:03:28.730> section

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
then I had another section

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:39.360 
then I had another section
I<00:03:35.049> took<00:03:36.549> all<00:03:37.549> the<00:03:37.790> ends<00:03:38.060> that<00:03:38.150> I<00:03:38.269> didn't<00:03:38.570> use

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
I took all the ends that I didn't use

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.620 
I took all the ends that I didn't use
stack<00:03:40.370> them<00:03:40.609> on<00:03:40.730> top<00:03:40.790> of<00:03:41.000> each<00:03:41.150> other

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
stack them on top of each other

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.830 
stack them on top of each other
narrow<00:03:41.870> them<00:03:42.019> together<00:03:42.140> and<00:03:42.739> then<00:03:43.840> luckily

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
narrow them together and then luckily

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.599 
narrow them together and then luckily
they<00:03:45.019> were<00:03:45.079> just<00:03:45.769> about<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.100> same<00:03:46.310> height<00:03:46.579> as

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
they were just about the same height as

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.220 
they were just about the same height as
if<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:47.090> was<00:03:47.209> just<00:03:47.359> to<00:03:47.420> have<00:03:47.600> one<00:03:48.079> of<00:03:48.170> these

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
if I was just to have one of these

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.140 
if I was just to have one of these
struts<00:03:48.590> so<00:03:49.519> you<00:03:49.609> can<00:03:49.730> tell<00:03:49.880> it's<00:03:50.060> a<00:03:50.090> little

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
struts so you can tell it's a little

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.490 
struts so you can tell it's a little
wider<00:03:50.450> there

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
wider there

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.350 
wider there
and<00:03:53.040> I<00:03:53.100> want<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.370> get<00:03:53.460> there<00:03:53.580> pretty<00:03:53.790> simply

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
and I want to get there pretty simply

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.760 
and I want to get there pretty simply
and<00:03:54.570> one<00:03:54.780> thing<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:54.960> like<00:03:55.110> to<00:03:55.230> mention<00:03:55.410> is<00:03:55.620> if

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
and one thing I like to mention is if

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.580 
and one thing I like to mention is if
you<00:03:55.860> get<00:03:56.040> how<00:03:56.250> it's<00:03:56.960> make<00:03:57.960> sure<00:03:58.200> they're<00:03:58.470> not

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
you get how it's make sure they're not

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.760 
you get how it's make sure they're not
treated<00:03:59.010> with<00:03:59.130> insecticides<00:03:59.820> because<00:04:00.770> these

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
treated with insecticides because these

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.470 
treated with insecticides because these
pallets<00:04:02.130> are<00:04:02.220> usually<00:04:02.580> sort<00:04:03.060> of<00:04:03.150> warehouses

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
pallets are usually sort of warehouses

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.940 
pallets are usually sort of warehouses
where<00:04:03.810> there's<00:04:04.020> a<00:04:04.050> lot<00:04:04.170> of<00:04:04.290> insects<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.860> will

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
where there's a lot of insects that will

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.700 
where there's a lot of insects that will
try<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.780> eat<00:04:06.780> away<00:04:06.870> at<00:04:06.990> the<00:04:07.140> pallets<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.620> then

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
try to eat away at the pallets and then

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.620 
try to eat away at the pallets and then
they<00:04:08.310> usually<00:04:08.490> want<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.880> pallets<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.270> last<00:04:09.450> as

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
they usually want the pallets to last as

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.290 
they usually want the pallets to last as
long<00:04:09.750> as<00:04:09.840> possible<00:04:10.050> so<00:04:10.850> one<00:04:11.850> thing<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.030> notice

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
long as possible so one thing to notice

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.210 
long as possible so one thing to notice
is<00:04:12.600> that<00:04:12.630> some<00:04:13.110> are<00:04:13.230> heat<00:04:13.410> treated<00:04:13.830> instead

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
is that some are heat treated instead

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.720 
is that some are heat treated instead
which<00:04:15.060> are<00:04:15.360> the<00:04:15.690> ones<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:16.019> go<00:04:16.170> for<00:04:16.640> so<00:04:17.640> I'll

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
which are the ones to go for so I'll

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.820 
which are the ones to go for so I'll
show<00:04:17.940> you<00:04:17.989> marking<00:04:18.989> it<00:04:19.260> says<00:04:21.710> straight<00:04:22.710> day

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
show you marking it says straight day

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.890 
show you marking it says straight day
the<00:04:23.010> HT<00:04:23.430> means<00:04:23.700> it's<00:04:23.880> heat<00:04:24.060> rated<00:04:24.450> at<00:04:24.630> least<00:04:24.810> I

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
the HT means it's heat rated at least I

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.490 
the HT means it's heat rated at least I
think<00:04:24.960> it<00:04:25.410> is<00:04:25.530> but<00:04:25.800> you<00:04:26.610> get<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.880> idea<00:04:27.350> not<00:04:28.350> all

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
think it is but you get the idea not all

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.260 
think it is but you get the idea not all
pallets<00:04:28.950> have<00:04:29.100> these<00:04:29.310> really<00:04:29.670> thick<00:04:29.910> cross

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
pallets have these really thick cross

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.660 
pallets have these really thick cross
members<00:04:31.070> so<00:04:32.720> such<00:04:33.720> as<00:04:33.900> that<00:04:34.250> so<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.520> lot<00:04:35.610> of

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
members so such as that so a lot of

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.970 
members so such as that so a lot of
these<00:04:35.910> are<00:04:36.450> made<00:04:36.840> for<00:04:37.110> heavier<00:04:37.440> weight<00:04:37.650> or

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
these are made for heavier weight or

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.040 
these are made for heavier weight or
something<00:04:38.310> that<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:39.510> know<00:04:39.600> they<00:04:39.750> didn't<00:04:40.020> want

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
something that you know they didn't want

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.950 
something that you know they didn't want
to<00:04:40.170> keep<00:04:40.350> using<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.710> power<00:04:40.890> off<00:04:44.660> just<00:04:45.660> be<00:04:45.780> sure

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
to keep using the power off just be sure

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.150 
to keep using the power off just be sure
to<00:04:45.990> get<00:04:46.170> something<00:04:46.530> that's<00:04:46.710> that's

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
to get something that's that's

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.470 
to get something that's that's
reasonable<00:04:47.640> because<00:04:47.760> some<00:04:48.000> of<00:04:48.090> these<00:04:48.150> can<00:04:48.390> be

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
reasonable because some of these can be

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
reasonable because some of these can be
really<00:04:48.750> thin<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:50.840> you<00:04:51.840> can<00:04:51.960> even<00:04:52.080> break<00:04:52.320> them

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
really thin and you can even break them

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.720 
really thin and you can even break them
by<00:04:52.590> just<00:04:52.770> stepping<00:04:52.980> out<00:04:53.190> cool<00:04:53.400> thing<00:04:53.640> about

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
by just stepping out cool thing about

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.550 
by just stepping out cool thing about
this<00:04:54.030> isn't<00:04:54.300> it's<00:04:54.450> basically<00:04:54.780> free<00:04:55.200> and<00:04:55.410> the

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
this isn't it's basically free and the

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.320 
this isn't it's basically free and the
only<00:04:55.680> thing<00:04:55.890> I<00:04:55.950> really<00:04:56.070> spent<00:04:56.400> money<00:04:56.580> on<00:04:56.669> yeah

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
only thing I really spent money on yeah

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.170 
only thing I really spent money on yeah
well<00:04:57.960> I<00:04:58.140> wants<00:04:58.560> to<00:04:58.680> spend<00:04:58.890> money<00:04:59.040> on<00:04:59.190> would<00:05:00.090> be

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
well I wants to spend money on would be

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.210 
well I wants to spend money on would be
the<00:05:00.300> nails

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
the nails

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.590 
the nails
assuming<00:05:02.220> you<00:05:02.280> have<00:05:02.340> fun<00:05:02.910> you<00:05:03.030> know<00:05:03.150> a<00:05:03.180> solder

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
assuming you have fun you know a solder

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.090 
assuming you have fun you know a solder
or<00:05:03.720> something<00:05:04.050> that<00:05:04.169> can<00:05:04.320> cut<00:05:04.500> pretty<00:05:04.890> quickly

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
or something that can cut pretty quickly

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.909 
or something that can cut pretty quickly
another<00:05:06.060> thing<00:05:06.210> is<00:05:06.360> to<00:05:06.900> make<00:05:07.350> one<00:05:07.740> of<00:05:07.860> these

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
another thing is to make one of these

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.140 
another thing is to make one of these
sections<00:05:08.360> only<00:05:09.360> talked<00:05:09.600> about<00:05:09.630> like<00:05:10.200> maybe

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
sections only talked about like maybe

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.590 
sections only talked about like maybe
ten<00:05:12.150> minutes<00:05:12.270> at<00:05:12.600> most<00:05:12.750> if<00:05:13.050> you've<00:05:13.200> had<00:05:13.380> to

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
ten minutes at most if you've had to

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.890 
ten minutes at most if you've had to
take<00:05:16.250> other<00:05:17.250> other<00:05:17.760> supports<00:05:18.390> and<00:05:18.570> you<00:05:18.810> know

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
take other other supports and you know

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.050 
take other other supports and you know
lames<00:05:19.169> william<00:05:19.860> flat<00:05:20.130> sideways<00:05:20.610> like<00:05:20.880> that

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
lames william flat sideways like that

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.210 
lames william flat sideways like that
had<00:05:21.210> to<00:05:21.390> for<00:05:21.600> some<00:05:21.780> of<00:05:21.840> them<00:05:21.960> to<00:05:22.140> make<00:05:22.290> complete

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
had to for some of them to make complete

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
had to for some of them to make complete
sections<00:05:24.020> it<00:05:25.020> doesn't<00:05:25.290> that<00:05:25.650> one<00:05:25.830> so<00:05:26.190> you<00:05:27.060> can

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
sections it doesn't that one so you can

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.930 
sections it doesn't that one so you can
make<00:05:27.360> a<00:05:27.390> bunch<00:05:27.660> of<00:05:27.780> these<00:05:27.930> sections<00:05:28.380> and<00:05:28.620> then

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
make a bunch of these sections and then

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.040 
make a bunch of these sections and then
you<00:05:29.940> know<00:05:30.030> you<00:05:30.090> could<00:05:30.330> probably<00:05:30.510> make<00:05:30.750> a<00:05:30.780> bunch

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
you know you could probably make a bunch

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.770 
you know you could probably make a bunch
of<00:05:31.169> cool<00:05:31.500> freeride<00:05:31.980> features<00:05:32.850> that<00:05:33.600> you

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
of cool freeride features that you

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.360 
of cool freeride features that you
wanted<00:05:34.110> to<00:05:34.260> know<00:05:34.890> i<00:05:36.530> might<00:05:37.530> attempt<00:05:37.950> to<00:05:38.130> try<00:05:38.310> to

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
wanted to know i might attempt to try to

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.100 
wanted to know i might attempt to try to
make<00:05:38.580> some<00:05:38.790> free<00:05:39.000> right<00:05:39.180> you<00:05:39.600> know<00:05:39.780> some

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
make some free right you know some

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.350 
make some free right you know some
freeride<00:05:40.410> features<00:05:40.830> that<00:05:41.010> are<00:05:41.160> elevated<00:05:41.669> with

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
freeride features that are elevated with

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.610 
freeride features that are elevated with
this<00:05:42.480> stuff<00:05:42.720> but<00:05:42.870> that's<00:05:43.050> gonna<00:05:43.260> get<00:05:43.410> pretty

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
this stuff but that's gonna get pretty

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.900 
this stuff but that's gonna get pretty
difficult<00:05:43.950> and<00:05:44.310> then<00:05:44.460> it's<00:05:44.490> probably<00:05:44.820> gonna

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
difficult and then it's probably gonna

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.820 
difficult and then it's probably gonna
start<00:05:45.060> costing<00:05:45.510> money<00:05:45.660> because<00:05:46.530> I<00:05:46.650> probably

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
start costing money because I probably

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.830 
start costing money because I probably
can't<00:05:47.160> just<00:05:47.370> use<00:05:47.580> pallets

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
can't just use pallets

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.200 
can't just use pallets
to<00:05:50.470> you<00:05:50.770> know<00:05:50.889> build<00:05:51.130> supports<00:05:51.880> and<00:05:52.060> stuff

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
to you know build supports and stuff

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.620 
to you know build supports and stuff
like<00:05:52.330> that<00:05:52.540> to<00:05:52.690> keep<00:05:52.840> it<00:05:52.900> elevated<00:05:53.139> so<00:05:54.630> that's

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
like that to keep it elevated so that's

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.210 
like that to keep it elevated so that's
one<00:05:55.780> thing<00:05:55.930> to<00:05:56.020> think<00:05:56.199> about<00:05:56.320> and<00:05:56.889> also<00:05:57.040> I

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
one thing to think about and also I

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.250 
one thing to think about and also I
don't<00:05:57.340> know<00:05:57.490> how<00:05:57.639> sturdy<00:05:57.970> it's<00:05:58.150> gonna<00:05:58.270> be<00:05:58.449> you

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
don't know how sturdy it's gonna be you

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.629 
don't know how sturdy it's gonna be you
know<00:05:59.320> once<00:05:59.530> you<00:05:59.620> get<00:05:59.740> it<00:05:59.889> that<00:06:00.070> far<00:06:00.280> in<00:06:00.430> the<00:06:00.520> air

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
know once you get it that far in the air

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.640 
know once you get it that far in the air
and<00:06:00.850> you<00:06:01.360> don't<00:06:01.510> want<00:06:01.630> to<00:06:01.660> have<00:06:02.380> it<00:06:02.530> being

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
and you don't want to have it being

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.290 
and you don't want to have it being
tilted<00:06:02.919> and<00:06:03.190> all<00:06:03.280> that<00:06:03.430> sometimes<00:06:03.880> it's<00:06:04.210> just

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
tilted and all that sometimes it's just

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.360 
tilted and all that sometimes it's just
better<00:06:04.479> to<00:06:04.630> you<00:06:05.440> know<00:06:05.470> throw<00:06:05.770> together<00:06:06.130> your

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
better to you know throw together your

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.770 
better to you know throw together your

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
make sure it's not gonna fall apart you

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.020 
make sure it's not gonna fall apart you
know<00:06:10.840> because<00:06:11.139> that<00:06:11.260> that<00:06:11.590> won't<00:06:11.800> get<00:06:11.919> I<00:06:12.190> mean

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
like that and it's not gonna be safe at

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.390 
like that and it's not gonna be safe at
all<00:06:17.020> especially<00:06:17.800> if<00:06:17.889> it's<00:06:18.040> like<00:06:18.220> you<00:06:18.340> know

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
know it's pretty cool you start making

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:28.830 
know it's pretty cool you start making
freeride<00:06:27.460> features<00:06:27.940> is<00:06:28.090> that<00:06:28.120> not<00:06:28.540> everything

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
freeride features is that not everything

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.290 
freeride features is that not everything
is<00:06:29.290> the<00:06:29.590> same<00:06:29.740> with<00:06:30.190> if<00:06:30.430> you<00:06:30.550> if<00:06:30.820> you<00:06:30.970> try<00:06:31.150> to<00:06:31.210> do

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
is the same with if you if you try to do

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.150 
is the same with if you if you try to do
this<00:06:31.419> with<00:06:31.600> pallets<00:06:34.350> you<00:06:35.350> know<00:06:35.530> that<00:06:35.680> section

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 
this with pallets you know that section

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.060 
this with pallets you know that section
meets<00:06:36.340> that<00:06:37.200> and<00:06:38.200> this<00:06:38.350> one<00:06:38.560> is<00:06:38.650> a<00:06:38.710> lot<00:06:38.860> thinner

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.070 
meets that and this one is a lot thinner

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.770 
meets that and this one is a lot thinner
than<00:06:39.250> that<00:06:39.340> so<00:06:39.760> you're<00:06:40.389> just<00:06:40.479> gonna<00:06:40.600> be

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
than that so you're just gonna be

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.570 
than that so you're just gonna be
careful<00:06:41.020> if<00:06:41.350> you<00:06:41.410> start<00:06:41.710> you<00:06:42.130> know<00:06:42.250> stringing

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
careful if you start you know stringing

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.220 
careful if you start you know stringing
them<00:06:42.639> together<00:06:42.760> and<00:06:44.010> trying<00:06:45.010> to<00:06:45.070> make
