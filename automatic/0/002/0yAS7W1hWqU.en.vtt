00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
is made out of silicone which means it's

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.060 
is made out of silicone which means it's
going<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.670> be<00:00:26.789> very<00:00:27.150> flexible<00:00:27.590> but<00:00:28.590> at<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
that it's made out of it is going to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.030 
that it's made out of it is going to

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
easy to do as you can see me installing

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.090 
easy to do as you can see me installing
it<00:01:06.360> right<00:01:06.540> here<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:06.990> that's<00:01:07.140> all<00:01:07.380> there<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.799> to

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
it right here and that's all there is to

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.030 
it right here and that's all there is to
it<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.430> let's<00:01:08.610> take<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> look<00:01:09.030> at<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.240> up<00:01:09.510> close

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
it so let's take a look at this up close

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.440 
it so let's take a look at this up close
on<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.430> back<00:01:11.610> side<00:01:11.850> you're<00:01:12.060> going<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> find

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
on the back side you're going to find

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.850 
on the back side you're going to find
some<00:01:12.510> poetic<00:01:12.750> branding<00:01:13.380> as<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.650> see<00:01:13.830> right

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
some poetic branding as you see right

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.760 
some poetic branding as you see right
there<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:15.240> back<00:01:15.540> instead<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.560> being

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
there and this back instead of being

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.100 
there and this back instead of being
smooth<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.430> kind<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.670> has<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.119> grid<00:01:18.869> design

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
smooth it kind of has this grid design

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.109 
smooth it kind of has this grid design
which<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:20.130> because<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.729> gives<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.090> a

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
which I like because it gives you a

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.120 
which I like because it gives you a
great<00:01:21.509> level<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.080> grip<00:01:22.409> when<00:01:22.619> you're<00:01:22.740> holding

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
great level of grip when you're holding

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.770 
great level of grip when you're holding
this<00:01:23.280> instead<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.850> being<00:01:24.060> smooth<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.570> back

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
this instead of being smooth on the back

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.280 
this instead of being smooth on the back
and<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.320> also<00:01:25.470> reduces<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.340> amount<00:01:26.460> of

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
and it also reduces the amount of

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.910 
and it also reduces the amount of
fingerprinting<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.470> you're<00:01:28.560> going<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.740> see

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
fingerprinting that you're going to see

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.679 
fingerprinting that you're going to see
on<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.159> back<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.579> case<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:30.450> not<00:01:30.659> a

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
on the back of this case it's not a

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.960 
on the back of this case it's not a
shiny<00:01:31.140> silicone<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:32.009> almost<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> matte

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
shiny silicone it's almost like a matte

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.569 
shiny silicone it's almost like a matte

compressed can air and blow those sorts

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.469 
compressed can air and blow those sorts
of<00:01:43.829> things<00:01:43.890> out<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.060> what<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.270> back

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
of things out but this is what the back

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.420 
of things out but this is what the back
of<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:46.170> case<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.680> going<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.950> look<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.130> you

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
but as you're going to see here in a

these buttons as you can see they are

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.500 
these buttons as you can see they are
very<00:02:34.110> responsive<00:02:34.410> very<00:02:34.770> tactile<00:02:35.520> you<00:02:36.180> can

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
very responsive very tactile you can

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.750 
very responsive very tactile you can
turn<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.050> volume<00:02:37.350> up<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.680> down<00:02:37.740> and<00:02:38.100> there's

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
turn the volume up and down and there's

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.820 
turn the volume up and down and there's
no<00:02:38.940> problem<00:02:39.360> there<00:02:39.390> whatsoever<00:02:40.110> so<00:02:40.650> that's

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
no problem there whatsoever so that's

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.590 
no problem there whatsoever so that's
nice<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.670> would<00:02:41.910> expect<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.450> be<00:02:42.570> that

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
nice and I would expect it to be that

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.199 
nice and I would expect it to be that
way<00:02:42.780> because<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.410> silicon<00:02:43.890> material<00:02:44.280> and

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
way because it is a silicon material and

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.780 
way because it is a silicon material and
usually<00:02:45.780> they<00:02:46.380> aren't<00:02:46.680> too<00:02:46.830> restrictive<00:02:47.520> so

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
usually they aren't too restrictive so

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.930 
usually they aren't too restrictive so
again<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:48.989> is<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.590> great<00:02:50.190> case<00:02:50.520> if<00:02:50.790> you're

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
again this is a great case if you're

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.620 
again this is a great case if you're
looking<00:02:51.330> for<00:02:51.980> drop<00:02:52.980> protection<00:02:53.280> but<00:02:54.060> nothing

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
looking for drop protection but nothing

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.229 
looking for drop protection but nothing
that<00:02:54.660> includes<00:02:55.230> let's<00:02:55.530> say<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.800> front<00:02:56.400> flap<00:02:56.790> to

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
that includes let's say a front flap to

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.720 
that includes let's say a front flap to
your<00:02:57.360> Nexus<00:02:57.870> 10<00:02:58.230> maybe<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.280> want<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.550> put<00:02:59.700> a

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
your Nexus 10 maybe you want to put a

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.910 
your Nexus 10 maybe you want to put a
screen<00:03:00.060> protector<00:03:00.270> on<00:03:00.720> this<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.140> all<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.500> would

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
screen protector on this is all I would

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.470 
screen protector on this is all I would
recommend<00:03:02.280> because<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.970> doesn't<00:03:03.300> have<00:03:03.420> a

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
recommend because it doesn't have a

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.479 
recommend because it doesn't have a
front<00:03:03.810> flap<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.500> but<00:03:05.040> it's<00:03:05.160> going<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.310> keep

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
front flap to it but it's going to keep

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.670 
front flap to it but it's going to keep
your<00:03:05.640> device<00:03:05.940> nice<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.660> lightweight<00:03:06.870> it's

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
going to keep it thin and at the same

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.540 
going to keep it thin and at the same
time<00:03:09.540> very<00:03:10.230> well<00:03:10.530> protected<00:03:10.800> it<00:03:11.280> is<00:03:11.370> the
