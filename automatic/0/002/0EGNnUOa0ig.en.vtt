00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
basically Temple Run except with this

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.120 
basically Temple Run except with this
really<00:00:17.550> cool<00:00:17.789> like<00:00:18.270> brink<00:00:19.050> aesthetic<00:00:19.830> it's

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
really cool like brink aesthetic it's

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.580 
really cool like brink aesthetic it's
the<00:00:20.310> end<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> world<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.359> your<00:00:22.199> objective

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
is to collect duct tape to buy power-ups

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.330 
is to collect duct tape to buy power-ups
that's<00:00:26.189> basically<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.500> just<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:29.310> just

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
that's basically it so you just you just

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.479 
that's basically it so you just you just
running<00:00:29.730> around<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.330> kind<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.489> flight

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
running around in this kind of flight

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.760 
running around in this kind of flight
into<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.300> world<00:00:33.600> environment<00:00:34.350> which<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.649> what

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
into the world environment which is what

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.500 
into the world environment which is what
really<00:00:34.980> attracted<00:00:35.520> me<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.940> game<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.270> begin

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
really attracted me to the game to begin

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.130 
really attracted me to the game to begin
with<00:00:36.719> us<00:00:36.899> pretty<00:00:37.260> vibrant<00:00:38.690> just<00:00:39.690> couple<00:00:39.870> small

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
with us pretty vibrant just couple small

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.319 
with us pretty vibrant just couple small
things<00:00:40.350> are<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.950> ramps<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.489> Temple<00:00:41.790> Run<00:00:41.940> I

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
things are the ramps in Temple Run I

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.510 
things are the ramps in Temple Run I
don't<00:00:42.870> think<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.260> yeah<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.070> get<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.370> got

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
don't think so yeah so you get you got

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.580 
don't think so yeah so you get you got
this<00:00:44.670> rent<00:00:45.000> mechanic<00:00:45.570> which<00:00:45.809> basically<00:00:46.410> just

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
this rent mechanic which basically just

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.040 
this rent mechanic which basically just
makes<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.860> jump<00:00:47.039> really<00:00:47.370> high<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.930> can

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
makes you jump really high and you can

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.080 
makes you jump really high and you can
also<00:00:49.170> take<00:00:49.440> tick<00:00:49.770> damage<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.760> get<00:00:50.910> hit

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
also take tick damage so you can get hit

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.479 
also take tick damage so you can get hit
like<00:00:51.120> PI<00:00:51.930> times<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.620> think<00:00:52.829> before<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.309> game's

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
like PI times I think before the game's

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.119 
like PI times I think before the game's
over<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.149> kind<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.949> won't<00:00:55.949> do

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
over so you can kind of like I won't do

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.830 
over so you can kind of like I won't do
it<00:00:56.280> I'll<00:00:56.489> probably<00:00:56.670> die<00:00:56.969> but<00:00:57.300> if<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.510> get<00:00:57.629> like

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it I'll probably die but if you get like

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.069 
it I'll probably die but if you get like
clipped<00:00:58.230> by<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> car<00:00:58.649> or<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.239> touch<00:01:01.050> a

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
clipped by a car or if you touch a

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.590 
clipped by a car or if you touch a
little<00:01:01.410> bit<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.770> fire<00:01:02.100> you'll<00:01:02.850> your<00:01:03.329> screen

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
little bit of fire you'll your screen

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.740 
little bit of fire you'll your screen
will<00:01:03.719> go<00:01:03.809> red<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.260> Gears<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.589> War<00:01:04.680> style<00:01:05.750> huh

noticing kind of oh there's a duct tape
factory<00:01:30.990> that's<00:01:31.170> cluttering<00:01:32.930> you<00:01:33.930> notice

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
factory that's cluttering you notice

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.840 
factory that's cluttering you notice
it's<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.409> similar<00:01:34.799> set<00:01:35.100> pieces<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.729> way

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850

really<00:01:37.380> neat<00:01:37.560> yeah<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.390> procedural

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
really neat yeah the the procedural

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.999 
really neat yeah the the procedural
stuff<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.079> particularly<00:01:40.770> sharp

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
stuff in this is particularly sharp

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:41.870 
stuff in this is particularly sharp
which<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.280> something<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.670> was<00:01:41.759> really

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
which is something I was really

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.899 
which is something I was really
surprised<00:01:42.270> by<00:01:42.540> that's<00:01:42.930> me<00:01:43.140> coming<00:01:43.979> from<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.310> you

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
surprised by that's me coming from a you

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.460 
surprised by that's me coming from a you
know<00:01:45.030> basically<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.570> no-name<00:01:45.869> developer<00:01:46.380> at

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
know basically a no-name developer at

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.630 
know basically a no-name developer at
least<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.770> haven't<00:01:47.040> heard<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.280> these<00:01:47.430> guys

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640
