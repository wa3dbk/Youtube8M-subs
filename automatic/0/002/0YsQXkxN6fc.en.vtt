00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
shortly thereafter about I was probably

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.020 
shortly thereafter about I was probably
24<00:02:07.090> years<00:02:07.299> old<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:08.429> at<00:02:09.429> a<00:02:09.489> girlfriend<00:02:09.880> who<00:02:09.970> was

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
24 years old and at a girlfriend who was

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.820 
24 years old and at a girlfriend who was
competing<00:02:10.390> as<00:02:10.599> a<00:02:10.630> bodybuilder<00:02:10.959> at<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.650> time

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
competing as a bodybuilder at the time

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.559 
competing as a bodybuilder at the time
so<00:02:11.980> one<00:02:12.130> saw<00:02:12.310> her<00:02:12.459> show<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:12.970> there<00:02:13.450> was

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
so one saw her show and there was

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.180 
so one saw her show and there was
fitness<00:02:13.930> at<00:02:14.049> that<00:02:14.200> show<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:15.010> thought

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
fitness at that show and I thought

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.530 
fitness at that show and I thought
that's<00:02:15.700> something<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.120> could<00:02:16.269> do

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
that's something I could do

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.370 
that's something I could do
so<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.260> decided<00:02:17.920> in<00:02:18.130> 2001<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:19.330> pardon<00:02:19.750> me<00:02:19.810> in<00:02:19.900> 2000

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
so I decided in 2001 I pardon me in 2000

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.910 
so I decided in 2001 I pardon me in 2000
that<00:02:20.440> I<00:02:20.590> would<00:02:20.739> give<00:02:20.890> that<00:02:21.069> a<00:02:21.099> try<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:23.230> my

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
that I would give that a try and I my

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.100 
that I would give that a try and I my
very<00:02:24.099> first<00:02:24.340> show<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.549> placed<00:02:24.910> third<00:02:25.269> which<00:02:25.810> I

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
very first show I placed third which I

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.720 
very first show I placed third which I
was<00:02:26.440> just<00:02:26.620> thrilled<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.220> actually<00:02:27.489> make<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.640> to

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
was just thrilled to actually make it to

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.870 
was just thrilled to actually make it to
the<00:02:27.849> stage<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:29.280> never<00:02:30.280> in<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.489> million<00:02:30.730> years

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
the stage so never in a million years

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.210 
the stage so never in a million years
did<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.120> ever<00:02:31.150> expect<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:31.870> would<00:02:32.220> have

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
did I ever expect that I would have

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.940 
did I ever expect that I would have
progressed<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.760> where<00:02:33.880> I'm<00:02:33.970> at<00:02:34.090> now<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.950> again

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
progressed to where I'm at now I again

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.490 
progressed to where I'm at now I again
thought<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.250> would<00:02:36.459> do<00:02:36.519> one<00:02:36.549> amateur<00:02:37.030> show<00:02:37.209> and

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
thought I would do one amateur show and

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.170 
thought I would do one amateur show and
see<00:02:38.500> how<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:38.709> went<00:02:38.859> and<00:02:39.010> never<00:02:39.280> be<00:02:39.489> it<00:02:39.609> so<00:02:39.940> here

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
see how it went and never be it so here

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.890
