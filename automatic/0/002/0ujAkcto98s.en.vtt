00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:22.130
 to prove that he is the director 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.390
 We are going to 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.600
 put so that they were not detected 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.640
 welcome details i'm francisco and 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.770
 naia I lived in the angels one of the 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.680
 great initiatives that were taken 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.620
 when 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.200
 when this adventure started it was to see 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.390
 I know what was going to be done with the stadium 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.730
 it seems to me that a club with this 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.690
 trajectory with these successes in what 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.480
 sports 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.550
 There is no doubt that we are talking about 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.920
 most successful team in the past 20 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.350
 years in Mexican soccer and one of the 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.230
 most successful in all of history what 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:02.170
 taking into account that was determined to do 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.170
 a thorough remodeling of the stadium 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.240
 solely a section but 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.060
 that is going to be a stadium according to 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.009
 the parameters 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.780
 things that the industrial marked sport 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.850
 in for today in the world and after 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.470
 many studies and to compare us not only 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.270
 at the national level but international 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.340
 examples of other clubs that have 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.590
 remodeled stadiums that have expanded 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.409
 others who have built stadiums later 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.649
 outside of where they have usually played 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.630
 this stadium has been here for many years 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.549
 since since the club plays in 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.549
 first division and before and good 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.340
 we learned that the success stories in their 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.940
 Most are those who have retained 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.209
 same place to keep playing we have 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.979
 the intention to build a stadium a 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:47.720
 parking on a lot 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.119
 exactly together that we're going to connect 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.220
 with two air bridges this 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.380
 parking will house 1,500 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.270
 vehicles are going to be six levels and two 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.069
 down will connect perfectly 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.170
 with the stadium the stadium intends 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.840
 grow your capacity to 30,000 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.429
 spectators let's do four macro 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.770
 to towns in the corners that are 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:09.590
 seeing there that they will hold a chest 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.600
 in uniform towards the entire perimeter of the 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.870
 stadium 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.300
 the four macro props will serve 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.400
 for access to the stadium 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.300
 for food and beverage concessions 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.220
 to have private boxes 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.100
 let's rename this rostrum of 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.170
 opposite that which is usually 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.120
 called boxes but we're really going to 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.490
 make boxes as we all know them 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.010
 closed etc. let's eliminate the 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.170
 columns that hinder the vision of 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.460
 many fans the boxes go to 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.310
 vary in size between 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.860
 from 6 people up to 20 depending on 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.230
 the demand for capacity and what 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.090
 adapts to the project space the 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.240
 second ones pretend to be as comfortable as 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.040
 we are going to select the ones we are going to 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.180
 do the two headers we're going to upload a 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.100
 level in this shadow tribune we are going to 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.590
 uniforming the entire stadium on two levels 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.840
 let's add a lot of technology we have 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.840
 important business partners add 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.150
 technology services in question 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.220
 internet screens 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.680
 and technology depending on the players 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.730
 also the lid benches 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.730
 that is not going to repeat 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.690
 100 years are celebrated in 2017 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.050
 it's a centennial it's never 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.490
 you have to live it with great intensity 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:35.740
 arriving at 17 the intention is 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:39.560
 celebrate with a world class stadium 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:42.680
 with a world class club and with 100 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.650
 years of stories they have to do 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.660
 feel very proud not only to 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.350
 our fans but I think the 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.180
 city â€‹â€‹of toluca 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.100
 and finally asked them for support come 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.250
 to the stadium have this stadium do 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.210
 feel the weight of the club 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.210
 in each part
