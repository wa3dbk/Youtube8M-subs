now

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.769 

first<00:00:30.759> trip<00:00:30.939> is<00:00:31.060> basically<00:00:31.390> switching

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
first trip is basically switching

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.200 
first trip is basically switching
between<00:00:31.929> two<00:00:32.469> chords<00:00:32.980> and<00:00:33.370> these<00:00:33.520> chords<00:00:34.059> are

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
between two chords and these chords are

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:41.580 
between two chords and these chords are
D<00:00:34.719> major<00:00:34.930> and<00:00:36.690> D<00:00:37.690> minor<00:00:37.960> and<00:00:40.019> if<00:00:41.019> you<00:00:41.140> want<00:00:41.410> to

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
you can put some sustains in between

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:44.759 
you can put some sustains in between
them<00:00:43.480> and<00:00:43.629> just<00:00:43.809> sort<00:00:44.110> of<00:00:44.140> fill<00:00:44.320> it<00:00:44.440> out<00:00:44.559> a<00:00:44.589> bit

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
them and just sort of fill it out a bit

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.210 
them and just sort of fill it out a bit
little<00:00:45.370> bit<00:00:45.519> and<00:00:46.470> there's<00:00:47.470> no<00:00:47.620> really<00:00:47.980> easy

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
little bit and there's no really easy

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.180 
little bit and there's no really easy
way<00:00:48.430> to<00:00:48.489> explain<00:00:48.760> this<00:00:49.120> but<00:00:49.470> just<00:00:50.470> sort<00:00:51.100> of

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
way to explain this but just sort of

00:00:51.190 --> 00:01:05.410 
way to explain this but just sort of
follow<00:00:51.430> what<00:00:51.610> it<00:00:51.729> sounds<00:00:52.120> like

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.810 

easy

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.470 

the<00:01:11.720> negative<00:01:12.050> is<00:01:12.170> a<00:01:12.230> little<00:01:12.440> bit<00:01:12.530> harder

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
the negative is a little bit harder

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.240 
the negative is a little bit harder
purely<00:01:14.480> poor<00:01:14.840> rhythmic<00:01:15.320> sense<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:15.920> also<00:01:16.040> a

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
purely poor rhythmic sense and also a

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.190 
purely poor rhythmic sense and also a
little<00:01:16.550> bit<00:01:16.670> in<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.330> sense<00:01:17.540> of<00:01:17.630> fingering<00:01:18.080> and

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
little bit in the sense of fingering and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.970 
little bit in the sense of fingering and
this<00:01:18.320> is<00:01:18.440> the<00:01:18.530> main<00:01:18.800> roof<00:01:19.750> and<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:21.650> thing<00:01:21.830> to

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
this is the main roof and the thing to

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.160 
this is the main roof and the thing to
get<00:01:22.100> down<00:01:22.400> is<00:01:22.730> the<00:01:23.150> source<00:01:23.390> drying<00:01:23.780> pattern

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
get down is the source drying pattern

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.950 
get down is the source drying pattern
you've<00:01:25.160> got<00:01:25.400> sort<00:01:25.730> of<00:01:25.790> in<00:01:26.000> this<00:01:26.390> so<00:01:26.600> you'll<00:01:26.840> get

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
you've got sort of in this so you'll get

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.420 
you've got sort of in this so you'll get
used<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.290> keeping<00:01:27.590> your<00:01:27.710> hand<00:01:27.890> moving<00:01:28.130> it's

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
used to keeping your hand moving it's

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.870 
used to keeping your hand moving it's
almost<00:01:28.760> Punk<00:01:29.540> style<00:01:29.780> way<00:01:29.960> of<00:01:30.080> playing<00:01:30.320> things

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
almost Punk style way of playing things

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:39.610 
almost Punk style way of playing things
so<00:01:31.880> it's<00:01:32.360> this<00:01:32.540> holes<00:01:32.840> of<00:01:33.020> I<00:01:33.140> do<00:01:38.500> keeping<00:01:39.500> your

hand moving the main riff starts on

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.410 
hand moving the main riff starts on
frets<00:01:43.759> 10<00:01:44.440> on<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:46.460> top<00:01:47.030> string<00:01:49.420> yu-gi-oh

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
comfortable just play that three times

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.249 
comfortable just play that three times
you<00:01:58.850> skids<00:01:59.119> on<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.330> next<00:01:59.540> string<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:02.750> it's

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
you skids on the next string and it's

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.590 
you skids on the next string and it's
Fritz<00:02:03.619> seven<00:02:04.160> on<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:05.300> string<00:02:07.360> which<00:02:08.360> goes

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
Fritz seven on the a string which goes

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.949 
Fritz seven on the a string which goes
to<00:02:09.080> fret<00:02:09.739> 8<00:02:09.979> so<00:02:12.340> now<00:02:13.340> if<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.489> notice<00:02:13.910> there's<00:02:14.900> a

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
to fret 8 so now if you notice there's a

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.310 
to fret 8 so now if you notice there's a
slight<00:02:15.350> pause<00:02:15.709> between<00:02:16.190> them<00:02:20.110> that's<00:02:21.110> next

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
slight pause between them that's next

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:28.120 
slight pause between them that's next
bit<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:23.690> once<00:02:24.410> you've<00:02:24.590> done<00:02:24.709> that<00:02:26.950> that's<00:02:27.950> the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
bit so once you've done that that's the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.650 
bit so once you've done that that's the
next<00:02:28.370> bit<00:02:30.430> it's<00:02:31.430> basically<00:02:31.790> on<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.180> string

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
next bit it's basically on the a string

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:41.199 
next bit it's basically on the a string
going<00:02:33.140> from<00:02:33.440> Fred<00:02:34.070> state<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.940> fret<00:02:35.180> 10<00:02:40.209> next

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
going from Fred state to fret 10 next

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.930 
going from Fred state to fret 10 next
bit<00:02:41.480> is<00:02:41.769> the<00:02:42.769> sort<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.040> descent<00:02:45.670> that's<00:02:46.670> very

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
bit is the sort of descent that's very

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.720 
bit is the sort of descent that's very
easy<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.239> do<00:02:47.470> first<00:02:48.470> finger<00:02:48.920> on<00:02:50.350> fret<00:02:51.350> 7<00:02:51.799> of<00:02:51.950> the

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
string which is just cats fret E string

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.599 
string which is just cats fret E string
to<00:03:22.200> eighth<00:03:23.200> fret<00:03:23.709> E<00:03:23.980> string<00:03:26.430> put<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.519> all

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
to eighth fret E string put it all

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:28.830 
to eighth fret E string put it all
together<00:03:27.819> and<00:03:28.239> you've<00:03:28.359> got<00:03:28.510> to<00:03:28.629> get<00:03:28.750> the

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
together and you've got to get the

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.780 
together and you've got to get the
rhythm<00:03:28.989> down<00:03:29.140> you'll<00:03:30.069> eventually<00:03:30.280> end<00:03:30.640> up

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
rhythm down you'll eventually end up

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:39.360 
rhythm down you'll eventually end up
with<00:03:37.019> in<00:03:38.019> between<00:03:38.379> so<00:03:38.560> that's<00:03:38.739> just<00:03:38.920> basically

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
with in between so that's just basically

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.920
