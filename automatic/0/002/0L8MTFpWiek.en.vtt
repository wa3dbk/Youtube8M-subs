00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
I take a first look at the new OS was

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
part of the two series so what you can

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.209 
part of the two series so what you can
see<00:00:10.019> over<00:00:10.320> here<00:00:10.380> this<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.620> actually<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.860> micro

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
see over here this is actually a micro

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.089 
see over here this is actually a micro
ATX<00:00:11.370> motherboard<00:00:12.000> from<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.630> top<00:00:13.019> series<00:00:13.200> but

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
ATX motherboard from the top series but

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.340 
ATX motherboard from the top series but
it<00:00:14.250> has<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.759> doesn't<00:00:15.059> have<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.240> thermo<00:00:16.049> armor

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
it has it doesn't have the thermo armor

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.410 
it has it doesn't have the thermo armor
as<00:00:16.529> what<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.640> see<00:00:17.880> on<00:00:18.350> the<00:00:19.550> sabertooth<00:00:20.550> z87<00:00:20.939> but

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
as what we see on the sabertooth z87 but

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.599 
as what we see on the sabertooth z87 but
it's<00:00:21.840> actually<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.320> separately<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.460> can

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
it's actually so separately so you can

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.609 
it's actually so separately so you can
actually<00:00:23.730> buy<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.180> total<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.869> about<00:00:25.019> yeah

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
actually buy the total of about yeah

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.689 
actually buy the total of about yeah
it's<00:00:25.769> also<00:00:25.949> pretty<00:00:26.779> so<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.810> standard<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.349> all

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
it's also pretty so I standard on all

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.359 
it's also pretty so I standard on all

actually x16 electrically while the rest

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.359 
actually x16 electrically while the rest
of<00:01:23.550> its<00:01:23.729> actually<00:01:24.030> x8<00:01:24.420> x8<00:01:24.860> at<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> bottom<00:01:26.250> you

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
of its actually x8 x8 at the bottom you

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.630 
of its actually x8 x8 at the bottom you
can<00:01:26.400> see<00:01:26.550> a<00:01:26.700> few<00:01:27.060> PCI<00:01:28.020> Express<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.650> mean<00:01:29.100> USB<00:01:29.490> 2.0

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
can see a few PCI Express I mean USB 2.0

can see a few PCI Express I mean USB 2.0
ports<00:01:30.410> expansion<00:01:31.410> ports<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:32.040> have<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.460> bios

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
ports expansion ports and we have a bios

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
flash bios flash back button and

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:42.249 
flash bios flash back button and
directly<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:37.619> get<00:01:37.860> some<00:01:38.820> focus<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.390> yes<00:01:40.310> okay

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
directly you get some focus on yes okay

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.749 
directly you get some focus on yes okay
so<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:43.440> i/o<00:01:43.649> part<00:01:44.039> we<00:01:44.160> can<00:01:44.310> see<00:01:44.580> for<00:01:46.369> for<00:01:47.369> USB

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
so I the i/o part we can see for for USB

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.859 
so I the i/o part we can see for for USB
2.0<00:01:47.940> a<00:01:48.420> DVI<00:01:48.930> port<00:01:49.289> and<00:01:49.470> then<00:01:50.270> SPD<00:01:51.270> has<00:01:51.479> ever<00:01:51.630> HD

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
2.0 a DVI port and then SPD has ever HD

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.230 
2.0 a DVI port and then SPD has ever HD
I<00:01:51.930> mind<00:01:52.170> then<00:01:52.380> another<00:01:52.560> for<00:01:52.920> USB<00:01:53.580> 3.0<00:01:53.940> port

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
I mind then another for USB 3.0 port

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.469 
I mind then another for USB 3.0 port
