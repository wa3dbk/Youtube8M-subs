00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:12.690
 a video is about golf is that two 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:15.630
 units with 2003 in 2013 ten years 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.730
 separate these two cars but I'll see 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.800
 that they have a lot in common 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.480
 Let's go and talk here from abroad. 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.919
 here in 2013 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:38.040
 there is a limit of red dijon tornado 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:41.430
 and this is a 2003 plus the gray tone 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.470
 Original Wheels him whether listened 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.270

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.280
 you can see side of the two cars at 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.030
 identical 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.030
 I do not know in the rear view mirror. 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:01:00.710

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.439
 face to face are totally 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.740
 different. 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.869
 this has a forward so that the front 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.830
 matches the design of the car 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:29.920
 let's now see inside first 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.899

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.170
 which is that the panel is now white background 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.550
