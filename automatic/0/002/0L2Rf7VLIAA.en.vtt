00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.920
 steve's boat and sank leaving him adrift alone I was practically 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.019
 Senator Antonio knew that he was far from any possibility of 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.349
 rescue 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.349
 I had my chances of survival very remote 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.460
 so the action is over 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.460
 although it was time 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.880
 the fish was plentiful 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.540
 I would not starve 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.690
 but he had a big problem 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.830
 the benfica went well into our flesh and fish has no vitamins and minerals that 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.700
 the human body needs 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.760
 on a car only diet and Steve's body would not work properly 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.390
 would go into bankruptcy and die 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.490
 which he does not know that the fish that lives this one contains the nutrients he 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.790
 need 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.030
 but they are in parts that he usually 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.100
 to discard 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.580
 John 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.070
 with your body on the verge of succumbing I've seen your palate undergo a change 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.550
 warn 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.720
 I become less and less interested in the client's house 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.520
 and more interested in parts like the eyes 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.500
 small discs in three decades 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.550
 group team 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.570
 and the words 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.570
 practically everything that comes from pt 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.170
 with the exception of the sector 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.680
 realizing that something is missing in his center's stimulus diet 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.680
 of general lack of intense desires 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.540
 he went back to eating anything that the years go by 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.620
 this instinct for survival forced our ancestors to experiment 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.620
 anything to maintain a balanced diet to the point of suppressing the 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.619
 palate 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:14.119
 chilli pepper to avoid being eaten produced a 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:16.419
 will not tolerate 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:19.439
 those of a chemical that 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:23.809
 the home anyway we eat 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:29.579
 This is because our brains know that survival can depend on 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.729
 of the limits 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:36.879
 eating pepper bombs the brain with signs of pain in response to the brain 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.419
 releases endorphins 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.489
 natural painkillers that provoked a sensation of pleasure 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.469
 Little Pepper Street Activated a Brain Learning Center It Stores 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.980
 memory that despite the sky by accident seams are rich 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.980
 nutrients that the pleasure of leafing 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:58.230
 at 13 elano 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.230
 rescued after 76 days 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:04.989
 sent by your brain besides saving your life 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.989
 he ate in a way that made him very healthy 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.929
 but caused this year to complete 

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:16.499
 I have explained to commemorate that there are people who are stuck in a point with a 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:18.749
 cap competitions 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:21.149
 bush and that he expected that day 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:24.339
 you can win a trip of the show even though you need to 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:29.349
 resist these posts I was curious and eriksson to cut all their 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.469
 memories every week sign up now slb with us and our children 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:35.789
