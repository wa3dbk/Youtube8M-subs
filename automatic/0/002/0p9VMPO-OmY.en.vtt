00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.050 
talked about this before videos and I've
used<00:00:15.890> it<00:00:16.070> and<00:00:16.130> I<00:00:16.189> probably<00:00:16.490> shown<00:00:16.820> you<00:00:16.939> how<00:00:17.029> to

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
used it and I probably shown you how to

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.179 
used it and I probably shown you how to
do<00:00:17.300> it<00:00:17.450> with<00:00:17.900> different<00:00:18.050> projects<00:00:18.590> but<00:00:19.160> I

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
do it with different projects but I

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.250 
do it with different projects but I
wanted<00:00:19.550> to<00:00:19.640> have<00:00:19.790> a<00:00:19.820> video<00:00:20.090> specific<00:00:20.630> to<00:00:20.810> it<00:00:20.990> so

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
wanted to have a video specific to it so

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.200 
wanted to have a video specific to it so
in<00:00:21.380> case<00:00:21.410> somebody<00:00:21.980> is<00:00:22.190> just<00:00:22.460> looking<00:00:23.030> for<00:00:23.150> the

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
in case somebody is just looking for the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.290 
in case somebody is just looking for the
icord<00:00:23.630> method<00:00:24.380> they<00:00:24.980> can<00:00:25.130> find<00:00:25.340> it<00:00:25.520> so<00:00:26.000> I'm

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
icord method they can find it so I'm

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.910 
icord method they can find it so I'm
just<00:00:26.449> using<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:26.779> red<00:00:26.930> loom<00:00:27.170> you<00:00:27.529> can<00:00:27.680> use<00:00:27.770> any

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
just using the red loom you can use any

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.130 
just using the red loom you can use any
size<00:00:28.130> when<00:00:28.369> you<00:00:28.520> want<00:00:28.730> pretty<00:00:29.539> much<00:00:29.660> probably

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
size when you want pretty much probably

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.470 
size when you want pretty much probably
the<00:00:30.410> I<00:00:30.710> don't<00:00:31.580> think<00:00:31.640> it<00:00:31.789> really<00:00:32.000> manageable

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
the I don't think it really manageable

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.119 
the I don't think it really manageable
size<00:00:32.720> use<00:00:33.080> I'm<00:00:33.320> just<00:00:33.500> doing<00:00:33.680> this<00:00:33.770> because<00:00:33.980> of

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
size use I'm just doing this because of

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:34.930 
size use I'm just doing this because of
the<00:00:34.340> video

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
the video

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.330 
the video
it's<00:00:35.120> as<00:00:35.239> if<00:00:35.390> real<00:00:35.540> estate<00:00:35.949> I'm<00:00:36.949> using<00:00:37.160> this

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
it's as if real estate I'm using this

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.520 
it's as if real estate I'm using this
yarn<00:00:37.670> it's<00:00:38.239> very<00:00:38.420> thin<00:00:38.750> you<00:00:39.110> could<00:00:39.290> do<00:00:39.500> a

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
yarn it's very thin you could do a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.410 
yarn it's very thin you could do a
double<00:00:39.710> strand<00:00:40.160> if<00:00:40.309> you<00:00:40.399> wanted<00:00:40.790> you<00:00:41.300> could

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
double strand if you wanted you could

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.510 
double strand if you wanted you could
use<00:00:41.570> a<00:00:41.600> bulkier<00:00:42.079> yarn<00:00:42.230> obviously<00:00:42.950> this<00:00:43.340> is

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
use a bulkier yarn obviously this is

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.000 
use a bulkier yarn obviously this is
just<00:00:43.760> because<00:00:44.120> it<00:00:44.390> will<00:00:44.660> contrast<00:00:45.410> with<00:00:45.680> my

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
just because it will contrast with my

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.100 
just because it will contrast with my
loom<00:00:46.250> pretty<00:00:46.520> well<00:00:46.700> so<00:00:47.420> you<00:00:47.480> do<00:00:47.719> your<00:00:47.870> regular

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
loom pretty well so you do your regular

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.240 
loom pretty well so you do your regular
Slipknot<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:50.200> like<00:00:51.200> this<00:00:51.469> is<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.559> very<00:00:51.829> simple

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
Slipknot and like this is a very simple

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
Slipknot and like this is a very simple
process<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:52.879> you<00:00:53.300> put<00:00:53.719> it<00:00:53.809> on<00:00:55.120> one<00:00:56.120> of<00:00:56.149> the

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
process and you put it on one of the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.639 
process and you put it on one of the
pegs<00:00:56.480> you're<00:00:56.660> only<00:00:56.809> going<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.050> be<00:00:57.110> using<00:00:57.320> three

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
pegs you're only going to be using three

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.560 
pegs you're only going to be using three
pegs<00:00:57.860> so<00:00:58.610> that's<00:00:58.730> what<00:00:58.850> makes<00:00:59.000> it<00:00:59.120> good<00:00:59.270> and<00:00:59.480> a

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
pegs so that's what makes it good and a

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.810 
pegs so that's what makes it good and a
very<00:00:59.750> simple<00:01:00.530> easy<00:01:00.649> project<00:01:01.219> something<00:01:01.579> you

this joint is a little fraying a little
bit<00:01:39.349> so<00:01:39.470> it<00:01:39.560> makes<00:01:39.709> it<00:01:39.860> tough<00:01:40.310> on<00:01:40.399> the<00:01:40.490> stencil

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
bit so it makes it tough on the stencil

you would place your beads in the spot
and<00:03:39.629> then<00:03:39.720> bring<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:40.019> around<00:03:40.079> the<00:03:40.290> front<00:03:40.319> and

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
and then bring it around the front and

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.520 
and then bring it around the front and
then<00:03:41.669> knit<00:03:41.879> over<00:03:41.909> so<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.900> kind<00:03:43.049> of<00:03:43.079> locks<00:03:43.230> them

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
then knit over so it kind of locks them

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.740 
then knit over so it kind of locks them
in<00:03:43.650> place<00:03:43.859> and<00:03:44.159> I've<00:03:44.790> done<00:03:44.970> this<00:03:45.180> before<00:03:45.389> with

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
in place and I've done this before with

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.439 
in place and I've done this before with
Julie<00:03:46.319> um<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.549> makes<00:03:47.699> nice<00:03:47.849> look<00:03:48.060> if<00:03:48.329> you

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
Julie um that makes nice look if you

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:49.729 
Julie um that makes nice look if you
want<00:03:48.599> to<00:03:48.659> like<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:48.840> choker<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.290> have<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:49.650> be

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
want to like a choker and have it be

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.219 
want to like a choker and have it be
yarn<00:03:49.979> you<00:03:50.760> can<00:03:50.909> can<00:03:51.090> do<00:03:51.239> this<00:03:51.389> but<00:03:51.659> you<00:03:51.900> have<00:03:52.109> to

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:52.229 
yarn you can can do this but you have to

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:53.809 
yarn you can can do this but you have to
figure<00:03:52.500> out<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.680> length<00:03:52.919> so<00:03:53.459> these<00:03:53.579> are<00:03:53.760> the

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
figure out the length so these are the

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.719 
figure out the length so these are the
best<00:03:53.970> thing<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.180> do<00:03:54.299> is<00:03:54.419> try<00:03:54.599> to<00:03:55.400> measure<00:03:56.400> out

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:56.729 
best thing to do is try to measure out

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:58.219 
best thing to do is try to measure out
how<00:03:56.849> long<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.120> might<00:03:57.239> want<00:03:57.419> to<00:03:57.449> do<00:03:57.599> let's<00:03:58.079> all

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:58.229 
how long you might want to do let's all

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:59.599 
how long you might want to do let's all
how<00:03:58.379> it's<00:03:58.500> working<00:03:58.650> out<00:03:58.799> pretty<00:03:58.979> quick<00:03:59.280> then

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
how it's working out pretty quick then

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.210 
how it's working out pretty quick then
this<00:03:59.699> is<00:03:59.819> the<00:03:59.909> icord<00:04:00.329> stitch<00:04:00.859> it's<00:04:01.859> kind<00:04:02.129> of

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
this is the icord stitch it's kind of

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.599 
this is the icord stitch it's kind of
flat<00:04:02.519> so<00:04:03.060> when<00:04:03.239> you<00:04:03.359> you<00:04:03.930> know<00:04:04.220> it<00:04:05.220> kinda<00:04:05.489> makes

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
flat so when you you know it kinda makes

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:06.740 
flat so when you you know it kinda makes
it<00:04:05.699> kind<00:04:05.879> of<00:04:05.909> cool<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.180> put<00:04:06.389> a<00:04:06.419> couple<00:04:06.720> more

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
it kind of cool and put a couple more

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.569 
it kind of cool and put a couple more
and<00:04:07.620> I'll<00:04:07.709> show<00:04:07.859> you<00:04:07.889> how<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.129> take<00:04:08.280> this<00:04:08.400> off

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
and I'll show you how to take this off

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.219 
and I'll show you how to take this off
and<00:04:08.819> we'll<00:04:08.879> be<00:04:09.030> all<00:04:09.120> done<00:04:09.150> very<00:04:09.780> simple

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:10.229 
and we'll be all done very simple

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:13.189 
and we'll be all done very simple
process<00:04:11.449> you'll<00:04:12.449> actually<00:04:12.690> almost<00:04:12.989> get

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
process you'll actually almost get

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.319 
process you'll actually almost get
addicted<00:04:13.409> sometimes<00:04:13.919> to<00:04:14.099> doing<00:04:14.280> this<00:04:14.400> like<00:04:15.150> I

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
addicted sometimes to doing this like I

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:16.819 
addicted sometimes to doing this like I
would<00:04:15.510> love<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.840> take<00:04:15.989> my<00:04:16.019> scrap<00:04:16.380> yarn<00:04:16.620> and

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
would love to take my scrap yarn and

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.199 
would love to take my scrap yarn and
then<00:04:17.340> actually<00:04:17.639> thing<00:04:17.789> about<00:04:17.909> making<00:04:18.120> a

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
then actually thing about making a

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.719 
then actually thing about making a
couple<00:04:18.359> of<00:04:18.539> I<00:04:18.599> quote<00:04:18.959> ropes<00:04:19.949> with<00:04:20.310> my<00:04:20.489> scrap

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
couple of I quote ropes with my scrap

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.939 
couple of I quote ropes with my scrap
yarn<00:04:21.000> just<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.239> see<00:04:21.449> how<00:04:21.659> different<00:04:22.650> colors

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
yarn just to see how different colors

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.219 
yarn just to see how different colors
will<00:04:23.099> work<00:04:23.130> together<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.909> then<00:04:24.810> use<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.020> for

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
will work together and then use it for

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.379 
will work together and then use it for
some<00:04:25.349> other<00:04:25.500> project<00:04:25.979> I<00:04:26.159> don't<00:04:26.880> know<00:04:27.090> if<00:04:27.240> this

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
some other project I don't know if this

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.000 
some other project I don't know if this
will<00:04:27.510> work<00:04:27.570> well<00:04:27.870> on<00:04:27.990> a<00:04:28.050> tree<00:04:28.380> unless<00:04:28.590> you<00:04:28.800> used

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
will work well on a tree unless you used

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.090 
will work well on a tree unless you used
again<00:04:29.190> something

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
again something

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.410 
again something
he<00:04:30.250> innocent<00:04:30.820> um<00:04:31.510> he's<00:04:32.320> getting<00:04:33.240> messed<00:04:34.240> up

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
he innocent um he's getting messed up

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.870 
he innocent um he's getting messed up
that<00:04:34.660> one<00:04:35.190> because<00:04:36.190> he<00:04:36.310> could<00:04:36.460> almost<00:04:36.580> do<00:04:36.820> it

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
that one because he could almost do it

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.490 
that one because he could almost do it
out<00:04:36.970> in<00:04:37.000> a<00:04:37.180> little<00:04:37.420> tree<00:04:37.540> for<00:04:37.780> somebody<00:04:38.050> it's

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
out in a little tree for somebody it's

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.170 
out in a little tree for somebody it's
that's<00:04:38.740> how<00:04:38.860> it's<00:04:39.010> weird<00:04:39.160> up<00:04:39.370> like<00:04:39.850> that<00:04:40.030> works

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
that's how it's weird up like that works

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.660 
that's how it's weird up like that works
it<00:04:40.300> pretty<00:04:40.510> fast<00:04:40.920> maybe<00:04:41.920> give<00:04:42.130> an<00:04:42.220> idea<00:04:42.490> you

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
it pretty fast maybe give an idea you

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.160 
it pretty fast maybe give an idea you
know<00:04:42.760> look<00:04:42.940> some<00:04:43.090> pretty<00:04:43.270> fast<00:04:43.570> that's<00:04:43.990> how

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
know look some pretty fast that's how

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.960 
know look some pretty fast that's how
much<00:04:44.290> we<00:04:44.410> gap<00:04:44.590> so<00:04:45.310> when<00:04:45.460> you're<00:04:45.580> ready<00:04:45.700> to<00:04:45.820> take

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
much we gap so when you're ready to take

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.960 
much we gap so when you're ready to take
this<00:04:46.150> off<00:04:46.360> it's<00:04:46.570> fairly<00:04:46.900> simple<00:04:47.760> all<00:04:48.760> you're

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
this off it's fairly simple all you're

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.160 
this off it's fairly simple all you're
going<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.150> do<00:04:49.330> is<00:04:49.570> you're<00:04:49.720> going<00:04:49.750> to<00:04:49.870> end<00:04:50.050> up

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
going to do is you're going to end up

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.560 
going to do is you're going to end up
wanting<00:04:50.500> pad<00:04:50.710> that<00:04:50.890> I'm<00:04:51.010> one<00:04:51.250> pay<00:04:51.460> so<00:04:52.240> we're

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
wanting pad that I'm one pay so we're

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.090 
wanting pad that I'm one pay so we're
going<00:04:52.660> to<00:04:52.750> take<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.110> loop<00:04:53.290> from<00:04:53.530> here<00:04:56.100> we're

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
going to take the loop from here we're

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.460 
going to take the loop from here we're
going<00:04:57.220> to<00:04:57.280> place<00:04:57.490> it<00:04:57.670> on<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:57.850> middle<00:04:58.090> loop<00:04:58.470> my

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
going to place it on the middle loop my

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.430 
going to place it on the middle loop my
middle<00:04:59.710> peg<00:04:59.920> sorry<00:05:00.870> place<00:05:01.870> it<00:05:02.020> on<00:05:02.110> there<00:05:02.290> and

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
middle peg sorry place it on there and

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.940 
middle peg sorry place it on there and
you<00:05:02.530> get<00:05:02.650> it<00:05:02.740> over<00:05:04.530> there<00:05:05.530> you<00:05:05.650> going<00:05:05.740> to<00:05:05.830> take

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
you get it over there you going to take

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.700 
you get it over there you going to take
this<00:05:06.160> loop<00:05:06.840> move<00:05:07.840> it<00:05:07.990> over<00:05:08.200> to<00:05:08.290> the<00:05:08.380> middle<00:05:08.590> peg

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
this loop move it over to the middle peg

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.900 
this loop move it over to the middle peg
then<00:05:11.710> you<00:05:11.770> get<00:05:11.890> an<00:05:11.980> it<00:05:12.100> over<00:05:14.220> much<00:05:15.220> now<00:05:15.700> you're

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
then you get an it over much now you're

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.640 
then you get an it over much now you're
going<00:05:16.030> to<00:05:16.090> take<00:05:16.180> it<00:05:16.300> off<00:05:16.510> completely<00:05:17.110> you

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
going to take it off completely you

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:24.600 
going to take it off completely you
gonna<00:05:17.800> cut<00:05:17.980> yourself<00:05:18.780> beyond<00:05:21.900> that<00:05:22.900> and<00:05:23.610> then

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
done that video of mine you can make one

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.900 
done that video of mine you can make one
really<00:06:02.680> long<00:06:02.920> and<00:06:03.160> what<00:06:03.250> I<00:06:03.280> mean<00:06:03.460> by<00:06:03.520> blowing

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
really long and what I mean by blowing

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.820 
really long and what I mean by blowing
is<00:06:04.180> because<00:06:04.480> it's<00:06:04.720> usually<00:06:05.410> a<00:06:05.590> little<00:06:05.680> more

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
is because it's usually a little more

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.070 
is because it's usually a little more
flare<00:06:06.250> evidence<00:06:06.580> showing<00:06:07.330> up<00:06:07.480> here<00:06:07.630> depends

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
flare evidence showing up here depends

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.570 
flare evidence showing up here depends
on<00:06:08.110> the<00:06:08.200> INA<00:06:08.380> might<00:06:08.620> work<00:06:08.740> up<00:06:08.860> definitely<00:06:09.130> but

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
on the INA might work up definitely but

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.020 
on the INA might work up definitely but
if<00:06:09.670> you<00:06:09.760> wind<00:06:10.090> it<00:06:11.100> it<00:06:12.100> never<00:06:12.280> had<00:06:12.430> to<00:06:12.640> be<00:06:12.790> really

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
if you wind it it never had to be really

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.600 
if you wind it it never had to be really
long<00:06:13.210> but<00:06:13.840> if<00:06:13.990> you<00:06:14.020> wound<00:06:14.380> it<00:06:14.620> around<00:06:15.100> itself

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
long but if you wound it around itself

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.450 
long but if you wound it around itself
so<00:06:15.970> be<00:06:16.900> flat<00:06:17.170> like<00:06:17.200> that<00:06:17.650> and<00:06:17.890> you<00:06:18.010> had<00:06:18.130> a<00:06:18.160> big

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
so be flat like that and you had a big

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.770 
so be flat like that and you had a big
one<00:06:18.790> then<00:06:19.510> what<00:06:19.630> you<00:06:19.780> can<00:06:19.960> do<00:06:20.490> is<00:06:21.490> you<00:06:22.300> can<00:06:22.420> sew

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
one then what you can do is you can sew

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.140 
one then what you can do is you can sew
the<00:06:23.110> loops<00:06:23.320> together<00:06:23.590> enough<00:06:24.130> so<00:06:24.730> this<00:06:25.000> would

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
the loops together enough so this would

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.730 
the loops together enough so this would
be<00:06:25.240> flat<00:06:25.570> and<00:06:25.930> almost<00:06:26.260> feel<00:06:26.380> like<00:06:26.470> a<00:06:26.530> little

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
be flat and almost feel like a little

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.370 
be flat and almost feel like a little
mini<00:06:26.890> poster<00:06:27.820> or<00:06:28.210> something<00:06:28.420> like<00:06:28.480> that<00:06:28.540> so

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
mini poster or something like that so

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.780 
mini poster or something like that so
that's<00:06:29.470> what<00:06:29.650> I<00:06:29.680> remember<00:06:29.980> that<00:06:30.100> but<00:06:30.550> that's<00:06:30.700> a

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
that's what I remember that but that's a

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.450 
that's what I remember that but that's a
quick<00:06:31.030> simple<00:06:31.240> I<00:06:31.570> chord<00:06:31.960> five<00:06:32.140> chord<00:06:32.460> method

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
quick simple I chord five chord method

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.920 
quick simple I chord five chord method
so<00:06:34.000> you<00:06:34.060> can<00:06:34.180> use<00:06:34.300> it<00:06:34.420> for<00:06:34.510> different<00:06:34.570> things

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
so you can use it for different things

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.520 
so you can use it for different things
and<00:06:35.200> I<00:06:35.560> hope<00:06:35.980> you<00:06:36.130> enjoyed<00:06:36.400> it
