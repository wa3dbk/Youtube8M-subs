00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
I had a lot of fun with the stack the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.310 
I had a lot of fun with the stack the
stack<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.120> very<00:02:53.330> inexpensive<00:02:53.900> especially

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
stack is very inexpensive especially

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.020 
stack is very inexpensive especially
since<00:02:54.470> we<00:02:54.590> cut<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:54.950> mutavault<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.820> don't

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
since we cut the mutavault you don't

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.850 
since we cut the mutavault you don't
need<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.269> bile<00:02:56.480> files<00:02:56.959> kind<00:02:57.380> of<00:02:57.440> iffy<00:02:57.680> and

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
need the bile files kind of iffy and

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.160 
need the bile files kind of iffy and
more<00:02:58.340> playtesting<00:02:59.030> but<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.540> mean<00:02:59.720> if<00:02:59.870> you<00:02:59.989> take
