00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.199
 I came to games week to give 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.990
 look around being me a 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.880
 collector and lately unfortunately 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.189
 with less and less time to play me 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.330
 like all consoles in general 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.330
 also the game on pc 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.669
 we have the space halo black ops two that 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.350
 are the titles a little more expected within 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.200
 Christmas that I felt that I am 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.480
 loved them so much they are medalofhonor 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.610
 warfighter that is quite realistic 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.350
 although a bit lacking in graphics but 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.379
 still remains a good dead title 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.050
 space is always as terrifying as al 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.090
 usually do not expect anything more 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.340
 black ops, but that's what I do 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.000
 I look forward to more than I am looking forward to 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.410
 be able to play on xbox flight games week 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.780
 Today I was particularly struck by the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.719
 world wiew why i had come up with the idea 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.400
 to see a little those were the news 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.780
 also from the hardware point of view 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.610
 I really liked how it was 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.540
 just implemented the use of 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.000
 tablet on the console and it seems to me that 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.950
 go to right to complete the offer that 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.920
 it's on the market right now 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.350
 as for the decline consoles is 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.960
 just released it proves to be a masterpiece 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.909
 how we expected and how full it is 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.860
 succeeded again this year turned out to be 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.670
 a good gamesweek especially for 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.590
 what concerns me the xbox part 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.040
 microsoft and women video games of the 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.840
 video game with and I know from the age of 4 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.540
 years my first coast was the super 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.830
 nintendo in evolution until you arrive 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:49.430
 now at the xbox and I have to say that 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.620
 people find it hard to keep up with me to him 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.420
 hit me like last year 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.700
 certainly the organization was one 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.830
 pleasant surprise or rediscovery to see 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.050
 halo 4 that already from the reviews me 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.150
 step more than positive I ask for guilt 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.040
 and it's really fantastic offers 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.440
 feelings that were not cared for by the first 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.960
 halo for what then concerns the 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.000
 part to me more dear kia nintendo wii u 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.580
 it surprised me more than that 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.370
 positive of how I expected because the 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.830
 game pad is a really intuitive thing 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.960
 really innovative in games like 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.420
 pikmin 3 that had been missing since the time of 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.540
 cube I had a feeling of 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.850
 Unusual zombie gameplay depth 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.190
 I think you will be surprised by them 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.050
 fleece of gold fps because it mixes both 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.940
 the mechanics therefore really a game 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.630
 innovative at launch that I do not 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.430
 expected 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.090
 well the games week is a great one 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.090
 opportunity 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.519
 it's a hangout for us players anyway 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.769
 important that must continue in these 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.599
 years always with more collaborations 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.970
 however, this year it was also given 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.280
 more order or more space 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.830
 especially also to televisions that 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.239
 they speak of video games is known 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.760
 a greater coordination above all 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.739
 among all the various xbox user environments 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.930
 they go bread for their teeth you know which ones 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.090
 sony pc users do not talk about it with 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.180
 asus k machine night really 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.280
 incredible absurd for judgment is 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.650
 more than positive, I remembered it as beautiful 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.910
 last year and I remembered it well at 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.090
 next year when i come back 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.090
 certainly
