00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 i 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.260
 two-wheel speed lap with alex 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.030
 with a low motorbike 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.980
 many people using language 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.470
 these day-to-day motorcycles in the city is 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.360
 cool is a motorcycle that both for 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.699
 you use on a daily basis as they prove 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.650
 she bought the bread at the bakery or 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.570
 amuse I think it's a high motorcycle 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.679
 bike and economic displacement right 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.449
 the bike takes the bike that was just the bike 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.470
 sports the visual has a visual 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.790
 big bike 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.430
 I think the fashion impact for who 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.040
 search for sportiness and entertain on the track 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.630
 even with 300 cylinders very much 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.550
 300cc power 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.910
 I think even by motorcyclists already have 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.130
 experience or want to start at the track 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.260
 and that uses a thousand displacements 1,600 in the 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.150
 category to start on the circuit for 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.200
 you start to play understand the 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.480
 Circuit process I think this 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.370
 category because economic is the motorcycle 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.290
 easy maintenance will be easy and the bike 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.300
 who is going to give you all the fun that 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.340
 It can get really big and then it's you. 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.049
 with experience shifting to the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.640
 categories shows this in the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.090
 practice the staff will now be 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.090
 funny 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:19.340
 the ninja 300 on a compact bike as a base 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:23.799
 for sportsmanship for beginner's 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.420
 a good category the lightweight eco-friendly 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.470
 a very easy to handle power 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.689
 to control 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.869
 for who is starting to search 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:36.829
 motorcycle sportsmanship has the visual 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:39.590
 of big bikes have a good brake on the 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.759
 high versatile personal power 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.759
 He stole the show it 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.170
 the time line might not even 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.000
 impress in comparison with the other 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.770
 deaths in our ranking but the small 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.870
 Kawasaki was faster than some 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.730
 pretty fast cars like mini john 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.730
 cooper works and jaguar xf 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:27.540
