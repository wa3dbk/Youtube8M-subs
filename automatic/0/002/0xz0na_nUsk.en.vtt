that<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.840> completely<00:00:52.260> aligned<00:00:52.559> with<00:00:52.800> felt<00:00:53.100> so

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
that is completely aligned with felt so

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.130 
that is completely aligned with felt so
it<00:00:53.399> protects<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.879> iPhone<00:00:54.239> 4<00:00:54.510> from<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> case

it protects the iPhone 4 from the case

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.959 
it protects the iPhone 4 from the case
itself<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.739> provides<00:00:56.250> extra<00:00:56.699> shock

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
itself and provides extra shock

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.090 
itself and provides extra shock
protection<00:00:57.260> if<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.410> look<00:00:58.559> closely<00:00:58.800> we<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:58.980> see

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
protection if we look closely we can see

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.040 
protection if we look closely we can see
that<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.460> felt<00:00:59.699> completely<00:01:00.210> lines<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.750> edges

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
that the felt completely lines the edges

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.600 
that the felt completely lines the edges
as<00:01:01.199> well<00:01:03.619> so<00:01:04.619> let's<00:01:04.769> go<00:01:04.890> ahead<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.100> slide<00:01:05.460> the

seems<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.950> work<00:01:50.040> normally<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:51.570> case<00:01:51.720> itself

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
seems to work normally the case itself

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.810 
seems to work normally the case itself
does<00:01:52.290> not<00:01:52.320> block<00:01:52.680> their<00:01:52.860> operation<00:01:53.399> now<00:01:53.640> let's

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
does not block their operation now let's

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.999 
does not block their operation now let's
put<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.090> belt<00:01:54.270> clip<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.689> again<00:01:55.619> you're<00:01:55.770> given

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
to it this is also available in black if

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.080 
to it this is also available in black if
you<00:02:22.870> don't<00:02:23.050> like<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.890> silver<00:02:24.280> finish<00:02:24.580> it's

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
you don't like the silver finish it's

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.150 
you don't like the silver finish it's
also<00:02:25.300> very<00:02:25.660> durable<00:02:25.960> so<00:02:26.380> it<00:02:26.500> provides<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.980> lot

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
also very durable so it provides a lot

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.070 
also very durable so it provides a lot
of<00:02:27.190> protection<00:02:27.430> for<00:02:27.940> your<00:02:28.120> iPhone<00:02:28.510> now<00:02:28.870> if<00:02:28.960> you

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
of protection for your iPhone now if you

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.540 
of protection for your iPhone now if you
look<00:02:29.290> at<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.590> distance<00:02:29.950> between<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.430> iPhone

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
look at the distance between the iPhone

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.340 
look at the distance between the iPhone
screen<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.570> case<00:02:31.750> itself<00:02:31.900> you<00:02:32.170> can<00:02:32.320> see

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
screen and the case itself you can see

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.720 
screen and the case itself you can see
there<00:02:32.620> is<00:02:32.680> quite<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:32.920> bit<00:02:33.130> of<00:02:33.160> distance<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:33.640> it

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
there is quite a bit of distance so it

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.510 
there is quite a bit of distance so it
does<00:02:33.880> add<00:02:34.090> some<00:02:34.390> bulk<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:35.830> phone<00:02:36.130> again<00:02:36.430> if

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
does add some bulk to the phone again if

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.650 
does add some bulk to the phone again if
you<00:02:36.580> look<00:02:36.730> at<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:36.910> back<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:37.390> see<00:02:37.540> the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
you look at the back you see the

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.810 
you look at the back you see the
distance<00:02:37.930> between<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.410> camera<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:38.890> the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
distance between the camera and the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.400 
distance between the camera and the
outer<00:02:40.060> outside<00:02:40.720> of<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.900> case<00:02:41.080> itself

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
outer outside of the case itself

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.290 
outer outside of the case itself
unfortunately<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:42.250> distance<00:02:42.610> also<00:02:42.790> causes

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
unfortunately that distance also causes

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.940 
unfortunately that distance also causes
the<00:02:43.330> flash<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.870> reflect<00:02:44.230> back<00:02:44.500> into<00:02:44.860> the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
the flash to reflect back into the

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.800 
the flash to reflect back into the
camera<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:45.580> unfortunate<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.090> can't<00:02:46.360> use<00:02:46.600> the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
camera so unfortunate you can't use the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.990 
camera so unfortunate you can't use the
flash<00:02:47.080> with<00:02:47.500> this<00:02:47.709> case<00:02:47.980> my<00:02:48.640> only<00:02:48.850> other

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
flash with this case my only other

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.490 
flash with this case my only other
concern<00:02:49.150> with<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.630> case<00:02:49.840> is<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.170> fact<00:02:50.380> that

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
concern with the case is the fact that

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.470 
concern with the case is the fact that
the<00:02:50.680> felt<00:02:50.860> appears<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.310> be<00:02:51.400> glued<00:02:51.670> on<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:52.150> the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
the felt appears to be glued on to the

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.630 
the felt appears to be glued on to the
Mellow<00:02:53.110> itself<00:02:53.560> which<00:02:53.740> may<00:02:53.920> not<00:02:54.130> hold<00:02:54.310> up<00:02:54.520> over

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
Mellow itself which may not hold up over

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.090 
Mellow itself which may not hold up over
time<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:55.240> do<00:02:55.720> have<00:02:55.959> low<00:02:56.140> peeling<00:02:56.560> on<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.770> inside
