00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.240
 hello here is replay again 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.309
 this is a new one here today 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.289
 I want video for you in this video 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.180
 Show you how you are your personal 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.609
 vehicles can double how to do it 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.080
 I'll show you what you do now 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.260
 you take your personal vehicle 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.699
 goes out in front of the garage and 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.029
 Put it on the wall quite important 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.300
 Must be a garage and have no mercy 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.809
 or 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.600
 a garage where you are so to speak no 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.340
 Animation takes place and you can 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.059
 unfortunately only with these garages made 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.040
 yourself with the eclipse star or other 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.520
 if you did that, you're worried 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.480
 what you car at the 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.579
 Passenger side of the vehicle provides 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.539
 because a road vehicle so a rule 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.739
 always growing bond i have now easy 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:05.640
 Called and worried me the journey 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:08.010
 and that's just about always and it 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:18.270
 not looked away and so could the car 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:21.450
 double up when you get the vehicle 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.400
 came worried then you just have to 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.410
 only a personal vehicle 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.680
 block doors resp 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.930
 or the driver's door then it rises from 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.370
 and test it all if you are now 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.010
 triangle expresses a need you 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.020
 be teleported or from the pharmacy 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.170
 then the vehicle picks up 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.410
 By the way, street has to be a coupÃ© as well 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:49.620
 his or a two-door because the whole 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:52.210
 songs do not go and heat to the garage 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.930
 when you arrived at the garage you are climbing 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.160
 you then take out the one waffle and 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.440
 would only have to the bonnet 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.440
 shoot until the car starts to burn 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.420
 the car then starts to rise so foreign 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.340
 Immediately enter the vehicle here 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.070
 then the bottom left should be the card 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:18.640
 I'll show you this completely 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:20.680
 short stronger card has flashed steiger 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.070
 out of it then get into the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.630
 corvette one I expect shortly and then 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.910
 would be automatically in the garage of the 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.430
 board and then you have your car 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.709
 now it will only be doubled 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.540
 go out and the original vehicle of 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.540
 the road to which was just 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.890
 Unfortunately, this trick does not work 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.470
 always one hundred percent therefore it could 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.730
 be that you try several times 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.230
 wants or has to start or 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.850
 different vessel in this case 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.850
 want to try 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.410
 rescues as well as I hope the video 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.910
 you liked it 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.790
 if only on the side of the channel 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.170
 forgot to subscribe and if you guys 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.890
 I would attack the video 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.390
 be happy if you score again at the end 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.060
 what was in front of me that was probably over 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.420
 apps here until next time 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.420
 ciao
