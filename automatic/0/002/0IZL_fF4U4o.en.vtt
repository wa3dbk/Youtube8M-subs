00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
around and you're behind the mask and

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.150 
around and you're behind the mask and
sometimes<00:02:47.060> more<00:02:47.240> behind<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.840> mask<00:02:48.110> we're<00:02:49.010> not

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
sometimes more behind a mask we're not

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.580 
sometimes more behind a mask we're not
afraid<00:02:49.400> of<00:02:49.520> doing<00:02:49.760> things<00:02:50.209> we're<00:02:51.200> not<00:02:51.320> afraid

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
afraid of doing things we're not afraid

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.440 
afraid of doing things we're not afraid
of<00:02:51.709> putting<00:02:52.220> ourselves<00:02:52.459> out<00:02:52.940> there<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.300> little

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
of putting ourselves out there a little

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.420 
of putting ourselves out there a little
bit<00:02:53.570> more<00:02:53.810> than<00:02:53.959> we<00:02:54.050> normally<00:02:54.230> do<00:02:54.709> so

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
bit more than we normally do so

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.180 
bit more than we normally do so
therefore<00:02:56.360> we<00:02:57.310> sort<00:02:58.310> of<00:02:58.400> become<00:02:59.500> more<00:03:00.500> likable

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
therefore we sort of become more likable

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.949 
therefore we sort of become more likable
and<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:02.090> think<00:03:02.300> that's<00:03:02.450> what<00:03:02.600> a<00:03:02.630> lot<00:03:02.810> of<00:03:02.870> people

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
and I think that's what a lot of people

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.080 
and I think that's what a lot of people
need<00:03:03.320> to<00:03:03.350> understand<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:04.160> you<00:03:04.459> don't<00:03:04.580> have<00:03:04.880> to

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
be hiding behind the mask to do these

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.699 
be hiding behind the mask to do these
