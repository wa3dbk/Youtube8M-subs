dissect this cow's head to take the

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.879 
dissect this cow's head to take the
brain<00:00:08.429> out<00:00:08.460> if<00:00:08.880> we<00:00:09.000> can<00:00:12.170> trying<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.290> do<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.500> for

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
brain out if we can trying to do it for

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:23.779 
brain out if we can trying to do it for
you<00:00:14.040> can<00:00:14.639> examine<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:16.490> 40<00:00:17.490> minutes

this cow's head was recently gotten from

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.359 
this cow's head was recently gotten from
a<00:00:26.220> slaughterhouse<00:00:27.590> you<00:00:28.590> can<00:00:28.770> see<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.130> still

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
a slaughterhouse you can see it still

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.370 
a slaughterhouse you can see it still
has<00:00:29.550> its<00:00:29.580> eyes<00:00:30.000> intact<00:00:30.570> which<00:00:30.840> will<00:00:31.020> try<00:00:31.199> and

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
has its eyes intact which will try and

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.740 
has its eyes intact which will try and
dissect<00:00:31.829> out<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> little<00:00:32.309> while<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:33.449> also

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
dissect out a little while you can also

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.710 
dissect out a little while you can also
see<00:00:34.199> where<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.699> bolt<00:00:35.699> I<00:00:36.030> was<00:00:36.510> talking<00:00:36.690> about

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
see where the bolt I was talking about

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.979 
see where the bolt I was talking about
in<00:00:36.870> class<00:00:36.960> earlier<00:00:37.470> where<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.220> went<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.989> so

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
in class earlier where that went in so

in class earlier where that went in so
if<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.710> were<00:00:40.830> doing<00:00:40.920> an<00:00:41.129> autopsy<00:00:41.489> right<00:00:41.760> now<00:00:41.910> as

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
if we were doing an autopsy right now as

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.640 
if we were doing an autopsy right now as
soon<00:00:42.239> as<00:00:42.330> you<00:00:42.480> reflected<00:00:43.019> the<00:00:43.170> skin<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
soon as you reflected the skin on the

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.650 
soon as you reflected the skin on the
forehead<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.220> have<00:00:44.400> seen<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.790> this<00:00:45.449> was

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
forehead and you have seen that this was

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:53.360 
forehead and you have seen that this was
people<00:00:48.500> here<00:00:49.500> comes<00:00:49.769> the<00:00:49.949> fun<00:00:50.160> part<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:52.370> cow's

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
people here comes the fun part the cow's

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.119 
people here comes the fun part the cow's
brain<00:00:53.699> case<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.420> actually<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:55.440> behind<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
brain case is actually just behind the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.010 
brain case is actually just behind the
eyes<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:57.559> I<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> dissected<00:00:59.370> skull<00:00:59.899> from<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
eyes and I have a dissected skull from a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.920 
eyes and I have a dissected skull from a
previous<00:01:01.440> operation<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.660> used

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
previous operation like this that I used

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.830 
previous operation like this that I used
to<00:01:04.110> make<00:01:04.289> sure<00:01:04.820> if<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.940> notice<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.570> one<00:01:06.630> I

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
to make sure if you notice on this one I

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:33.109 
to make sure if you notice on this one I
started<00:01:07.110> chopping<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> wrong<00:01:08.070> place

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.270 

one<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> things<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.229> overlooked<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.040> first

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
one of the things I overlooked the first

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.920 
one of the things I overlooked the first
time<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.490> did<00:01:35.850> was<00:01:38.960> that<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.079> brain<00:01:40.320> comes

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.440 

puts<00:01:44.140> it<00:01:44.260> back<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:45.430> fact<00:01:45.670> I<00:01:45.850> showed<00:01:46.150> you<00:01:46.300> where

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
puts it back in fact I showed you where

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:54.109 
puts it back in fact I showed you where
the<00:01:46.480> spinal<00:01:46.930> cord<00:01:47.170> was<00:01:48.120> back<00:01:49.120> here

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.999 

and<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.719> need<00:01:54.929> to<00:01:55.020> follow<00:01:55.229> up<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.799> either

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
and so I need to follow up on either

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:35.309 
and so I need to follow up on either
side<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.399> that

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.179 

that's<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.069> Canada

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
that's the Canada

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:59.740 
that's the Canada
there<00:02:39.189> we<00:02:39.310> go

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.140 

as<00:02:59.960> an<00:03:00.110> interior<00:03:00.740> of<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.310> console

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.510 

and<00:03:13.050> that<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.500> brain<00:03:13.740> inside<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.340> dura

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
and that is the brain inside of the dura

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:23.140 
and that is the brain inside of the dura
mater

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.000 

so<00:03:23.420> I<00:03:23.599> am<00:03:23.750> going<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:23.930> go<00:03:24.080> ahead<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.409> open<00:03:24.769> up<00:03:24.860> a

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
so I am going to go ahead and open up a

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:44.309 
so I am going to go ahead and open up a
key<00:03:25.069> remember

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.470 

protections<00:03:45.430> it's<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.969> protective

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
protections it's the protective

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.809 
protections it's the protective
outermost<00:03:46.870> covering

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.309 

the<00:03:53.370> transverse<00:03:54.000> fissure<00:03:54.239> has<00:03:54.659> dura<00:03:55.110> mater

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
the transverse fissure has dura mater

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.260 
the transverse fissure has dura mater
inside<00:03:55.829> it<00:03:55.950> as<00:03:56.069> well

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
inside it as well

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.990 
inside it as well
that<00:03:57.870> is<00:03:58.110> why<00:03:58.260> it's<00:03:58.470> very<00:03:58.680> difficult<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.880> get

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
that is why it's very difficult to get

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.660 
that is why it's very difficult to get
the<00:04:00.330> entire<00:04:00.720> brain<00:04:01.050> out<00:04:01.230> and

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
the entire brain out and

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:15.130 
the entire brain out and
go

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:24.480 

needs<00:04:15.740> a<00:04:15.950> good<00:04:15.980> cleaning

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.700 

I<00:04:24.580> cut<00:04:25.240> out<00:04:25.539> the<00:04:25.720> chiasm

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.140 

I<00:04:38.650> don't<00:04:38.980> know<00:04:39.100> if<00:04:39.280> this<00:04:39.430> is<00:04:39.610> a<00:04:39.640> practical

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
I don't know if this is a practical

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.240 
I don't know if this is a practical
exercise

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.780 

way<00:04:44.820> too<00:04:44.880> much<00:04:45.480> work
