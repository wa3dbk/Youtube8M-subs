it's not too wet at all it's not too
moist<00:02:41.640> see<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.790> molded<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.930> worms<00:02:44.170> can

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
moist see the molded and the worms can

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.759 
moist see the molded and the worms can
come<00:02:44.709> up<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:46.060> get<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.629> and<00:02:47.019> that's<00:02:47.530> after

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
come up to get that and that's after

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.770 
come up to get that and that's after
layers<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.430> that<00:02:48.579> layer<00:02:48.819> keeps<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.540> fruit

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
layers and that layer keeps the fruit

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.660 
layers and that layer keeps the fruit
flies<00:02:50.049> which<00:02:50.319> there's<00:02:50.680> one<00:02:50.950> flying<00:02:51.310> around

going<00:02:57.549> to<00:02:57.730> do<00:02:57.849> this<00:02:58.030> step<00:02:58.269> by<00:02:58.480> step<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.140> that's

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
going to do this step by step so that's

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.690
