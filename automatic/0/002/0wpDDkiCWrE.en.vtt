throw home with it and they finally get
an<00:01:43.070> out<00:01:43.220> here<00:01:43.520> is<00:01:43.760> he's<00:01:43.940> forced<00:01:44.330> at<00:01:44.510> the<00:01:44.630> plate

an out here is he's forced at the plate

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.650 
an out here is he's forced at the plate
so<00:01:45.980> they're<00:01:46.160> fortunate<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:46.850> get<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.150> force<00:01:47.420> at

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
so they're fortunate to get the force at

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.120 
so they're fortunate to get the force at
the<00:01:47.780> plate<00:01:48.050> but<00:01:48.320> they<00:01:48.500> might<00:01:48.740> have<00:01:48.860> gotten<00:01:49.010> a

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
the plate but they might have gotten a

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.130 
the plate but they might have gotten a
little<00:01:49.280> greedy<00:01:49.640> there<00:01:49.940> by<00:01:50.090> not<00:01:50.420> trying<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:51.020> go
