00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.309
 how do I make provost 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.780
 hairy people healthy hair 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.130
 hair without breakage so it's 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.430

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.139
 secrets 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.760
 firstly care I do not think that 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.410
 use a repairing shampoo more 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.970
 really helped so a little bit 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.829
 whatever you choose it changes 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.239
 nothing is really revealing side and 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.800
 mask to be careful 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.810
 I really like La Garotte 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.149
 a whole weekend of L'Oréal especially their 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.189
 mask with my own pharmacy repaired 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:32.689
 point of fuchu super fast we can 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.640
 use it in the shower when we 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.650
 leave 2 to 3 minutes in the raïs and 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.720
 here is the negative side is that they 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.130
 repair the spikes in the short term so 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.600
 continue a mask a little more 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.370
 repairer must really want to 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.840
 rid of the function points a 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.550
 once a week I use my mask 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.230
 is a favorite who spontaneously repaired my 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.880
 split ends and long term this 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.590
 this time it's the one of street looks 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.270
 donges and apply it after washing 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.950
 yb missed my hair I let it act 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.490
 for 15 minutes then open as well 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.490
 selected 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.580
 these important town halls fact I 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.990
 with a comb in Holland to choose have 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.850
 tend to caen know more when it's 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.410
 wet uses one of the best that can 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.390
 also be a good option that prevents 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.770
 to shoot too much are warm I was typing 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.790
 use too much heat it's bad to 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.630
 long term for hair but 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.760
 actually exist alternative 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.050
 possible to heat one could 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.270
 register the girls the spring has 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.550
 successful fashionable one can do a very 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.140
 dirty asleep that will create the beautiful effect 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.300
 curly or in our hair that we get up 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.830
 the morning are seen more defined waves 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.880
 we can make very good plans to 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.880
 cap in the heart joy 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.630
 when they exist of mind that gives to 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.220
 your beach effect hair a look a 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.220
 a little more negligent but that superb 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.960
 if you really want to leave at home 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.759
 set loose from the dryer to the most 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.049
 cold and keep it as far as possible from 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.909
 you so I do a drop distance 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.020
 season that's going to be a little bit more 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.829
 long to dry but that makes 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.689
 definitely less aggressive for the 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.250
 scare the curling iron we use a 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.539
 charlotte protector that's for sure 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.740
 even abyss the hair but at 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.740
 the less we protect them a little more 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.239
 I will still quote on the fact that if 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.099
 your hair is really damaged take 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.959
 the trowel and put in a drawer and 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.940
 you of the torture type otherwise called 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.260
 brothers and curtly no but 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.670
 you're not in a drawer and but 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.420
 honestly you will really see a 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.739
 difference is easily as before 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.000
 wash the hair become brittle and 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.400
 week sector if you have hair 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.540
 fat did not have it every day if he 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.310
 just made the second day of 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.769
 washing one can use a dry shampoo 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.120
 your session near you ready you let yourself 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.950
 act for a few seconds then you 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.599
 stir to remove the excess 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.599
 use a country or brush 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.079
 otherwise we say bye-bye all informed no 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.459
 sealed as super hot but who 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.989
 we burn the back of the head it takes 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.250
 we use but it produces rice 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.989
 vital years for all come beautiful 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.670
 it's really to banish you want 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.930
 really changed you walk assume 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.640
 pay a little more and go see the 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.200
 hairdresser she has products really 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.910
 best suited for your hair care 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.709

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.420
 crowd that will thank you sheep 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.680
 man if you want you I 'm 60 and 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.660
 sometimes you have to take the problem to the 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.610
 root bo tip 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.810
 short cut the spikes it's really 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.950
 the best advice I can you 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.209
 give you do not need to the 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.790
 to do every month we need to 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.660
 cut 10 cm at a time just a little bit for 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.160
 remove what works 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.840
 yes the hair break by feedback but 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.760
 this points and to him they will go through 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.500
 beauty will grow more I prefer 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.549
 to entrust me alone because for the 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.930
 little that I think it would cost 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.579
 really too expensive to go to the 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.380
 dressing table in addition to super g cut in 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.760
 my hair before starting with a 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.680
 treatment that's really what I'm doing 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.030
 advise to make a good cut of 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.609
 hair you'll see it's miraculous 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.319
 we laughed a little advice is fundamental 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.549
 but it is to drink water the water is 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.109
 a vital need as much for the 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.519
 functioning of the body only for 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.079
 hair that must be grown 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.540
 hair faster but it helps their 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.290
 health professions 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.019
 finally to grow 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.909
 I can not live well with patience 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.129
 I can honestly rarely poses y 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.480
 more than 2 cm a month that's what it 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.159
 depends who has it is more 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.019
 quickly I took - live but 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.459
 honestly it's not all the stuff at 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.629
 world I was trying to do that will do 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.519
 grow hair faster 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.810
 on the other hand he advises that I have you 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.340
 given you contribute to that your 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.409
 hair is really healthier - 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.879
 broken and may have you seem 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.980
 push faster precisely because they 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.629
 have been healthier so I hope that 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.410
 my video have you been able to we are going to get 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.310
 find for a next 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.310
 theoretically
