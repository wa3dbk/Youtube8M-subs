00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.689
 now again welcome to another video 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.850
 this 2 I bring another match of the tournament 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.820
 youtubers this time I will fight against 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.280
 distance the former player 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.760
 you will find it activate the description 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.070
 in the description you find his channel 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.470
 visit him please do me the favor and 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.610
 let's see his team his team is greg 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:27.880
 ninja with that the hard 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:32.020
 and see with unnecessary and it is but the 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:35.410
 truth is that they are not pokemon tv cc and they 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.700
 You can see but they are not a little university 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.790
 in fact he had told me that there was no 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.740
 played I think it seems to me that 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.030
 you see it no but that's not good 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.190
 it means either that 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.440
 that's why one has an advantage over 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.890
 others because good can earn me equal 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.739
 so well let's see the combat 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.170
 I say that yes I was a little confident 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.980
 because when I saw that there was not a little DVD 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.940
 I thought it would be to sew and sing 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.619
 with the bag not to have espn that 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.570
 that I in famous the combination of 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.369
 guided and maestri that is very used this 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.320
 combination now less because there are less 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.860
 porrÃ³n with ray but still it is a 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.900
 fairly used combination not 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.270
 had changed sides and remove to throw and 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.040
 you are to be able to stop it well and anita 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.200
 with his great special defense for hand and 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.180
 berni stopped is pawn 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.730
 basically I'm even immune to attacks 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.520
 from stealth to stealth and there is no see 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.430
 neither canon method look evolve to 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.080
 manet trick to be able to hit harder 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.700
 I had seen that you will not have anything left with 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:46.020
 lightning so I did not mind evolving 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.130
 I no longer needed I did not need 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.130
 I would say he 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.810
 What is the name of the lightning rod? 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.910
 commented the thing yes it was bad luck 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.680
 for him because I would have burst a lot 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:03.620
 electric 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.240
 but good things that happen in the book 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:10.200
 magical thing that surprised me a lot 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.870
 because I was surprised 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.700
 it ends with the hard without and by 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.620
 true 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.569
 to stop me when shooting and you're 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.519
 logically so well I did not hesitate 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.860
 take a minute to degrees to intimidate 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:26.100
 to that with the hard so that the 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.650
 attack times in less damage 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.819
 besides if it's a ship's fist something 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.739
 so this would be a problem 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.749
 ultra electric hand grip although what 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.749
 it resists well because of the inclination 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.790
 many defenses that have more of this in 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.170
 special what defense do I think I 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.930
 it's quite surprising to take off the defensive 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.569
 special I do not know the truth 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.010
 I kill electric hematoma which was a 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:58.010
 pity I did not have mega pokemon thunder 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.280
 here the whole world has been damaged by the 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.030
 storm with that the hard burned by 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.780
 to activate guts that could be a 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.780
 Problem why 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.330
 although psuv is intimidated the attack 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:17.000
 It was good but I really did not think 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:21.190
 I could do a lot because doing it is 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.900
 of flying type then to think after 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.670
 she was nominated for sharp rock 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.150
 and that is to say that I was very surprised 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.920
 talent and die sincerely there are game 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.000
 very well I did not expect at all that 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.500
 sharp rock 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.760
 imagine with the damage of the gills 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.920
 although this is if it is incriminated 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.170
 problems damaged by 4 is also burned 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.180
 acting guts so imagine thunder 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.210
 in storm sand and burned are 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.820
 taking a toll on how hard the 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:53.190
 retires to avoid unfortunately because 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.400
 Of course it's the flying guy because he rapes me 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.830
 pretty pretty hardcore ultra fist 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.110
 throw and is without hesitation I thought that 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.560
 I would not do it that I wanted good we're going to 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.500
 sacrifice good there kill me tyrannical 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.640
 unnecessarily why 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.640
 and I could have 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.340
 predict that but well I was not going 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.530
 protect was a 7 throw and is super 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.949
 super offensive as expected without 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.509
 protection so good I made myself a 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.520
 I train a big fan because the long one 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:28.150
 could be useful in line with the attack 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.940
 come down to outs fight him and he can give me 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.220
 problems so just for 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.800
 paralyzing it besides that it can not 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.790
 attack to be a little with with enough 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.460
 little defense, can I? 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.430
 overcome it in speed not only me 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.440
 are the two against one I was screwed 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.830
 because he said fuck with that team and I up 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.390
 it's going to hurt me a lot but it 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.510
 turned into ice type 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.510
 he mounts type but not 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.680
 achievement not hit me no shame to 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.630
 it was the storm it was but he had to 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.300
 do waterfall with heat because if I do not 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.840
 I ate a sharp rock and it destroyed me very 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.430
 hardcore 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.139
 the mental projector star in although I 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.010
 it seems that he had not died in 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:18.630
 line to nobody will guide you two dramas ps 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.130
 thing that saved me is to say no 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.470
 having been it could have been very 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.940
 painful and there is good nothing else 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.410
 there was a cascade to go back 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:32.010
 I read that I know to back off or paralyze what 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.570
 it was my only salvation and he stepped back and 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.100
 you have done that is natural or has 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.280
 saved my ass from not having made it 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:41.740
 a thunder would have died very hardcore 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.860
 because I would have attacked first of ninja 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.410
 but I'm not saying either 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.020
 with me heaven because I have known to have 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.240
 more power casca won good had to 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.610
 go for the kickback or the pay or the 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.590
 paralysis was my only salvation me 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.440
 it went well could have gone wrong already 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.720
 I say you leave in this fight since 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.509
 Failure away also commit as 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.280
 here there is no possible discussion and I had 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:07.720
 hacks if it is that if I do not say no 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.699
 but good 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.610
 other times they give me my ass 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:13.830
 what remedy 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.750
