00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:32.759

 if I show more details of the device 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:54.060
 removing the packaging is important 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.689
 say that this smartphone here is the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.689
 waterproof 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.560
 We're going to play some games with 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.240
 He did not review it later. He can not see that. 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.140
 everyone does not even have access to 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.220
 drums 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.220
 there is that protection here of the connectors 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.160
 and let's put on the hood to see how 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:21.420
 and he stays 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:36.470
 The actual size is quite easy to put 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:36.470
 cap caught her connector 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:45.420
 and I can tell you what they have 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.790
 A good footprint, she's matte. 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.850
 then it is rough also the material here is 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.050
 plastic but it is rough then not 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.090
 slide in hand 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:03:00.990
 This is interesting so it has 9.8 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.150
 millimeters of very thin thickness weighs only 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.310
 110 grams 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.310
 for the data that we saw there on the website 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:23.910
 here the volume control knob 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:25.890
 Here is USB micro USB input and here 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.850
 for the headset that is left 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:34.290
 on the left side of the phone 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:40.680
 It is kind of hard to take waterproof 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:42.150
 It is also then gives to place but we will 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.920
 see this in review right 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.269
 in the video will suddenly show but stay 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.180
 on the left side usually the others 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:54.260
 smartphones stay up but okay 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:58.739
 we see the tests as he leaves 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:01.560
 and his screen has a resolution of 320 per 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:05.220
 480 points 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:09.000
 It has a 5 megapixel camera. 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:13.340
 in high resolution, that is 720 points and 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.079
 has a led flash and here is the 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.150
 speaker a person is practically 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.669
 this is one of the most 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.900
 is that he is resistant to 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:28.550
 water and producer we will play in the 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.550
 water not only in review 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.680
 and there's no way people will stay by 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.240
 review then wait for the next video 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.009

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.020
