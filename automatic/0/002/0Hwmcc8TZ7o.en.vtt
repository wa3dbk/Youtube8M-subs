 android or ios 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.040
 that is, actually , in my opinion, this 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:51.370
 the first product that really 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.769
 get to the point g who conceived 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.480
 microsoft when created windows 8 and 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.980
 because it really is a tablet 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.010
 from the real tablet to watch it thin 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.070

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.620

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:21.090

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.810
 dollars i.e. three times 824 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.370
 Russian money from 25 thousand rubles well 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.040
 and grow again it will be more expensive as 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.200
