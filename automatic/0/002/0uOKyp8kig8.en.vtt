00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.330
 but first here and I want Ford was outweighed with my Duin 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.520
 Contradictions in the Bible 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.910
 second part 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.149
 We had wanted to contradict it recently 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:16.359
 from where can his wife have 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.130
 Kind of got that was Mr. relative 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.099
 easy 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.189
 that was relatively robust by 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.619
 now we want to end a contradiction with the blue light the 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.179
 I had had very little knowledge so far so had to do so very early 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.210
 to do 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.830
 but when we meet the legends people can do that sometimes too 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:36.840
 to the fore 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.290
 and contradictions 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.499
 in the bible and although different time information 

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:45.179
 the crucifixion m 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:46.190
 the gospels 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.690
 would like to try to explain briefly 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.000
 in which this contradiction 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.999
 and we have one at the same time 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:55.999
 one won tears for those who do not know the Bible so well 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.040
 Percent, we have the stories of Jesus 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.089
 described in many different gospels 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.199
 Matheus Markus Lukas Johannes 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.890
 they are four eyewitnesses 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.789
 and the 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:09.049
 the crucifixion 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.009
 describe the suffering and resurrection of Jesus and we have a magician 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.210
 at Acteos 27 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.710
 45 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.040
 the ark 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.880
 the report of Matheus 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.039
 that Jesus 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:23.290
 hangs on the cross 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.520
 and thanks to an eclipse entry 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.520
 and so second goal to the sixth hour 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.140
 We have Rome on one side 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.640
 in contrast occurs 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.670
 Alsleben 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.899
 that the gospel of John says that in Johannas percent 19 verse 14 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.160
 that the sojus 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.030
 before the crucifixion BAG the Lakers was under investigation for trial 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.790
 and on additional 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.049
 so we can here 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.450
 clearly see the contradiction 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.049
 What's wrong with this silence? 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.230
 not knowing the evangelists themselves 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.999
 at what hour Jesus says where warm Acteos 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.419
 at the sixth hour was Nils Schumann Grosz 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.649
 and there was the eclipse of the sun and John says wine for the sixth hour 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:17.869
 is not yet crucified he was still Patil Arthur 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:20.640
 and Berra still with a car castle 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.159
 these are 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.500
 contradictions 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.680
 in the Bible and remained with us the truthfulness and the inspiration of the Dr 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.549
 Bible doubt 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.589
 Let's study a bit more thoroughly 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:37.250
 and for a bit more 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.099
 to study the times 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.580
 we all have no time in the markus gospel 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.709
 Information on the market launch for the 25th 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.990
 Darwin Jesus crucified so the fourth hour 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:51.319
 and then it goes on 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.749
 In the quarter you can see the boy again 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:03:01.589
 describes Mateos are Matheus 27 46 that the death of Jesus has occurred 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:04.109
 Neureuther hour 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.089
 when we gather this time and 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:09.730
 Dante who first 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.679
 after our German argue that's right 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:15.640
 that's what you can say 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.799
 so the stairs hour 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.739
 Evening tells us Mark that Jesus was crucified 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:25.990
 Matheus tells us about the sixth hour 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.420
 that the darkness 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.819
 an enterprising would be here so'n concept 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.359
 Otmar TAOS also reports that at the ninth hour 9 o'clock 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.369
 the death of Jesus occurred and now we have the contradiction 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.729
 Matheus says at 6 o'clock 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:44.019
 that would be 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.580
 Solar eclipse during the crucifixion and John says 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.000
 was at 6 o'clock 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.780
 Jesus still with Pilate here we see 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.849
 the contradiction 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.019
 Labor de Gier is constructed 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.710
 but we have to 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.519
 not a bit 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:03:59.729
 the 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:00.559
 around 

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:02.080
 the Swedish newspaper 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.429
 understanding 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:06.479
 or how the UBM does the tour 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.509
 have understood or have understood 

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:12.829
 Here I have you a bit meager recorded 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.849
 that means if in Germany in Germany 0 is 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:19.900
 At 0 o'clock we mean with 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.349
 the Jews 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.129
 have another one 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:25.940
 SBU bills or time as we 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.539
 for her, it's not just pure midnight 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.219
 Sundials Urs Sunrise 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:32.030
 this means 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.280
 when we have to leave about six o'clock now because I believe you 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.670
 Sunrise in Berlin not so different as ours in Germany 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.379
 become more monoterpenes 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:43.029
 Opel combo say 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.900
 Sun 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.780
 Sunrise is Sugar Securities choice 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.170
 that means only 6 o'clock 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.909
 and first hour is credited is 7 million 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:54.639
 this means 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.660
 for the twelfth hour 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.780
 that's on 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.069
 Baierbrunn Said 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:00.150
 6 pm 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.749
 which are now going down to the sun, that is 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:05.839
 0 o'clock sunrise 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:09.909
 18 o'clock sunset if we then again 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:10.939
 these 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:12.740
 new 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.199
 Bill as something new as a new time to the Jewish era on the 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.080
 Evangelist Markus Schmidt Mateos apply 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.650
 then we want that 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.930
 Mappus said Hingi's hour 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.229
 at the crucifixions that according to the Jewish era 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.919
 9 Uro Morgans 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.349
 there we have after antivirus 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:35.639
 for the sixth hour the darkness 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.569
 "That's even nicer just calculating 12 noon 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.800
 12 o'clock noon was so 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.379
 solar eclipse 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:46.280
 and the death of Jesus also according to Matheus 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.760
 until the ninth hour translates to the Jewish era 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:54.539
 3 pm German second afternoon 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.789
 so that means 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.419
 around 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.400
 if we take this opportunity now 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.400
 then the sixth hour would be too 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:11.419
 Jesus had been at Pilate for 12 noon that night for 6 noon 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:13.759
 Here we have the solution 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:17.680
 Matheus and Mark were written much earlier 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.500
 as the gospel of john 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.599
 and use the Jewish era 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:24.150
 Johanna is but 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.530
 when he swam the sixth hour he speaks already at John 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.250
 has been written a little later 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.710
 already from the Roman era 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.449
 which is ours 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:37.639
 that is, Jesus was with Pilate 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:42.010
 to the sixth hour that means that our app will be showing the Roman 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:42.889
 Time bill 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:44.320
 six o'clock in the morning 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.150
 9 o'clock ladies 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.460
 the crucifixion at nine o'clock in the morning at 12 o'clock the solar eclipse 

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:54.330
 at 3 pm, TUI stepped forward 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.160
 this means 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.720
 we have no contradiction here but we just have in John 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.930
 the Roman period bill 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.249
 and Game Mateos 

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:05.999
 Markus 

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:07.689
 Jewish era 

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:08.969
 that was 

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:13.089
 Percent a bit complicated but he has to get me in a bit 

00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:14.029
 is working 

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:15.819
 on the second look 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:18.819
 The Bible then you have no contradiction 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:21.040
 she just has to 

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.509
 in Kohl gates 

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:24.240
 and historical context 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.430
 to be read 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.220
 so continue to have fun 

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.319
 while reading and students offers Bergische
