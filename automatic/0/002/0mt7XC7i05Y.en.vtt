00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.360 

hello<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.290> welcome<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.980> slingshot

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
hello and welcome to the slingshot

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.970 
hello and welcome to the slingshot
channel<00:00:14.580> today<00:00:15.570> we<00:00:15.750> want<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:15.960> try<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.619> make<00:00:16.800> an

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
channel today we want to try to make an

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.859 
channel today we want to try to make an
arrow<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.460> pierces<00:00:18.060> on<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.359> skull<00:00:18.630> and

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
arrow that pierces on the skull and

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.720 
arrow that pierces on the skull and
destroys<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.740> brain<00:00:19.859> behind<00:00:20.369> it

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
destroys the brain behind it

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.210 
destroys the brain behind it
arrows<00:00:21.510> are<00:00:21.810> normally<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.170> good<00:00:22.410> way<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.650> pierce

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
arrows are normally a good way to pierce

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.210 
arrows are normally a good way to pierce
a<00:00:23.460> skull<00:00:23.760> but<00:00:24.390> I'm<00:00:24.660> concerned<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.949> may

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
a skull but I'm concerned that it may

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.150 
a skull but I'm concerned that it may
not<00:00:26.430> destroy<00:00:26.699> enough<00:00:27.180> brain<00:00:27.480> meta<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
not destroy enough brain meta the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.220 
not destroy enough brain meta the
problem<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.150> zombie<00:00:30.570> only<00:00:30.929> uses<00:00:31.199> a

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
problem is that a zombie only uses a

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.780 
problem is that a zombie only uses a
very<00:00:31.470> small<00:00:31.740> part<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.040> its<00:00:32.219> brain<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.579> if<00:00:32.669> you

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
very small part of its brain and if you

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.639 
very small part of its brain and if you
don't<00:00:33.030> destroy<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.600> right<00:00:33.780> part<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.440> may

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
don't destroy the right part it may

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.319 
don't destroy the right part it may
still<00:00:34.920> come<00:00:35.160> after<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.610> even<00:00:35.790> though<00:00:36.090> there

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
still come after you even though there

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.780 
still come after you even though there
is<00:00:36.420> an<00:00:36.570> arrow<00:00:36.780> poking<00:00:37.350> out<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.649> its<00:00:37.829> head<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.340> I

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
is an arrow poking out of its head so I

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.060 
is an arrow poking out of its head so I
made<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.690> special<00:00:40.379> arrow<00:00:40.530> tip<00:00:40.800> from<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
made this special arrow tip from a

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.959 
made this special arrow tip from a
little<00:00:41.309> bit<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.579> flat<00:00:41.820> iron<00:00:42.090> piece<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.809> some

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
little bit of a flat iron piece and some

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.900 
little bit of a flat iron piece and some
hooks<00:00:44.969> from<00:00:45.960> woodworking<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:47.100> idea<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.640> that

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
hooks from woodworking the idea is that

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.139 
hooks from woodworking the idea is that
this<00:00:48.510> will<00:00:49.110> go<00:00:49.350> through<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.770> skull<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.340> once

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
this will go through the skull and once

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.689 
this will go through the skull and once
it's<00:00:51.329> inside<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.199> brain<00:00:52.440> cavity<00:00:52.699> these

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
it's inside the brain cavity these

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.360 
it's inside the brain cavity these
levers<00:00:54.210> will<00:00:54.690> automatically<00:00:55.500> swing<00:00:55.829> out<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
levers will automatically swing out and

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.819 
levers will automatically swing out and
slice<00:00:57.239> through<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.690> bait<00:00:57.930> through<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.649> brain

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
slice through the bait through the brain

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:12.180 
slice through the bait through the brain
matter<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.760> scalpels<00:01:02.090> like<00:01:03.090> this

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.890 

this<00:01:12.790> is<00:01:12.940> how<00:01:13.060> it<00:01:13.180> looks<00:01:13.360> like<00:01:13.570> when<00:01:13.750> it's

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
this is how it looks like when it's

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.890 
this is how it looks like when it's

still functional rubber based crossbow
that<00:01:30.610> I<00:01:30.640> built<00:01:30.940> from<00:01:31.180> probably<00:01:31.570> two<00:01:31.780> years<00:01:32.050> ago

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
that I built from probably two years ago

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.320 
that I built from probably two years ago
it's<00:01:32.740> not<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.010> strongest<00:01:33.220> but<00:01:33.940> it's<00:01:34.120> still

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
it's not the strongest but it's still

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:46.160 
it's not the strongest but it's still
works<00:01:34.630> really<00:01:34.870> good<00:01:35.070> ready<00:01:36.070> steady

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.360 

so<00:01:47.170> the<00:01:47.410> blades<00:01:47.740> have<00:01:48.010> opened<00:01:48.430> and<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.960> sliced

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
so the blades have opened and it sliced

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.490 
so the blades have opened and it sliced
the<00:01:51.370> ballistic<00:01:51.790> gelatin<00:01:51.970> which<00:01:52.960> by<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.350> way

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
the ballistic gelatin which by the way

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.060 
the ballistic gelatin which by the way
is<00:01:53.980> a<00:01:54.040> lot<00:01:54.400> more<00:01:54.880> tough<00:01:55.180> than<00:01:55.800> real<00:01:56.800> brain

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
is a lot more tough than real brain

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.640 
is a lot more tough than real brain
matter<00:01:57.360> will<00:01:58.360> shoot<00:01:58.570> against<00:01:58.810> sideways<00:01:59.350> so<00:01:59.530> we

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
matter will shoot against sideways so we

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:11.470 
matter will shoot against sideways so we
can<00:01:59.830> see<00:02:00.010> the<00:02:00.130> opening<00:02:00.520> better

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.750 

as<00:02:11.540> you<00:02:12.230> see<00:02:12.440> at<00:02:12.620> one<00:02:12.769> point<00:02:12.950> they<00:02:13.190> had<00:02:13.220> blades

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
as you see at one point they had blades

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.610 
as you see at one point they had blades
had<00:02:14.000> been<00:02:14.209> fully<00:02:14.480> opened<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.110> sliced<00:02:15.409> the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
had been fully opened and sliced the

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.070 
had been fully opened and sliced the
huge<00:02:15.860> canal<00:02:16.430> through<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.269> great<00:02:17.450> matter<00:02:17.720> and

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
huge canal through the great matter and

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.649 
huge canal through the great matter and
but<00:02:19.069> then<00:02:19.220> they<00:02:19.430> snapped<00:02:19.730> over<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.120> blocks<00:02:20.360> I

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
but then they snapped over the blocks I

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.330 
but then they snapped over the blocks I
think<00:02:20.930> I<00:02:21.019> have<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.319> enhance<00:02:21.680> those<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.159> make

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
think I have to enhance those to make

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.270 
think I have to enhance those to make
them<00:02:22.519> tougher<00:02:23.019> but<00:02:24.019> you<00:02:24.200> see<00:02:24.440> there<00:02:25.010> is<00:02:25.250> a

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
them tougher but you see there is a

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.250 
them tougher but you see there is a
badly<00:02:25.879> sliced<00:02:26.239> brain<00:02:26.629> and<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:26.900> can<00:02:27.049> clearly

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
badly sliced brain and you can clearly

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.770 
badly sliced brain and you can clearly
see<00:02:27.379> that<00:02:27.560> they<00:02:27.799> open<00:02:28.099> slowly<00:02:28.450> what<00:02:29.450> happened

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
see that they open slowly what happened

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.880 
see that they open slowly what happened
is<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:30.110> these<00:02:30.739> little<00:02:30.950> blocks<00:02:31.310> here<00:02:31.730> just

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
is that these little blocks here just

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.580 
is that these little blocks here just
welded<00:02:33.890> on<00:02:34.510> proved<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.690> little<00:02:35.959> bit<00:02:36.110> too<00:02:36.319> flat

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
welded on proved a little bit too flat

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.270 
welded on proved a little bit too flat
so<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:38.269> pressure<00:02:38.540> on<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.989> blades<00:02:39.230> made<00:02:40.099> them

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
so the pressure on the blades made them

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.910 
so the pressure on the blades made them
