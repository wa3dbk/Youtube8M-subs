00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.320
 or the youtube easels talks to them 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.330
 stain 98 with part 2 of the top 10 of 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.029
 the best and worst cartoons of the 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.360
 2000 well let's start with the top 5 of the 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:34.300
 best cartoons in the top 5 are the 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.190
 superpowerful girls this series was very 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.590
 good although it was supposed to be for 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.570
 girls I did not see anything of girls at 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.790
 it seemed like more action and adventures 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.100
 pretty good but over time 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.620
 the Japanese tried to make another 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.750
 version of the superpowerful girls 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.210
 now called the superpowerful girls 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.190
 z I thought it would be great anime type and 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.220
 more action than before and a little people 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.650
 and xd but it was very boring now it seemed 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.720
 a little more for girls did not come so much 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.860
 action that before and it became a shit 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.180
 the top 4 is the cantankerous beavers 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.710
 this series was very good 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.080
 I never got bored in any of his 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.970
 chapters besides fun in a 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.250
 time was criticized because in the 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.470
 episode the king of the pines in a 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.780
 part norbert says shut up your mouth that 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.640
 in English it would shut up some parents 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.980
 of family complained that the word 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.490
 sub sounded very similar so what in 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.950
 Spanish 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.140
 the word nickelodeon shit is derived 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.909
 he wanted to solve it by putting the sound 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.310
 vile of censure to cover the word 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.259
 but this caused controversy because it 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.830
 I thought they wanted to cover a word 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.869
 offensive 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.420
 then nickelodeon along with the 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.039
 creators changed the dialogue so that 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.920
 Shut up instead to say say 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:48.100
 silence however in Latin America not 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.740
 they made no censure the top 3 is the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.049
 modern life of rocko this caricature is not 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.270
 it's from 2000 but I remember seeing it 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.950
 in my childhood what I did not understand very 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.110
 well it was because a dog that lived 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.179
 modernly he had as a mascot another 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.450
 dog but this dog did not speak or anything 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.909
 it was an ordinary pet xd al 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.739
 just like the cantankerous beavers this 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.929
 series had a censorship since in the 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.980
 episode road rash that was only shown in 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.840
 television once 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.790
 efe and rocco ask for a room in a 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.580
 hotel and the attendant makes a gesture 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.580
 peculiar here is the scene runs video 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.150
 2 is recreating the truth this series was 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.370
 one of the best that happened in the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.410
 disney chanel channel before it 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.720
 turned into shit with his series that 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.940
 they have no joke that series never had 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.970
 bad episodes in my opinion was a 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.190
 success and in the top 1 is she arnold a 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.050
 of the best series of nickelodeon what 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.480
 bad is that it ended with a movie 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.240
 like the other series they did not have more 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.820
 good ideas here ends the top 5 of the 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.400
 best cartoons and now the top 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.590
 5 of the worst cartoons now not 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.690
 will be the dog lawyer since he did not come to 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.850
 work by huevÃ³n but in his replacement 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:04.280
 is a friend of youtube called 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:06.770
 cool 99 a little dog I'm with 99 I'll start 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.890
 to upload videos from youtube after and 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.550
 I will accompany in some videos to state 98 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.250
 ok let's start in the top 5 are the 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.230
 magical godparents this caricature was 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.420
 good in the first episodes like 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.190
 most of the series but it was boring that 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.680
 every time the same episodes will happen 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.450
 by jetix and disney chanel after 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.040
 they started broadcasting new episodes 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.110
 by nickelodeon 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.909
 I know they were great again 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.620
 until he came to cause that shit 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:35.689
 mold and wave wanted a baby and to 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.420
 fucking the more they changed the 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:41.689
 voice to cosmo and that's how it became a 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.180
 total shit in the top 4 is generator 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:46.430
 rex this caricature looks a lot like 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.379
 sold in the form of animation but 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.450
 for me it is very boring 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.819
 principle I thought it would be like ben 10 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.310
 but I was disappointed to see that shit 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.000
 of an idiot with a subatomic changoleon 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.000
 with superpowers 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.690
 in the top 3 are the penguins of 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.820
 Madagascar 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.220
 this series was funny at the beginning 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.230
 but standing after they started saying 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.030
 pure I catch nothing without a joke and the 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.240
 stories of the chapters do not have 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.250
 sense in the top 2 is the guy 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.290
 animated this series the first 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.480
 chapters had grace in my opinion 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.970
 but seeing it well the new chapters 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.400
 they do not make sense for example in a 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.680
 chapter where the guy meets 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.140
 a rabbit and grants wishes and I do not know 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.080
 what the fuck more in my opinion fantasize 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:35.440
 too much with the chapters and now with 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.900
 the number one and the top number one is 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.450
 an updated classic of the lengths 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.040
 but when I saw that modification 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.200
 updated I charge on the fucking wall 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.750
 and I'm talking about the roadrunner and the 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.790
 coyote computerized version is good 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.620
 the form of animation but because shit 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.930
 they did 3d when I saw the first 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.390
 chapter I realized that it was not like 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.550
 before those classics that were enough 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.470
 fun and accidents to laugh but 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.150
 in this fucking program only one and 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.730
 nothing of fucking grace 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.260
 this is just a mini show the program s 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.170
 of bunny bugs but I'll talk about that 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:12.360
 then good that has been everything wait 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.360
 Part 3 subscribe greetings
