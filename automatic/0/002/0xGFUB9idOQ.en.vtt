00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
full cap so you can't really see down

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.870 
full cap so you can't really see down
into<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.689> injectors<00:02:05.200> but<00:02:05.500> we<00:02:06.310> have<00:02:06.430> new<00:02:06.610> fuel

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
into the injectors but we have new fuel

trucks<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.940> allow<00:02:22.269> them<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.810> run<00:02:23.019> and<00:02:23.890> maintain

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
trucks to allow them to run and maintain

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.390 
trucks to allow them to run and maintain
this<00:02:25.630> maximum<00:02:26.170> power<00:02:26.350> going<00:02:26.680> upgrades<00:02:27.130> with

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
this maximum power going upgrades with

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.949 
this maximum power going upgrades with
40,000<00:02:28.030> pounds<00:02:28.299> on<00:02:28.390> knock<00:02:28.570> me<00:02:28.720> through<00:02:28.900> the

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
40,000 pounds on knock me through the

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.690 
40,000 pounds on knock me through the
four<00:02:29.140> radios<00:02:29.470> all<00:02:29.829> right<00:02:30.010> okay

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
four radios all right okay

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.819 
four radios all right okay
so<00:02:31.000> first<00:02:31.810> what<00:02:32.019> we<00:02:32.140> have<00:02:32.320> here<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:32.620> power

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
so first what we have here is power

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.250 
so first what we have here is power
steering<00:02:33.930> next<00:02:34.930> we<00:02:35.049> have<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.500> a/c<00:02:35.680> condenser

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
steering next we have the a/c condenser

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.780 
steering next we have the a/c condenser
next<00:02:38.260> we<00:02:38.380> have<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.860> low<00:02:39.040> temperature<00:02:39.579> loop

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
next we have the low temperature loop

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.060 
next we have the low temperature loop
radiator<00:02:40.299> this<00:02:41.200> low<00:02:41.440> temperature<00:02:41.620> loop

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
radiator this low temperature loop

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.130 
radiator this low temperature loop
radiator<00:02:42.549> is<00:02:42.760> responsible<00:02:43.450> for<00:02:43.480> cooling<00:02:44.019> the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
radiator is responsible for cooling the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.370 
radiator is responsible for cooling the
charge<00:02:44.410> air<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.880> transmission<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:48.519> fuel

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
charge air the transmission and the fuel

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.550 
charge air the transmission and the fuel
alright<00:02:50.380> next<00:02:50.799> we<00:02:51.100> have<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:52.690> main<00:02:52.930> radiator

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
alright next we have the main radiator

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.930 
alright next we have the main radiator
or<00:02:53.739> what<00:02:53.889> we<00:02:54.010> call<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.340> high<00:02:54.459> temperature

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
or what we call the high temperature

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.550 
or what we call the high temperature
radiator

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
radiator

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.199 
radiator
which<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.069> responsible<00:02:56.190> for<00:02:56.730> cooling<00:02:57.180> the

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
which is responsible for cooling the

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.790 
which is responsible for cooling the
engine<00:02:57.390> coolant<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.740> oil<00:02:58.920> and<00:03:00.709> keeping<00:03:01.709> a

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
engine coolant and the oil and keeping a

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.500 
engine coolant and the oil and keeping a
truck<00:03:02.010> running<00:03:02.310> up<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.550> hill<00:03:02.580> at<00:03:03.000> maximum

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
truck running up the hill at maximum

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.720 
truck running up the hill at maximum
power<00:03:03.569> so<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.560> got<00:03:04.770> a<00:03:04.800> stack<00:03:05.100> of<00:03:05.130> four<00:03:05.520> heat

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
power so you got a stack of four heat

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.040 
power so you got a stack of four heat
exchangers<00:03:06.240> right<00:03:06.420> in<00:03:06.540> front<00:03:06.720> of<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.870> truck

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
exchangers right in front of the truck

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.870 
exchangers right in front of the truck
you<00:03:07.170> get<00:03:07.410> air<00:03:07.620> back<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.069> last<00:03:08.340> one<00:03:08.640> when<00:03:08.790> it

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
you get air back to the last one when it

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.130 
you get air back to the last one when it
has<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.090> go<00:03:09.209> through<00:03:09.480> three<00:03:09.690> other<00:03:09.810> ones<00:03:10.020> is

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
has to go through three other ones is

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.640 
has to go through three other ones is
that<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> problem

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
that a problem

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.190 
that a problem
not<00:03:11.280> really<00:03:11.640> because<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:12.450> size<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.900> this<00:03:12.989> one

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
not really because the size of this one

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.780 
not really because the size of this one
is<00:03:13.260> big<00:03:13.440> enough<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:14.130> gets<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.430> little<00:03:14.580> bit

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
is big enough that it gets a little bit

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.940 
is big enough that it gets a little bit
of<00:03:14.880> first<00:03:15.120> hair<00:03:15.360> here<00:03:15.720> on<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.020> top<00:03:16.230> around

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
of first hair here on the top around

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.340 
of first hair here on the top around
this<00:03:17.160> rad<00:03:17.459> support<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.150> these<00:03:18.870> other<00:03:19.110> heat

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
this rad support and these other heat

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.710 
this rad support and these other heat
exchangers<00:03:19.950> reject<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.670> small<00:03:21.000> enough<00:03:21.239> amount

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
exchangers reject a small enough amount

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.180 
exchangers reject a small enough amount
of<00:03:21.840> heat<00:03:22.020> that<00:03:22.470> this<00:03:22.650> high-temperature

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
of heat that this high-temperature

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.130 
of heat that this high-temperature
radiator<00:03:23.730> can<00:03:24.000> still<00:03:24.239> maintain<00:03:24.450> coolant

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
radiator can still maintain coolant

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.500 
radiator can still maintain coolant
temperatures<00:03:25.560> less<00:03:25.920> than<00:03:26.160> 110<00:03:26.670> degrees<00:03:27.060> C<00:03:27.270> now

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
temperatures less than 110 degrees C now

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.509 
temperatures less than 110 degrees C now
we<00:03:27.870> talk<00:03:28.110> about<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.380> turbo<00:03:28.560> you've<00:03:28.950> got<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.340> new

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
we talk about the turbo you've got a new

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.490 
we talk about the turbo you've got a new
engine<00:03:29.850> braking<00:03:30.060> setup<00:03:30.420> right<00:03:30.630> yes<00:03:30.989> do<00:03:31.380> the

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
engine braking setup right yes do the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.410 
engine braking setup right yes do the
valves<00:03:32.220> actually<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:32.730> veins<00:03:32.910> with<00:03:33.120> turbo

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
valves actually the veins with turbo

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.790 
valves actually the veins with turbo
open<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:33.930> closed<00:03:34.140> yes<00:03:34.440> they<00:03:34.620> do

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
open and closed yes they do

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.890 
open and closed yes they do
coming<00:03:35.190> up<00:03:35.280> yeah<00:03:35.459> how<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:35.910> works<00:03:36.090> yeah<00:03:36.480> so

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
coming up yeah how that works yeah so

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.960 
coming up yeah how that works yeah so
allow<00:03:37.500> us<00:03:37.620> go<00:03:37.769> back<00:03:37.920> here<00:03:38.160> look<00:03:38.730> at<00:03:38.820> this<00:03:38.940> a

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
allow us go back here look at this a

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.320 
allow us go back here look at this a
little<00:03:39.120> bit<00:03:39.269> closer<00:03:40.160> so<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.489> veins<00:03:41.700> on<00:03:42.090> this

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
little bit closer so the veins on this

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330 
little bit closer so the veins on this
turbo<00:03:42.630> charge<00:03:42.870> are<00:03:43.019> back<00:03:43.290> here<00:03:43.590> in<00:03:43.650> determined

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
turbo charge are back here in determined

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.090 
turbo charge are back here in determined
casing<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.350> this<00:03:46.350> is<00:03:46.470> really<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.860> third

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
casing and this is really the third

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.550 
casing and this is really the third
pillar<00:03:47.310> why<00:03:47.700> we<00:03:47.880> did<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.209> 2015<00:03:48.870> truck<00:03:49.200> all

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
pillar why we did the 2015 truck all

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.440 
pillar why we did the 2015 truck all
right<00:03:49.739> first<00:03:50.310> one<00:03:50.430> was<00:03:50.700> more<00:03:50.940> advertising

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
right first one was more advertising

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.080 
right first one was more advertising
torque<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.050> horsepower<00:03:52.370> second<00:03:53.370> was<00:03:53.550> more

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
torque and horsepower second was more

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.400 
torque and horsepower second was more
altitude<00:03:54.450> performance<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:55.140> we<00:03:55.230> talked

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
altitude performance that we talked

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.350 
altitude performance that we talked
about<00:03:55.530> earlier<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.550> third<00:03:56.760> one<00:03:57.000> when

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
about earlier and the third one when

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.850 
about earlier and the third one when
you're<00:03:57.480> going<00:03:57.690> down<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.080> hill<00:03:58.230> is<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.739> have

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
you're going down the hill is to have

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.780 
you're going down the hill is to have
improved<00:04:00.079> controllability<00:04:01.079> and<00:04:01.790> confidence

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
improved controllability and confidence

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.210 
improved controllability and confidence
in<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.390> vehicle<00:04:03.840> going<00:04:04.320> down<00:04:04.590> steep<00:04:04.920> grades

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
in the vehicle going down steep grades

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.569 
in the vehicle going down steep grades
so<00:04:05.820> what<00:04:06.000> happens<00:04:06.420> is<00:04:06.720> as<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.890> driver<00:04:08.220> pushes

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
so what happens is as the driver pushes

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.270 
so what happens is as the driver pushes
the<00:04:08.910> engine<00:04:09.180> brake<00:04:09.390> button<00:04:09.799> to<00:04:10.799> maintain<00:04:11.250> a

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
the engine brake button to maintain a

7500 miles all right and how much power
are<00:06:22.820> you<00:06:22.940> actually<00:06:23.229> losing<00:06:24.229> because<00:06:24.380> of<00:06:24.620> you

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
are you actually losing because of you

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.339 
are you actually losing because of you
know<00:06:25.250> the<00:06:25.490> emissions<00:06:26.360> that<00:06:26.810> I<00:06:26.900> see<00:06:27.050> right<00:06:27.199> here

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
know the emissions that I see right here

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:28.270 
know the emissions that I see right here
right<00:06:27.470> this<00:06:27.560> is<00:06:27.680> all<00:06:27.770> the<00:06:27.830> emissions<00:06:28.159> yeah

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
right this is all the emissions yeah

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.100 
right this is all the emissions yeah
this<00:06:28.520> is<00:06:28.669> your<00:06:28.849> diesel<00:06:29.659> after-treatment

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
this is your diesel after-treatment

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.860 
this is your diesel after-treatment
system<00:06:30.139> yeah<00:06:30.889> you<00:06:31.520> have<00:06:31.729> three<00:06:32.419> basic

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
system yeah you have three basic

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.870 
system yeah you have three basic
components<00:06:32.990> here<00:06:33.590> you<00:06:33.740> have<00:06:33.919> a<00:06:33.949> after

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
components here you have a after

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.029 
components here you have a after

along<00:06:40.430> and<00:06:40.699> about<00:06:40.849> this<00:06:41.090> section<00:06:41.479> here<00:06:41.659> here's

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
along and about this section here here's

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.899 
along and about this section here here's
the<00:06:42.199> dosing<00:06:42.620> mechanism<00:06:43.220> for<00:06:43.430> it<00:06:43.520> right<00:06:43.699> here

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:43.909 
the dosing mechanism for it right here

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:45.550 
the dosing mechanism for it right here
that<00:06:44.090> comes<00:06:44.300> from<00:06:44.510> your<00:06:44.659> surya<00:06:45.020> tank<00:06:45.320> back

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 
that comes from your surya tank back

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.670 
that comes from your surya tank back
here<00:06:45.919> and<00:06:46.330> then<00:06:47.330> lastly<00:06:47.810> you<00:06:47.930> have<00:06:48.050> a<00:06:48.199> diesel

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
here and then lastly you have a diesel

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.279 
here and then lastly you have a diesel
soot<00:06:49.039> filter<00:06:49.400> that's<00:06:49.669> there<00:06:50.240> to<00:06:50.570> eliminate

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:51.289 
soot filter that's there to eliminate

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:53.290 
soot filter that's there to eliminate
the<00:06:51.650> black<00:06:51.860> smoke<00:06:52.070> that<00:06:52.340> you<00:06:52.400> see<00:06:52.669> some<00:06:52.909> coming

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.300 
the black smoke that you see some coming

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.550 
the black smoke that you see some coming
out<00:06:53.389> of<00:06:53.479> some<00:06:53.630> of<00:06:53.720> these<00:06:53.780> other<00:06:53.960> buses<00:06:54.380> around

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 
out of some of these other buses around

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.110 
out of some of these other buses around
in<00:06:54.710> the<00:06:54.770> parking<00:06:55.070> lot<00:06:55.250> you<00:06:55.520> won't<00:06:55.880> see<00:06:56.090> that

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 
in the parking lot you won't see that

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.710 
in the parking lot you won't see that
for<00:06:56.479> me<00:06:56.800> no<00:06:57.800> more<00:06:58.070> rolling<00:06:58.370> coal<00:06:58.729> yeah<00:06:59.060> yeah

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 
for me no more rolling coal yeah yeah

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.800 
for me no more rolling coal yeah yeah
now<00:07:00.490> your<00:07:01.490> original<00:07:01.880> question<00:07:02.000> was<00:07:02.389> what's

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 
now your original question was what's

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.689 
now your original question was what's
that<00:07:02.960> cost<00:07:03.229> us<00:07:03.470> in<00:07:03.650> terms<00:07:03.860> of<00:07:04.130> fuel

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:04.699 
that cost us in terms of fuel

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:07.000 
that cost us in terms of fuel
consumption<00:07:05.260> generally<00:07:06.260> there<00:07:06.590> there<00:07:06.860> is<00:07:06.979> a

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.010 
consumption generally there there is a

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.710 
consumption generally there there is a
small<00:07:07.220> penalty<00:07:07.789> for<00:07:08.030> having<00:07:08.389> all<00:07:08.570> this

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 
small penalty for having all this

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.210 
small penalty for having all this
equipment<00:07:08.990> on<00:07:09.380> here<00:07:09.560> in<00:07:09.680> terms<00:07:09.710> of<00:07:10.039> fuel

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.220 
equipment on here in terms of fuel

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.330 
equipment on here in terms of fuel
consumption<00:07:10.690> that's<00:07:11.690> a<00:07:11.889> less<00:07:12.889> than<00:07:13.070> a<00:07:13.130> couple

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340 
consumption that's a less than a couple

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.320 
consumption that's a less than a couple
percent<00:07:13.820> and<00:07:14.000> we've<00:07:14.150> overcome<00:07:14.630> that<00:07:15.229> the

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.330 
percent and we've overcome that the

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.519 
percent and we've overcome that the
improvements<00:07:17.330> in<00:07:17.389> a<00:07:17.479> combustion<00:07:17.960> system<00:07:18.349> in<00:07:18.469> a
