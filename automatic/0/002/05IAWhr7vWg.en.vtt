iphone 5 first off this case does come

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.419 
iphone 5 first off this case does come
in<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.380> whole<00:00:10.559> array<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.800> different<00:00:11.010> colors

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429

also<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:15.389> blue<00:00:15.690> which<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:15.990> really<00:00:16.139> do<00:00:16.289> like

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
also this blue which I really do like

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.939 
also this blue which I really do like
now<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.940> TPU<00:00:18.539> high-density<00:00:19.230> TPU

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
now this is a TPU high-density TPU

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.880 
now this is a TPU high-density TPU
material<00:00:20.160> which<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.270> thermoplastic<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.740> as

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
material which is a thermoplastic so as

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.939 
material which is a thermoplastic so as
you<00:00:23.039> can<00:00:23.160> see<00:00:23.340> it's<00:00:23.609> actually<00:00:24.140> it's<00:00:25.140> somewhat

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
you can see it's actually it's somewhat

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.670 
you can see it's actually it's somewhat
flexible<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.640> kind<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.970> soft<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.480> touch

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
flexible and kind of soft to the touch

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.529 
flexible and kind of soft to the touch
it's<00:00:28.680> not<00:00:28.830> overly<00:00:29.250> soft<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.210> not<00:00:30.359> too

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
it's not overly soft it and it's not too

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.880 
it's not overly soft it and it's not too
stiff<00:00:30.900> it's<00:00:31.080> really<00:00:31.289> easy<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.619> get<00:00:31.800> your

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
stiff it's really easy to get your

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.220 
stiff it's really easy to get your
device<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.520> out<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.820> case<00:00:33.090> which<00:00:34.079> is

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
device in and out of this case which is

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.470 
device in and out of this case which is
really<00:00:34.410> nice<00:00:34.850> another<00:00:35.850> thing<00:00:36.000> that's<00:00:36.149> nice<00:00:36.300> as

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
really nice another thing that's nice as

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.240 
really nice another thing that's nice as
well<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.020> I'm<00:00:37.410> not<00:00:37.739> sure<00:00:37.770> if<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.040> really

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
well and I'm not sure if you can really

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.799 
well and I'm not sure if you can really
see<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.850> video<00:00:38.940> too<00:00:39.149> much<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:39.660> it's

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
see it in the video too much but it's

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.090 
see it in the video too much but it's
just<00:00:39.930> something<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.230> noticed<00:00:40.410> about<00:00:40.739> this

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
just something I noticed about this

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.540 
just something I noticed about this
thermoplastic<00:00:42.059> material<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:43.040> it<00:00:44.040> kind<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.370> has

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
thermoplastic material is it kind of has

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.600 
thermoplastic material is it kind of has
like<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.140> metallic<00:00:46.140> effect<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:46.950> which<00:00:47.340> looks

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
like a metallic effect to it which looks

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.910 
like a metallic effect to it which looks
really<00:00:47.879> good<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.030> my<00:00:48.300> opinion<00:00:48.329> also<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.649> has<00:00:49.890> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
really good in my opinion also it has a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.119 
really good in my opinion also it has a
high<00:00:50.309> oil<00:00:50.390> resistant<00:00:51.590> material<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.829> it's

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
high oil resistant material so that it's

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.740 
high oil resistant material so that it's
not<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.489> absorb<00:00:53.670> any<00:00:54.030> oil<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.600> if<00:00:54.690> you

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
not going to absorb any oil so if you

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.150 
not going to absorb any oil so if you
guys<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:55.050> cases<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.530> gets<00:00:55.649> smudges<00:00:56.010> all<00:00:56.129> over

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
guys have cases it gets smudges all over

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.130 
guys have cases it gets smudges all over
them<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:57.180> case<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.570> not<00:00:57.600> going<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.960> do<00:00:58.109> that

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
them this case is not going to do that

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.080 
them this case is not going to do that
due<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.680> material<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.820> let's<00:00:59.940> go<00:01:00.059> ahead

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
due to the material so let's go ahead

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.910 
due to the material so let's go ahead
and<00:01:00.359> let's<00:01:00.780> put<00:01:01.050> our<00:01:01.079> device<00:01:01.350> into<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.710> case

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
and let's put our device into the case

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.429 
and let's put our device into the case
and<00:01:01.949> I'll<00:01:02.309> tell<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.640> bit<00:01:02.879> more<00:01:02.910> about<00:01:03.059> it

and I'll tell you a bit more about it
putting<00:01:04.439> your<00:01:04.470> device<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.129> really<00:01:05.700> quite

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
can see just pull down one of the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.630 
can see just pull down one of the
corners<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.920> your<00:01:14.040> device<00:01:14.220> will<00:01:14.369> come<00:01:14.520> right

case<00:01:17.040> I've<00:01:17.250> reviewed<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.700> lot<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.939> cases<00:01:18.119> that

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
case I've reviewed a lot of cases that

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.420 
case I've reviewed a lot of cases that
really<00:01:18.600> suck<00:01:18.960> kidding<00:01:19.710> your<00:01:19.830> device<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.280> and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
out so let's do a run-through of the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.230 
out so let's do a run-through of the
outside<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.830> case<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.400> see<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
outside of the case as you can see the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.210 
outside of the case as you can see the
volume<00:01:24.630> up<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.110> down<00:01:25.140> buttons<00:01:25.530> are<00:01:25.830> covered

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
volume up and down buttons are covered

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.429 
volume up and down buttons are covered
the<00:01:26.640> tactic<00:01:27.060> feedback<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.780> these<00:01:27.930> buttons<00:01:28.170> is

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
the tactic feedback of these buttons is

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.080 
the tactic feedback of these buttons is
really<00:01:28.650> quite<00:01:28.829> fantastic<00:01:29.040> they're<00:01:29.670> easy<00:01:29.880> to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
really quite fantastic they're easy to

what<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.709> like<00:02:10.979> about<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.250> case<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.550> how<00:02:11.970> thin

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
what I like about this case is how thin

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.520 
what I like about this case is how thin
it<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.810> does<00:02:12.930> not<00:02:13.080> add

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
it is it does not add

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.460 
it is it does not add
any<00:02:13.890> thickness<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.670> device<00:02:14.940> at<00:02:15.150> all<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
any thickness to device at all and the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.620 
any thickness to device at all and the
surprising<00:02:17.069> thing<00:02:17.100> is<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.550> this<00:02:18.240> case<00:02:18.450> will

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
surprising thing is that this case will

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.260 
surprising thing is that this case will
protect<00:02:18.990> your<00:02:19.140> device<00:02:19.230> up<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.370> five<00:02:20.910> foot

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
protect your device up to a five foot

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.930 
protect your device up to a five foot
drop<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.890> due<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.400> material

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
drop and that is due to this material

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.210 
drop and that is due to this material
this<00:02:24.060> thermoplastic<00:02:24.930> it's<00:02:24.959> a<00:02:25.290> it's<00:02:26.010> it's

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
this thermoplastic it's a it's it's

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.640 
this thermoplastic it's a it's it's
really<00:02:26.490> quite<00:02:26.670> resilient<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.569> it's<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.440> very

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
really quite resilient and it's a very

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.710 
really quite resilient and it's a very
nice<00:02:28.740> material<00:02:29.160> so<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:30.060> will<00:02:30.239> get<00:02:30.330> protection

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
nice material so you will get protection

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.930 
nice material so you will get protection

up your device at all the case is going

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.780 
up your device at all the case is going
