00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
like so and just check my levels we can

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.410 
like so and just check my levels we can
see<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:40.859> instantly<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.729> my<00:01:41.909> levels<00:01:42.210> are<00:01:42.299> at

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
see here instantly that my levels are at

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.020 
see here instantly that my levels are at
far<00:01:42.659> too<00:01:42.899> far<00:01:43.859> too<00:01:43.889> high<00:01:44.130> at<00:01:44.249> the<00:01:44.310> moment<00:01:44.609> so

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
far too far too high at the moment so

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.340 
far too far too high at the moment so
I'm<00:01:45.090> going<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.299> actually<00:01:45.600> back<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:46.079> down

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
I'm going to actually back this down

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.230 
I'm going to actually back this down
until<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.799> get<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.039> decent<00:01:47.579> level<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:47.999> this<00:01:48.090> is

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
until I get a decent level and this is

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.840 
until I get a decent level and this is
represented<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.200> halo<00:01:49.619> around<00:01:50.459> the<00:01:50.639> game

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850

input<00:01:51.810> control<00:01:52.289> when<00:01:53.159> we've<00:01:53.280> got<00:01:53.429> a<00:01:53.459> green

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
input control when we've got a green

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:55.550 
input control when we've got a green
signal<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.569> means<00:01:54.719> it's<00:01:54.959> a<00:01:55.020> good<00:01:55.319> quality

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
signal that means it's a good quality

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.959 
signal that means it's a good quality
recording<00:01:56.249> signal<00:01:56.670> if<00:01:56.999> it's<00:01:57.299> red<00:01:58.759> that's<00:01:59.759> too

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
recording signal if it's red that's too

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.519 
recording signal if it's red that's too
much<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.329> we<00:02:00.420> need<00:02:00.569> to<00:02:00.659> back<00:02:00.840> off<00:02:02.329> ok<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.539> go<00:02:04.289> back

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:04.529 
much so we need to back off ok I go back

want to add another track now I can go

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.759 
want to add another track now I can go
to<00:02:47.440> my<00:02:47.650> instruments<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.730> then<00:02:49.569> choose<00:02:49.870> from

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
to my instruments and then choose from

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.369 
to my instruments and then choose from
the<00:02:50.950> various<00:02:51.549> different<00:02:51.819> options<00:02:52.180> here<00:02:52.450> we

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
the various different options here we

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.890 
the various different options here we
can<00:02:53.530> then<00:02:53.650> go<00:02:53.799> for<00:02:54.010> audio<00:02:54.340> recorder<00:02:54.909> and<00:02:55.120> this

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
can then go for audio recorder and this

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.319 
can then go for audio recorder and this
time<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.500> can<00:02:57.069> plug<00:02:57.310> my<00:02:57.459> microphone<00:02:58.060> directly

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
time I can plug my microphone directly

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.449 
time I can plug my microphone directly
into<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.840> XLR<00:02:59.230> socket<00:02:59.739> on<00:02:59.889> the<00:03:00.069> front<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.370> the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
itraq solo make sure I'm going to record

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.920 
itraq solo make sure I'm going to record
in<00:03:03.129> from<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.519> left<00:03:03.730> channel<00:03:03.970> or<00:03:04.239> channel<00:03:04.690> one

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
if you look at the front panel we'll see

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.199

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.589 
also got a 48 volt phantom power switch
as<00:03:30.069> well<00:03:30.250> which<00:03:30.430> lets<00:03:30.639> us<00:03:30.760> use<00:03:30.790> condenser

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
as well which lets us use condenser

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.089 
as well which lets us use condenser
microphones<00:03:32.109> and<00:03:32.319> that<00:03:32.470> sort<00:03:32.680> of<00:03:32.709> thing<00:03:32.919> for
