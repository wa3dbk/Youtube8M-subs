material and I felt I must get in the
studio<00:00:28.929> and<00:00:29.339> and<00:00:30.339> get<00:00:30.970> some<00:00:31.179> of<00:00:31.269> these<00:00:31.359> day<00:00:31.630> out

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
about the songs mostly I thought I will

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.180 
about the songs mostly I thought I will
start<00:00:39.010> off<00:00:39.160> thinking<00:00:39.910> about<00:00:40.360> a<00:00:40.620> song<00:00:41.620> if<00:00:41.950> it's

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
start off thinking about a song if it's

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.030 
start off thinking about a song if it's
a<00:00:42.310> guitar<00:00:42.670> part<00:00:43.000> that<00:00:43.180> I<00:00:43.210> like<00:00:44.040> not

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
a guitar part that I like not

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.800 
a guitar part that I like not
necessarily<00:00:45.460> rift<00:00:45.790> just<00:00:46.090> might<00:00:46.300> it<00:00:46.480> might<00:00:46.630> be

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:46.810 
necessarily rift just might it might be

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.230 
necessarily rift just might it might be
just<00:00:46.840> some<00:00:47.140> changes<00:00:47.680> or<00:00:47.860> what<00:00:47.980> but<00:00:48.910> something

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.240 
just some changes or what but something

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.650 
just some changes or what but something
that<00:00:49.390> I<00:00:49.890> really<00:00:50.890> enjoy<00:00:51.070> playing<00:00:51.370> its<00:00:52.210> that's

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
that I really enjoy playing its that's

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.130 
that I really enjoy playing its that's
the<00:00:52.840> first<00:00:53.020> thing<00:00:53.200> and<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:55.420> then<00:00:55.780> maybe<00:00:55.960> I'll

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
the first thing and and then maybe I'll

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.490 
the first thing and and then maybe I'll
come<00:00:56.260> up<00:00:56.320> with<00:00:56.440> a<00:00:56.820> melody<00:00:57.820> top<00:00:58.060> line<00:00:58.300> and<00:00:58.500> and

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
come up with a melody top line and and

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.340 
come up with a melody top line and and
think<00:01:00.340> about<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.670> lyric<00:01:02.100> usually<00:01:03.100> if<00:01:03.809> if<00:01:04.809> I'm

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
think about the lyric usually if if I'm

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.899 
think about the lyric usually if if I'm
really<00:01:05.590> enjoying<00:01:05.799> working<00:01:06.340> with<00:01:06.670> it<00:01:06.790> it

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
really enjoying working with it it

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.840 
really enjoying working with it it
doesn't<00:01:07.119> take<00:01:07.390> very<00:01:07.420> long<00:01:08.640> sometimes<00:01:09.640> you

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
doesn't take very long sometimes you

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.410 
doesn't take very long sometimes you
know<00:01:09.880> you<00:01:09.999> can<00:01:10.780> wait<00:01:10.960> weeks<00:01:11.770> for<00:01:11.950> a<00:01:12.520> lyric<00:01:12.820> idea

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
know you can wait weeks for a lyric idea

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.969 
know you can wait weeks for a lyric idea
though<00:01:13.600> I<00:01:13.869> think<00:01:14.679> lyrics<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:16.479> to<00:01:16.799> they<00:01:17.799> have

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
though I think lyrics have to they have

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.440 
though I think lyrics have to they have
to<00:01:18.130> mean<00:01:18.310> something<00:01:18.759> to<00:01:18.789> the<00:01:19.060> person<00:01:19.420> that

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
to mean something to the person that

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.429 
to mean something to the person that
that's<00:01:19.840> writing<00:01:20.170> it<00:01:20.499> and<00:01:20.710> and<00:01:21.700> I<00:01:22.359> think<00:01:22.439> when

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
that's writing it and and I think when

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.679 
that's writing it and and I think when
you've<00:01:23.590> written<00:01:23.770> a<00:01:23.920> lot<00:01:24.039> of<00:01:24.189> songs<00:01:24.399> you<00:01:24.789> you

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
you've written a lot of songs you you

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.090 
you've written a lot of songs you you
have<00:01:25.929> to<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:28.450> they<00:01:28.689> really<00:01:28.840> have<00:01:29.020> avoid<00:01:29.649> what

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
have to if they really have avoid what

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.489 
have to if they really have avoid what
you've<00:01:30.670> already<00:01:30.939> written<00:01:31.149> if<00:01:31.329> you<00:01:31.450> can<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.999> and

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:34.499 
you've already written if you can so and

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:37.379 
you've already written if you can so and
and<00:01:35.499> the<00:01:35.649> other<00:01:35.770> thing<00:01:35.859> is<00:01:36.039> he<00:01:36.389> constantly

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:37.389 
and the other thing is he constantly

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:39.809 
and the other thing is he constantly
tried<00:01:37.749> to<00:01:37.899> make<00:01:38.049> it<00:01:38.200> more<00:01:38.350> poetic<00:01:39.009> a<00:01:39.189> little

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
tried to make it more poetic a little

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.139 
tried to make it more poetic a little
luuk<00:01:40.119> and<00:01:40.499> stay<00:01:41.499> away<00:01:41.710> from<00:01:41.740> clichés<00:01:42.340> which<00:01:42.670> is

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
luuk and stay away from clichés which is

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:44.969 
luuk and stay away from clichés which is
probably<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.569> hardest<00:01:43.659> part<00:01:44.139> of<00:01:44.530> writing

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
probably the hardest part of writing

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:45.630 
probably the hardest part of writing
lyrics
