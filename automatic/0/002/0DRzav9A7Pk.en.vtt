I<00:01:10.200> think<00:01:10.700> 2011<00:01:11.700> with<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.060> model<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.580> Ford

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
I think 2011 with that model and Ford

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.320 
I think 2011 with that model and Ford
did<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:16.340> technical<00:01:17.340> service<00:01:17.700> bulletin<00:01:20.330> repair

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
did a technical service bulletin repair

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.350 
did a technical service bulletin repair
kind<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.870> thing<00:01:22.200> where<00:01:22.550> they<00:01:23.550> suggested

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
kind of thing where they suggested

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.950

changing out the transmission fluid from

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.670 
changing out the transmission fluid from
what<00:01:28.770> was<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> lighter<00:01:30.720> viscosity

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
what was in it to a lighter viscosity

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.440 
what was in it to a lighter viscosity
fluid<00:01:32.070> because<00:01:32.370> this<00:01:32.580> is<00:01:32.730> primarily<00:01:33.030> a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
fluid because this is primarily a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.130 
fluid because this is primarily a
cold-weather<00:01:34.350> issue<00:01:35.340> or<00:01:35.940> a<00:01:36.000> cold<00:01:36.780> engine

when<00:02:11.510> I<00:02:11.540> first<00:02:11.900> got<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.260> car<00:02:12.440> but<00:02:12.770> after<00:02:13.130> about

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
when I first got the car but after about

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.860 
when I first got the car but after about
six<00:02:13.670> months<00:02:13.760> I<00:02:14.390> started<00:02:15.140> noticing<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:17.150> bit<00:02:17.720> of

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
six months I started noticing a bit of

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.559 
six months I started noticing a bit of
notch<00:02:18.349> enos<00:02:18.770> going<00:02:19.489> from<00:02:19.700> first<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.120> second

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
notch enos going from first to second

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.050 
notch enos going from first to second
especially<00:02:21.260> when<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.560> engine<00:02:21.950> was<00:02:21.980> cold<00:02:22.459> and

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.610 

when<00:02:26.060> when<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.569> engine<00:02:26.870> got<00:02:27.020> warmed<00:02:27.410> up<00:02:27.500> a

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
when when the engine got warmed up a

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.490 
when when the engine got warmed up a
little<00:02:27.650> bit<00:02:28.720> I'm<00:02:29.720> assuming<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.290> the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
little bit I'm assuming that the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.199 
little bit I'm assuming that the
transmission<00:02:31.130> fluid<00:02:31.280> got<00:02:31.670> warmed<00:02:32.000> up<00:02:32.120> a

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
transmission fluid got warmed up a

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.339 
transmission fluid got warmed up a
little<00:02:32.239> bit<00:02:32.569> as<00:02:32.780> well<00:02:33.319> and<00:02:33.620> that<00:02:34.550> issue<00:02:35.349> kind

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
little bit as well and that issue kind

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.790 
little bit as well and that issue kind
of<00:02:36.500> disappeared<00:02:37.150> so<00:02:38.150> what<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.170> have<00:02:39.470> learned

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
of disappeared so what I have learned

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.500 
of disappeared so what I have learned
and<00:02:40.190> what<00:02:40.730> I<00:02:40.760> have<00:02:40.970> started<00:02:41.209> doing<00:02:41.390> is<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:43.510> start

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510

to<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.110> point<00:03:10.410> where<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.280> shift<00:03:11.700> from<00:03:11.940> first<00:03:12.240> a

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
to a point where that shift from first a

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.130 
to a point where that shift from first a
second<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:13.110> was<00:03:13.260> smooth<00:03:13.680> as<00:03:14.010> butter<00:03:15.140> another

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
second that was smooth as butter another

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.220 
second that was smooth as butter another
thing<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.970> need<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.240> keep<00:03:18.420> in<00:03:18.570> mind<00:03:18.840> is

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
thing that you need to keep in mind is

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.700 
thing that you need to keep in mind is
that<00:03:19.590> if<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:19.980> get<00:03:20.160> lazy<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:22.290> don't<00:03:22.320> push

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
that if you get lazy and you don't push

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.860 
that if you get lazy and you don't push
the<00:03:23.130> clutch<00:03:23.370> pedal<00:03:24.090> all<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.450> way<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:24.720> the

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
the clutch pedal all the way to the

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.050 
the clutch pedal all the way to the
floor<00:03:24.990> like<00:03:25.830> even<00:03:26.280> an<00:03:26.459> inch<00:03:27.060> above<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.170> floor

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
floor like even an inch above the floor

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.830 
floor like even an inch above the floor
that<00:03:30.060> has<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.420> tendency<00:03:31.140> of<00:03:32.300> resulting<00:03:33.300> in<00:03:33.570> a

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
that has a tendency of resulting in a

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.210 
that has a tendency of resulting in a
nachi<00:03:34.740> shift<00:03:35.580> so<00:03:36.510> if<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:37.410> keep<00:03:37.620> those<00:03:37.950> two

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
nachi shift so if you keep those two

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.110 
nachi shift so if you keep those two
things<00:03:38.250> in<00:03:38.700> mind<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.770> lot<00:03:40.770> of<00:03:41.130> your<00:03:41.400> notch<00:03:41.670> enos

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
things in mind a lot of your notch enos

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.120 
things in mind a lot of your notch enos
issues<00:03:43.160> from<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.370> first<00:03:44.640> to<00:03:44.880> second<00:03:45.330> shift

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
issues from the first to second shift

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.530 
issues from the first to second shift
will<00:03:47.130> pretty<00:03:47.310> much<00:03:47.430> go<00:03:47.820> away<00:03:48.060> on<00:03:48.330> their<00:03:48.480> own

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
will pretty much go away on their own

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.020 
will pretty much go away on their own
see<00:03:49.080> that<00:03:49.230> was<00:03:49.380> another<00:03:49.650> shift<00:03:50.250> from<00:03:50.580> first<00:03:50.880> a

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
see that was another shift from first a

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.560 
see that was another shift from first a
second<00:03:51.450> smooth<00:03:51.900> as<00:03:52.080> butter<00:03:52.110> once<00:03:52.950> again<00:03:53.310> so<00:03:54.239> I

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
second smooth as butter once again so I

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.550 
second smooth as butter once again so I
think<00:03:56.120> if<00:03:57.120> you've<00:03:57.390> got<00:03:57.570> an<00:03:57.690> MTA<00:03:58.080> t2

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
think if you've got an MTA t2

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.520 
think if you've got an MTA t2
transmission<00:03:59.340> in<00:03:59.489> your<00:03:59.640> Mustang<00:04:00.260> give<00:04:01.260> those

transmission in your Mustang give those
two<00:04:01.860> suggestions<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:03.180> try<00:04:03.570> and<00:04:03.900> see<00:04:04.680> if<00:04:04.739> it

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
two suggestions a try and see if it

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.630 
two suggestions a try and see if it
makes<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.100> difference<00:04:05.130> for<00:04:05.670> you<00:04:05.820> if<00:04:06.600> not<00:04:07.640> then
