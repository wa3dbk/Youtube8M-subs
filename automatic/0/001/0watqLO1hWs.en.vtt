 or that in 40 names you have to change and 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.920
 I'm a designer from the shots 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.690
 and half strategist of networks in naughty 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.690
 dog for sofas fabrics 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.380
 here 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.500
 in the covers is the story of two 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.390
 joel honey characters me in a world in 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.320
 the one that has been infected to all the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.990
 world population 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.970
 cordis our world we exist 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.040
 we got the idea about what would happen if the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.510
 humanity was attacked by this fungus and 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.160
 the answer that the player will have the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.110
 game is that the population has almost been 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.880
 exterminated in the history of the last 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.650
 of us begins 20 years after the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.240
 infection took place and only about 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.040
 few manage to survive in areas of 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.480
 quarantine controlled by the military 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.700
 under an aesthetic martial law 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.230
 that's where we'll find joel a 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.940
 Survivor that is dedicated to the market 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.410
 black making decisions that anybody 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.479
 of us would take if it were about 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.220
 survive then it will be the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.390
 In charge of taking Elijah to the hands of 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.280
 a group of renegades called 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.110
 fireflies but this is only the 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.060
 beginning of the story from there 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.470
 you will see how is the trip of both as 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.850
 the plans change when they meet 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.380
 with other survivors who try to 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.729
 take away what they have and how 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.910
 Your relationship evolves to the end 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.910
 of the game 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.200
 do not 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.200
 or not 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.770
 we wanted the players had to 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.330
 really survive in this world there 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.860
 have to think that 20 years have passed since 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.780
 the infection and that's why almost all 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.280
 the resources have disappeared and remains 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.870
 very little in this world and that's why 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.400
 players are going to have to explore a lot 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.080
 to find things that will help them 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.760
 face your enemies the more 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.320
 explore more you will learn about this 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.330
 world and you will find things with which 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.190
 create other tools like weapons or 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.360
 first aid kits that will help us in 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.030
 our mission to survive the 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.830
 infected you can choose between being more 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.180
 defensive offensive reacting to the 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.180
 hostility that you have in your way 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.100
 return 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.819
 throughout our mission with joel 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.980
 we will buy with the help of characters 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.019
 feminine as the man they are 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.239
 non-playable characters controlled by 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.249
 he and he, for example, have not known the 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.379
 world without the infection and for it is 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:03.569
 very important to feel useful helping 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.760
 joel she is small and can enter by 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.829
 some areas for which he can not 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.840
 help you with objects that allow 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.670
 unlock the road but the relationship 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.040
 it's also the other way around since we 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.900
 as joel we will teach him and even what 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.269
 point can be the human condition 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.370
 when a person is taken to the 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.989
 limits of survival we have 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.239
 I tried to make the relationship as much as possible 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.859
 possible integrated and we'll even see him 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.430
 and help in combat 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.430
 sometimes 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.800
 rigau 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.800
 wanda 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.350
 all those games are characters we have 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.020
 created a new world for him and 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.940
 we wanted to see what limit decisions 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.560
 both the volunteers and the ones that you see 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.180
 forced to take that assumes that the 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.040
 character has to change and also his 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.510
 relationship with the other protagonists that 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.510
 is what motivated us to create this game 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.120
 and of course 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.060
 whenever we have launched a game we have 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.950
 thought that we had taken to the limit 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.379
 the potential of playstation 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.150
 we really thought about it and we said no 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.949
 we can do nothing else we have tried 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.600
 always be the most ambitious that 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.010
 we could with each project and the 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.720
 incredible the group that works in 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.449
 naughty dog â€‹â€‹has always looked for the 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.710
 ways to get the engine to maximum 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.930
 topics like the eia 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.120
 the graphics so we're stuck 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.660
 very close to the limits of ds3 with 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.660
 our project 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:43.429
 and the soup would have been different 

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:46.189
 we know playstation3 very well and 

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:47.839
 we know how to work is the 4 just 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:50.119
 become known with a very technology 

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:52.039
 powerful and we are sure that in the 

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:54.999
 study we will be able to get the most out of it 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.999
 restaurant 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:08.159
 I played a lot the multiplayer of the 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.840
 last of us and it will be very fun not 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.159
 we can count too much because we are 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.800
 very focused on explaining the way 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:15.659
 individual 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.189
 of characters and scenarios but if 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:18.990
 look how this individual mode will be 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:21.120
 what will the tension be like 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.280
 resources within our reach the system of 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.360
 exploration and creation do not mix with 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.830
 the idea of fighting with others 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.990
 survivors controlled by the 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.389
 artificial intelligence you can make 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.710
 an idea of how the multiplayer will be 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.710
 to be something very special and lic 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.460
 ah 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:51.240
 we hope that the presentation we see 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.240
 in the act of June 14 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.800
 wherever he says carriers 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.800
 good 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.770
 or not 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.370
 very high 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.720
 in fifa natura
