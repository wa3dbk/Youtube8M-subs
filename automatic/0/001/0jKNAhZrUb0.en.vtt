alarm systems you can get access to

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.280 
alarm systems you can get access to
security<00:02:34.610> hubs<00:02:34.940> cameras<00:02:35.540> can<00:02:36.320> actually<00:02:37.310> turn

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
security hubs cameras can actually turn

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.860 
security hubs cameras can actually turn
internet<00:02:39.290> or<00:02:39.590> century<00:02:40.340> butts<00:02:40.550> against<00:02:41.420> your

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
internet or century butts against your

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.590 
internet or century butts against your
enemies<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.500> capture<00:02:43.130> hacking<00:02:44.090> augmentation

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
enemies the capture hacking augmentation

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.410 
enemies the capture hacking augmentation
will<00:02:45.260> allow<00:02:45.530> you<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:46.100> act<00:02:46.430> different<00:02:46.850> systems

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
will allow you to act different systems

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.320 
will allow you to act different systems
so<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:48.050> higher<00:02:48.290> your<00:02:48.560> capture<00:02:49.120> ability<00:02:50.120> is

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
so the higher your capture ability is

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.510 
so the higher your capture ability is
the<00:02:50.780> eyelid<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.470> more<00:02:51.650> high-level<00:02:51.920> security

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
the eyelid the more high-level security

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.000 
the eyelid the more high-level security
systems<00:02:53.270> you<00:02:53.420> will<00:02:53.570> be<00:02:53.750> able<00:02:53.990> to<00:02:54.380> act<00:02:54.530> you<00:02:54.860> will

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
systems you will be able to act you will

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.699 
systems you will be able to act you will
be<00:02:55.160> also<00:02:55.310> able<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:56.030> have<00:02:56.150> some<00:02:56.630> abilities<00:02:57.470> that

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
be also able to have some abilities that

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.400 
be also able to have some abilities that
will<00:02:57.890> let<00:02:58.160> you<00:02:58.430> decrease<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.600> probabilities

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
will let you decrease the probabilities

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.290 
will let you decrease the probabilities
of<00:03:00.440> being<00:03:00.830> depicted<00:03:01.070> every<00:03:01.550> time<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:01.880> capture

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
of being depicted every time you capture

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.660 
of being depicted every time you capture
and<00:03:02.480> now<00:03:02.600> Gil<00:03:02.930> also<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:03.739> have<00:03:03.980> an<00:03:04.130> ability<00:03:04.280> that

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
and now Gil also I have an ability that

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.090 
and now Gil also I have an ability that
allow<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:05.269> to<00:03:05.300> make<00:03:05.840> analysis<00:03:06.590> of<00:03:06.800> the
