00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
can i viewers this is Troy from Twitter

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.640 
can i viewers this is Troy from Twitter
it's<00:00:10.120> channel<00:00:10.480> I<00:00:11.940> thought<00:00:12.940> I'd<00:00:13.090> try<00:00:13.930> and<00:00:14.230> get

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
it's channel I thought I'd try and get

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.940 
it's channel I thought I'd try and get
this<00:00:15.270> mechanical<00:00:16.270> TV<00:00:16.630> set<00:00:16.960> up<00:00:17.050> as<00:00:17.260> quickly<00:00:17.680> as

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
this mechanical TV set up as quickly as

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.640 
this mechanical TV set up as quickly as
possible<00:00:18.070> just<00:00:18.700> for<00:00:18.760> the<00:00:18.910> sake<00:00:19.150> of<00:00:19.529> testing<00:00:20.529> it

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
possible just for the sake of testing it

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.170 
possible just for the sake of testing it
and<00:00:20.860> to<00:00:21.220> see<00:00:21.490> if<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:22.660> does<00:00:22.930> anything<00:00:24.180> useful

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
and to see if it does anything useful

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.500 
and to see if it does anything useful
and<00:00:25.630> remotely<00:00:26.080> displaying<00:00:27.060> at<00:00:28.060> least<00:00:28.330> a

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
and remotely displaying at least a

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.710 
and remotely displaying at least a
rudimentary<00:00:28.690> picture<00:00:31.559> anyhow<00:00:32.559> so<00:00:33.129> I<00:00:33.160> thought

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
rudimentary picture anyhow so I thought

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.840 
rudimentary picture anyhow so I thought
having<00:00:34.720> the<00:00:34.930> circuits<00:00:35.379> on<00:00:35.500> breadboard<00:00:35.800> as<00:00:36.690> is

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
having the circuits on breadboard as is

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.190 
having the circuits on breadboard as is
set<00:00:39.850> it<00:00:39.970> up<00:00:40.059> in<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:42.610> a<00:00:42.730> good<00:00:42.880> enough<00:00:43.120> way<00:00:43.390> to<00:00:43.450> at

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
set it up in in a good enough way to at

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.110 
set it up in in a good enough way to at
least<00:00:44.410> test<00:00:44.829> it<00:00:45.540> so<00:00:46.540> here<00:00:46.930> we<00:00:46.960> have<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:48.399> nick

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
least test it so here we have the nick

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.979 
least test it so here we have the nick
of<00:00:49.450> disk<00:00:50.110> spinning<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.820> we<00:00:52.059> have<00:00:52.180> our<00:00:52.360> Bank<00:00:52.840> of

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
of disk spinning and we have our Bank of

00:00:52.989 --> 00:01:01.470 
of disk spinning and we have our Bank of
LEDs<00:00:53.559> as<00:00:54.100> they<00:00:54.760> are<00:00:56.370> blinking<00:00:57.370> away<00:01:00.239> as<00:01:01.239> they

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
LEDs as they are blinking away as they

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.540 
LEDs as they are blinking away as they
are<00:01:01.629> doing<00:01:02.340> producing<00:01:04.050> the<00:01:05.460> variation<00:01:06.460> of

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
are doing producing the variation of

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.900 
are doing producing the variation of
light<00:01:07.539> pulses<00:01:08.200> to<00:01:09.210> produce<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.479> picture<00:01:11.910> now

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
light pulses to produce the picture now

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.770 
light pulses to produce the picture now
I've<00:01:13.210> seen<00:01:13.680> nothing<00:01:14.680> really<00:01:15.580> is<00:01:15.909> happening<00:01:16.600> as

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
I've seen nothing really is happening as

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.539 
I've seen nothing really is happening as
at<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.260> moment<00:01:17.710> cuz<00:01:18.570> but<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.750> LEDs<00:01:20.560> as<00:01:20.890> they

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
at the moment cuz but the LEDs as they

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.260 
at the moment cuz but the LEDs as they
are<00:01:22.080> under<00:01:23.080> fused<00:01:23.890> so<00:01:24.430> you<00:01:24.670> just<00:01:24.880> pretty<00:01:25.119> much

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
are under fused so you just pretty much

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.820 
are under fused so you just pretty much
seen<00:01:26.220> lids<00:01:27.220> showing<00:01:27.759> up<00:01:27.939> through<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.830> holes

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
seen lids showing up through the holes

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.179 
seen lids showing up through the holes
of<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.220> disk<00:01:30.490> that<00:01:30.880> I've<00:01:31.090> punched<00:01:31.450> through

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
of the disk that I've punched through

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.010 
of the disk that I've punched through
just<00:01:33.189> about<00:01:33.280> I'd<00:01:33.909> safe<00:01:34.180> they<00:01:34.479> two<00:01:34.540> holes

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
just about I'd safe they two holes

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.270 
just about I'd safe they two holes
haven't<00:01:35.530> exactly<00:01:35.770> counted<00:01:36.430> and<00:01:36.580> yet<00:01:38.070> they<00:01:39.070> the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
haven't exactly counted and yet they the

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.030 
haven't exactly counted and yet they the
waves<00:01:39.460> as<00:01:39.820> you<00:01:39.970> can<00:01:40.119> see<00:01:40.560> each<00:01:41.560> hole

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
waves as you can see each hole

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.340 
waves as you can see each hole
progressively<00:01:44.159> crossing<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.340> LEDs<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:47.110> got

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
progressively crossing the LEDs you got

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.149 
progressively crossing the LEDs you got
you<00:01:47.500> can<00:01:47.650> see<00:01:47.759> it's<00:01:48.759> um

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
you can see it's um

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.179 
you can see it's um

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.940 
is how the original their televisor
worked

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
worked

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.560

the<00:02:02.950> pictures<00:02:03.310> are<00:02:03.490> progressively<00:02:04.270> scanned

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
the pictures are progressively scanned

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.960 
the pictures are progressively scanned
vertically<00:02:05.470> and<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.909> Raza<00:02:07.890> scans<00:02:08.890> from<00:02:09.340> yeah

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
vertically and the Raza scans from yeah

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.940

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.970 

yeah<00:02:16.940> once<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.120> get<00:02:18.270> this<00:02:18.470> set<00:02:19.470> up<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.680> bit<00:02:19.830> more

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
yeah once I get this set up a bit more

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
yeah once I get this set up a bit more
properly<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.599> Bank<00:02:21.989> of<00:02:22.140> LEDs<00:02:24.680> put<00:02:25.680> into<00:02:25.950> a

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
properly and the Bank of LEDs put into a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.460 
properly and the Bank of LEDs put into a
little<00:02:27.000> housing<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:28.010> in<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:33.170> translucent<00:02:34.170> to

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
little housing and in a translucent to

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.490 
little housing and in a translucent to
opaque<00:02:36.050> type<00:02:37.050> arm<00:02:37.350> cover<00:02:37.770> over<00:02:38.250> in<00:02:38.340> which<00:02:39.500> this

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
opaque type arm cover over in which this

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.970 
opaque type arm cover over in which this
which<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.459> say<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.480> plastic<00:02:43.349> bag<00:02:43.650> was<00:02:43.890> just<00:02:44.250> by

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
which I say a plastic bag was just by

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.740 
which I say a plastic bag was just by
guy<00:02:46.980> named<00:02:47.390> Daniel<00:02:48.390> gossip<00:02:49.580> so<00:02:50.580> you'll<00:02:50.819> give

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
guy named Daniel gossip so you'll give

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.910 
guy named Daniel gossip so you'll give
that<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.959> go<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.380> see<00:02:52.620> how<00:02:53.580> when<00:02:53.850> we<00:02:53.970> get<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.920> nice

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
that a go and see how when we get a nice

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.740 
that a go and see how when we get a nice
evenly<00:02:56.640> spread<00:02:57.180> light<00:02:57.750> for<00:02:58.319> this<00:02:58.610> experiment

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
evenly spread light for this experiment

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.110 
evenly spread light for this experiment
and<00:03:00.750> also<00:03:00.930> another<00:03:01.560> thing<00:03:01.799> too<00:03:02.100> with<00:03:02.910> the

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
and also another thing too with the

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.400 
and also another thing too with the
motor<00:03:03.630> setup<00:03:03.989> I<00:03:05.120> think<00:03:06.120> maybe<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.810> disk<00:03:07.049> ain't

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
motor setup I think maybe the disk ain't

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.820 
motor setup I think maybe the disk ain't
spinning<00:03:07.980> fast<00:03:08.910> enough<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:10.760> produce<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:12.150> decent

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
spinning fast enough to produce a decent

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.449 
spinning fast enough to produce a decent
scan<00:03:13.830> to<00:03:14.250> reproduce<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.180> picture<00:03:16.160> so<00:03:17.160> that's

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
scan to reproduce the picture so that's

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.130 
scan to reproduce the picture so that's
something<00:03:18.180> else<00:03:18.510> I'm<00:03:18.690> going<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.840> be<00:03:18.959> looking

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
something else I'm going to be looking

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.880 
something else I'm going to be looking
into<00:03:20.600> there<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.750> waves<00:03:21.959> I've<00:03:22.320> got<00:03:22.530> the

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
into there the waves I've got the

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.110 
into there the waves I've got the
general<00:03:23.250> idea<00:03:23.400> anyhow<00:03:24.299> on<00:03:26.000> building<00:03:27.000> this

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
general idea anyhow on building this

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:35.780 
general idea anyhow on building this
mechanical<00:03:27.750> TV<00:03:28.140> set<00:03:30.890> so<00:03:31.890> yeah<00:03:32.340> hopefully<00:03:34.790> with

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
mechanical TV set so yeah hopefully with

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.009 
mechanical TV set so yeah hopefully with
these<00:03:36.030> bugs<00:03:36.510> on<00:03:36.780> yet<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.350> should<00:03:38.900> get<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.930> picture

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
these bugs on yet I should get a picture

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.319 
these bugs on yet I should get a picture
of<00:03:40.440> some<00:03:40.680> sort

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
of some sort

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:48.039 
of some sort
yeah<00:03:42.329> what's<00:03:42.810> meant<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.410> be<00:03:43.500> displaying<00:03:44.720> is<00:03:45.720> a

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
yeah what's meant to be displaying is a

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.800 
yeah what's meant to be displaying is a
there's<00:03:49.049> a<00:03:49.109> little<00:03:49.440> test<00:03:49.859> pattern<00:03:50.310> of<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.810> white

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
there's a little test pattern of a white

00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:01.640 
there's a little test pattern of a white
circle<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.829> a<00:03:53.459> white<00:03:53.820> square<00:03:58.459> yeah

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.910 

once<00:04:02.650> I<00:04:02.860> get<00:04:03.280> around<00:04:03.640> to<00:04:04.440> set<00:04:05.440> this<00:04:05.590> thing<00:04:05.860> up

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
once I get around to set this thing up

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.470 
once I get around to set this thing up
properly<00:04:06.520> I<00:04:08.520> should<00:04:09.520> get<00:04:09.970> some<00:04:10.240> better

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
properly I should get some better

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:19.380 
properly I should get some better
results<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.950> yeah<00:04:18.340> this<00:04:18.549> is<00:04:18.610> just<00:04:18.880> set<00:04:19.150> up<00:04:19.239> in

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
results and yeah this is just set up in

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.740 
results and yeah this is just set up in
a<00:04:19.450> very<00:04:19.630> watch<00:04:20.350> ass<00:04:20.709> rough<00:04:21.220> sort<00:04:21.459> of<00:04:21.580> way<00:04:21.760> so<00:04:22.090> I

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
a very watch ass rough sort of way so I

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.320 
a very watch ass rough sort of way so I
was<00:04:23.590> kind<00:04:23.860> of<00:04:23.950> hoping<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.580> get<00:04:24.700> surfing<00:04:25.060> on<00:04:25.300> the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
was kind of hoping to get surfing on the

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.800 
was kind of hoping to get surfing on the
supply<00:04:26.280> anyhow<00:04:27.280> yep<00:04:29.730> this<00:04:30.730> is<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.090> general

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
supply anyhow yep this is the general

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
supply anyhow yep this is the general
idea<00:04:31.900> of<00:04:32.760> mechanical<00:04:33.760> TV<00:04:34.210> oh<00:04:34.680> another<00:04:35.680> thing

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
idea of mechanical TV oh another thing

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.020 
idea of mechanical TV oh another thing
off<00:04:36.220> about<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.580> demonstrating<00:04:37.330> is<00:04:39.030> varying

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
off about the demonstrating is varying

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.220 
off about the demonstrating is varying
the<00:04:40.150> motor<00:04:40.360> speed<00:04:41.070> so<00:04:42.070> as<00:04:42.220> seen<00:04:42.580> here<00:04:42.610> if<00:04:43.230> got

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
the motor speed so as seen here if got

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.530 
the motor speed so as seen here if got
me<00:04:45.180> DC<00:04:46.180> motor<00:04:46.720> speed<00:04:46.870> adjustments<00:04:48.300> which<00:04:49.300> I'm

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
me DC motor speed adjustments which I'm

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.020 
me DC motor speed adjustments which I'm
very<00:04:49.830> up-and-down<00:04:51.630> so<00:04:52.800> how<00:04:53.800> much<00:04:54.010> slower<00:04:54.550> so

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
very up-and-down so how much slower so

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.870 
very up-and-down so how much slower so
I'll<00:04:55.150> speed<00:04:55.630> it<00:04:56.670> up<00:04:57.670> bit<00:04:57.940> more<00:04:59.070> and<00:05:00.070> I've

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
I'll speed it up bit more and I've

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.900 
I'll speed it up bit more and I've
adjusted<00:05:01.660> up<00:05:02.200> to<00:05:02.440> absolute<00:05:02.860> maximum<00:05:03.430> that's

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
adjusted up to absolute maximum that's

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.230 
adjusted up to absolute maximum that's
the<00:05:04.210> absolute<00:05:04.390> maximum<00:05:05.110> speed<00:05:05.440> and<00:05:05.590> go

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
the absolute maximum speed and go

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.750 
the absolute maximum speed and go
however<00:05:08.340> by<00:05:10.290> ramping<00:05:11.290> up<00:05:11.410> the<00:05:11.680> input<00:05:12.130> voltage

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
however by ramping up the input voltage

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.120 
however by ramping up the input voltage
from<00:05:12.940> four<00:05:13.330> volts<00:05:13.720> to<00:05:13.930> say<00:05:14.320> maybe<00:05:14.710> twelve

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
from four volts to say maybe twelve

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.910 
from four volts to say maybe twelve
volts

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:37.020 

the<00:05:21.000> virus<00:05:22.000> scanning<00:05:22.390> all<00:05:22.630> my<00:05:23.140> weapon<00:05:36.030> still

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
the virus scanning all my weapon still

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.830 
the virus scanning all my weapon still
what<00:05:37.600> seeing<00:05:38.170> any<00:05:39.450> anything<00:05:40.450> recognizable

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
what seeing any anything recognizable

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:51.510 
what seeing any anything recognizable
through<00:05:41.770> these<00:05:42.010> four<00:05:42.490> LEDs<00:05:42.880> but<00:05:49.800> but<00:05:50.800> I'll<00:05:51.010> get

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
through these four LEDs but but I'll get

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.670 
through these four LEDs but but I'll get
there<00:05:51.730> eventually<00:05:54.690> staff<00:05:55.690> to<00:05:55.840> defuse<00:05:56.290> LEDs

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
there eventually staff to defuse LEDs

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.190 
there eventually staff to defuse LEDs
seeds<00:05:57.510> so<00:05:58.510> again<00:05:58.780> an<00:05:58.870> evenly<00:05:59.260> spread<00:05:59.920> a<00:05:59.950> lot

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
seeds so again an evenly spread a lot

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.240 
seeds so again an evenly spread a lot
have<00:06:02.200> the<00:06:02.320> set<00:06:02.560> up<00:06:02.680> properly<00:06:03.100> and<00:06:03.220> like<00:06:03.850> and

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
have the set up properly and like and

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.800 
have the set up properly and like and
tested<00:06:06.250> more<00:06:06.460> accurately<00:06:06.970> I<00:06:09.630> might<00:06:10.630> actually

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
tested more accurately I might actually

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:22.400 
tested more accurately I might actually
turn<00:06:11.290> off<00:06:11.350> the<00:06:11.620> lot<00:06:11.890> safe<00:06:12.430> it<00:06:13.440> improves<00:06:14.440> them

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.740 

yeah<00:06:23.410> once<00:06:23.770> again<00:06:24.100> as<00:06:24.400> you<00:06:24.520> see<00:06:24.850> the<00:06:25.060> LEDs<00:06:25.510> are

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
yeah once again as you see the LEDs are

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.540 
yeah once again as you see the LEDs are
flashing<00:06:25.960> according<00:06:26.860> to<00:06:27.100> the<00:06:28.260> variations<00:06:29.260> of

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
flashing according to the variations of

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.350 
flashing according to the variations of
electrical<00:06:30.550> impulses<00:06:31.150> from<00:06:31.180> the<00:06:33.360> mechanical

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
electrical impulses from the mechanical

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:55.270 
electrical impulses from the mechanical
picture

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.080 

and<00:06:56.280> I<00:06:56.460> can<00:06:56.670> sort<00:06:57.150> of<00:06:57.300> say<00:06:58.040> some<00:06:59.040> variations<00:06:59.880> in

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090 
and I can sort of say some variations in

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.730 
and I can sort of say some variations in
the<00:07:00.240> life<00:07:00.510> from<00:07:00.810> the<00:07:01.110> mechanical<00:07:02.070> scan<00:07:03.710> so<00:07:04.710> I

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
the life from the mechanical scan so I

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.800 
the life from the mechanical scan so I
guess<00:07:05.040> I'm<00:07:05.310> on<00:07:05.850> the<00:07:06.420> way<00:07:06.600> there<00:07:08.630> it's<00:07:09.630> not

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:09.810 
guess I'm on the way there it's not

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:31.490 
guess I'm on the way there it's not
showing<00:07:10.140> up<00:07:10.290> when<00:07:10.470> we<00:07:10.560> made<00:07:10.770> our<00:07:10.920> fire<00:07:11.310> though

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.500 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:38.100 

and<00:07:34.080> it's<00:07:35.080> wet<00:07:35.500> no<00:07:35.830> I'm<00:07:36.160> gonna<00:07:36.780> call<00:07:37.780> it<00:07:37.990> an

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:38.110 
and it's wet no I'm gonna call it an

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.340 
and it's wet no I'm gonna call it an
evening<00:07:38.320> through<00:07:39.040> this<00:07:39.160> project<00:07:39.520> and<00:07:40.110> work<00:07:41.110> on

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:41.350 
evening through this project and work on

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.550 
evening through this project and work on
tomorrow<00:07:41.860> whenever<00:07:42.220> I<00:07:42.490> get<00:07:42.550> the<00:07:42.670> time<00:07:43.560> now

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 
tomorrow whenever I get the time now

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.310 
tomorrow whenever I get the time now
hope<00:07:45.130> you<00:07:45.310> enjoy<00:07:45.640> this<00:07:46.110> project<00:07:47.110> I<00:07:47.260> started
