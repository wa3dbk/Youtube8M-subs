00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
so let's get right into it all right the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.290 
so let's get right into it all right the
thing<00:00:34.920> we<00:00:35.070> really<00:00:35.219> like<00:00:35.489> about<00:00:35.670> both<00:00:36.030> phones

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
thing we really like about both phones

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.119 
thing we really like about both phones
is<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.630> they're<00:00:36.780> very<00:00:36.809> usable<00:00:37.469> one-handed

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
is that they're very usable one-handed

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.110 
is that they're very usable one-handed
one<00:00:38.640> not<00:00:38.790> being<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.719> know<00:00:39.870> too<00:00:39.930> big<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.530> hold

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
one not being you know too big to hold

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.950 
one not being you know too big to hold
so<00:00:42.120> both<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.510> them<00:00:42.660> are<00:00:42.750> very<00:00:42.989> easy<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.829> hold

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
so both of them are very easy to hold

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.690 
so both of them are very easy to hold
the<00:00:45.960> only<00:00:46.170> thing<00:00:46.350> though<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.860> Lumia<00:00:47.129> 920

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the only thing though is the Lumia 920

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.940 
the only thing though is the Lumia 920
is<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.820> bit<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.239> bulkier<00:00:48.660> phone<00:00:48.899> wing<00:00:49.200> you

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
is a bit of a bulkier phone wing you

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.100 
is a bit of a bulkier phone wing you
know<00:00:50.039> over<00:00:50.370> 6<00:00:50.670> ounces<00:00:51.059> compared<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
know over 6 ounces compared to the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.639 
know over 6 ounces compared to the
iphone<00:00:53.100> 5<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.149> weighs<00:00:54.570> around<00:00:54.780> four<00:00:55.230> ounces

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
iphone 5 that weighs around four ounces

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.729 
iphone 5 that weighs around four ounces
so<00:00:56.090> there<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> bit<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.899> difference<00:00:58.289> but<00:00:58.379> so

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
so there is a bit of a difference but so

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.560 
so there is a bit of a difference but so
