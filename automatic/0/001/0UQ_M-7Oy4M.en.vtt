00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.299
 hello youtube people today I'm going to 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.940
 show how to move free players in 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.940
 2015 and also serves for 2014 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.230
 first they are going to edit 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.820
 they create the player they want they put the 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.180
 name they want and the nationality that 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.180
 want 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.590
 Once created, they will transfer 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.500
 they go to the team they want to move their 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.500
 player 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.930
 I'm going to move my player to Real Madrid 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.930
 then they give in to add 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.530
 they look for the nationality that they put 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.530
 your player 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.830
 If he does not appear, they give him in search 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.340
 they put his name and his nationality 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.859
 and as you see, the player who 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.859
 finished creating you give in ok and ready 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.900
 and as you can see, no player appeared in the 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.900
 real madrid 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.769
