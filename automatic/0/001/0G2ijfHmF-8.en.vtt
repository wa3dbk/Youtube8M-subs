00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 good 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.190
 hi to all his fans will find themselves 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.050
 for a nozzle a new video of 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.730
 gleacher gta5 online so how 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.579
 bring solo vehicles online 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.920
 after patch 1 points 12 on ps3 and xbox 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.890
 this time we go so it works on 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.180
 both platforms 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.500
 we know not complicated just not bad 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.449
 loading it is necessary to follow the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.519
 video and you'll get there from the second 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.830
 first strike his costs that 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.060
 depends how you manage the church 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.440
 So here we go we'll start 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.040
 do not put you appear 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.040
 Last Position 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.410
 here I do not know what I was in 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.340
 to do I galley a little 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.140
 once you've done for the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.100
 repair last position in 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.100
 equity i was in laye 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.050
 finally i left donges rarely had 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.730
 a little trouble at the beginning of the video 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.260
 so once you left I was 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.660
 online you will end up with the 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.130
 a solo character so if you 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.930
 fall unless you come across three 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.910
 is not a loaded otherwise you go with 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.770
 trevor and you're looking for you are 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.119
 have to bring vehicles fashion and on 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.710
 garages to predict because it 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.720
 tells with 13 hours that market of 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.340
 the it so that brings you its in the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.740
 garages of treasures or else you go 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.520
 take a car dock in the street or 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.540
 a car I drool turismo what so 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.010
 it's when you want to import 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.210
 vehicle that you want so I 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.369
 will take a car on the street and 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.679
 I will improve it to be able to 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.700
 win in multiplayer so here is 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.989
 you will pick up your vehicle mode 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.880
 and if you want to carried away with a fashion 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.800
 and or else you will pick up your 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.290
 car you want to bring in laye 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.680
 so that's all it works with everything 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.030
 a shot of trevor makes this docker 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.590
 tourism will have time it really works 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.030
 is closed so I took this 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.400
 car there because I found that in 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.730
 the street and after you head to the 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.730
 strip tease 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.730
 so once you get to striptease you 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.730
 just have to get off your car 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.760
 that's like me in the video once 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.920
 you got off the car 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.900
 so you're going to get a 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.219
 car a little further so I 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.629
 go get them a car in the 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:02.549
 street to go a little lower 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.959
 so you go a little on the street 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.299
 you go I 'll have a bit like me in 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.189
 the video you are not really going 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.689
 precise location and after you take 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:21.060
 your multiplayer character one does 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:25.019
 yes so the load on average a little 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.930
 long no I really put in charge 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.040
 and still so here is once arrived 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.030
 in one part you will report back to 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.430
 respect with your character 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.870
 multiplayer 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.500
 so here you are going to have to do the 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.239
 small manipulation 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.079
 so it's a bit complicated so there I 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.200
 wonder how it's going to be 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:43.620
 do it here is so now you 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.760
 go do start market is there all of 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.049
 following after you are going to have but you 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.609
 m on 1 person on the character 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.989
 go back there it's not complicated I 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.849
 you have to do the trick like me 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.220
 before the buses like that the menu on more 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.979
 quickly and you wait 3 4 seconds 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.400
 and then you press ok to 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:00.599
 choose the character and after you 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.669
 see that the market will be displayed 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.199
 does b and that will take you solo and 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:06.959
 you will always have the little trick 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:08.790
 golden that charge next so there you 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.569
 have not been able to move there you do 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.569
 walk two bogeys 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:20.039
 once you land your markets you do 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:21.120
 of class a will charge again you have 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.070
 since there is a lot of loading when 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.659
 even then there you will come in 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.240
 multiplayer so where do we walk 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:28.650
 again and there you go 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.380
 accept your friend's invitation 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.900
 private party then wait for you in the park 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:39.360
 private striptease so there you accepted 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:42.199
 the invitation and the fact yes and there it goes 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.199
 bring you back into his part 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.350
 so there you will answer with the 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.700
 character michael you see you and 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.740
 see you visible he will not see the 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.120
 michael character so there you go 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.020
 look for a vehicle in the street and you 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.020
 lead in the strip tease 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.509
 so there you put pretty much like me 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.090
 in the video me I got there 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.919
 after that gerbaud judge why you 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.300
 put on board and command the video and 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:19.169
 once you've done that you 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.270
 go down and there you walk so 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.240
 there your friend stays at the striptease 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.650
 so he will see the car appear on 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.050
 so go there normally your friend saw 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.060
 to appear your car so the after 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.440
 you commit suicide our future is next to 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.850
 the car where during that time you 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.150
 commit suicide to recover your character 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.150
 multiplayer 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.370
 once you decide you 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.560
 stay with your character 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:47.370
 multiplayer 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.840
 here it is once you have respected 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.729
 your staff always are you going to 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.860
 head in the strip tease so on the 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.820
 parking there you parked just before the 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.780
 car that you will find in the 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.190
 street so here 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.110
 and there you 'll just find it next 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.509
 your car you bring so mode and 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.490
 or you 're soloing a car 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:06.660
 comes from the solo so I'm going to 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.740
 head into my garage for you 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.740
 to prove that we can return 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.820
 hello thanks to kraft for helping me 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.250
 for slips so here is so it's a 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.580
 again from the sky knox so late thanks 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.419
 dude must have helped here once 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.180
 arrived at your apartment 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.470
 you just go back in 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.150
 replace a lived under your garage is 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.440
 full and you see me I feel it on 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.690
 me otherwise I 'll put this in accelerated 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.699
 I bugged a bit in the entrance of 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:36.210
 garage where I like that I put that in 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:38.159
 accelerated his head or do the same thing 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.300
 I do not know all that changes nothing I 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:44.490
 just wait a little bit 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:46.500
 see that the un will appear here 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.180
 so you saw that I put a little bit of 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.789
 time to load her so once 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.210
 you have changed you replace a 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:53.159
 vehicle 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.800
 I'm going in place and there even 

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:57.900
 blue next to me and here you see 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.340
 that the vehicle is in my garage so 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.720
 the glitch worked well that the 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.380
 vehicle put an end solo scope 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.180
 to online 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.650
 so that's all alone hopefully this 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.639
 video will have pleased you especially join 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.560
