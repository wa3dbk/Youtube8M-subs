 So-called in- house 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:28.100
 It's true that it's about trying to make materials that show off to executives 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.100

 With the image of the lord 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:06.750
 It means that the person who is making it sometimes leaves the Meiji era 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.750
 It is for after contents 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.460

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.430
