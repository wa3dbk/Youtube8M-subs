about 32 days after lunch was a fairly

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.010 
about 32 days after lunch was a fairly
big<00:00:13.650> milestone<00:00:14.219> for<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:15.179> independent

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
big milestone for the independent

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.480 
big milestone for the independent
developer<00:00:16.350> community<00:00:16.740> because<00:00:17.010> at<00:00:17.310> this

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
developer community because at this

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.980 
developer community because at this
point<00:00:17.670> all<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.000> projects<00:00:18.480> had<00:00:18.600> largely<00:00:18.869> been

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
point all the projects had largely been

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.800 
point all the projects had largely been
just<00:00:19.320> using<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.890> raw<00:00:20.039> depth<00:00:20.340> data<00:00:20.640> just<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
just using the raw depth data just the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.900 
just using the raw depth data just the
3d<00:00:22.199> points<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.710> space<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.310> there<00:00:23.490> wasn't<00:00:23.640> any

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
3d points in space and there wasn't any

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.820 
3d points in space and there wasn't any
understanding<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.019> people<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
understanding of people in the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.769 
understanding of people in the
environment<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.880> what<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.420> were<00:00:27.510> talking

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
environment and what you were talking

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.060 
environment and what you were talking
about<00:00:27.869> with<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.109> body<00:00:28.260> tracking<00:00:28.800> but<00:00:28.920> yes

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
about with the body tracking but yes

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.589 
about with the body tracking but yes
this<00:00:29.340> realized<00:00:29.730> oh<00:00:29.910> there's<00:00:30.179> two<00:00:30.330> people

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
this realized oh there's two people

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.849 
this realized oh there's two people
standing<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:30.960> front<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.500> their<00:00:31.650> hands

standing in front of it and their hands

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.590 
standing in front of it and their hands

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
independent developer now has this

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.529 
independent developer now has this
capability<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.820> few<00:00:57.000> minutes<00:00:57.239> after<00:00:57.510> a

capability in a few minutes after a
download<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.140> they<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.739> get<00:00:59.100> fairly

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
download and they can get fairly

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.760 
download and they can get fairly
reasonable<00:01:00.120> full-body<00:01:00.629> tracking<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.199> start

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
reasonable full-body tracking and start

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.799 
reasonable full-body tracking and start
to<00:01:01.890> approximate<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.609> capability<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.719> we

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
to approximate the capability that we

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.170 
to approximate the capability that we
have<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.080> Xbox<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.700> camera<00:01:05.939> will<00:01:06.060> know

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
have on Xbox so the camera will know

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.310 
have on Xbox so the camera will know
that<00:01:06.299> you're<00:01:06.420> raising<00:01:06.540> your<00:01:06.720> right<00:01:06.900> hand<00:01:06.960> for

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
that you're raising your right hand for

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.500 
that you're raising your right hand for
evidence<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.830> triggers<00:01:08.280> some<00:01:08.549> bright

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
evidence and that triggers some bright

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.420 
evidence and that triggers some bright
spots<00:01:09.780> yeah<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.320> almost<00:01:10.530> immediately<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:11.280> think

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
spots yeah so almost immediately I think

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.580 
spots yeah so almost immediately I think
within<00:01:11.729> 24<00:01:12.330> hours<00:01:12.360> they<00:01:12.780> stay<00:01:12.960> independent

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
within 24 hours they stay independent

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.410 
within 24 hours they stay independent
developers<00:01:14.159> started<00:01:14.490> using<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.939> as<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.060> motion

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
developers started using it as a motion

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.359 
developers started using it as a motion
capture<00:01:15.540> tool<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.170> actually<00:01:16.770> integrating<00:01:17.250> it

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
capture tool and actually integrating it

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.240 
capture tool and actually integrating it
into<00:01:17.700> real<00:01:18.240> production<00:01:18.750> tools<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.380> my<00:01:19.590> 3d

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
into real production tools like my 3d

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.149 
into real production tools like my 3d
studio<00:01:20.430> max<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.390> are<00:01:21.509> used<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.860> actually

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
studio max that are used in to actually

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.399 
studio max that are used in to actually
create<00:01:23.549> actual<00:01:24.000> short<00:01:24.240> films<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.229> we

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
create actual short films and so we

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.520 
create actual short films and so we
start<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.770> see<00:01:25.920> these<00:01:26.130> fairly<00:01:26.520> sophisticated

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
start to see these fairly sophisticated

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.740 
start to see these fairly sophisticated
storytelling<00:01:28.670> projects<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.820> use<00:01:30.119> Kinect<00:01:30.630> as

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
storytelling projects that use Kinect as

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.990 
storytelling projects that use Kinect as
a<00:01:30.780> motion<00:01:30.990> capture<00:01:31.229> tool<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.369> course<00:01:32.579> all

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
a motion capture tool and of course all

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.340 
a motion capture tool and of course all
over<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.360> world<00:01:33.540> people<00:01:33.840> are<00:01:34.079> starting<00:01:34.320> to

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
over the world people are starting to

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.510 
over the world people are starting to
play<00:01:34.619> around<00:01:34.710> with<00:01:35.009> making<00:01:35.189> their<00:01:35.430> own

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
play around with making their own

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.240 
play around with making their own
versions<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.210> games<00:01:36.530> this<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.979> simple

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
versions of games this is just a simple

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.490 
versions of games this is just a simple
one<00:01:38.520> where<00:01:38.729> you're<00:01:39.210> mapping<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> 2d

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
one where you're mapping it to a 2d

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.359 
one where you're mapping it to a 2d
skeleton<00:01:42.079> but<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.380> can<00:01:43.590> also<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.950> course<00:01:44.009> get

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
skeleton but you can also of course get

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.670 
skeleton but you can also of course get
all<00:01:44.460> use<00:01:44.640> all<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> 3d<00:01:45.210> data<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:46.290> fact

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
all use all the 3d data and in fact

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.830 
all use all the 3d data and in fact
there's<00:01:47.070> almost<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.759> think<00:01:47.820> their<00:01:48.180> support<00:01:48.600> for

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
there's almost I think their support for

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.670 
there's almost I think their support for
Kinect<00:01:49.259> motion<00:01:49.530> capture<00:01:50.040> for<00:01:50.310> most<00:01:51.680> game
