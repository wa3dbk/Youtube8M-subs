those obvious influences and the things

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.310 
those obvious influences and the things
that<00:01:50.580> one<00:01:50.700> might<00:01:50.880> recognize<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.570> her<00:01:51.690> work<00:01:51.870> she

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
that one might recognize in her work she

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.380

color her own use of drama and I think

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.230 
color her own use of drama and I think
really<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.530> adds<00:01:58.800> up<00:01:58.980> to<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.250> very<00:01:59.520> unique<00:01:59.940> and

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
really it adds up to a very unique and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.970 
really it adds up to a very unique and
distinct<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.020> powerful<00:02:01.440> voice<00:02:01.470> and<00:02:01.830> that's

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
distinct and powerful voice and that's

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.190 
distinct and powerful voice and that's
why<00:02:02.130> that's<00:02:02.730> why<00:02:02.850> we<00:02:02.970> found<00:02:03.750> her<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.020> be<00:02:04.050> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
why that's why we found her to be the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:14.000 
why that's why we found her to be the
