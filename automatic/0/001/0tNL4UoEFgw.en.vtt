but just tight enough that you can still
move<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.880> with<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.119> lever<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:53.210> but<00:01:54.210> to

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
move it with the lever like this but to

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.789 
move it with the lever like this but to
the<00:01:54.509> point<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.930> when<00:01:55.020> you're<00:01:55.140> blowing<00:01:55.350> snow

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
the point that when you're blowing snow

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.620 
the point that when you're blowing snow
it's<00:01:56.250> not<00:01:56.520> going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.729> move<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.030> chute<00:01:57.299> up<00:01:57.450> on

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
it's not going to move the chute up on

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.249 
it's not going to move the chute up on
its<00:01:57.840> own

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
its own

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.530 
its own
now<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.040> youtuber<00:01:59.579> emailed<00:01:59.880> me<00:02:00.060> back<00:02:00.270> after

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
now the youtuber emailed me back after

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.209 
now the youtuber emailed me back after
answered<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.229> question<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.829> told<00:02:02.009> me<00:02:02.100> he

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
answered that question and told me he

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.730 
answered that question and told me he
doesn't<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.820> arm<00:02:02.850> here<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:04.079> adjust<00:02:04.200> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
doesn't have the arm here to adjust the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.780 
doesn't have the arm here to adjust the
Deschutes

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
Deschutes

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.819 
Deschutes
so<00:02:06.119> he's<00:02:06.360> also<00:02:06.540> got<00:02:06.840> cables<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.590> will<00:02:07.710> adjust

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
so he's also got cables that will adjust

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.369 
so he's also got cables that will adjust
the<00:02:08.459> direction<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.330> chute<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.959> what's

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
the direction of the chute and what's

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.350 
the direction of the chute and what's
happening<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.190> he'll<00:02:11.459> adjust<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:12.030> chute<00:02:12.239> in

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
happening is he'll adjust the chute in

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.670 
happening is he'll adjust the chute in
one<00:02:12.540> direction

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
one direction

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.289 
one direction
and<00:02:13.769> then<00:02:14.099> it's<00:02:14.280> going<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.489> move<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:14.819> its<00:02:15.030> own

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
and then it's going to move on its own

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.140 
and then it's going to move on its own
to<00:02:15.750> another<00:02:15.989> direction<00:02:16.700> so<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.730> can<00:02:18.030> be

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
to another direction so that can be

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.490 
to another direction so that can be
annoying<00:02:18.390> because<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.079> want<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.319> blow<00:02:19.439> the

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
annoying because you want to blow the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.410 
annoying because you want to blow the
snow<00:02:19.769> in<00:02:19.890> one<00:02:20.069> direction<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.849> then<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.239> could

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
snow in one direction and then it could

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.699 
snow in one direction and then it could
turn<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.900> other<00:02:22.019> one<00:02:22.170> but<00:02:22.439> on<00:02:22.560> your

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
turn the other one but on your

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.069 
turn the other one but on your
neighbor's<00:02:22.980> driveway<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:24.360> what<00:02:24.629> you<00:02:24.750> could<00:02:24.870> do

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
neighbor's driveway so what you could do

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.619 
neighbor's driveway so what you could do
for<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.470> is<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:26.250> could<00:02:26.430> check<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.090> position

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
for that is you could check the position

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.610 
for that is you could check the position
of<00:02:27.810> all<00:02:28.079> your<00:02:28.290> cables<00:02:28.939> down<00:02:29.939> here<00:02:30.500> it's<00:02:31.500> going

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
of all your cables down here it's going

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.110 
of all your cables down here it's going
to<00:02:31.680> be<00:02:31.799> slightly<00:02:32.010> different<00:02:32.370> on<00:02:32.640> his<00:02:32.819> blower

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
to be slightly different on his blower

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.599 
to be slightly different on his blower
you<00:02:34.079> might<00:02:34.260> want<00:02:34.439> to<00:02:34.530> check<00:02:34.799> how<00:02:35.129> tight<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
you might want to check how tight the

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.160 
you might want to check how tight the
levers<00:02:35.970> are<00:02:36.180> if<00:02:36.450> they're<00:02:36.689> really<00:02:36.900> really

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
levers are if they're really really

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.039 
levers are if they're really really
loose<00:02:37.439> on<00:02:37.709> console<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.939> could<00:02:39.180> be<00:02:39.359> making<00:02:39.750> it

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
loose on console it could be making it

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.660 
loose on console it could be making it
easier<00:02:40.319> for<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.620> chute<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.069> turn<00:02:41.280> direction

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
easier for the chute to turn direction

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.869 
easier for the chute to turn direction
also<00:02:42.569> check<00:02:43.170> down<00:02:43.409> here<00:02:43.859> that<00:02:44.459> all<00:02:44.609> the<00:02:44.760> bolts

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
also check down here that all the bolts

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.539 
also check down here that all the bolts
are<00:02:45.180> tight<00:02:45.480> where<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.170> chute<00:02:46.470> rack<00:02:46.859> is<00:02:47.129> down

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
are tight where the chute rack is down

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.119 
are tight where the chute rack is down
here<00:02:48.000> but<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.720> most<00:02:48.930> common<00:02:49.260> problem<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.739> found

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
here but the most common problem I found

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.449 
here but the most common problem I found
was<00:02:50.760> where<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.150> cables<00:02:51.659> trail<00:02:52.459> because

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
was where the cables trail because

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:54.979 
was where the cables trail because
sometimes<00:02:53.879> you<00:02:54.030> move<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.329> chute<00:02:54.629> and<00:02:54.840> the

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
sometimes you move the chute and the

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.050 
sometimes you move the chute and the
cable<00:02:55.440> doesn't<00:02:56.099> quite<00:02:56.459> move<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.879> way<00:02:57.000> it

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
cable doesn't quite move the way it

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.759 
cable doesn't quite move the way it
should<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.420> it's<00:02:57.720> putting<00:02:57.989> pressure<00:02:58.319> for<00:02:58.709> it

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
should and it's putting pressure for it

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.920 
should and it's putting pressure for it
to<00:02:58.920> go<00:02:59.010> back<00:02:59.250> in<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.760> other<00:02:59.819> direction<00:03:00.120> if<00:03:00.720> I

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
to go back in the other direction if I

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.899 
to go back in the other direction if I
do<00:03:00.989> get<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:01.349> troy<00:03:01.650> bilt<00:03:01.859> snow<00:03:02.370> blower

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
do get a troy bilt snow blower

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.910 
do get a troy bilt snow blower
with<00:03:03.359> the<00:03:03.480> same<00:03:03.720> features<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.500> will<00:03:04.680> make<00:03:04.889> a

with the same features I will make a

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.869 
with the same features I will make a
video<00:03:05.159> on<00:03:05.370> it

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.520 
cover here it's easier if you remove the
carburetor<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:31.980> forth<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.900> then<00:03:33.900> you<00:03:34.199> go

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
carburetor and so forth and then you go

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.229 
carburetor and so forth and then you go
from<00:03:34.769> there<00:03:34.859> I<00:03:35.220> will<00:03:35.430> be<00:03:35.669> making<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:36.030> video

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
from there I will be making a video

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.569 
from there I will be making a video
hopefully<00:03:37.079> this<00:03:37.260> winter<00:03:37.650> on<00:03:37.829> how<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.099> do<00:03:38.370> that

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
hopefully this winter on how to do that

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.789 
hopefully this winter on how to do that
so<00:03:39.329> remember<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:40.079> don't<00:03:40.319> need<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.650> go

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
so remember that you don't need to go

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.530 
so remember that you don't need to go
through<00:03:41.069> all<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.400> work<00:03:41.549> of<00:03:41.849> removing<00:03:42.510> your

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
through all the work of removing your

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.869 
through all the work of removing your
engine<00:03:43.049> from<00:03:43.530> your<00:03:43.680> snow<00:03:43.889> blower<00:03:44.069> to<00:03:44.549> adjust

engine from your snow blower to adjust
the<00:03:45.000> valves<00:03:45.389> even<00:03:46.199> if<00:03:46.319> your<00:03:46.470> snow<00:03:46.680> blowers<00:03:47.099> an

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
the valves even if your snow blowers an

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.399 
the valves even if your snow blowers an
overhead<00:03:47.579> valve<00:03:47.760> engine<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.569> do<00:03:48.750> not<00:03:48.930> need<00:03:49.260> to

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
overhead valve engine you do not need to

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.140 
overhead valve engine you do not need to
remove<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.829> engine<00:03:49.949> from<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:50.579> snow<00:03:50.879> blower

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
remove the engine from the snow blower

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.659 
remove the engine from the snow blower
to<00:03:51.419> adjust<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.870> valves<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.440> only<00:03:53.159> remove<00:03:53.519> an

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
to adjust the valves I only remove an

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.039 
to adjust the valves I only remove an
engine<00:03:53.970> from<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.209> salt<00:03:54.510> lower<00:03:54.690> when<00:03:54.930> I'm

now my last question today youtuber has

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.569 
now my last question today youtuber has
a<00:04:03.150> consumer-grade<00:04:04.079> must<00:04:04.889> have<00:04:05.010> on<00:04:05.129> a<00:04:05.280> chainsaw

a consumer-grade must have on a chainsaw

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.509 
a consumer-grade must have on a chainsaw
similar<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.479> this<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:07.079> he's<00:04:07.949> having<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.370> hard

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
similar to this and he's having a hard

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.309 
similar to this and he's having a hard
time<00:04:08.579> putting<00:04:09.060> back<00:04:09.329> the<00:04:09.510> chain<00:04:09.780> brake<00:04:10.049> on

time putting back the chain brake on

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.800 
time putting back the chain brake on
after<00:04:10.799> replacing<00:04:11.129> a<00:04:11.430> chain<00:04:11.699> now<00:04:12.569> when<00:04:12.780> I

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
after replacing a chain now when I

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.809 
after replacing a chain now when I
mention<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.290> chain<00:04:13.650> brake<00:04:14.010> it's<00:04:14.280> this<00:04:14.579> whole

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
mention the chain brake it's this whole

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.529 
mention the chain brake it's this whole
cover<00:04:15.150> here<00:04:15.769> including<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.889> handle<00:04:17.359> now<00:04:18.359> when

cover here including the handle now when

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:19.789 
cover here including the handle now when
you<00:04:18.630> replace<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:19.079> chain<00:04:19.440> you're<00:04:19.620> obviously

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
you replace a chain you're obviously

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.930 
you replace a chain you're obviously
going<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.430> remove<00:04:20.789> this<00:04:21.030> cover<00:04:22.760> now<00:04:23.760> what

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
going to remove this cover now what

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.909 
going to remove this cover now what
could<00:04:24.090> be<00:04:24.210> causing<00:04:24.450> this<00:04:24.750> problem<00:04:24.960> of<00:04:25.500> having

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
could be causing this problem of having

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:26.970 
could be causing this problem of having
a<00:04:25.979> hard<00:04:26.130> time<00:04:26.190> putting<00:04:26.580> the

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
a hard time putting the

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.060 
a hard time putting the
right<00:04:27.340> back<00:04:27.580> on<00:04:27.820> is<00:04:28.420> that<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.870> old<00:04:29.110> chain<00:04:29.590> is

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
right back on is that the old chain is

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.330 
right back on is that the old chain is
slightly<00:04:30.550> longer<00:04:30.880> than<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.690> new<00:04:31.870> chain<00:04:32.340> over

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
slightly longer than the new chain over

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.430 
slightly longer than the new chain over
time<00:04:33.610> that<00:04:33.790> chain<00:04:34.060> stretches<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:34.990> you<00:04:35.320> have

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
time that chain stretches and you have

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.100 
time that chain stretches and you have
to<00:04:35.590> keep<00:04:35.710> adjusting<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.730> bar<00:04:36.970> but<00:04:37.660> tightening

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
to keep adjusting the bar but tightening

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.050 
to keep adjusting the bar but tightening
this<00:04:38.260> screw<00:04:38.590> here<00:04:38.800> which<00:04:38.980> is<00:04:39.370> the<00:04:39.610> chain

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
this screw here which is the chain

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.570 
this screw here which is the chain
adjuster<00:04:40.240> so<00:04:40.900> if<00:04:40.960> you<00:04:41.080> tighten<00:04:41.350> it<00:04:41.650> in<00:04:41.890> it's

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
adjuster so if you tighten it in it's

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.250 
adjuster so if you tighten it in it's
going<00:04:42.730> to<00:04:42.850> tighten<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.270> chain<00:04:43.450> on<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.690> bar<00:04:43.990> if

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
going to tighten the chain on the bar if

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.990 
going to tighten the chain on the bar if
you<00:04:44.410> loosen<00:04:44.770> it<00:04:44.860> when<00:04:45.130> it<00:04:45.250> loops<00:04:45.430> in<00:04:45.640> the<00:04:45.760> chain

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
you loosen it when it loops in the chain

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.690 
you loosen it when it loops in the chain
there's<00:04:46.690> a<00:04:46.780> little<00:04:47.020> pin<00:04:47.350> here<00:04:47.830> that<00:04:48.160> grabs<00:04:48.430> in

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
there's a little pin here that grabs in

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.180 
there's a little pin here that grabs in
the<00:04:48.820> bar<00:04:49.030> hole<00:04:49.240> right<00:04:49.480> here<00:04:49.930> so<00:04:50.890> when<00:04:51.160> you

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
the bar hole right here so when you

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.160 
the bar hole right here so when you
tighten<00:04:51.490> it<00:04:51.700> and<00:04:51.820> move<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.210> bar<00:04:52.390> forward<00:04:52.750> if

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
tighten it and move the bar forward if

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.930 
tighten it and move the bar forward if
you<00:04:53.320> loosen<00:04:53.650> it<00:04:53.710> it<00:04:54.010> allows<00:04:54.250> the<00:04:54.460> bar<00:04:54.640> to<00:04:54.820> go

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
you loosen it it allows the bar to go

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.230 
you loosen it it allows the bar to go
back<00:04:55.180> to<00:04:55.690> loosen<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.200> chain<00:04:56.550> so<00:04:57.550> that's

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
back to loosen the chain so that's

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.420 
back to loosen the chain so that's
what's<00:04:58.540> going<00:04:58.720> on<00:04:58.960> when<00:04:59.710> you<00:04:59.800> put<00:04:59.950> a<00:04:59.980> new<00:05:00.160> chain

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
what's going on when you put a new chain

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.310 
what's going on when you put a new chain
on<00:05:00.640> what<00:05:00.880> happens<00:05:01.300> usually<00:05:01.720> is<00:05:01.810> that<00:05:01.840> it's<00:05:02.200> a

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
on what happens usually is that it's a

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.650 
on what happens usually is that it's a
tiny<00:05:02.710> bit<00:05:02.890> shorter<00:05:03.520> than<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.120> old<00:05:04.450> one

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
tiny bit shorter than the old one

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.930 
tiny bit shorter than the old one
because<00:05:04.810> it's<00:05:05.140> not<00:05:05.410> stretched<00:05:05.860> therefore<00:05:06.700> it

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
because it's not stretched therefore it

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.300 
because it's not stretched therefore it
throws<00:05:07.240> off<00:05:07.390> your<00:05:07.600> original<00:05:08.200> settings<00:05:08.800> for

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
throws off your original settings for

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.580 
throws off your original settings for
your<00:05:09.430> chain<00:05:09.840> so<00:05:10.840> when<00:05:10.990> you<00:05:11.080> go<00:05:11.170> to<00:05:11.230> put<00:05:11.500> the

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
your chain so when you go to put the

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.010 
your chain so when you go to put the
chain<00:05:11.830> break<00:05:12.100> cover<00:05:12.370> back<00:05:12.670> on<00:05:13.030> and<00:05:13.510> may<00:05:13.810> not

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
chain break cover back on and may not

hole the cover may not go in as deep as
it<00:05:46.600> should<00:05:47.050> so<00:05:47.380> that's<00:05:48.250> one<00:05:48.460> way<00:05:48.580> of<00:05:48.610> knowing

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
it should so that's one way of knowing

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.090 
it should so that's one way of knowing
it's<00:05:49.270> not<00:05:49.510> in<00:05:49.690> there<00:05:49.840> all<00:05:49.960> the<00:05:49.990> way<00:05:50.110> now

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
it's not in there all the way now

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.040 
it's not in there all the way now
another<00:05:51.340> common<00:05:51.730> and<00:05:52.120> completely<00:05:52.660> different

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
another common and completely different

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.140 
another common and completely different
problem<00:05:53.590> could<00:05:53.860> be<00:05:54.010> that<00:05:54.220> your<00:05:54.400> chain<00:05:54.760> break

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
problem could be that your chain break

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.480 
problem could be that your chain break
is<00:05:55.330> in<00:05:55.660> the<00:05:55.780> on<00:05:55.960> position<00:05:56.100> so<00:05:57.100> if<00:05:57.160> it's<00:05:57.310> been

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
is in the on position so if it's been

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.870 
is in the on position so if it's been
moved<00:05:57.700> forward<00:05:58.060> like<00:05:58.420> this<00:05:59.340> that<00:06:00.340> means<00:06:00.550> it's

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
moved forward like this that means it's

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.780 
moved forward like this that means it's
on<00:06:01.260> the<00:06:02.260> tines<00:06:02.560> of<00:06:02.800> the<00:06:03.010> band<00:06:03.280> here<00:06:03.670> and

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
on the tines of the band here and

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.170 
on the tines of the band here and
therefore<00:06:04.480> the<00:06:04.870> band<00:06:05.140> is<00:06:05.830> too<00:06:06.340> small<00:06:06.610> now<00:06:06.850> to

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
therefore the band is too small now to

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.750 
therefore the band is too small now to
fiddle<00:06:07.420> with<00:06:07.570> the<00:06:07.810> clutch<00:06:08.050> over<00:06:08.410> here<00:06:08.650> so<00:06:09.610> now

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
fiddle with the clutch over here so now

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.650 
fiddle with the clutch over here so now
if<00:06:09.820> you<00:06:09.910> go<00:06:09.970> to<00:06:10.120> put<00:06:10.360> it<00:06:10.390> on<00:06:10.600> with<00:06:11.020> the<00:06:11.140> brake<00:06:11.380> on

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 
if you go to put it on with the brake on

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.020 
if you go to put it on with the brake on
just<00:06:13.660> not<00:06:13.840> going<00:06:14.050> to<00:06:14.140> go<00:06:14.260> on<00:06:14.910> so<00:06:15.910> what

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
just not going to go on so what

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.880 
just not going to go on so what
chaptered<00:06:16.450> you<00:06:16.600> in<00:06:16.690> this<00:06:16.840> case<00:06:17.110> is<00:06:17.410> grab<00:06:17.740> the

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
cover and the handle and move it back

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:25.050 
cover and the handle and move it back
till<00:06:19.930> you<00:06:20.020> hear<00:06:20.170> click<00:06:21.960> like<00:06:22.960> that<00:06:24.000> now<00:06:25.000> the

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
till you hear click like that now the

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.080 
till you hear click like that now the
band<00:06:25.420> is<00:06:25.630> expanded<00:06:26.320> and<00:06:26.830> it's<00:06:27.640> going<00:06:27.820> to<00:06:27.880> fit

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
band is expanded and it's going to fit

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.330 
band is expanded and it's going to fit
right<00:06:28.120> over<00:06:28.660> the<00:06:28.780> clutch<00:06:29.020> and<00:06:29.380> now<00:06:30.040> you<00:06:30.100> can

right over the clutch and now you can
reinstall<00:06:30.730> your<00:06:31.060> chain<00:06:31.360> break<00:06:31.630> cover

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.850 

once<00:06:38.390> you<00:06:38.540> put<00:06:38.780> the<00:06:38.870> chain<00:06:39.080> break<00:06:39.350> cover<00:06:39.590> back

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
once you put the chain break cover back

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:46.940 
here like that and the chain has to be

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.100 
here like that and the chain has to be
able<00:06:47.000> to<00:06:47.150> move<00:06:47.360> freely<00:06:47.660> like<00:06:47.930> this<00:06:49.810> so<00:06:50.810> thanks
