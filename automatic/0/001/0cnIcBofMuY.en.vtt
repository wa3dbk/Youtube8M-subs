00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.520
 the big dome is not a planetarium 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.389
 whim network fantasies 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.389
 it is known that the planet is moving in 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.830
 heavenly sphere which is a ball 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.710
 the ancients knew this 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.769
 and in the planetarium to show the sky is needed with 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.289
 physically screen he pier supposed 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.960
 inside the dome 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.669
 outer dome design ready question 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.060
 how to execute the shell inside the screens 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.579
 and make it perfectly round 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.800
 so that the image but did not work without 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.950
 distortion 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.260
 The problem was solved with the help of rectilinear 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.860
 galvanized steel 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.110
 profiles 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.110
 in fact, now judge a ready answer by 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.220
 at least on the first question of tasks 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.600
 made of individual elements 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.920
 openwork support structure 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.010
 the screen surface will still be filled 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.460
 but how did you manage to get round 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.330
 shape of rectilinear 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.440
 the wand is just a firm of individual 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.200
 fragments will consist which 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.940
 to that way to a certain angle and 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.570
 Immediately all the same it turns out 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.280
 some such 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.680
 similarity in other cyclopean 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.520
 facilities 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.520
 diameter of 16 meters was difficult for us 1024 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.799
 changes made from thin-walled 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:14.660
 profile 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.960
 total weight not more than five tons 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.150
 thickness of steel here is only 1 millimeter but 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.260
 even this cross cannot lift either 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.570
 one tap since the shell had to 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.030
 collect existing coupons 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.729
 the assembly of the inner sphere was done manually 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.790
 and worked only 4 people 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.140
 multimeter steel firms with their own 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.760
 machines are adjacent to the contents of the ring 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.020
 it is the only element all together 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.420
 in two years it is not tied to the top 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.740
 the doll hangs on domestic farms 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.050
 center end this center shell need 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.240
 say that everything had to be here 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.640
 perform for the first time of this kind 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.440
 spherical zinc structures 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.690
 steel profile walls did not comply 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.750
 no one has such screens yet 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.090
 russia's planetarium is a class estate sure 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.250
 the fact that it will work 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.200
 of fear 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.460
 Alla was of course I do not hide it 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.029
 and since but we have not encountered such 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:12.899
 designs earlier 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.489
 Lyudmila koltsovo her experts first in 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.680
 Nizhny Novgorod region 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.989
 mastered this promising 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.640
 construction direction of 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.170
 its thin-walled profiles and not 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.560
 built dozens of varied 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.720
 facilities but purchased facilities of this kind 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.900
 saw never helped experience 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.840
 cooperation with architectural scientists 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.469
 construction university and 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.250
 strong faith your idea of ​​dignity from 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.200
 its lightweight structures but it was 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.760
 implemented date major 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.269
 worth in the design here it is 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.759
 fine settings 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.539
 at the very convenience of installation and I do not think that 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.749
 attack performed the first stage of the task 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:48.649
 the main screen itself will be typed 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:50.319
 from aluminum plates 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.180
 who will fill the existing secret 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.230
 lattice recall that this technology 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.519
 spherical designs so far 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.519
 no one has waited until the result 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:04.549
 but the inside of the large dome of Nizhny Novgorod 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:05.520
 planetarium 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.520
 in full swing 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:11.259
 to honor 

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:12.519
 something exactly 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.339
 this object got in error 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:17.079
 know if I have to say 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.079
 according to her aggressor 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.079
 arrange magazine 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.389
 in the spring of 2006 we really 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.389
 filmed the plot for construction 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.479
 attic of thin-walled 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.859
 but a profile but no one in March children 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.709
 couldn't imagine that light durable 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.609
 designs will be used in the attack 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.549
 unique object 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.809
 steel hemisphere assembled inside 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:39.939
 outer shell of the dome will weigh 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:43.059
 total 6 tons 5 tons firm and one ton 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:45.599
 aluminum plates from which on our 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.099
 eyes are mounted vault under 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.109
 the most side of the screen which will be 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.109
 projected cosmic pictures 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.959
 on the walls for 224 construction sites 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.169
 they are located 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.739
 16 stock sizes 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.909
 the work of installers resembles an assembly 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.259
 put the facade if you can even talk 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:09.829
 on the facade and not going ceiling 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.439
 it can happen here the situation with 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.650
 it's not so easy for students 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.319
 autostat 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.049
 and all the elements in principle they 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.119
 to make a court specifically for this 

00:04:19.119 --> 00:04:21.729
 project and they like what people told 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.960
 that some parts of the Avenue in Sochi 16 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.330
 the source of the brand should be 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.039
 quite high much higher than in 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:29.860
 aseev capitals 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.270
 aluminum plates run away from the center 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.470
 resize 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.759
 and ultimately 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.990
 no steps should be noticeable 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.990
 perfect hemisphere sky light 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.129
 authorities should not 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:45.659
 demand has not yet fallen painted 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.680
 and buses 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.770
 sorry, I was alone 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.210
 we still have a lot to see 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.039
 on this one but i'm usually building 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:55.240
 site regions 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.289
 continue our observations of how 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.289
 Nizhny Novgorod erected 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.229
 quite tannom scale Nizhny Novgorod 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.449
 planetarium is not the biggest kulikovsky 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.960
 in the city they are Anya the diameter of the dome is almost 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.080
 twice as much but by Russian standards 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.349
 we are champions Russia showed and the fire itself 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:17.130
 although the Barcelona composition 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.909
 supposedly planned 2 4 meters to make 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.180
 we have 6 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.690
 at the time of publication 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.760
 last year said the portal getting there 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.189
 only coloring 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:29.559
 and then it got already done 

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:31.879
 they hit the record came out with them monolith 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:32.970
 by recall 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.589
 in services new homes 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:38.849
 increased his rights to 10 1 plate 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:40.749
 purchased such as was in monolithic 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:42.470
 complexes with 300 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.540
 in the mouths of the authors of this unique project 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.120
 everything looks quite prosaic 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.190
 in fact in Nizhny Novgorod happened 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.880
 little construction wonders 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.400
 the shortest time has been developed 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.990
 lightweight and durable assembly technology 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.090
 supporting structure will allow you to create 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.999
 huge can for screen apologies 

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:59.210
 830 tons of beef herd 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.500
 children suspended ceiling outdoor 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.949
 after biting the paint primer 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:06.050
 the building is white to put an end to 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.710
 this story we have to wait 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.110
 when this is the matter of the sky 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.159
 wait for the first stars of duty 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:13.030
 Nizhny Novgorod Planetarium
