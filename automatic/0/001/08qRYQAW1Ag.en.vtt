00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.730 

in<00:00:00.930> this<00:00:01.020> video<00:00:01.290> we're<00:00:01.410> going<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.589> talk<00:00:01.709> about

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
in this video we're going to talk about

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.130 
in this video we're going to talk about
the<00:00:02.040> systemic<00:00:02.429> vessels<00:00:02.970> based<00:00:03.389> off<00:00:03.720> of<00:00:03.750> the

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
the systemic vessels based off of the

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.590 
the systemic vessels based off of the
torso<00:00:04.859> here<00:00:05.040> that<00:00:05.220> we<00:00:05.310> have<00:00:05.520> this<00:00:05.850> is<00:00:06.000> the

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
torso here that we have this is the

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.940 
torso here that we have this is the
torso<00:00:06.870> that<00:00:07.020> we're<00:00:07.109> having<00:00:07.200> in<00:00:07.379> class<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.830> so

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
torso that we're having in class and so

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.650 
torso that we're having in class and so
we're<00:00:08.490> just<00:00:08.519> going<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.849> walk<00:00:09.030> through<00:00:09.059> the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
we're just going to walk through the

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.900 
we're just going to walk through the
flow<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.019> blood<00:00:10.349> through<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.429> actual

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
flow of blood through the actual

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.430 
flow of blood through the actual
arteries<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:12.870> we're<00:00:12.990> just<00:00:13.019> going<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.290> walk

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
arteries and so we're just going to walk

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.660 
arteries and so we're just going to walk
through<00:00:13.469> specifically<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.250> systemic

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
through specifically the systemic

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.240 
through specifically the systemic
arteries<00:00:14.969> found<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:15.870> torso<00:00:16.590> model<00:00:16.890> here

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
arteries found on this torso model here

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.640 
arteries found on this torso model here
so<00:00:17.430> all<00:00:17.880> blood<00:00:18.270> comes<00:00:18.510> from<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:18.840> arterial

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
so all blood comes from that arterial

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.769 
so all blood comes from that arterial
blood<00:00:19.800> comes<00:00:20.070> from<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.400> left<00:00:20.699> ventricle<00:00:21.539> and

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
blood comes from that left ventricle and

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.269 
blood comes from that left ventricle and
so<00:00:21.900> once<00:00:22.170> we<00:00:22.230> go<00:00:22.380> from<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.619> left<00:00:22.859> ventricle

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
so once we go from that left ventricle

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.560 
so once we go from that left ventricle
you'll<00:00:23.400> notice<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> heart's<00:00:24.119> not<00:00:24.210> here

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
you'll notice that the heart's not here

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.670 
you'll notice that the heart's not here
so<00:00:24.750> we're<00:00:24.869> not<00:00:24.960> going<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.109> see<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> coronary

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
so we're not going to see the coronary

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.560 
so we're not going to see the coronary
arteries<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> first<00:00:26.400> two<00:00:26.640> branches<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
arteries the first two branches of the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.470 
arteries the first two branches of the
ascending<00:00:28.109> aorta<00:00:28.529> but<00:00:29.099> we<00:00:29.220> still<00:00:29.400> see<00:00:29.910> after

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
ascending aorta but we still see after

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.999 
ascending aorta but we still see after
that<00:00:30.599> we<00:00:30.750> still<00:00:30.960> see<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.140> bit<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> sending

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
that we still see a bit of the a sending

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.130 
that we still see a bit of the a sending
order<00:00:32.250> right<00:00:32.430> here<00:00:32.570> and<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.899> could<00:00:34.050> imagine

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
order right here and you could imagine

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.350 
order right here and you could imagine
the<00:00:34.440> ACA<00:00:34.770> order<00:00:35.130> first<00:00:35.370> then<00:00:35.670> gives<00:00:35.910> them<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
the ACA order first then gives them the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.330 
the ACA order first then gives them the
arch<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.020> aorta<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.190> imagine

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
arch of the aorta and you can imagine

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.160 
arch of the aorta and you can imagine
the<00:00:38.610> arch<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.000> order<00:00:39.210> has<00:00:39.390> three<00:00:39.750> branches

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the arch of the order has three branches

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.690 
the arch of the order has three branches
right<00:00:40.320> arch<00:00:40.890> early<00:00:41.160> order<00:00:41.370> two<00:00:41.489> three

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
right arch early order two three

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.450 
right arch early order two three
branches<00:00:42.090> brachiocephalic<00:00:43.040> left<00:00:44.040> common

branches brachiocephalic left common

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.720 
branches brachiocephalic left common
carotid<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.940> left<00:00:45.450> subclavian

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
carotid and left subclavian

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.069 
carotid and left subclavian
brachycephalic<00:00:47.730> will<00:00:47.969> split<00:00:48.210> into<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.629> right

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
brachycephalic will split into the right

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.630 
brachycephalic will split into the right
common<00:00:49.469> carotid<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.950> then<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.309> right

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
common carotid and then the right

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.760 
common carotid and then the right
subclavian<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.690> then<00:00:52.260> if<00:00:52.350> we're<00:00:52.469> taking<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
subclavian and then if we're taking a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.560 
subclavian and then if we're taking a
look<00:00:52.860> at<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> common<00:00:53.520> carotid<00:00:53.730> they'll<00:00:54.239> go<00:00:54.420> up

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
look at the common carotid they'll go up

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.750 
look at the common carotid they'll go up
into<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.020> neck<00:00:55.260> with<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.670> internal<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
into the neck with the internal and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.069 
into the neck with the internal and
external<00:00:56.820> carotid<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:57.629> actually<00:00:57.780> see

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
external carotid and we actually see

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.990 
external carotid and we actually see
just<00:00:58.500> two<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> branches<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.550> external

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
just two of the branches of the external

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.420 
just two of the branches of the external
carotid<00:01:00.149> here<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.199> facial<00:01:01.620> artery<00:01:01.890> here<00:01:02.250> as

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
carotid here the facial artery here as

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.310 
carotid here the facial artery here as
well<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.239> then<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.449> superficial<00:01:04.170> temporal

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
well as then the superficial temporal

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.070 
well as then the superficial temporal
artery<00:01:05.119> when<00:01:06.119> we<00:01:06.210> take<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> look<00:01:06.570> at<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.840> rest

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
artery when we take a look at the rest

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.960 
artery when we take a look at the rest
of<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:07.590> see<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> subclavian<00:01:08.250> moving<00:01:08.729> along

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
of it we see the subclavian moving along

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.370 
of it we see the subclavian moving along
and<00:01:09.150> then<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.330> don't<00:01:09.479> see<00:01:09.659> anything<00:01:09.900> else<00:01:10.200> of

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and then we don't see anything else of

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.859 
and then we don't see anything else of
it<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> model<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.880> continues<00:01:12.390> as<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
it but on the model it continues as the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.140 
it but on the model it continues as the
arch<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> or<00:01:13.650> goes<00:01:14.280> into<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.729> descending

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
arch of the or goes into the descending

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.950 
arch of the or goes into the descending
aorta<00:01:15.360> creating<00:01:16.110> then<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.850> posterior

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
aorta creating then the posterior

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.999 
aorta creating then the posterior
intercostal<00:01:18.960> arteries<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:19.740> see<00:01:19.830> all

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
intercostal arteries you can see all

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.230 
intercostal arteries you can see all
these<00:01:20.189> branches<00:01:20.759> going<00:01:20.909> into<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
these branches going into the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.020 
these branches going into the
intercostal<00:01:21.810> space<00:01:22.080> there<00:01:22.409> once<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.310> pierce

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
intercostal space there once we pierce

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.810 
intercostal space there once we pierce
the<00:01:24.270> diaphragm<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.380> descending<00:01:26.220> or<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.580> this

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the diaphragm the descending or in this

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.789 
the diaphragm the descending or in this
area<00:01:27.090> called<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> thoracic<00:01:27.540> aorta<00:01:27.990> becomes

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
area called the thoracic aorta becomes

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.100 
area called the thoracic aorta becomes
the<00:01:28.979> abdominal<00:01:29.700> aorta<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.509> we<00:01:30.720> have<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> bunch

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the abdominal aorta and we have a bunch

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.410 
the abdominal aorta and we have a bunch
of<00:01:31.200> organs<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.040> require<00:01:32.729> some<00:01:33.030> blood<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.390> we

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
of organs that require some blood so we

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.760 
of organs that require some blood so we
have<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> lot<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:33.990> branches<00:01:34.320> here<00:01:34.650> and

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
have to have a lot of branches here and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.840 
have to have a lot of branches here and
so<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> first<00:01:35.130> two<00:01:35.250> branches<00:01:35.490> we're<00:01:35.670> going<00:01:35.790> to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
so the first two branches we're going to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.260 
so the first two branches we're going to
find<00:01:36.030> are<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.500> inferior<00:01:37.500> phrenic<00:01:37.920> now<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
find are the inferior phrenic now the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.030 
find are the inferior phrenic now the
left<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.750> missing<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.560> right<00:01:40.710> one<00:01:40.890> is

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
left one is missing but the right one is

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.249 
left one is missing but the right one is
here<00:01:41.189> going<00:01:41.369> back<00:01:41.490> up<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.820> diaphragm<00:01:42.259> so

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
here going back up to the diaphragm so

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.410 
here going back up to the diaphragm so
inferior<00:01:43.680> phrenic<00:01:44.189> coming<00:01:44.790> back<00:01:44.909> up<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.299> then

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
inferior phrenic coming back up and then

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.230 
inferior phrenic coming back up and then
we<00:01:45.450> get<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.780> next<00:01:45.930> one<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.170> large<00:01:46.470> celiac<00:01:47.189> trunk

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
we get the next one a large celiac trunk

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.030 
we get the next one a large celiac trunk
the<00:01:48.240> celiac<00:01:48.600> trunk<00:01:48.659> supplies<00:01:49.350> many<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
the celiac trunk supplies many of the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.940 
the celiac trunk supplies many of the
arteries<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.110> abdominal

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
arteries that we have in the abdominal

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.620 
arteries that we have in the abdominal
cavity<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.700> left

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
cavity to the left

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.020 
cavity to the left
this<00:01:55.350> guy<00:01:55.560> would<00:01:55.860> travel<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> left<00:01:56.700> become

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
this guy would travel to the left become

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.520 
this guy would travel to the left become
the<00:01:57.149> splenic<00:01:57.570> because<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.990> spleen<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the splenic because the spleen is on the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.010 
the splenic because the spleen is on the
left<00:01:58.920> side<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.880> right<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.719> common

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
left side the right is the common

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.780 
left side the right is the common
hepatic<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.950> then<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.369> one<00:02:02.549> coming

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
hepatic and then this one coming

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.240 
hepatic and then this one coming
straight<00:02:03.060> up<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.570> left<00:02:03.810> gastric<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.649> that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
straight up is the left gastric and that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.130 
straight up is the left gastric and that
would<00:02:05.369> supply<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.729> stomach<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.329> left<00:02:06.780> common

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
would supply the stomach so left common

the stomach or at least part of it after

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.530 
the stomach or at least part of it after
that<00:02:15.060> we<00:02:15.240> get<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:16.310> superior<00:02:17.310> mesenteric<00:02:17.850> now

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
that we get the superior mesenteric now

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.120 
that we get the superior mesenteric now
a<00:02:18.570> mesenteric<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.410> covering<00:02:19.980> or

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
a mesenteric is that covering or

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.410 
a mesenteric is that covering or
membrane<00:02:20.430> covering<00:02:20.580> going<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.240> small

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
membrane covering going to the small

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.570 
membrane covering going to the small
intestines<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.230> colon<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:23.310> we<00:02:23.460> can

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
intestines and the colon and so we can

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.280 
intestines and the colon and so we can
say<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.060> superior<00:02:24.630> mesenteric<00:02:24.720> takes

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
say that the superior mesenteric takes

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.140 
say that the superior mesenteric takes
care<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.560> all<00:02:25.740> of<00:02:25.770> small<00:02:26.130> intestines<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.700> sandy

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
care of all of small intestines a sandy

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.670 
care of all of small intestines a sandy
and<00:02:27.330> transverse<00:02:27.750> colon<00:02:27.960> or<00:02:28.110> at<00:02:28.230> least<00:02:28.410> part<00:02:28.620> of

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
and transverse colon or at least part of

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.790 
and transverse colon or at least part of
it<00:02:28.860> after<00:02:29.580> that<00:02:29.730> we<00:02:29.790> get<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.440> blood<00:02:31.440> vessels

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
it after that we get the blood vessels

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.199 
it after that we get the blood vessels
that<00:02:31.860> go<00:02:31.920> up<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.430> super<00:02:32.730> renal<00:02:33.030> glands

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
that go up to the super renal glands

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.120 
that go up to the super renal glands
it's<00:02:33.480> called<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.720> super<00:02:34.170> renal<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.620> then<00:02:35.010> they

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
it's called a super renal and then they

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.710 
it's called a super renal and then they
go<00:02:35.220> straight<00:02:35.520> across<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.060> kidneys<00:02:36.420> called

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
go straight across to the kidneys called

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.470 
go straight across to the kidneys called
the<00:02:36.870> renal<00:02:37.320> glands<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.740> then<00:02:37.920> going<00:02:38.370> down<00:02:38.480> to

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
the renal glands and then going down to

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.690 
the renal glands and then going down to
the<00:02:40.020> gonads<00:02:40.440> called<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.860> gonadal<00:02:41.370> now<00:02:41.550> if

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
the gonads called the gonadal now if

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.790 
the gonads called the gonadal now if
this<00:02:41.820> was<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.030> male<00:02:42.270> species<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.320> can't<00:02:43.530> tell

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
this was a male species you can't tell

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.880 
this was a male species you can't tell
so<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.120> male<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.840> would<00:02:45.959> be<00:02:46.110> testicular

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
so this is a male it would be testicular

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.400 
so this is a male it would be testicular
fills<00:02:47.310> female<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.880> ovarian<00:02:48.180> after<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.290> the
