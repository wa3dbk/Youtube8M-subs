00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.829
 because of the robbery 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.829
 so these classes were paralyzed at our airports 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.459
 We have to get ready to be able to 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:12.519
 the world welcomed a spectacle of this greatness 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:14.959
 we can not 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.060
 to subject the Brazilian people to humiliation. 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:23.559
 I think he's not ready yet I'm a supporter of the candidacy 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:27.330
 but if I do not think the capital is enough 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.130
 a great event like to joke sauce 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.120
 is the whole process of cultural change ' 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.600
 it's a process of giving you this candidate city 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.530
 urban infrastructure 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.850
 according to the environmental preservation loop 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 sports park multiplexing 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.240
 including me looking pro the municipal and state public schools 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.160
 proscribed grow up practice sports with good physical education professionals 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
 to make good use of the structure 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.850
 that was then left of the Pan-American Games this has to be a 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.650
 Concomitant action ethic of having already visited the media has several times 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.150
 Barcelona has already had 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.690
 at 82 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.440
 so much that it already had 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.640
 or because in Brazil 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.030
 the prejudice against markets 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.000
 to get the achievement 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.200
 How much money 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.500
 is the party being a donor is spent and only for the application dossier and 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.369
 presentation of these 85 million reais that the government 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.140
 for the entire population 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.950
 the funorte of rio de janeiro that is an application can assure its vacancy 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.120
 the rate must be invested in the public school 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.280
 It's not the time to make an Olympics, I'm a little lost in the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.700
 Brazil, when Brazil has conditions, you really can 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.930
 a truck project was launched 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.150
 with which there is not so much political interference and better planned 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.430
 I think so 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.280
 the opinion of his mother regarding his colleagues with the 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.370
 visitor experience we are all together 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.550
 I do not think there is much experience completely misplaced. 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.630
 that Brazil hosts the world cup 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.630
 the games to win 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:28.720
 thanks 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.129
 I have doubts 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.129
 the first one I have doubts so do not use 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:36.769
 we will be able to decide something 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.929
 olympic games that 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:43.679
 China has evidently shown that we do not need to do as china but 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:45.189
 she showed 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.189
 the altitude 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:54.169
 investment and planning the way we are organized today 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:57.249
 In Brazil, the Olympic sport in Brazil, I think we 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:00.879
 the saints have the pretension of being the Amazon headquarters the development that we 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.019
 we can have 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.050
 is the inclusion of an olympiad in Brazil - it will be huge 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.589
 It's up to one hour. 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:11.599
 we passed one to a much higher level than we meet today 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.419
 that's the main reason 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:18.119
 Brazil or the people in my opinion should fight for hosting an Olympiad 

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:20.679
 that year held in birmingham 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:23.589
 we tried an administrative revolution 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:25.739
 very big in brazil 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.739
 We do not look in your friendly Brazilian sport face. 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:33.229
 on the sports ministry website we can not put everything of my everything 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.559
 the doctor who can walk for example which proposal is at sea 

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:39.429
 a joke anomaly 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:43.490
 if they do not have to work, who also put five and provide 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.979
 the bet is that for the party 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:47.369
 is the athlete 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:50.369
 it's a loss 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:00.709
 here we are in Brazil 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.459
 I try in a constructive way but really have to have a better 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.209
 profit in 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.529
 is so that a soul 

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:12.779
 Olympic bid is not just to host an event 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:18.169
 I you transform a society a technical overseer cleansing cleaner 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.169
 at least in that moment he will not fool anyone 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:26.029
 A good born with Brazil from the point of view 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:29.029
 of its development as the country 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.620
 I think it's interesting 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.039
 more civilian if they are 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:35.939
 this whole year is 

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:37.740
 Similarly 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.319
 What was the Pan-American? 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:43.759
 I think the team is not always dangerous 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:46.370
 the right job 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.539
 I think we talk 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.430
 the action the rooms of the white house forming area I am very pessimistic 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.590
 on the negative side 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.800
 in the next days 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.889
 currently the generation 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.860
 the country will improve with this 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.389
 courteous to have the flag of Brazil one of the flags 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.129
 my opinion is that it does not extend also says prepared 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.110
 Why should Brazil? 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.110
 is a citizen who has been published 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:19.349
 we approve because the procopa program quoted the source 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.460
 in Brazil there is no future with much fear 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.169
 It has nothing to do with it. 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.620
 the problem is that this is going to be what it is 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.240
 Just kidding 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.289
 by the company caught ball pumped to put the face with fable but the truth 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:34.629
 is that 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:36.090
 got lucky 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.540
 this cpi will leave now said the premier yesterday 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.020
 this can harm 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.289
 the olympiad 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.289
 the Rio de Janeiro 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:45.069
 next day 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:47.990
 could hurt the olympics in Rio de Janeiro 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.460
 he died afterwards a complaint of corruption in the use of 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.970
 I'll give you the next one if you're going to clean it and the grandfather I think Brazil has 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.460
 to prepare 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.460
 the technique 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.389
 two Olympic medals 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:06.409
 it's a done 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:11.489
 see the importance of a family that fought and bet a lot to make the child 

00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:15.189
 the first Olympic champion in Brazilian swimming history 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.110
