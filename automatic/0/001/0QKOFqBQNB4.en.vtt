00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
he's moving with the ball you know it's

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.830

easy getting past defenders is really

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.660 
easy getting past defenders is really
really<00:02:54.050> fun<00:02:54.380> playing<00:02:54.830> with<00:02:54.890> this<00:02:55.130> card<00:02:55.430> and

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
really fun playing with this card and

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.130 
really fun playing with this card and
that<00:02:56.300> is<00:02:56.420> round<00:02:56.780> FIFA<00:02:57.290> nowadays<00:02:57.770> and<00:02:58.070> yeah<00:02:59.140> one

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
that is round FIFA nowadays and yeah one

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.080 
that is round FIFA nowadays and yeah one
little<00:03:00.470> dump<00:03:00.860> site<00:03:01.130> is<00:03:01.340> attacking

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
little dump site is attacking

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.180 
little dump site is attacking
positioning<00:03:02.630> as<00:03:02.780> I<00:03:02.840> predict<00:03:03.410> then<00:03:03.620> again<00:03:03.920> it

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
positioning as I predict then again it

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.940 
positioning as I predict then again it
is<00:03:04.640> slightly<00:03:05.030> off<00:03:05.390> sometimes<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:06.560> takes<00:03:06.709> them

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
is slightly off sometimes it takes them

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.440 
is slightly off sometimes it takes them
a<00:03:07.010> wild<00:03:07.250> again<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.700> box<00:03:07.940> so<00:03:08.120> if<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.300> do<00:03:08.420> want

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
a wild again the box so if you do want

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.830 
a wild again the box so if you do want
to<00:03:08.630> cross<00:03:08.900> in<00:03:09.140> then<00:03:09.890> he's<00:03:10.459> not<00:03:10.730> always<00:03:11.450> there

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
to cross in then he's not always there

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.320 
to cross in then he's not always there
and<00:03:12.080> that's<00:03:12.560> like<00:03:13.070> a<00:03:13.130> bit<00:03:13.610> of<00:03:13.640> a<00:03:13.790> downside

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
and that's like a bit of a downside

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.210 
and that's like a bit of a downside
especially<00:03:14.989> if<00:03:15.080> you're<00:03:15.230> using<00:03:15.410> him<00:03:15.709> as<00:03:15.769> a<00:03:15.920> solo

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
especially if you're using him as a solo

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.160 
especially if you're using him as a solo
striker<00:03:16.670> you<00:03:17.000> know<00:03:17.090> your<00:03:17.300> stray<00:03:17.660> into

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
striker you know your stray into

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.340 
striker you know your stray into
midfield<00:03:18.580> sometimes<00:03:19.580> but<00:03:20.269> you<00:03:20.930> could<00:03:21.140> get

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
midfield sometimes but you could get

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.220 
midfield sometimes but you could get
away<00:03:21.470> with<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:21.920> sometimes<00:03:22.580> because<00:03:23.390> you

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
away with that sometimes because you

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.100 
away with that sometimes because you
know<00:03:24.350> is<00:03:24.950> passing<00:03:25.610> makes<00:03:26.269> up<00:03:26.540> for<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:26.870> like

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
know is passing makes up for it like

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.550 
know is passing makes up for it like
it's<00:03:27.440> through<00:03:27.769> balls<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.340> is<00:03:28.510> 12<00:03:29.510> passes<00:03:30.019> with

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
it's through balls and is 12 passes with

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.410 
it's through balls and is 12 passes with
his<00:03:30.709> teammates<00:03:31.130> seem<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.549> be<00:03:31.670> very<00:03:31.700> very<00:03:32.299> good

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
his teammates seem to be very very good

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.900 
his teammates seem to be very very good
so<00:03:33.290> for<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.680> strike<00:03:33.950> of<00:03:34.100> that<00:03:34.250> is<00:03:34.400> really<00:03:34.790> really

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
so for a strike of that is really really

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.970 
so for a strike of that is really really
weird<00:03:35.030> since<00:03:35.450> he's<00:03:35.570> only<00:03:35.720> got<00:03:35.930> 61<00:03:36.410> passing<00:03:36.890> I

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
weird since he's only got 61 passing I

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.190 
weird since he's only got 61 passing I
wasn't<00:03:37.280> expecting<00:03:37.519> that<00:03:37.880> but<00:03:38.269> yeah<00:03:38.600> it<00:03:39.110> was

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
wasn't expecting that but yeah it was

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.650 
wasn't expecting that but yeah it was
absolutely<00:03:39.920> fantastic<00:03:40.220> I<00:03:40.850> used<00:03:41.329> him<00:03:41.480> in<00:03:41.570> a
