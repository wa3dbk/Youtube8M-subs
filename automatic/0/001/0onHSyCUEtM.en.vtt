00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.170
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:10.380
 another unboxing thing in here 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.200
 I'm really into that 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.450
 long waited and wanted me too 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.279
 order longer 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:23.699
 I do not say you see so close to 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:28.170
 title but it remains exciting to 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:33.510
 current time for this is here 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.440
 my new keyboard yes says cozza 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.559
 remove them 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.170
 the looks chic which is 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.930
 should be pretty easy to guess 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.620
 I guess now and that 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.610
 corsair vengeance k70 is there again 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:54.840
 with gaming keyboard keyboard layout 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.789
 German I'm curious but still 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.609
 anything else it says there is 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:06.740
 yes it even stands windy it looks there 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:09.990
 There cherry mx stands like switches 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.500
 customizer beck headwear and it 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.049
 surely gives outlines for the wsd buttons 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.590
 and we are right with other buttons 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.759
 ingenious 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.750
 which means you can I for such a 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.939
 highlight a bit and that the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.350
 have another feeling 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.400
 so you can speak so to speak for people 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.330
 do not write ten fingers now 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 can or something 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.229
 that then really without 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.939
 if they can meet 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.220
 now and again come right back 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.960
 on the sd or something 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.060
 that would be such an example of 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.020
 field of use 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.270
 there you see the mx rap switches is that 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.869
 hot 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.680
 why a new keyboard my razer 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.689
 blackwidow ultimate is just too loud 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.970
 Now we have some people again 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.460
 and that's why it became real 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.560
 time that a quiet literature comes from 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.930
 and this time with mechanical 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.070
 mechanical switches for gambling 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.790
 are suitable 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.370
 the mx blood switches are the ones of 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.380
 the razer blackwidow 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.060
 they are not very shocking 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.780
 they are damn loud and above all 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.730
 not suitable for youtube videos 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.480
 yes and now the keyboard barely 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.550
 still hear 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.620
 in the background and no 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.090
 Look what I would say 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.290
 a big advantage 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.490
 yes this is normal course par 70 me 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.050
 somehow think of memory 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.940
 when I see it that way 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.530
 corser people of working memory 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.600
 exactly the same name yes one 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.880
 palm rest is also there but 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.160
 I just do it out I quite 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.940
 wait next to it 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.900
 It does not matter what on the packaging 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.910
 stands 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.320
 I want to see it was the last video 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.830
 yes no real unboxing sorry 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.150
 for this 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.320
 I think I'll hang something else 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.320
 in the back like they probably are now 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.430
 probably about the same 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.730
 at the same time as an initiator and and that 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.930
 microphone to boxee and I will because of that 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.190
 with microphone still pending so 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:22.280
 that you can see the microphone again 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:23.420
 gets that feels so cool and 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.050
 announces first take out 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.050
 somehow 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.690
 Stylish is indeed synonymous that the cable too 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.810
 are good 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.860
 fitting to the mx red switches i hope 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.330
 they'll be hot now 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:49.290
 yes, if so creates usb twice 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.900
 I'll see if that knows the usd port 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.930
 year it has okay there is a usb port 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.980
 you might know right here 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.340
 Not at all, I just have it that way 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.770
 because of the price performance 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.400
 even with the best was the price 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:11.010
 is currently at 115 euros for this 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:13.560
 Variation here, at least I think so 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.519
 I'm still a bit higher 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.519
 I'm not sure anymore 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.769
 get rid of plastic first 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.770
 that's how christmas wanted human 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:35.670
 So that works damn high quality that 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.160
 Here you can see all aluminum too 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.940
 maybe or not aluminum nickel 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.190
 aluminum is brushed steel 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.350
 stall I have to look in any case 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.140
 what metallic space button feels 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.170
 really cool that is synonymous has so synonymous 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.550
 his contour moment tries to show 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.960
 the camera piece rath other way so 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.590
 It is very difficult to score any goal 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.380
 produce 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:04.940
 but you can see it, I think so 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:04.940
 we see buttons are pretty quiet 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:15.410
 You can wave a bit more 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:17.970
 but there is no war to report 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.740
 really cool and how you look 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.940
 are also a bit off that is 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:26.310
 they can now solve directly 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:28.920
 also made very cool there is behind and 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.570
 at Ausschalter one sees maybe 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.790
 also that is at east ran and then 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:37.500
 pay 1 to 8 14 12 48 can be seen 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.680
 maybe not quite as good but first 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:44.550
 From above corsair logo I can always off 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:48.180
 make this plastic very much here 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:51.090
 I have to say chic and in use them 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.870
 then soon with lighting here yet 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:57.090
 very short user manual is also included 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:01.860
 a quick start guide and that is here 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:06.900
 want right and here we still have 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:08.100
 the buttons with contour also not 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.900
 bad then here is a rubber ring 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.440
 what does it have to do first 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.530
 find out 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.380
 but well, what thanks for that 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:19.710
 Watch the unboxing of the corsair 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:22.320
 vengeance k70 mechanical keyboard with 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:28.490
 mx rap I quite possibly still hold 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:34.620
 show what was then 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:39.450
 there you see the mx red button so looks 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:42.920
 So it does not matter at all here 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:45.990
 Noise is very easy to press 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.790
 really cool so that's it 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.040
 we will not forget to comment 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:53.370
 do not forget write something in the 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.660
 comments and would sometimes me 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.520
 What are you interested in for keyboards 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.520
 So I am happy and am
