00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 so recoucou everyone it was for 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.790
 introduce you to the cloud turtle b in 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.370
 black here so I have already read but in 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.650
 blue has it so finally when we can see 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.109
 so that it projects many stars 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.859
 the stars are very clear as we 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:23.100
 can see these wonderful moments and 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.460
 greet a thousand really shell there the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.560
 blue 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.689
 so we can go the same way 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.009
 color at the glass level here and the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.390
 stars at the pad 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.790
 so it's late according to the stars 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.710
 during her fixed she does not move there 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.559
 there is no music so with one side 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.420
 I sleep again to make my daughter sleep 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.520
 with us in the purchase it's all 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.039
 the year finally it lasts 45 minutes 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.200
 projection for 45 minutes to see 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.010
 stars move it I'll have a 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.870
 little heartache 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.879
 so me it suits me very well 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.190
 to be fixed a little star 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.300
 so here we see it well this is 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.680
 me moving the product but we see 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.199
 although they are good 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.000
 so be it here we see the little ones 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.010
 different logos that also light up 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.659
 can do it so 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.450
 and it's really a night light I want 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.479
 to say there we see my veil besides me 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.950
 see her so I hope you see her 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.080
 but I mean it's bathing 3 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.520
 so that's it if we do not want we can 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.850
 do even both I mean we want 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.520
 make the night light more the star in blue 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.259
 or in glass what can we really do 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.700
 it is a product that is really very 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.369
 well I know that I tested 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.920
 different night light and me I cube is 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.750
 really it's a good old to 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.579
 1g caps say the product of the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.020
 companies is a nightmare worry 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.929
 still something 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.600
 in front of icons is really good it's 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.039
 true she achala cost a cost a 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.060
 little expensive anyway for a night light 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.530
 I still believe it cost 35 euros 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.210
 but I mean I do not regret the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.679
 all because in addition to that as we have 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.649
 have seen we can use it also in 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.759
 stuffed so here and my daughter was going 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.420
 immediately when she sees 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.060
 little stars 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.649
 So here it helps baby sleep well and 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.319
 frankly it's a good brand so 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.769
 I recommend it to you so bah say 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.769
 Moscow
