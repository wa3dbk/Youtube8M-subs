00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
today I have two things that I brought

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.000 
today I have two things that I brought
with<00:00:21.300> me<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.690> Venice<00:00:21.960> last<00:00:22.140> week<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.770> wanted

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
with me to Venice last week and I wanted

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.170 
with me to Venice last week and I wanted
to<00:00:23.100> show<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.369> before<00:00:23.700> I<00:00:23.910> wrote<00:00:24.420> about<00:00:24.570> them<00:00:26.180> to

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
to show you before I wrote about them to

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.240 
to show you before I wrote about them to
me<00:00:27.360> it<00:00:27.480> matches<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.020> aesthetic<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:29.070> Leica

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
me it matches the aesthetic of a Leica

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.720 
me it matches the aesthetic of a Leica
camera<00:00:29.869> this<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.290> probably<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.220> tiniest

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
camera this is probably the tiniest

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.970 
camera this is probably the tiniest
camera<00:00:33.300> bag<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.020> could<00:00:34.350> contend<00:00:34.739> with

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
camera bag that you could contend with

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.549 
camera bag that you could contend with
and<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.760> think<00:00:36.150> it<00:00:36.390> works<00:00:36.570> really<00:00:36.720> well<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.500> has

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
and I think it works really well it has

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.670 
and I think it works really well it has
a<00:00:38.100> small<00:00:38.519> slot<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> inside<00:00:40.140> I'll<00:00:40.440> show<00:00:40.620> you

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
a small slot on the inside I'll show you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.490 
a small slot on the inside I'll show you
a<00:00:40.800> detail<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.519> a<00:00:41.550> second<00:00:42.080> for<00:00:43.080> an<00:00:43.170> SD

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
a detail of it in a second for an SD

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.509 
a detail of it in a second for an SD
card<00:00:45.620> it<00:00:46.620> feels<00:00:46.949> like<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.250> would<00:00:47.340> probably

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
card it feels like it would probably

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:48.680 
card it feels like it would probably
last<00:00:47.820> for<00:00:48.120> 50<00:00:48.420> years

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
last for 50 years

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.410 
last for 50 years
so<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.680> was<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.610> was<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.940> good<00:00:51.059> experience

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
so it was a it was a good experience

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.280 
so it was a it was a good experience
using<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:52.229> bag<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:53.159> other<00:00:53.370> thing<00:00:53.820> that

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
using this bag the other thing that

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.649 
using this bag the other thing that
photo<00:00:55.290> village<00:00:55.589> gave<00:00:55.769> me<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.949> test<00:00:56.670> out<00:00:56.940> was<00:00:57.330> a

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
photo village gave me to test out was a

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:03.649 
photo village gave me to test out was a
35<00:00:58.500> millimeter<00:00:58.979> Civic<00:00:59.370> Ron<00:01:01.940> it<00:01:02.940> turned<00:01:03.299> out<00:01:03.449> to

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
35 millimeter Civic Ron it turned out to

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.219 
35 millimeter Civic Ron it turned out to
be<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:04.110> really<00:01:04.710> great<00:01:05.010> travel<00:01:05.610> less-good

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
be a really great travel less-good

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.380 
be a really great travel less-good
portraits<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.500> could<00:01:08.040> handle<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:09.119> narrow

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
portraits and could handle the narrow

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.020 
portraits and could handle the narrow
alleyways<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.229> Venice<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.760> know<00:01:11.880> the

churches<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:12.780> architecture<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.159> it

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
churches and the architecture so it

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.520 
churches and the architecture so it
really<00:01:14.909> allowed<00:01:15.299> me<00:01:15.510> to<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:15.689> focus<00:01:16.500> on

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
really allowed me to just focus on

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.219 
really allowed me to just focus on
taking<00:01:17.460> pictures<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.270> not<00:01:18.510> fumbling<00:01:19.020> with

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
taking pictures and not fumbling with

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:27.130 
taking pictures and not fumbling with

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
this lens is going to favor places where

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.460 
this lens is going to favor places where
wide-angle<00:01:32.460> photography<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.270> gonna<00:01:33.510> come

to make sure that your f-stop is already

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.140 
to make sure that your f-stop is already
taken<00:02:10.800> care<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.070> because<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.820> little

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
taken care of because it's a little

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.690 
taken care of because it's a little
tricky<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.540> adjust<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.320> if<00:02:13.500> you're<00:02:14.100> focusing

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.820 

I<00:02:25.850> really<00:02:26.850> enjoyed<00:02:27.270> how<00:02:27.540> compact<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:28.290> lens

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
I really enjoyed how compact this lens

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.610 
I really enjoyed how compact this lens
was<00:02:29.100> if<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:29.550> look<00:02:29.910> at<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.209> without<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.110> hood<00:02:31.290> I

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
was if you look at it without the hood I

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:42.110 
was if you look at it without the hood I
mean<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.910> total<00:02:33.090> pancake<00:02:40.670> if<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:42.000> are

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
mean it's a total pancake if you are

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.530 
mean it's a total pancake if you are
just<00:02:42.750> getting<00:02:42.930> started<00:02:43.470> in<00:02:43.560> rangefinder

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
spend a whole lot of money but get a

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.800 
spend a whole lot of money but get a
really<00:02:49.890> versatile<00:02:50.400> lens<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.360> will<00:02:51.480> keep<00:02:51.690> you

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
busy overall I'd say that this this one

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.930 
busy overall I'd say that this this one
is<00:03:01.200> really<00:03:01.380> this<00:03:02.040> one's<00:03:02.280> really<00:03:02.459> works<00:03:02.760> if<00:03:02.880> I

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
is really this one's really works if I

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.500 
is really this one's really works if I
