00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:09.500
 Hello everyone, I have here for you 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.769
 such a beautiful openwork pattern 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:19.230
 asterisks or snowflakes can somehow 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:22.220
 can be called such a pattern 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.220
 blouse 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.490
 jacket can knit hats 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.270
 he fit very easily 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.329
 and it looks beautiful from the front 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.530
 looks like this from the wrong side 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.629
 he looks like that 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.450
 we associate a pattern and require 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.680
 dial loop number multiple of three + 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.820
 two additional loops for symmetry 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.690
 pattern and 2 edge I typed 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:04.110
 22 loops and let's get down to knitting 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:07.560
 and so knit the first row edge loop 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:17.270
 we remove further we knit one facial 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:20.250
 and the next 3 loops together three loops 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.259
 knit together facial as follows 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.799
 way 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:31.680
 one loop knit doing grab 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:40.740
 filament and again and shoot with us 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:43.200
 it turns out three loops and again 3 loops 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.600
 together facial 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:51.360
 pulling the loop we catch the thread and 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:57.270
 knit another loop get 3 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:00.259
 loop and remove and so on knit on 3 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.259
 loops together facial 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:14.550
 to end of row 3 together facial 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.470
 in this way 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:31.510
 pull the loop picks up the thread and more 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.630
 just knitting one and at the end of the row 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:39.459
 we knit one face and last 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:44.280
 knitting on the purl all 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:49.110
 even rows we knit loops by drawing 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.110
 that is, knit with purl loops 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.380
 knit each loop with a purl 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.380
 loop 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:09.329
 knit to the end of the row all the even rows 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.329
 purl loops 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:34.360
 and so the second row we knit further 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.800
 knit 3 row edge loop remove and 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:41.000
 further knit 3 loops together 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:46.820
 front 5 so as not to get confused here 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.130
 see 3 5 place we have these 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.400
 there were snowflake stars 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.300
 beautifully needed so that they are located on 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.110
 diagonals 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:02.840
 in this way and for that both 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:05.180
 navigate here when knit 3 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:11.330
 loops together the front here we have here 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:16.220
 there is such a hole here it is them and run 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:19.400
 take one loop in front of this hole 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.700
 and two loops after it, that is, such 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:26.050
 we knit 3 loops together 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:29.930
 facial make grab the thread and 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:33.080
 provyazyvaem here she starred again in 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.870
 we get one loop from here and 2 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.560
 from here and then we will have it going 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:45.350
 right diagonally this way 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:50.980
 and again we catch and knit 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.980
 until the end of row 3 loops together facial 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.600
 like this 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:10.249
 three loops sing facial knit one 

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:15.519
 loop we catch the thread and again 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:15.519
 extending 3 loops 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:26.989
 once again 3 loops together and at the end of the row y 

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:32.479
 we get 2 facial and last 

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:36.759
 knitting on the back and again 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:44.779
 repeat the next row knit 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:50.379
 completely purlable all even rows 

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:50.379
 knit on the pattern of purl loops 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:22.680
 knotted a series of purl loops and 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:27.300
 We repeat again from the first row an edge 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:31.680
 remove 2 face loops and then 3 loops 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:34.800
 together facial in this way and here 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.680
 it turns out so beautiful openwork 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:42.650
 pattern 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:49.500
