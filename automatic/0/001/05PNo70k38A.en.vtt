00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.019 

here's<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:03.989> white<00:00:04.170> clip<00:00:04.500> and<00:00:04.880> we<00:00:05.880> mentioned

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
here's the white clip and we mentioned

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.900 
here's the white clip and we mentioned
this<00:00:06.269> before<00:00:06.450> but<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:07.380> white<00:00:07.590> clip<00:00:07.920> basically

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
this before but the white clip basically

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.900 
this before but the white clip basically
lets<00:00:09.210> us<00:00:09.420> clip<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.650> levels<00:00:11.100> into<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.370> broadcast

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
lets us clip the levels into a broadcast

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.460 
lets us clip the levels into a broadcast
safe<00:00:12.210> form<00:00:12.540> at<00:00:12.920> the<00:00:13.920> maximum<00:00:14.309> broadcast<00:00:14.820> safe

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
safe form at the maximum broadcast safe

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.939 
safe form at the maximum broadcast safe
white<00:00:16.470> levels<00:00:16.830> are<00:00:17.039> 100<00:00:17.849> I<00:00:18.000> re<00:00:18.179> so<00:00:19.140> if<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:19.710> go<00:00:19.890> to

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
white levels are 100 I re so if we go to

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.060 
white levels are 100 I re so if we go to
100<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.670> can<00:00:20.880> see<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.650> brightest

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
100 you can see that the the brightest

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.710 
100 you can see that the the brightest
white<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.610> I'm<00:00:24.060> thinking<00:00:24.300> about<00:00:24.600> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
white and I'm thinking about the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.410 
white and I'm thinking about the
highlight<00:00:25.110> on<00:00:25.289> Derek's<00:00:25.949> forehead<00:00:26.400> here<00:00:26.609> has

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
highlight on Derek's forehead here has

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.400 
highlight on Derek's forehead here has
been<00:00:27.449> clipped<00:00:28.140> down<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.920> 100<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.670> re<00:00:30.050> now<00:00:31.050> if<00:00:31.350> we

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
been clipped down to 100 I re now if we

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.889 
been clipped down to 100 I re now if we
shoot<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.250> 108<00:00:32.789> and<00:00:33.120> we're<00:00:33.269> not<00:00:33.480> directly

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
shoot on 108 and we're not directly

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.420 
shoot on 108 and we're not directly
broadcasting<00:00:34.620> what<00:00:34.739> we're<00:00:34.890> shooting<00:00:35.039> we're

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
broadcasting what we're shooting we're

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.430 
broadcasting what we're shooting we're
going<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.610> color<00:00:35.790> correct<00:00:35.970> and<00:00:36.270> post<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.809> gives

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
going to color correct and post it gives

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.460 
going to color correct and post it gives
us<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.649> little<00:00:37.800> more<00:00:37.920> wiggle<00:00:38.190> room<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:39.470> extend

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
us a little more wiggle room to extend

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.410 
us a little more wiggle room to extend
the<00:00:40.649> values<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.309> were<00:00:41.670> actually<00:00:41.820> recording

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
the values that were actually recording

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.080 
the values that were actually recording
to<00:00:42.540> tape<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:44.040> level<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.430> 108<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.940> what<00:00:45.059> i

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
to tape so a level of 108 is what i

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.299 
to tape so a level of 108 is what i
normally<00:00:45.180> use<00:00:45.719> unless<00:00:46.590> i'm<00:00:46.739> going<00:00:46.950> direct<00:00:47.250> to

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
normally use unless i'm going direct to

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.340 
normally use unless i'm going direct to
broadcast<00:00:47.850> then<00:00:48.450> i<00:00:48.480> would<00:00:48.719> essentially<00:00:49.230> be

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
broadcast then i would essentially be

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.500 
broadcast then i would essentially be
required<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.829> put<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.250> 100<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.450> make

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
required to put it on 100 just to make

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.119 
required to put it on 100 just to make
sure<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.899> we're<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.290> safe<00:00:52.559> zone<00:00:52.590> for

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
sure that we're in a safe zone for

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.709 
sure that we're in a safe zone for
broadcast<00:00:54.000> we're<00:00:54.239> not<00:00:54.360> going<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.539> broadcast

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
broadcast we're not going to broadcast

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.270 
broadcast we're not going to broadcast
any<00:00:55.140> illegal<00:00:56.039> levels

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.289 

so<00:01:01.270> here's<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.660> knee<00:01:01.780> control<00:01:02.940> now<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.000> knee

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
so here's the knee control now the knee

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.070 
so here's the knee control now the knee
control<00:01:05.310> has<00:01:06.310> essentially<00:01:06.940> two<00:01:07.150> options

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
control has essentially two options

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.760 
control has essentially two options
manual<00:01:08.619> and<00:01:08.799> auto<00:01:09.659> now<00:01:10.659> a<00:01:11.020> lot<00:01:11.320> of<00:01:11.350> people<00:01:11.500> use

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
manual and auto now a lot of people use

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.280 
manual and auto now a lot of people use
auto<00:01:12.040> I<00:01:12.310> personally<00:01:13.060> like<00:01:13.270> to<00:01:13.299> use<00:01:13.450> manual<00:01:13.900> so

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
auto I personally like to use manual so

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.850 
auto I personally like to use manual so
that<00:01:14.320> I<00:01:14.500> can<00:01:14.560> control<00:01:15.070> how<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.970> curve<00:01:16.509> is

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that I can control how the curve is

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.950 
that I can control how the curve is
actually<00:01:17.860> reacting<00:01:18.460> to<00:01:18.640> my<00:01:19.240> highlights<00:01:19.690> at

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
actually reacting to my highlights at

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.620 
actually reacting to my highlights at
the<00:01:20.590> moment<00:01:21.009> my<00:01:21.100> knee<00:01:21.159> is<00:01:21.670> set<00:01:22.000> on<00:01:22.030> one<00:01:22.270> hundred

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
the moment my knee is set on one hundred

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.560 
the moment my knee is set on one hundred
percent<00:01:22.659> and<00:01:23.290> you<00:01:23.890> can<00:01:24.040> see<00:01:24.310> that<00:01:24.580> in<00:01:25.299> this

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
percent and you can see that in this

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.289 
percent and you can see that in this
situation<00:01:25.960> we<00:01:26.440> have<00:01:26.979> a<00:01:27.130> very<00:01:27.369> hot<00:01:27.700> spot<00:01:28.090> on

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
situation we have a very hot spot on

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.450 
situation we have a very hot spot on
Derek's<00:01:28.600> forehead<00:01:29.020> at<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.259> moment<00:01:29.560> now<00:01:30.280> what

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
Derek's forehead at the moment now what

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.889 
Derek's forehead at the moment now what
I'm<00:01:30.549> going<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.729> do<00:01:30.970> is<00:01:31.090> I'm<00:01:31.180> going<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.330> turn<00:01:31.570> the

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
I'm going to do is I'm going to turn the

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.380 
I'm going to do is I'm going to turn the
level<00:01:32.229> down<00:01:32.380> of<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:32.740> knee<00:01:32.920> and<00:01:33.190> I'm<00:01:33.970> only

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
level down of the knee and I'm only

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.840 
level down of the knee and I'm only
controlling<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.800> top<00:01:36.130> part<00:01:36.460> of<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.610> curve

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
controlling the top part of the curve

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.660 
controlling the top part of the curve
just<00:01:37.149> the<00:01:37.300> highlights<00:01:37.690> so<00:01:38.440> I'm<00:01:38.560> really<00:01:38.920> when<00:01:39.640> I

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
just the highlights so I'm really when I

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.800 
just the highlights so I'm really when I
turn<00:01:39.940> this<00:01:40.119> down<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:41.560> can<00:01:41.740> see<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.780> that

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
turn this down you can see that that

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.180 
turn this down you can see that that
highlight<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:45.490> rolls<00:01:45.759> off<00:01:45.970> a<00:01:46.030> little<00:01:46.539> softer

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
highlight just rolls off a little softer

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.830 
highlight just rolls off a little softer
into<00:01:48.190> white<00:01:48.429> instead<00:01:48.970> of<00:01:49.119> just<00:01:49.270> clipping<00:01:49.600> to

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
into white instead of just clipping to

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.109 
into white instead of just clipping to
white<00:01:50.020> now<00:01:50.770> it's<00:01:50.950> rolling<00:01:51.369> off<00:01:51.520> into<00:01:51.880> white

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
white now it's rolling off into white

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.540 
white now it's rolling off into white
and<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:53.350> knee<00:01:53.500> circuit<00:01:53.890> can<00:01:54.039> go<00:01:54.159> as<00:01:54.280> low<00:01:54.520> as

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
and the knee circuit can go as low as

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.969 
and the knee circuit can go as low as
eighty<00:01:54.880> percent<00:01:55.119> which<00:01:55.539> is<00:01:55.720> really<00:01:56.050> great<00:01:56.920> for

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
eighty percent which is really great for

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.550 
eighty percent which is really great for
giving<00:01:57.909> us<00:01:58.030> very<00:01:58.450> much<00:01:58.509> a<00:01:58.630> film<00:01:58.990> look<00:01:59.289> and

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
giving us very much a film look and

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.620 
giving us very much a film look and
getting<00:02:00.130> away<00:02:00.220> from<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.759> video<00:02:00.940> clipping

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
getting away from the video clipping

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.630 
getting away from the video clipping
that<00:02:01.810> is<00:02:01.990> normally<00:02:02.740> associated<00:02:02.950> with<00:02:03.399> most

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
that is normally associated with most

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.580 
that is normally associated with most
video<00:02:04.090> cameras<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:06.869> we<00:02:07.869> can<00:02:08.049> see<00:02:08.290> on<00:02:08.470> the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
video cameras and we can see on the

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.509 
video cameras and we can see on the
chart<00:02:09.929> exactly<00:02:10.929> what<00:02:11.079> happens<00:02:11.560> once<00:02:11.980> we<00:02:12.250> start

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
chart exactly what happens once we start

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.690 
chart exactly what happens once we start
turning<00:02:12.850> it<00:02:12.940> down<00:02:14.190> we<00:02:15.190> start<00:02:15.489> to<00:02:15.579> get

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
turning it down we start to get

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.440 
turning it down we start to get
definition<00:02:16.390> in<00:02:16.600> those<00:02:17.440> in<00:02:18.130> those<00:02:18.190> white<00:02:19.030> chips

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
definition in those in those white chips

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.380 
definition in those in those white chips
I'm<00:02:20.380> thinking<00:02:20.709> about<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:21.489> last<00:02:21.730> three<00:02:22.120> on<00:02:22.269> the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
I'm thinking about the last three on the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.990 
I'm thinking about the last three on the
right<00:02:22.570> we<00:02:23.380> really<00:02:24.130> can<00:02:24.340> define<00:02:24.760> the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
right we really can define the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.940 
right we really can define the
differences<00:02:25.720> in<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.079> in<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.320> three<00:02:26.650> chips

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
differences in the in the three chips

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.890 
differences in the in the three chips
and<00:02:27.220> if<00:02:27.310> we<00:02:27.400> put<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.700> on<00:02:27.820> one<00:02:28.540> hundred<00:02:28.870> percent

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
and if we put it on one hundred percent

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.880 
and if we put it on one hundred percent
we<00:02:29.590> start<00:02:29.829> to<00:02:29.920> get<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.070> little<00:02:30.130> bit<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.459> clipping
