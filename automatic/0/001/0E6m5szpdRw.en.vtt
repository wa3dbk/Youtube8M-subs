surgery they all offer something and

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.229 
surgery they all offer something and
they<00:02:35.750> offer<00:02:35.900> something<00:02:36.319> different<00:02:37.209> what<00:02:38.209> I

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
they offer something different what I

they offer something different what I
like<00:02:38.629> to<00:02:38.780> do<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:39.019> work<00:02:39.319> with<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:39.739> patients

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
like to do is work with the patients

like to do is work with the patients
talk<00:02:40.640> with<00:02:40.879> the<00:02:41.000> patient<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.659> find<00:02:41.959> out<00:02:42.140> what

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
talk with the patient and find out what

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.680 
talk with the patient and find out what
their<00:02:42.769> most<00:02:43.040> important<00:02:43.549> criteria<00:02:43.690> for

their most important criteria for
example<00:02:45.019> if<00:02:45.109> you're<00:02:45.230> going<00:02:45.319> to<00:02:45.379> go<00:02:45.500> buy<00:02:45.620> a<00:02:45.650> car

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
example if you're going to go buy a car

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.800 
example if you're going to go buy a car
there's<00:02:46.730> something<00:02:47.090> you've<00:02:47.209> got<00:02:47.239> at<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.599> top

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
there's something you've got at the top

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.690 
there's something you've got at the top
of<00:02:47.840> list<00:02:48.200> whatever<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:48.859> may<00:02:48.980> be<00:02:49.010> maybe<00:02:49.489> its

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
of list whatever it may be maybe its

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.640 
of list whatever it may be maybe its
speed<00:02:50.060> maybe<00:02:50.750> it's<00:02:51.049> you<00:02:51.290> know<00:02:52.569> reliability

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
speed maybe it's you know reliability

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.990 
speed maybe it's you know reliability
there's<00:02:54.650> something<00:02:55.099> at<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.400> top<00:02:55.640> of<00:02:55.670> your

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
there's something at the top of your

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000 
there's something at the top of your
list<00:02:56.299> and<00:02:56.659> you<00:02:57.200> need<00:02:57.379> to<00:02:57.500> take<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:57.829> same

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
list and you need to take that same

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.050 
list and you need to take that same
approach<00:02:58.129> with<00:02:58.310> weight<00:02:58.670> loss<00:02:58.700> surgery

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
approach with weight loss surgery

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.319 
approach with weight loss surgery
because<00:02:59.720> they<00:02:59.959> offer<00:03:00.290> something<00:03:00.620> different

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
because they offer something different

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.910 
because they offer something different
briefly<00:03:02.329> for<00:03:02.870> example<00:03:03.349> the<00:03:03.530> gastric<00:03:03.890> bypass

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
briefly for example the gastric bypass

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.339 
briefly for example the gastric bypass
is<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.790> bigger<00:03:05.060> operation<00:03:05.959> it's

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
is the bigger operation it's

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.259 
is the bigger operation it's
non-reversible<00:03:07.010> but<00:03:07.670> it's<00:03:07.819> also<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.209> most

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
non-reversible but it's also the most

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.780 
non-reversible but it's also the most
powerful<00:03:08.750> so<00:03:09.530> there's<00:03:09.739> some<00:03:10.099> reasons<00:03:10.640> to

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
powerful so there's some reasons to

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.569 
powerful so there's some reasons to
choose<00:03:10.849> that<00:03:11.269> one<00:03:11.480> their<00:03:12.440> lap<00:03:12.590> band<00:03:12.920> on<00:03:13.220> the

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
choose that one their lap band on the

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.990 
choose that one their lap band on the
other<00:03:13.730> hand<00:03:14.000> is<00:03:14.780> reversible<00:03:15.769> it<00:03:16.489> but<00:03:16.819> it's

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
other hand is reversible it but it's

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.640 
other hand is reversible it but it's
adjustable<00:03:17.540> that<00:03:17.959> requires<00:03:18.349> some

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
adjustable that requires some

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.370 
adjustable that requires some
maintenance<00:03:18.889> on<00:03:19.310> your<00:03:19.400> part<00:03:20.269> some<00:03:20.989> people

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
maintenance on your part some people

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.960 
maintenance on your part some people
want<00:03:21.530> that<00:03:21.739> some<00:03:22.069> people<00:03:22.400> don't<00:03:22.549> want<00:03:22.790> that

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
want that some people don't want that

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.879 
want that some people don't want that
and<00:03:23.180> then<00:03:23.630> finally<00:03:24.019> there's<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:24.349> gastric

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
and then finally there's the gastric

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.099 
and then finally there's the gastric
sleeve<00:03:25.220> resection<00:03:25.849> which<00:03:26.569> is<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.780> newer

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
sleeve resection which is a newer

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.979 
sleeve resection which is a newer
operation<00:03:27.919> it<00:03:28.879> seems<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.389> offer<00:03:29.599> some

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
operation it seems to offer some

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.050 
operation it seems to offer some
combinations<00:03:30.709> of<00:03:30.829> both<00:03:31.040> surgeries<00:03:31.579> with<00:03:31.849> up

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
combinations of both surgeries with up

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.909 
combinations of both surgeries with up
young<00:03:32.359> people<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:32.930> there's<00:03:33.169> there's<00:03:33.379> reasons

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:33.919 
young people so there's there's reasons

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.729 
young people so there's there's reasons
to<00:03:34.099> choose<00:03:34.160> each<00:03:34.700> one<00:03:35.030> we<00:03:35.840> don't<00:03:35.989> have<00:03:36.379> a

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
to choose each one we don't have a

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.420 
to choose each one we don't have a
diagram<00:03:37.549> for<00:03:38.540> patients<00:03:39.049> which<00:03:39.919> is<00:03:40.069> the<00:03:40.220> best

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
diagram for patients which is the best

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.309 
diagram for patients which is the best
if<00:03:40.730> there<00:03:40.940> are<00:03:41.060> queries<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:41.840> it's<00:03:41.959> a<00:03:42.079> whole

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
if there are queries and it's a whole

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.960 
if there are queries and it's a whole
moon<00:03:42.560> they<00:03:42.799> should<00:03:43.010> get<00:03:43.099> a<00:03:43.129> lap<00:03:43.310> band<00:03:43.579> and<00:03:43.879> we

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
moon they should get a lap band and we

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.400 
moon they should get a lap band and we
don't<00:03:44.090> have<00:03:44.329> that<00:03:44.389> that's<00:03:44.780> what<00:03:44.930> makes<00:03:45.139> our

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
don't have that that's what makes our

don't have that that's what makes our
specialty<00:03:45.949> fun<00:03:46.220> we<00:03:46.849> want<00:03:47.060> to<00:03:47.180> work<00:03:47.329> with<00:03:47.389> the
