00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
can actually decode the marek lifx we

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.250 
can actually decode the marek lifx we
could<00:02:59.470> do<00:02:59.620> it<00:02:59.739> now<00:02:59.920> except<00:03:00.880> get<00:03:01.780> ours<00:03:01.930> this<00:03:02.200> is

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
could do it now except get ours this is

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
could do it now except get ours this is
such<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.680> long

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
such a long

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.780 
such a long
passage<00:03:04.910> of<00:03:05.090> Mara<00:03:05.540> clippings<00:03:06.170> we<00:03:06.890> learned<00:03:07.190> at

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
to be in a very long line to be able to

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.930 
to be in a very long line to be able to
decode<00:03:17.200> everything<00:03:18.400> you're<00:03:19.400> moving<00:03:19.790> you're

moving<00:03:19.970> through<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.540> line<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.080> it's<00:03:21.590> really

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
moving through the line and it's really

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.380 
moving through the line and it's really
tough<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.130> decode<00:03:22.370> but<00:03:22.550> see<00:03:23.060> there's<00:03:23.239> little

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
tough to decode but see there's little

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.030 
tough to decode but see there's little
things<00:03:23.660> over<00:03:23.870> here<00:03:24.110> we<00:03:24.260> could<00:03:24.410> try<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.680> decode

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
things over here we could try to decode

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.440 
things over here we could try to decode
yeah<00:03:25.310> there<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:25.850> go

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
yeah there you go

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.070 
yeah there you go
decode<00:03:26.959> I<00:03:27.680> choose<00:03:28.310> wisely<00:03:30.640> really<00:03:31.640> says<00:03:31.819> that

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
decode I choose wisely really says that

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.900
