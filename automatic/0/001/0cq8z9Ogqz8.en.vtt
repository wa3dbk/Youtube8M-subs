00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
bulk like this this is definitely a lot

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.740 
bulk like this this is definitely a lot
cheaper<00:00:32.099> than<00:00:32.309> buying<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.180> individual

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
cheaper than buying it in the individual

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.660 
cheaper than buying it in the individual
packages<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.890> nice<00:00:35.070> thing<00:00:35.280> about<00:00:35.309> this

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
packages and the nice thing about this

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.030 
packages and the nice thing about this
is<00:00:35.969> sometimes<00:00:36.660> those<00:00:36.899> packages<00:00:37.440> aren't<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
is sometimes those packages aren't the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.799 
is sometimes those packages aren't the
exact<00:00:38.489> serving<00:00:38.969> size<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.480> I'll<00:00:39.540> have<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.719> use

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
exact serving size and I'll have to use

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.350 
exact serving size and I'll have to use
multiple<00:00:40.579> packages<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.730> get<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.000> size<00:00:42.180> that

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
multiple packages to get the size that

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.450 
multiple packages to get the size that
you<00:00:42.480> want<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.200> I've<00:00:43.379> always<00:00:43.770> just<00:00:43.920> bought<00:00:44.280> it

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
you want so I've always just bought it

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.490 
you want so I've always just bought it
and<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.879> kind<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.210> cylinder<00:00:45.510> shape<00:00:45.809> thing<00:00:46.079> it

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
and this kind of cylinder shape thing it

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.410 
and this kind of cylinder shape thing it
saves<00:00:46.829> money<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.670> think<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.059> lot<00:00:48.210> more

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
saves money and I think it's a lot more

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:57.049 
saves money and I think it's a lot more
convenient<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.260> one<00:00:49.530> cup<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:50.039> these<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:56.309> then

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
convenient so one cup of these and then

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.150 
convenient so one cup of these and then
you're<00:00:57.329> going<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.600> add<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.590> half<00:00:58.770> cups

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
you're going to add one and a half cups

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.740 
you're going to add one and a half cups
of<00:00:59.309> water<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:02.359> then<00:01:03.359> you're<00:01:03.539> going<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
of water and then you're going to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.750 
of water and then you're going to
microwave<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.530> about<00:01:04.860> two<00:01:05.159> minutes<00:01:05.339> now

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
the morning to do that that's great more

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.950 
the morning to do that that's great more
power<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.330> know<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.510> lot<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.750> us

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
power to you but I know a lot of us

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.810 
power to you but I know a lot of us
don't<00:01:13.560> have<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.799> much<00:01:14.070> time<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.490> morning

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
don't have that much time in the morning

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.640 
don't have that much time in the morning
to<00:01:14.939> get<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.180> pot<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.750> pan<00:01:15.960> out<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.380> then<00:01:16.500> to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
to get a pot in the pan out and then to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.080 
to get a pot in the pan out and then to
clean<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.009> up<00:01:17.130> takes<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.520> little<00:01:17.729> bit<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.909> time

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
clean it up takes a little bit of time

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.910 
clean it up takes a little bit of time
so<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:18.780> think<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.200> easier<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.650> grab<00:01:19.890> a

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
so I just think it's easier to grab a

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.890 
so I just think it's easier to grab a
bowl<00:01:20.189> stick<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> microwave<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.450> put<00:01:21.810> in

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
bowl stick in the microwave and put in

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.140 
bowl stick in the microwave and put in
the<00:01:21.990> dishwasher<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.860> be<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.130> my<00:01:23.159> way<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:24.090> two

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
the dishwasher and be on my way so two

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.109 
the dishwasher and be on my way so two
minutes<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> microwave<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:26.790> now<00:01:26.909> while

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
minutes in the microwave and now while

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.580 
minutes in the microwave and now while
this<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.360> microwaving<00:01:28.200> here<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.470> can

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
this is microwaving here you can

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.980 
this is microwaving here you can
actually<00:01:29.040> do<00:01:29.759> something<00:01:30.180> else<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.570> prepared

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
actually do something else and prepared

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.690 
actually do something else and prepared
another<00:01:31.140> part<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> meal<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.009> with<00:01:32.490> this

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
another part of the meal and with this

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.090 
another part of the meal and with this
what<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:32.970> like<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.270> do<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.960> actually<00:01:34.140> put

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
what I like to do is to actually put

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.710 
what I like to do is to actually put
bananas<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> top<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> oatmeal<00:01:36.570> I

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
bananas on the top of the oatmeal I

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.530 
bananas on the top of the oatmeal I
think<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.110> adds<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.439> lot<00:01:37.890> more<00:01:37.950> flavor<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.759> while

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
think it adds a lot more flavor so while

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.120 
think it adds a lot more flavor so while
you're<00:01:39.659> waiting<00:01:39.990> for<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.229> microwave<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:41.100> can

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
you're waiting for the microwave you can

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.210 
you're waiting for the microwave you can
go<00:01:41.400> ahead<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.909> take<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.659> banana<00:01:43.009> open<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.100> up

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
go ahead and take a banana open it up

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.639 
go ahead and take a banana open it up
and<00:01:44.490> cut<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:44.939> into<00:01:45.030> small<00:01:45.090> pieces<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:46.140> put<00:01:46.439> on

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
and cut it into small pieces to put on
