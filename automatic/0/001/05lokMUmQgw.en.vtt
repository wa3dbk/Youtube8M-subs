and<00:01:57.119> six<00:01:57.420> foot<00:01:57.719> pieces<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.500> one<00:01:58.979> buy<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.490> I

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479

and six foot pieces of one buy and I
just<00:02:01.020> cut<00:02:01.409> angles<00:02:01.860> with<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.630> miter<00:02:03.630> box<00:02:03.899> over

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
just cut angles with the miter box over

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.340 
just cut angles with the miter box over
here<00:02:04.259> each<00:02:04.590> corner<00:02:04.920> has<00:02:05.390> an<00:02:06.390> angle<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:07.289> that

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
here each corner has an angle like that

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.009 
here each corner has an angle like that
so<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:08.039> kind<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.519> picture<00:02:08.789> frame

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019

around<00:02:10.019> the<00:02:10.590> outside<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.579> the<00:02:12.450> door<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:12.989> I

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
around the outside of the door and I

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.100 
around the outside of the door and I
broke<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.799> piece<00:02:14.070> of<00:02:14.310> wood<00:02:14.519> one<00:02:15.360> cracked<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.079> I

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
broke a piece of wood one cracked so I

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.840 
broke a piece of wood one cracked so I
had<00:02:16.290> these<00:02:16.470> extra<00:02:16.799> pieces<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:17.430> what<00:02:17.579> I'm<00:02:17.700> going

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
had these extra pieces so what I'm going

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.080 
had these extra pieces so what I'm going
to<00:02:17.880> do<00:02:18.120> with<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:19.170> type<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.620> piece<00:02:19.829> is<00:02:20.130> I'm

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
to do with this type of piece is I'm

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.050 
to do with this type of piece is I'm
going<00:02:21.329> to<00:02:21.450> make<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:21.959> nice<00:02:22.230> little<00:02:22.560> decorative

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
going to make a nice little decorative

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.699 
going to make a nice little decorative
corner<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.180> guess<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.600> might<00:02:25.109> add<00:02:25.320> strength

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
corner and I guess it might add strength

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.349 
corner and I guess it might add strength
to<00:02:25.859> the<00:02:26.010> door<00:02:26.280> as<00:02:26.400> well<00:02:26.579> but<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:26.940> is<00:02:27.120> what<00:02:27.269> I'm

to the door as well but this is what I'm

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.599 
to the door as well but this is what I'm
going<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.600> do<00:02:27.750> with<00:02:28.410> these<00:02:28.500> extra<00:02:28.950> pieces<00:02:29.160> as

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.590 
I've made my mark and I'm going to cut
that<00:02:33.120> angle

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:05.400 
texture 111 so I'm going to go in the
center<00:02:57.100> right<00:02:58.000> there<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.959> I'll<00:03:05.260> probably

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
center right there and I'll probably

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.130 
center right there and I'll probably
just<00:03:05.680> put<00:03:06.180> one<00:03:07.180> right<00:03:07.450> here<00:03:07.690> in<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.840> middle<00:03:08.110> of

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
just put one right here in the middle of

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.020 
just put one right here in the middle of
these<00:03:08.260> like<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.160> said<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.400> think<00:03:09.700> they're<00:03:09.850> more

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
these like I said I think they're more

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.400 
these like I said I think they're more
decoration<00:03:10.720> than<00:03:10.900> they<00:03:11.020> are

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
decoration than they are

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:18.180

anything<00:03:12.340> else<00:03:13.739> force<00:03:16.440> more<00:03:17.440> stuff<00:03:17.769> for<00:03:17.950> me<00:03:18.070> to

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
anything else force more stuff for me to

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:54.840 
anything else force more stuff for me to
paint<00:03:18.459> I<00:03:18.550> guess

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.150 

so<00:03:55.850> I've<00:03:56.120> assembled<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.200> door<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:57.770> as<00:03:58.130> you
