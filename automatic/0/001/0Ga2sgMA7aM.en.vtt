00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello that such good afternoon to 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.529
 then we are making a 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.230
 reaction work and speed 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.209
 using canes 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.910
 it is an important element for 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:19.410
 enriching practices and development 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.210
 of exercises in this case physical 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.890
 prior to football practice the 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.199
 first exercise that we are doing a 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.720
 lateral displacement always in the 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:31.029
 fastest possible speed with a call 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.980
 zig zag and we are going to make a series of 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.220
 exercises that we can do we can 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:40.230
 perform with this type of canes in 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.230
 this formation or location 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.700
 second year second variant the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.260
 exercise always using the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.600
 sticks let's be the same 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.010
 side scrolling only now what 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.190
 we always back the requirement 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.020
 It must be at the highest level 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.450
 center of truth is low 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.730
 to assimilate the movements that can 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.730
 be very similar to those that are going to 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.260
 perform in the game can the reaction 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.270
 of the soccer game 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.710
 each variant or each exercise we are going 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.640
 To make 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.640
 twice 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.590
 another variant to move with the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.410
 highest possible speed in front and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.550
 back following the line of the location 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.550
 of constancy 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.280
 these exercises he developed before 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.130
 the sports practice to make a 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.640
 stimulation of the neurosis system 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.609
 neuromuscular and therefore have greater 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.439
 ability to work at the time of 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:46.439
 proper technical foundation 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.520
 yes 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.520
 good good 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.840
 what struck me the most 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.230
 to the goal 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.720
 in this variant we are going to add a little 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.570
 of saltability or you can also 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.390
 consider biometrics work force 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.300
 and the power followed by a short cycle 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.440
 of speed 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.480
 we can do jumps with two legs with 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.200
 one leg 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.700
 but it is important to work in several 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.690
 elements that enrich the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.380
 training 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.380
 morning 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.320
 in this type of exercise also 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.380
 we work the coordination is important 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.260
 that the athlete has total control of her 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.080
 elements in this case you can train 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.030
 lower 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.550
 because there are situations in the game that 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.070
 the speed and the reaction warrant it 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.590
 is an important element but if you 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.280
 we add some difficulty results more 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.280
 beneficial 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:18.889
 1 up 13 and then the stretch of 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.889
 speed 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.850
 we add another as difficulty now 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.920
 they have to surround each of the 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.170
 Canes 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.020
 as I repeat, the idea is 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.500
 develop the speed the reaction the 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.500
 coordination in elements or spaces 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.500
 reduced 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.469
 well I think this little sample shows them 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.819
 can serve can help them to 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:50.849
 perform your training work 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.319
 although perfectly football 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.870
 sports like volleyball that is very 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.329
 important the reaction the basketball the 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.579
 indoor soccer sport also 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.159
 requires great mobility or space 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.470
 short the reaction work is always 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.689
 an element that is going to be welcome in 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.200
 the trainings to put it in 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:12.150
 practice in action play good afternoon 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.970
 I hope you keep watching my videos or 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.150
 keep enjoying and comment for 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.539
 improve and learn from you too 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.539
 thank you very much
