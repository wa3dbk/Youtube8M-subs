00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.060 
same person with the same shop and he's

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.210 
same person with the same shop and he's
not<00:07:36.180> there<00:07:36.330> anymore<00:07:36.360> and<00:07:37.010> they<00:07:38.010> could<00:07:38.130> be<00:07:38.190> a

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.220 
not there anymore and they could be a

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.980 
not there anymore and they could be a
little<00:07:38.340> pricey<00:07:38.550> over<00:07:38.880> there<00:07:39.000> so<00:07:39.240> i<00:07:39.510> went<00:07:39.750> to

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:39.990 
little pricey over there so i went to

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.890 
little pricey over there so i went to
somewhere<00:07:40.500> new<00:07:40.730> I<00:07:41.730> figure<00:07:42.480> they're<00:07:42.660> like<00:07:42.870> a

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900 
somewhere new I figure they're like a

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.690 
somewhere new I figure they're like a
new<00:07:43.140> or<00:07:43.320> place<00:07:43.530> in<00:07:43.740> town<00:07:43.920> and<00:07:44.220> they<00:07:44.490> probably

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:44.700 
new or place in town and they probably

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.180 
new or place in town and they probably
need<00:07:45.000> to<00:07:45.060> try<00:07:45.210> to<00:07:45.270> attract<00:07:45.630> in<00:07:45.870> attention<00:07:46.440> so<00:07:47.160> I

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:47.190 
need to try to attract in attention so I

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.290 
need to try to attract in attention so I
figured<00:07:47.550> their<00:07:47.640> prices<00:07:47.940> would<00:07:48.030> be<00:07:48.150> a<00:07:48.180> little

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.300 
figured their prices would be a little

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.260 
figured their prices would be a little
bit<00:07:48.480> lower<00:07:48.630> and<00:07:48.840> they<00:07:48.960> were<00:07:49.020> um<00:07:49.580> and<00:07:50.580> the<00:07:51.180> guy

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:51.270 
bit lower and they were um and the guy

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.470 
bit lower and they were um and the guy
was<00:07:51.450> really<00:07:51.600> nice<00:07:51.900> so<00:07:52.580> I'm<00:07:53.580> really<00:07:54.090> happy<00:07:54.360> with
