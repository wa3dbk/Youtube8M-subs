this episode we will look at spacing so
we<00:00:30.769> can<00:00:30.949> squeeze<00:00:31.279> in<00:00:31.580> most<00:00:31.850> buildings<00:00:32.180> and

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
we can squeeze in most buildings and

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.290 
we can squeeze in most buildings and
roads<00:00:32.780> to<00:00:32.930> the<00:00:33.079> playground<00:00:33.730> so<00:00:34.730> let's<00:00:35.000> get

don't<00:00:56.339> know<00:00:56.489> for<00:00:56.730> sure<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:57.420> all<00:00:57.690> depends<00:00:58.290> on

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
don't know for sure it all depends on

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.500 
don't know for sure it all depends on
the<00:00:58.470> free<00:00:58.800> space<00:00:59.129> required<00:00:59.640> between<00:00:59.910> objects

in<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.839> game<00:01:01.080> and<00:01:01.350> what<00:01:01.530> objects<00:01:01.890> those

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
in the game and what objects those

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.820 
in the game and what objects those
spaces<00:01:02.550> attach<00:01:03.089> to<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:03.900> this<00:01:04.110> method<00:01:04.440> will

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
spaces attach to but this method will

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.980 
spaces attach to but this method will
make<00:01:05.009> the<00:01:05.220> perfect<00:01:05.610> layout<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.450> no<00:01:06.690> free

when<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.320> draw<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.740> road<00:01:17.009> you'll<00:01:17.280> do<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.640> from

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
when you draw a road you'll do it from

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.580 
when you draw a road you'll do it from
the<00:01:18.000> middle<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.509> road<00:01:18.720> which<00:01:19.200> should<00:01:19.410> give

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
the middle of the road which should give

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.550 
the middle of the road which should give
a<00:01:19.619> price<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:19.979> 25<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.479> some<00:01:21.720> odd<00:01:21.930> reason<00:01:21.960> I

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
a price of 25 but for some odd reason I

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.770 
a price of 25 but for some odd reason I
haven't<00:01:22.830> figured<00:01:23.280> out<00:01:23.430> yet<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:24.240> price<00:01:24.539> is

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
haven't figured out yet the price is

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.249 
haven't figured out yet the price is
only<00:01:24.960> 24<00:01:25.820> maybe<00:01:26.820> there<00:01:27.149> is<00:01:27.300> a<00:01:27.330> 2-point<00:01:27.869> middle

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
only 24 maybe there is a 2-point middle

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.940 
only 24 maybe there is a 2-point middle
section<00:01:28.649> in<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:28.950> road<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.130> don't<00:01:29.460> pay<00:01:29.729> for

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
section in the road you don't pay for

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.460 
section in the road you don't pay for
let's<00:01:31.950> draw<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.310> road<00:01:32.570> first<00:01:33.570> 24<00:01:34.110> for<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
let's draw the road first 24 for the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.270 
let's draw the road first 24 for the
road<00:01:34.679> then<00:01:35.280> 4<00:01:35.610> for<00:01:35.910> the<00:01:36.030> spacing<00:01:36.539> then<00:01:36.990> 188<00:01:37.979> for

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
road then 4 for the spacing then 188 for

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.660 
road then 4 for the spacing then 188 for
the<00:01:38.369> building<00:01:38.789> 4<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.720> spacing<00:01:40.140> again<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.950> 24

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
the building 4 for spacing again and 24

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.630 
the building 4 for spacing again and 24
for<00:01:41.910> the<00:01:41.940> other<00:01:42.179> road<00:01:42.509> all<00:01:43.289> in<00:01:43.740> all<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.399> dirt

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
for the other road all in all the dirt

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.880 
for the other road all in all the dirt
road<00:01:44.910> price<00:01:45.270> should<00:01:45.509> end<00:01:45.720> up<00:01:45.810> with<00:01:45.890> 244

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
road price should end up with 244

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.749 
road price should end up with 244
samolians<00:01:47.780> exactly<00:01:49.039> remember<00:01:50.039> to<00:01:50.250> use<00:01:50.429> shift

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
samolians exactly remember to use shift

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.779 
samolians exactly remember to use shift
so<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.300> will<00:01:51.569> have<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> perfect<00:01:52.050> straight<00:01:52.500> line

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
so you will have a perfect straight line

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.940 
so you will have a perfect straight line
this<00:01:53.789> covers<00:01:54.209> the<00:01:54.239> basics<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.410> let's<00:01:55.679> go<00:01:55.890> to

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
this covers the basics so let's go to

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.979 
this covers the basics so let's go to
the<00:01:56.190> back-to-back<00:01:56.700> high-density<00:01:57.599> building

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:57.989 
the back-to-back high-density building

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:00.570 
the back-to-back high-density building
calculation

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
calculation

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.370 
calculation
here<00:02:01.580> we<00:02:01.670> have<00:02:01.850> a<00:02:01.880> back-to-back<00:02:02.510> high-density

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
here we have a back-to-back high-density

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.680 
here we have a back-to-back high-density
layout<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:03.980> as<00:02:04.400> you<00:02:04.550> can<00:02:04.700> see<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:05.390> same

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
layout and as you can see the same

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.990 
layout and as you can see the same
numbers<00:02:06.140> appears<00:02:06.590> again<00:02:07.010> but<00:02:07.610> there<00:02:07.850> is<00:02:07.970> a

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
numbers appears again but there is a

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.020 
numbers appears again but there is a
space<00:02:08.390> between<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:08.930> two<00:02:08.960> building<00:02:09.590> as<00:02:09.740> well

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
space between the two building as well

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.090 
space between the two building as well
so<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.180> calculation<00:02:11.840> is<00:02:11.990> 24<00:02:12.560> for<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.860> first

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
so the calculation is 24 for the first

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.600 
so the calculation is 24 for the first
road<00:02:13.400> four<00:02:14.060> for<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.480> space<00:02:15.250> 188<00:02:16.250> for<00:02:16.520> the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
road four for the space 188 for the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.970 
road four for the space 188 for the

building side by side layout yet but
we'll<00:02:53.540> do<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:53.750> after<00:02:54.650> this<00:02:54.800> video<00:02:55.040> is<00:02:55.280> done
