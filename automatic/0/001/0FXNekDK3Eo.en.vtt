00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
so simple to use now i do not have an

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.850 
so simple to use now i do not have an
estimate<00:01:42.030> about<00:01:42.240> how<00:01:42.960> long<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.530> takes<00:01:43.740> to

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
estimate about how long it takes to

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.440 
estimate about how long it takes to
charge<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:46.100> devices<00:01:47.100> via<00:01:47.130> USB<00:01:47.610> port<00:01:48.000> because

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
charge the devices via USB port because

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.260 
charge the devices via USB port because
i<00:01:48.689> usually<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.829> them<00:01:50.100> charging<00:01:50.759> overnight

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
i usually have them charging overnight

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.359 
i usually have them charging overnight
so<00:01:52.140> i<00:01:52.170> wouldn't<00:01:52.500> be<00:01:52.829> able<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.070> give<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.280> a

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
so i wouldn't be able to give you a

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.450 
so i wouldn't be able to give you a
total<00:01:53.729> estimate<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.140> does<00:01:55.530> charge<00:01:55.950> fairly

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
total estimate but it does charge fairly

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.719 
total estimate but it does charge fairly
quick<00:01:56.729> let's<00:01:57.540> because<00:01:58.079> I've<00:01:58.439> charged<00:01:59.250> both<00:01:59.490> my

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
quick let's because I've charged both my

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.639 
quick let's because I've charged both my
ipod<00:02:00.329> touches<00:02:00.950> via<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.930> i'd<00:02:03.930> say<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.409> it

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
ipod touches via this and i'd say it it

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.210 
ipod touches via this and i'd say it it
fully<00:02:05.009> charges<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.700> within<00:02:06.229> one<00:02:07.229> sometimes

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
fully charges it within one sometimes

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.850 
fully charges it within one sometimes
two<00:02:08.310> hours<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.349> that's<00:02:10.349> just<00:02:10.530> an<00:02:10.679> estimate

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
two hours and that's just an estimate

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.610 
two hours and that's just an estimate
i'm<00:02:11.730> not<00:02:11.879> for<00:02:12.599> sure<00:02:12.629> on<00:02:12.930> that
