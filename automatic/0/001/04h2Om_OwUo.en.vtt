00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.590
 Life is eternal because you are children of God and God is eternal. 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:10.831
 You who follow me believe in this, but often too superficially because, when 

00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:15.020
 the pain of mourning comes, you don't know how to live it in a Christian way. 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:22.260
 Sometimes the mourning for your loved one comes on suddenly, sometimes after a long time 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.779
 disease, but always hurts you in your feelings and puts you in front of the raw 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:33.449
 reality of death. Yes, death is a raw and painful reality that deeply hurts 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:38.219
 the heart and places the intellect in front of the darkness of the Mystery. 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.030
 You often ask yourself many questions about your conduct, wonder if you have behaved 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.370
 right, if there have been debts of love with the person who left you. Consciences 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.109
 more sensitive they are always at fault, while others do not think about it so much. 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:02.249
 In truth you have debts of love with God and with all the brothers, but you have time, in 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:06.930
 this life, to repair the evil done and the good omitted through prayer. 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.120
 In fact, prayer is always useful to the deceased, even if he was pure and could 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.280
 reach eternal bliss immediately. Most of the time, however, they need 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.790
 times of purification, which you can shorten by means of prayer. In this way 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.320
 you will do good to your loved one and, at the same time, you will do your duty as children of 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.680
 God. 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.600
 When a person ends his earthly journey, he leaves a great void that he does not 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.070
 he can no longer fill, because his physical presence can no longer be between you. 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.290
 Many would like to know where they go and what happens to their deceased loved ones. It takes respect 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.430
 for the Mystery that you cannot understand. It takes respect for God, who is the Father of 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.479
 everyone and everyone loves. It takes respect for the decisions of God, who calls children to Himself 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.039
 at the most opportune moment: both the young and the elderly, both the healthy and the sick. 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.519
 It takes respect for what God wants and also for what God allows. Indeed, 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:19.700
 as I told you many times before, all that God allows is to draw from it 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.359
 well. One day you will understand all these things that you cannot understand now and you will praise 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.609
 God for his Wisdom. 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:33.859
 The death of loved ones unleashes a great rebellion in the heart of many and I understand 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:40.260
 this is because I know your nature and your limits well. I want to remind you, though 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.620
 how much you forget too easily: life is eternal and you, at the appointed time, 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.549
 you will be reunited with them. 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:54.060
 I am the Resurrection and the Life and in Me are all the creatures that were, that are 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.409
 and that will be. Do not be afraid of physical death, because it is a "passage", a 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:05.159
 rise to a reality greater than the one you are living. 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.469
 Do not cry too much your loved ones who are no longer among you, do not weep as if 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:16.529
 they died because, in truth, they live. They are not dead and will never die. 

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:23.000
 I have conquered death and redeemed you in the totality of your being. At the end of 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.209
 process of redemption, each will be completely a new creature, a perfect being, a 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:36.249
 likeness of God. You are formed by spirit, soul and body: everything must be sanctified. 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:43.749
 The body goes through death and then, at the appointed time, rises again. Everything must happen 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:50.329
 according to the Plan of God, individual and universal, which you cannot know. 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.109
 Have faith in God! 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.969
 A question that often afflicts your hearts concerns your status as sinners and, in 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:03.970
 this case, even that of your dear departed and it is rightly so. what 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.590
 which I don't like is that instead of doing what you can do, you sometimes bask 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.169
 in a sad and fruitless laziness. What good is thinking and rethinking too many things about 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.910
 past and lose precious time that you could devote to prayer and good times 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.180
 suffrage works? 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.840
 Make good use of your time, because it is measured and you cannot even add it 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.840
 an hour. 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.740
 You are called to prepare yourselves for your future life with worthy fruits of conversion. 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.170
 You are called to live charity towards everyone and especially towards your loved ones 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:47.030
 they left to precede you in the other life. Pray for them and believe that they 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.300
 they are alive, they love you and will continue to love you forever. 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.280
 Don't cry too much for your loved ones who no longer physically share yours 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.820
 earthly events, because they are still close to you, even if you cannot perceive them 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.920
 their presence. 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.780
 Think of them as living and love them as such. Love is stronger than death 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.963
 and time; the love that has tied you to them will never end. 

00:05:12.963 --> 00:05:19.740
 Don't cry too much for your loved ones, because they still share, even if so 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.850
 different, your lives and intercede for you. Also for their love, resume with 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:32.800
 courage the journey of life, trusting in the Good God who always attentively assists you. 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.330
 Don't cry too much for your loved ones and believe that they help you, day after day, and 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.790
 they wait to be able to embrace you again in the eternal embrace of the Life that does not die. 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:49.580
 Your loved ones are no stranger to your daily problems, they are not far, not 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.580
 they are absent. 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.660
 They are in Me and as I am always with you, equally they are always with you, 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.360
 always present. Their love for you now is much more beautiful and pure than before and theirs 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.760
 help is more effective, although this remains invisible to your eyes. 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.910
 Thinking of them, keep your gaze fixed on the purpose of your earthly life. 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:18.632
 I also bless the tears you shed for your dear departed, but I urge you not to 

00:06:18.632 --> 00:06:24.370
 cry too much and resume the journey of faith with constancy and perseverance, making 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.530
 thank God because he always supports you. 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:33.040
 Pray for the salvation of all souls. Pray for those who do not pray. Pray 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.860
 for all the souls in purgatory. Invoke the Divine Mercy for all: this I 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.110
 I ask you. 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:47.370
 Dear little ones, help me with prayer, help me with conversion, help me to 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.350
 save all. 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:07:02.700
 Don't cry too much for your deceased loved ones. Believe in God and the Mystery of Life 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.700
 I AM-. 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.840
 I love you, welcome my Love.
