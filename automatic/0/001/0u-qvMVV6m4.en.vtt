00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello everyone because of the great reception 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.000
 who is having this channel 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.830
 you are so many that we have reached a point 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.900
 in which I am forced to stop 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.870
 answer your questions if I want 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.340
 have time to prepare new courses 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.289
 and as of now I will not be able to 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.630
 help you directly with your 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.699
 problems I have decided to make this video 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.529
 where I will give a series of tips 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.529
 that will help you get the most 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.960
 party to this course so that you can 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.670
 finish it without anyone's help so 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.670
 it is very important that you see it whole 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.949
 making video games with unity requires 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.530
 have a minimum knowledge of 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.269
 programming if you do not have them you'll have 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.699
 problems with even the most code 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:44.750
 simple so if they do not know anything 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.640
 about programming 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.739
 The first thing you should do is 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.659
 finish the course that I have published of 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.750
 introduction to programming with Caesar 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:55.489
 in unite and if not as soon as we get to the 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.979
 part where you start using the 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.439
 programming you will be copying text that 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:00.949
 will not know how it works and everything will be a 

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:03.859
 problem 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.200
 therefore you are warned if you wish 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.330
 create video games invest time in 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.100
 having a strong foundation is the best 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.650
 investment you could make 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.840
 This course is focused on people who 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.909
 you already know how to use unity and want 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.740
 learn to manage the tools that 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.400
 this one incorporated from its version 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.130
 4.3 to create games in 2d is not a 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.259
 unity course for beginners clarified 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.970
 this because throughout the same I will give 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.130
 for granted that you have 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.440
 basic knowledge on how to 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.390
 they make games in unity so there will be 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.420
 things that will not be explained with so much 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.430
 Detail yet if you are new with unity 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.930
 and do not be afraid to expand on your own 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.240
 any information that could 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.360
 need you will not have many 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.550
 problems 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.100
 and follow my tutorials is how to do 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.290
 an operation on a calculator always 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.200
 you will get the same result while 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.090
 you press the same buttons if in some 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.280
 moment you get a different result 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.460
 what you see in the videos I can 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.350
 99 ensure that 99 percent is 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.479
 because something has escaped you or you have not 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.790
 done the same you'll have to arm yourself 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.340
 patience and revisit everything with 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.500
 more calm if the tutorials write a 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.450
 small letter you should write it 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.250
 in lowercase and if you type in 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.410
 capital letters you should write it in 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.050
 capital letters you should do everything 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.900
 exactly the same though you can use 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.940
 other graphics music sounds and types of 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.510
 letter since these do not affect the 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.640
 resulting functionality 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.920
 the software used in these courses 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.780
 it may have been updated and it is possible 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.659
 that certain elements have changed 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.390
 position or aspect if you want to avoid 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.280
 I recommend this type of problem 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.760
 use the same version of unity that 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.700
 use to do this course which is the 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.560
 4.3.4 in the description of this video 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.959
 you have a link to the page where 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.489
 download that particular version as well 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.319
 you will have one less thing than the one 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.470
 worry since everything will look and be 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.630
 it will do exactly the same 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.760
 It is very important that you read the 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.770
 descriptions of the videos since these 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.500
 they will have all the extra information that 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.390
 you could need in them you will find 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.150
 links to download that all 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.250
 resources used tips solutions 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.590
 to problems that you could have links 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.330
 to download the scripts to which 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.670
 they were left after doing each chapter 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.130
 and a link located in the description 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.890
 of the last video to download the 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.050
 project completely finished with 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.210
 all this information you will have no excuse 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.490
 for not being able to solve on your own 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.870
 any problem you have since if 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.270
 it is not explained in the description 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.220
 has the source codes and the project 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.290
 complete to compare it with what you 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.580
 you have done and so they see that you have left or 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.100
 what have you done differently 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.200
 Do not forget to watch the videos with 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.210
 annotations activated since 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.190
 they will show very important information that 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.050
 you should keep in mind and that in the 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.860
 moment of recording the video I forgot 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.170
 comment 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.450
 make sure you understand everything that is 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.760
 does in a video and why it's done before 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.460
 to move on to the next one if you do things 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.470
 without understanding them then you will not be able to 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.010
 create anything other than what is explained 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.780
 in this course to finish I present to you 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.690
 this community that I created in google + 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.519
 call we make video games will be a 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.260
 space where you can meet more 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.630
 people interested in the development of 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.760
 video games and so share and discover 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.430
 anything that is relevant and of 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.470
 Free access tries to be respectful 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.300
 with others and if you post a message 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.990
 New mark it in the category that you 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.990
 correspond 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.550
 as you see, you have everything you need to 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.320
 solve on your own any 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.840
 problem that could occur while 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.850
 you follow this course if the case of 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.800
 that you had a problem and no matter how much 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.200
 you have reviewed it you can not find a 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.450
 solution you can ask for help from others 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.940
 users of this community that yes 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.980
 remember that it is a community, not a 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.780
 office so try too 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.510
 help others as far as 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.640
 possible 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.980
 clarify that although it does not respond to 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.350
