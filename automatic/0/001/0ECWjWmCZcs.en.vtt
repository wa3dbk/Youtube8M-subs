00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.930
 today we are going to see how we can put a 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.940
 globe inside another the most important thing 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.309
 is that the outside is a balloon of the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.990
 what they call crystal is to say that it is 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.290
 transparent in this case we to one of 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.210
 11 inches can be inflated or with 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.250
 a mattress inflator or with a 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.080
 carboy of God we are going to use a 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.480
 mattress inflator because we want 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.940
 that the balloon can hold a lot and with 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.430
 helium with all the weight make the 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.350
 balloon lose strength very fast good 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.940
 we have here the two balloons 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.679
 we have taken the same size 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.719
 but this could be smaller than 

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:38.489
 will go inside the outside as we have already 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.800
 said has to be the one they call 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.899
 crystal then what we do is 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.510
 we take the one we want to put inside and 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.470
 we put it inside then we put it 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:53.230
 in directly 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.230
 You see, little by little, passing it 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.329
 careful not to puncture the glass 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.269
 sometimes with the emotion we puncture the one of 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.040
 it was good because we already have a 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.470
 globe inside another 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.250
 now we connect the inflator to the balloon 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.100
 inside 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.320
 Well, we connect the inflator to the 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.790
 purple mouth that is going to go 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.070
 inside even though you see 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.290
 the transparent we leave it here too 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.170
 so that when inflating the purple does not come out 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.420
 flying then we hold strong and 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.700
 we started to inflate with our feet 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.490
 we help and we start to inflate you see that 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.110
 purple starts to inflate the balloon as 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.140
 when it arrives then more or less to this 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.899
 size we stop and tie him we start what 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:42.619
 What we do is take the purple balloon and 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:46.590
 here we tie a knot only in the purple 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.570
 well once we have purple already 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.759
 tied what we have to do is inflate 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.729
 the transparent then let's go back 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.610
 to put the inflator where in the mouth 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.430
 of the transparent we put the inflator 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.020
 the mouth of the transparent you see and also 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.729
 we hold because now we have to 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.570
 get no air out where 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.360
 there is the liver 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.399
 it makes a little noise but nothing happens 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.030
 you have little by little start in flash the 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.030
 transparent 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.870
 once we finish what I do is 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.370
 make a knot that brings the two together 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.490
 say here I have inside the knot of 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:29.100
 purple will pose a knot that at the same time 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.100
 I grabbed the purple and the transparent
