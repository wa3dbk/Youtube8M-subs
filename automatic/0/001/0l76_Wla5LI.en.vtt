black<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.920> those<00:00:17.820> plants<00:00:18.420> that's<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
black and those plants that's the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.290 
black and those plants that's the
natural<00:00:19.439> color<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.310> natural<00:00:20.460> color<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.000> their

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
natural color the natural color of their

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.509 
natural color the natural color of their
leaves<00:00:22.430> so<00:00:23.430> just<00:00:24.090> different<00:00:25.099> strains<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
leaves so just different strains of the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.339 
leaves so just different strains of the
same<00:00:26.550> plant<00:00:27.119> obviously<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.930> have<00:00:28.019> different

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
same plant obviously that have different

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.519 
same plant obviously that have different
colours<00:00:28.910> so<00:00:29.910> he's<00:00:30.090> planted<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.750> out<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.289> it's

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
colours so he's planted it out and it's

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.810 
colours so he's planted it out and it's
grown<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.420> recently<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:35.070> pattern<00:00:35.430> started

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
grown and recently the pattern started

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.370 
grown and recently the pattern started
to<00:00:35.850> become<00:00:36.149> obvious<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.930> when<00:00:37.020> we<00:00:37.110> get<00:00:37.260> up

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
to become obvious and when we get up

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.750 
to become obvious and when we get up
high<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.620> look<00:00:37.800> down<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.640> what<00:00:38.790> we<00:00:38.940> see

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
high and look down this is what we see

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:49.500 
high and look down this is what we see
is<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.820> incredible

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.440 

so<00:00:50.050> it's<00:00:50.230> been<00:00:50.440> like<00:00:50.649> that<00:00:50.829> for<00:00:50.890> a<00:00:51.790> couple<00:00:52.390> of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
so it's been like that for a couple of

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.200 
so it's been like that for a couple of
months<00:00:52.630> already<00:00:52.899> and<00:00:53.440> he<00:00:54.430> said<00:00:54.460> that<00:00:55.000> it

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
months already and he said that it

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.270 
months already and he said that it
should<00:00:55.510> still<00:00:55.840> be<00:00:55.870> looking<00:00:56.140> like<00:00:56.559> I<00:00:57.010> for

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
should still be looking like I for

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.520 
should still be looking like I for
another<00:00:57.460> month<00:00:58.090> or<00:00:58.270> two<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.960> incredible

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
another month or two it's incredible

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.990 
another month or two it's incredible
isn't<00:01:02.680> it<00:01:04.619> such<00:01:05.619> clear<00:01:06.009> images<00:01:06.640> sort<00:01:06.790> of<00:01:06.910> a

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
isn't it such clear images sort of a

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.420 
isn't it such clear images sort of a
bird

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.620 

birds

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.510 

isn't<00:01:22.260> it<00:01:22.320> awesome

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.370 

so<00:01:26.119> of<00:01:26.180> course<00:01:26.390> since<00:01:26.600> we<00:01:26.720> get<00:01:26.840> up<00:01:26.930> high<00:01:27.079> we<00:01:27.259> can

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
so of course since we get up high we can

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.929 
so of course since we get up high we can
see<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:27.590> image<00:01:27.829> but<00:01:28.009> of<00:01:28.100> course<00:01:28.280> he<00:01:28.399> created

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
see the image but of course he created

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.480 
see the image but of course he created
that<00:01:28.970> on<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.329> ground<00:01:29.600> which<00:01:29.899> is<00:01:30.490> quite

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
that on the ground which is quite

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.700 
that on the ground which is quite
incredible<00:01:31.780> they've<00:01:32.780> put<00:01:32.930> a<00:01:32.960> platform<00:01:33.259> up

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
incredible they've put a platform up

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.100 
incredible they've put a platform up
across<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.310> street<00:01:34.640> so<00:01:35.570> you<00:01:35.659> can<00:01:35.780> climb<00:01:36.049> up

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
across the street so you can climb up

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.050 
across the street so you can climb up
the<00:01:36.350> platform<00:01:36.640> stand<00:01:37.640> on<00:01:37.729> top<00:01:37.850> of<00:01:38.000> the

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
the platform stand on top of the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.820 
the platform stand on top of the
platform<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:38.600> look<00:01:38.720> down<00:01:38.930> on<00:01:39.140> it<00:01:39.170> but<00:01:39.710> of

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
platform and look down on it but of

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.719 
platform and look down on it but of
course<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.130> people<00:01:40.369> that<00:01:40.460> are<00:01:40.549> driving

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
course the people that are driving

passed out on that main road out there

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.669 
passed out on that main road out there
unlikely<00:01:44.299> to<00:01:44.450> notice<00:01:44.600> anything<00:01:45.140> unusual<00:01:45.200> at

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
unlikely to notice anything unusual at

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.480 
unlikely to notice anything unusual at
all<00:01:47.350> it's<00:01:48.350> not<00:01:48.500> until<00:01:48.770> you<00:01:48.799> actually<00:01:48.979> get<00:01:49.250> up<00:01:49.399> a

all it's not until you actually get up a

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.859 
all it's not until you actually get up a
little<00:01:49.610> bit<00:01:49.759> harder<00:01:50.060> you<00:01:50.090> can<00:01:50.330> see<00:01:50.570> it<00:01:50.659> isn't

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
little bit harder you can see it isn't

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:58.960 
little bit harder you can see it isn't
incredible<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.950> kanji<00:01:52.399> as<00:01:52.520> well<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:58.850> all

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
done with just different colored leaves

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:07.740 
done with just different colored leaves
very<00:02:00.950> cool<00:02:01.250> isn't<00:02:01.459> it

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750
