00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:07.069
 if the race suspiciously after 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.960
 methanol and metro smells when up to 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.860
 8000 ps the tires are at temperature 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.630
 bring 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.480
 for the fastest racing cars in the world 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.480
 then let dragster experience hockenheim 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.260
 this event here in hockenheim 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.200
 is the biggest drag racing event 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.759
 outside the usa with about 50,000 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.680
 spectators at the weekend so that is 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.970
 really a big goal and is one 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.830
 unique spectacle and 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.360
 is very different from the usual 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.190
 motorsports we usually do on the 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.050
 racing track have nowhere else experienced 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.710
 one duelle ultrafast crane jib 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.870
 against by slammer of sports cars 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.120
 laying almost forgotten small car of 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:54.230
 motorcycles us classics and german 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:55.940
 Allisen on a raceday the drag 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.980
 racing is firmly in Germany 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.300
 Hand of amateur drivers like Michael 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.460
 voigt and his team 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.260
 what is missing as a sponsor support 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.250
 will be passionate about that 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.250
 racing made up for 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.390
 before we go home with the mito 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.329
 Racing a complete engine just put down 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.909
 The friendly man follow German 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.909
 story different when assembled 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.380
 here on the big stage to 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.909
 main race of the year under 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.829
 could test me conditions yes 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.719
 He does not want to do that anyway 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.319
 drive full risk if he has a chance 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:41.439
 wants 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:43.599
 with just under 1700 ps , the turbo 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.770
 ventilate classic cars into battle 

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:46.770
 win or fly 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.409
 Now we are here four days after 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.790
 the engine was completely the thing is running 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.780
 better than ever have the new 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.780
 personal best times 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.930
 at 293 km h and that 's that moment 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.940
 the whole other switch 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.500
 to forget 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.030
 Also this pure wolfs a typical 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.030
 self-built dragster 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.700
 alone 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.900
 I had previously 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.989
 the winter will be 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.720
 foto laaser instantly principle you are 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.730
 thereby fifth can 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.379
 and then you drive with the protons so 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.349
 problems and then you start to 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:44.019
 restore effect exactly what you do 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:49.140
 before that if you do so through this 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.140
 stages separated by 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.690
 dragster is not just fast 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.400
 also want to be driven precisely because 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.560
 At the driving time on the track will be the 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.560
 reaction time added at the traffic light 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.150
 the pilots are all good at it 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.860
 they all have good ones 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.870
 reaction times, most cars the 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.549
 that means you can drive under ex 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.870
 could also gamble on the 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.250
 therefore they will all be 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.769
 try to win a ramp 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.890
 means the one with the best time can 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.930
 In the race they think about what he is doing 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.810
 we hope those belong to it 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.190
 took hundreds of reaction time or something 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.920
 maybe borders can and experiences 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.849
 the daad is the index of 99 seconds 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.220
 he retired 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.870
 as with an early start this 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.030
 Time limits met the precise 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.220
 tomorrow will be in the slower classes 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.200
 for equal opportunity in the faster 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.910
 on the other hand, who counts first over 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.910
 the finish line is the winner 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.860
 the dna of drag racing will be faster 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.010
 technology in the service of a single thing 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.540
 speed 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.610
 clearly the duels are on the track 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.540
 short but the speeds for it 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.430
 sensational 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.410
 to the incomparable fragrance of 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.000
 engines in the fastest classes 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.560
 not with fuel but with 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.350
 be operated explosive 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.299
 The nitrolympx also have 2013 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.430
 impressively proved that drag racing 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.430
 really exciting racing is
