00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
there's quite a few reasons for this

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.130 
there's quite a few reasons for this
actually<00:00:35.219> your<00:00:35.790> indoor<00:00:36.329> environment<00:00:37.020> is

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
actually your indoor environment is

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.049 
actually your indoor environment is
actually<00:00:37.559> controlled<00:00:37.980> for<00:00:38.280> heat<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.670> cooling

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
actually controlled for heat and cooling

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.780 
actually controlled for heat and cooling
whereas<00:00:40.020> outside<00:00:40.290> your<00:00:41.100> rabbit<00:00:41.460> would<00:00:41.610> be

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
whereas outside your rabbit would be

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.529 
whereas outside your rabbit would be
subjected<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.809> high<00:00:43.559> heat<00:00:44.239> very<00:00:45.239> cold

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
subjected to high heat very cold

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.569 
subjected to high heat very cold
temperatures<00:00:46.020> which<00:00:46.590> obviously<00:00:46.890> may<00:00:47.370> limit

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
temperatures which obviously may limit

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.639 
temperatures which obviously may limit
it<00:00:47.789> from<00:00:47.969> being<00:00:48.210> able<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.570> get<00:00:48.780> water<00:00:48.930> if<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
it from being able to get water if the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.520 
it from being able to get water if the
water<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:50.010> frozen<00:00:50.899> predators<00:00:51.899> outside<00:00:52.350> are

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
water is frozen predators outside are

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.200 
water is frozen predators outside are
another<00:00:52.770> good<00:00:52.980> reason<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.489> wouldn't<00:00:54.059> want

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
another good reason you wouldn't want

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.000 
another good reason you wouldn't want
your<00:00:54.329> rabbit<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.840> go<00:00:54.930> roaming<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.500> yard<00:00:55.710> or

be free outside of its cage because

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.069 
be free outside of its cage because
