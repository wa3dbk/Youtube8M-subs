00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.530
 or faith the doctor kristine of the 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.539
 clinic menorca and today I will talk about the 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.849
 protein intake diet 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:17.030
 The first thing you can emphasize is that it's a 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:20.270
 kind of medical treatment that is 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.520
 diet can not be followed as someone 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.990
 because he has craved it as he can 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.280
 go with other diets that are for you 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.040
 there in the market that I bought a book 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.290
 and now I do it on my own here 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.780
 not here there must always be a 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.210
 exhaustive medical control that is 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.610
 fundamental because sometimes the diet is 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.800
 contraindicated is a very reduction 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.870
 drastic calorie and this reduction the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.150
 Let's do at the expense of hydrates 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.510
 of carbon sugars and flours and of 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.510
 fats 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.629
 to ensure that the patient loses 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.969
 fat but do not lose your lean mass 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.760
 so that your skin looks good so that your 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.649
 musculature do not miss so what 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.300
 let's guarantee is a contribution of 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.000
 proteins in the daily diet and that 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.869
 protein contribution is going to be guaranteed to 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.450
 through some laboratory preparations 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.830
 the protein intake diet is not a 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.240
 diet indicated for all types of 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.909
 people who want to lose weight but 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.920
 for those with obesity or 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.670
 with overweight and risk factors 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.470
 cardiometabolic associated with fat 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.290
 first advantage is that 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.600
 and the result in fat loss and 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.030
 weight and volume is much more 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.800
 faster than with other diets 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.560
 we are used to another advantage is 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.290
 that you do not go hungry and then you 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.840
 can you carry then with joy 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.220
 you practically lose a lot of fat but 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.350
 lean mass is maintained in others 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.120
 diets the protein of the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.330
 Patient loses weight but there is a lot of skin 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.060
 hanging there is a lot of aquino flaccidity and 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.430
 a fundamental advantage is that those 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.590
 patients whose obesity is reflected in 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.750
 increase in blood cholesterol cholesterol 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.790
 tension triglycerides are going to see some 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.650
 advantages in your analytics improvements 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.360
 spectacular the first drawback 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.370
 which is a diet of doing 100% is a 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.900
 medical treatment with a base 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.330
 scientific that I have to follow 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.520
 religiously one hundred percent and not 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.730
 I can skip what is never also a 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.800
 diet that I would say at the beginning a little 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.200
 antisocial has many limitations to 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.180
 when to eat out of going to a 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.040
 bar to go with friends what is the 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.890
 advantage that we have instead 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.379
 when a patient starts 80% of the 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.269
 weight that he wants to lose he must lose in 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.420
 strict protein diet this is 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:43.210
 Guaranteed with 5 protein preparations 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.540
 to the day some vegetables 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:49.450
 the extra virgin olive oil in 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.210
 very specific and limited quantity with 2 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.480
 liters of water per day with a series of 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.520
 vitamin supplementation in minerals 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.370
 and religiously you have to follow my 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.090
 indications when the patient has 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:08.140
 lowered after a while that 80% of the 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.160
 weight you want to lower then it's over 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.620
 the first part 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.600
 the part of strict protein diet and 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.880
 then we move on to a second phase that 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.390
 is the phase of food reeducation in 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.730
 which will progressively go 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.310
 thus incorporating different foods from 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.130
 what is a normal balanced diet and 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.440
 still going to lose 20% is going to be a 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.270
 slow phase in which we incorporate the 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.650
 feeding healthy food but 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.250
 no longer from laboratory but from 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.080
 supermarket in the initial phase of diet 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.790
 Protein the patient comes every two 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.350
 weeks religiously and they are made 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.720
 Analytics make tension control 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.460
 of the electro pulse is what it takes 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.590
 to ensure that the health of the 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.150
 patient follow well and better 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.640
 in the second phase of reeducation 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:56.050
 food the patient has every month and 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.120
 there, since medical control is much 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.590
 less exhaustive because the patient already 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.980
 is eating many more calories and more than 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.720
 everything and obviously healthy and finally in 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.310
 the maintenance the patient does not have 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.810
 that getting off is already perfect, I've already 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.090
 learned to eat is simply that 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.549
 every three months it comes to consultation for 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.760
 good to guarantee that effectively 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.799
 for two years it has been maintained and that 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.959
 would be the end of the treatment some 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.669
 years of maintenance and with having 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.440
 learned to eat and maintaining 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.410
 regular physical activity that patient is 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.910
 a patient who is already free to do 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.190
 life on your own 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.139
 Victor, we've been three and a half months 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.900
 treatment and in these three months and 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:38.380
 medium you have lowered 25 kilos of weight and of 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:41.830
 fat 21 kilos of fat is a result 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:46.030
 terrific as of today we started the 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:48.889
 phase that is called more social facilitated 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.389
 Progressively reeducation 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.419
 we are going to introduce the different 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:57.259
 food and doing that bit by bit 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:59.539
 because you eat very healthy and to your liking and 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:03.289
 which of course keeps losing weight 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:04.819
 still and now he has little left but that 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:08.389
 do not keep losing that little bit that you 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:11.979
 missing and putting the different foods 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.979
 of what a healthy diet would be 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.030
 two 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:18.069
 ah
