it definitely fits in the 5s or 5c dock

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.350 
it definitely fits in the 5s or 5c dock
but<00:00:31.439> there<00:00:31.560> are<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.740> couple<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.189> issues<00:00:32.340> here<00:00:32.579> to

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
but there are a couple of issues here to

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.790 
but there are a couple of issues here to
worry<00:00:33.660> about<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.170> I'm<00:00:34.290> gonna<00:00:34.380> go<00:00:34.559> ahead<00:00:34.620> and

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
worry about so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.680 
worry about so I'm gonna go ahead and
explain<00:00:35.130> those<00:00:35.309> for<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.640> real<00:00:35.820> quick

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
explain those for you real quick

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.990 
explain those for you real quick
basically<00:00:37.230> it's<00:00:37.890> not<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.399> know<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:38.670> not<00:00:38.760> cut

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
basically it's not you know it's not cut

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.540 
basically it's not you know it's not cut
out<00:00:39.120> right<00:00:39.360> for<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.079> iPod<00:00:40.440> touch<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:40.950> when<00:00:41.430> you

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
out right for the iPod touch so when you

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.069 
out right for the iPod touch so when you
have<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:41.940> either<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.300> these<00:00:42.510> docks

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
have it in either of these docks

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.590 
have it in either of these docks
there's<00:00:43.350> actually<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> little<00:00:44.610> wiggle<00:00:44.940> room<00:00:45.329> in

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
there's actually a little wiggle room in

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.540 
there's actually a little wiggle room in
there<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.200> not<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.680> good<00:00:46.950> thing<00:00:47.010> either

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
there and it's not a good thing either

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.150 
there and it's not a good thing either
so<00:00:48.000> as<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:48.930> see<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.350> back<00:00:49.530> right<00:00:49.829> here

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
so as you can see on the back right here

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.580 
so as you can see on the back right here
we<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> tiny<00:00:51.420> little<00:00:51.600> gap<00:00:52.079> down<00:00:52.379> there

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
we do have a tiny little gap down there

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.229 
we do have a tiny little gap down there
at<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.980> bottom<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.460> that's<00:00:53.610> because<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
at the bottom and that's because the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.600 
at the bottom and that's because the
iPhone<00:00:54.570> 5c<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.320> obviously<00:00:56.039> bigger<00:00:56.309> than<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
iPhone 5c is obviously bigger than the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.700 
iPhone 5c is obviously bigger than the
iPod<00:00:56.940> Touch<00:00:57.270> now<00:00:57.750> as<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.109> can<00:00:58.199> see<00:00:58.260> there's

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
iPod Touch now as you can see there's

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.369 
iPod Touch now as you can see there's
just<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.340> huge<00:00:59.609> gap<00:00:59.940> here<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.420> what<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.109> means

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
just a huge gap here and what this means

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.070 
just a huge gap here and what this means
is<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:02.489> iPod<00:01:02.879> Touch<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.390> only<00:01:03.719> being

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
is that the iPod Touch is only being

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.170 
is that the iPod Touch is only being
supported<00:01:04.739> by<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.250> lightning<00:01:05.909> connector

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
supported by the lightning connector

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.240 
supported by the lightning connector
that's<00:01:06.689> at<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.170> bottom<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:07.979> have<00:01:08.220> a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
that's at the bottom of it so you have a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.070 
that's at the bottom of it so you have a
lot<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.549> wiggle<00:01:08.790> room<00:01:09.090> here<00:01:09.119> that's<00:01:09.720> not<00:01:09.900> going

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
lot of wiggle room here that's not going

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.929 
lot of wiggle room here that's not going
to<00:01:10.170> prevent<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.680> from<00:01:10.740> working<00:01:10.890> but<00:01:11.520> as<00:01:11.760> you

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
to prevent it from working but as you

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.420 
to prevent it from working but as you
can<00:01:12.090> see<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.390> 5s<00:01:12.900> dock<00:01:13.409> actually<00:01:13.950> has<00:01:14.130> way

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
can see the 5s dock actually has way

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.370 
can see the 5s dock actually has way
less<00:01:14.460> wiggle<00:01:15.180> room<00:01:15.390> but<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:15.960> you're<00:01:16.080> looking

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
less wiggle room but if you're looking

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.350 
less wiggle room but if you're looking
to<00:01:16.560> pick<00:01:16.799> up<00:01:16.979> one<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.460> these<00:01:17.610> docks<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:18.210> your

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
to pick up one of these docks for your

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.450 
to pick up one of these docks for your
fifth-generation<00:01:18.750> iPod<00:01:19.140> touch<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.860> highly

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
fifth-generation iPod touch I highly

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.149 
fifth-generation iPod touch I highly
recommend<00:01:20.970> grabbing<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.689> iPhone<00:01:22.140> 5s<00:01:22.710> dock

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
recommend grabbing the iPhone 5s dock

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.700 
recommend grabbing the iPhone 5s dock
just<00:01:23.430> because<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.330> has<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> way<00:01:24.930> less<00:01:25.200> wiggle

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
just because it has a way less wiggle

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.620 
just because it has a way less wiggle
room<00:01:25.890> there<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.490> back<00:01:26.700> right<00:01:27.119> here<00:01:27.330> as<00:01:27.450> you

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
room there in the back right here as you

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
room there in the back right here as you
can<00:01:27.780> see<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.140> weight<00:01:28.409> less<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.890> crack<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
can see just weight less of a crack and

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.280 
can see just weight less of a crack and
I<00:01:29.549> mean<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.090> still<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:30.509> have<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.930> kind<00:01:31.200> of

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
I mean you still do have this kind of

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.560 
I mean you still do have this kind of
just<00:01:31.770> freestanding<00:01:32.369> iPod<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.360> only

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
just freestanding iPod and it's only

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.060 
just freestanding iPod and it's only
being<00:01:33.840> supported<00:01:34.439> by<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.619> Lightning

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
being supported by the Lightning

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.950 
being supported by the Lightning
connector<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.880> at<00:01:36.000> least<00:01:36.210> there's<00:01:36.600> less

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
connector but at least there's less

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.020 
connector but at least there's less
space<00:01:37.320> back<00:01:37.680> there<00:01:37.759> obviously<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.850> would<00:01:39.000> be

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
space back there obviously it would be

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.910 
space back there obviously it would be
ideal<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.540> have<00:01:39.720> less<00:01:40.140> space<00:01:40.290> there<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:40.829> you

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
ideal to have less space there but you

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.499 
ideal to have less space there but you
may<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.130> able<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.520> mod<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> piece

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
may be able to mod it with like a piece

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.420 
may be able to mod it with like a piece
of<00:01:42.540> foam<00:01:42.960> or<00:01:42.990> something<00:01:43.590> like<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.159> stick

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
it in that little space right there so

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.480 
it in that little space right there so
it's<00:01:46.140> not<00:01:46.259> resting<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.189> Lightning

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490
