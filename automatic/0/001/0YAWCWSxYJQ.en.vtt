00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.030 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:41.119 

Oh

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.640 

so<00:00:42.129> the<00:00:42.219> two<00:00:42.370> obvious<00:00:42.760> transitions<00:00:43.329> in<00:00:43.480> my

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
so the two obvious transitions in my

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.690 
so the two obvious transitions in my
life<00:00:43.800> one<00:00:44.040> when<00:00:44.220> I<00:00:44.250> broke<00:00:44.520> my<00:00:44.670> back<00:00:45.080> which

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
life one when I broke my back which

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.400 
life one when I broke my back which
ironically<00:00:47.700> enough<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.300> where<00:00:48.540> I<00:00:48.570> felt<00:00:48.990> most

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
ironically enough is where I felt most

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.440 
ironically enough is where I felt most
powerful<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.250> my<00:00:50.550> life<00:00:50.790> because<00:00:51.030> my<00:00:51.180> life<00:00:51.390> was

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
powerful in my life because my life was

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.020 
powerful in my life because my life was
black<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.020> white<00:00:52.220> the<00:00:53.220> second<00:00:53.550> transition

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
black and white the second transition

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.970 
black and white the second transition
was<00:00:54.510> when<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.080> retired<00:00:55.560> from<00:00:55.710> competitive

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
out climbing these hills and probably I

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.700 
out climbing these hills and probably I
don't<00:01:32.550> know<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.850> took<00:01:32.940> me<00:01:33.090> half<00:01:33.390> an<00:01:34.260> hour<00:01:34.380> up

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
and then I'm coming down and I'm just

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.410 
and then I'm coming down and I'm just
sort<00:01:37.080> of<00:01:37.110> thinking<00:01:37.440> and<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.860> my<00:01:38.700> subconscious

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
sort of thinking and and my subconscious

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.420 
sort of thinking and and my subconscious
sort<00:01:39.720> bubbled<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.320> surface<00:01:40.860> at<00:01:41.010> this<00:01:41.160> point

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
sort bubbled the surface at this point

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.580 
sort bubbled the surface at this point
and<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.420> had<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.660> thought<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.050> I<00:01:43.229> should<00:01:43.410> climb

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
and I had this thought of I should climb

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.550 
and I had this thought of I should climb
Mount<00:01:43.890> Kilimanjaro<00:01:44.630> had<00:01:45.630> no<00:01:45.900> idea<00:01:46.259> whether<00:01:46.440> it

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
Mount Kilimanjaro had no idea whether it

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.440 
Mount Kilimanjaro had no idea whether it
was<00:01:46.680> possible<00:01:46.890> had<00:01:47.310> no<00:01:47.460> idea<00:01:47.760> whether<00:01:47.910> anybody

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
was possible had no idea whether anybody

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.230 
was possible had no idea whether anybody
had<00:01:48.600> tried<00:01:48.900> to<00:01:49.050> do<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.410> a<00:01:49.470> hand<00:01:49.680> cycle<00:01:50.210> but<00:01:51.210> I

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
had tried to do it in a hand cycle but I

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.580 
had tried to do it in a hand cycle but I
thought<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.930> what<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.110> want<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.440> do

thought this is what I want to do

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.220 
thought this is what I want to do
because<00:01:52.800> when<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.130> had<00:01:53.370> left<00:01:54.230> competitive

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
because when I had left competitive

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.700 
because when I had left competitive
sport<00:01:55.560> what<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.770> missed<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.370> most<00:01:56.540> was<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.710> my

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
sport what I missed the most was that my

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.440 
sport what I missed the most was that my
performance<00:01:59.190> could<00:01:59.580> speak<00:01:59.909> for<00:02:00.120> a<00:02:00.150> whole<00:02:00.210> lot

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450

of people who didn't necessarily have a
voice<00:02:02.370> I<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.790> speak<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.060> me<00:02:04.050> is<00:02:04.260> somebody<00:02:04.500> in

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
voice I can speak for me is somebody in

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.080 
voice I can speak for me is somebody in
a<00:02:04.710> wheelchair<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:05.220> it<00:02:05.310> could<00:02:05.400> speak<00:02:05.610> for<00:02:05.850> a
