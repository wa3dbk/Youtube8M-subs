00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
have a swivel it's a pivot when you get

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.169 
have a swivel it's a pivot when you get
to<00:00:07.350> bag<00:00:07.560> you<00:00:08.040> want<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.309> hit<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:08.550> as<00:00:08.670> if<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:09.000> put

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
to bag you want to hit it as if you put

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.730 
to bag you want to hit it as if you put
a<00:00:09.210> plumb<00:00:09.480> line<00:00:09.510> right<00:00:09.960> here<00:00:10.170> in<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.410> center<00:00:10.710> of

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
a plumb line right here in the center of

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.379 
a plumb line right here in the center of
this<00:00:10.950> pivot<00:00:11.400> right<00:00:11.580> here<00:00:11.790> that<00:00:11.969> plumb<00:00:12.210> line

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
this pivot right here that plumb line

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.240 
this pivot right here that plumb line
would<00:00:12.599> go<00:00:12.719> straight<00:00:13.139> down<00:00:13.410> right<00:00:13.679> here

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
would go straight down right here

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.400 
would go straight down right here
now<00:00:14.700> your<00:00:14.969> point<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.269> impact<00:00:15.660> should<00:00:15.960> be<00:00:16.139> right

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
now your point of impact should be right

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.109 
now your point of impact should be right
here<00:00:16.710> on<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.010> bag<00:00:17.220> right<00:00:17.520> about<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:17.970> you
