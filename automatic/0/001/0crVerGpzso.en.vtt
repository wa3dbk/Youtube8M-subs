00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.230
 Hi seekers. 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.140
 In today's video, I'll show Easter eggs from Dragon Age: 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.140
 Inquisition. 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.339
 Traveling around the world you can find a few references. 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:08.940
 to other EA games. 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.589
 Arriving at Crestwood, on the farm of the old Whitter, show up 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.349
 a kind of place - a series of large sunflowers 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.050
 opposite a stone fence, each of which is planted 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.740
 between the long boards. 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.500
 Looks like a track. 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.919
 On several of these paths, next to sunflowers are 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:23.919
 body. 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.710
 This is a clear parody of the game PopCap, which owns 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.710
 EA - Plants vs Zombies. 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.061
 It's amazing that the plants here are intact, because 

00:00:31.061 --> 00:00:33.629
 that I don't see a single pea grower here and not quite 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.020
 it is clear how sunflowers won this fight. 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.190
 This is not the only reference to this game. 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.440
 Nearby there is a building where you can climb the stairs. 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.470
 At the top will be a chair, a bottle of some kind of drink. 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.470
 and diary. 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.989
 Having read that it turned out that in Ferelden was very 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:48.059
 strange battle. 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.739
 The demon revived the whole army of corpses and sent them to 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.609
 home of the retreat, hermit. 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.719
 But she was not defenseless and with the help of magic instilled 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.650
 spirits in the plants in the garden. 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.200
 Dead in a hurry instead of armor pulled on themselves 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.440
 buckets and took the door instead of shields, and the plants in response 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.040
 spat at them with seeds. 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.900
 And at the end of this diary, the writing style is very similar. 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.120
 Mad Dave 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.590
 In the world of Dragon Age his name is Davet Mad. 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.700
 In this world, in several locations there are a couple of few 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.140
 strange places. 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.790
 One of them is near the mountains, on a small hill with a view 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.790
 on the forest. 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.610
 There is a stool, a bottle of booze and someone's corpse. 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.721
 The second place like this is on the Stormlands, 

00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:27.090
 even more strange place. 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.120
 On the rocks just above the raging sea. 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.040
 Only here there is a piece of cheese, but there are no bodies. 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.750
 I don't know what that means. 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.750
 Speaking of cheese. 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.170
 In the game he paid quite a lot of attention. 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.170
 Like that, in one of the houses, I found on the table a huge 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.170
 piece of cheese. 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.461
 It surprised me, but at the same time I thought that 

00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:45.670
 maybe it's pretty affordable food for the locals. 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.710
 I thought so until I got to one village 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.710
 in Crestwood. 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.130
 There, under the mountain stands a house, behind which in a small 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.540
 a skeleton sits on the back of the street, scattered under its feet, 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.020
 As I understood, some cards. 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.390
 And, I almost forgot, this huge one is still nearby. 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.390
 cheese. 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.390
 What in general. 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.270
 Either one of the farmers made a small stash 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.961
 food, or I don't even know. 

00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:08.110
 I do not know how the skeleton, cards and cheese are interconnected. 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.450
 But I would like to know the history of this town. 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.240
 But this is not the last strange thing with cheese. 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.230
 Again, still in Crestwood. 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.799
 On the mountain, just above the cliff, there seems to be a supervisory 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:18.819
 paragraph. 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.209
 There on the table is a small piece of cheese, similar to the one 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.590
 that was in someone's house. 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.969
 Only this one can take. 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:27.299
 And no, this is not food to replenish health ... This is a shield. 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.260
 And if this cheese can be a shield, then I think you should not 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.260
 it is. 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.239
 Not sure, though, how they cope with the smell. 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.099
 By the way, in the game you can still find a variety of debris 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.230
 weapons and other necessary and unnecessary things. 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.440
 Among them can get “sad fragments”. 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.090
 This is a simple stick, to which a nail is nailed ... a banana. 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.329
 There is one Easter egg in the game that no one should even 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:48.329
 was to find. 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.719
 But, you understand that the chances of not finding such a pretty 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:51.719
 are small. 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.109
 Sooner or later, somebody would have noticed it. 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.230
 In this case, it happened early. 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.370
 Easter should not have been found, because it is 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.489
 under the textures. 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.329
 But it just so happened that it was in this place that the small 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.340
 a bug due to which the character fell through them. 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.709
 It is located in Skyhold, under the library. 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.019
 I did not have this bug, no matter how hard I tried to fall 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.090
 under the texture. 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.810
 But if you still succeed, under them you will find the head 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.330
 from, like, pie. 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.170
 With eyes and a big hat. 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.079
 Very reminiscent of the Hatter from “Alice in Wonderland”. 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.190
 Remember the episode for the second part of the game? 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.959
 There I showed an old man who told you the ending 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:24.959
 different movies. 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.400
 Then, having got to Skyhold, talk to Cole. 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.060
 Every time, starting a conversation with him, he will issue 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.170
 spoilers for a variety of movies. 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.409
 And here they are much more than the old man gave out in Dragon 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:36.409
 Age 2. 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.109
 According to one of the tasks in the game, called “The Spirit of the Lake”, 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.230
 which you can take from a woman in the village of Redcliffe, you need 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.870
 will be attributed to the lake a bloody lotus. 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.049
 Reaching the right place and putting a lotus from the lake 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.390
 There will be a sword that can be picked up. 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.529
 This is a parody of the story about the sword from the lake - Escalibur 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:54.169
 - the famous sword of King Arthur, who brought him in 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:55.739
 Gift of the Spirit of the Lake. 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.840
 At the Crossroads, in one of the houses on the edge of the settlement, 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.849
 You can find the "Healer Records at the Crossroads". 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.569
 This mysterious healer uses short simple 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.069
 sentences that lead straight to the point. 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.639
 Players noticed that the text was written in the style of Mordin 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.790
 Souls is a scientist and Salarian healer from the Mass Effect game. 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.219
 I have not shown this yet, as I made the video only 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:17.200
 on the first part of the Mass Effect. 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.660
 But still, in the second part you can find a demon statue 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.660
 from Dragon Age. 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.320
 Right there on the multiplayer map on the estate, in one 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.860
 trophies hang from the rooms. 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.250
 Heads of different animals and ... krogan. 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.920
 This is an alien race in the Mass Effect universe. 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.320
 How he got here and much more important who could 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.320
 kill him? 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.840
 This is already a question. 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.060
 Unfortunately, I did not find the right room. 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.450
 The map is large, and even in multiplayer. 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.290
 Just so you can not walk. 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.980
 They say the head can also be found in the single, but where 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.790
 I don't know exactly. 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.370
 Having conquered a fortress in the Western limit, in the very fortress 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.720
 sometimes there will be three soldiers and their commander, 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.370
 which will give out different phrases. 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.380
 If you're lucky, you can hear their dialogue, 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.630
 which the commander asks the soldiers - what is most important 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.630
 in the Inquisition? 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.430
 To which they respond: “Suddenness, gray”, “Suddenness and fear!”. 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.320
 This scene is an obvious reference to the “Spanish Inquisition” 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.340
 Monty Python. 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.920
 This, I will tell you, should have happened, they must 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.550
 Were add here this easter eggs and I am glad that they 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.550
 did so. 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.390
 It was the last Easter eggs in the video, on which I leave you 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.670
 until next week. 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.743
 Do not forget to subscribe to the channel to find out 

00:05:18.743 --> 00:05:19.960
 about the new commercials the very first.
