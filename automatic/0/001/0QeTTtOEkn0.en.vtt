00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.720
 until recently, orthodontics was used mainly to straighten 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.460
 their teeth crooked today when the problems they detect 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.280
 time it becomes possible to modify the facial development they had growth 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.520
 Lizana functional appliances other orthodontic appliances are not effective 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.540
 for facial development but if they move their teeth and correct malocclusions 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.250
 this device corrected the bite of these posterior teeth this collision 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.250
 the bite of the front teeth a third class of appliances called 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.520
 space maintainers is used after having lost a baby tooth 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.860
 they maintain the alignment of the permanent teeth this is chirping that the 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.329
 molar move forward this is stabilizing the teeth on both sides 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.520
 mouth brakes are used to correct a bad bite once 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.670
 most permanent teeth have left until the 80s a band 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.260
 steel encircled each tooth separately as a ring the wire that 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.780
 pushed the teeth the line of bow was attached a small brake 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.590
 that was in the front of these steel bands 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.490
 you will remember the appearance of them a mouth full of metal 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.780
 Fortunately 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.860
 currently we have deployed these bands for braquets that gave just 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.860
 on the front of the teeth are much more comfortable in smaller size than 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.320
 a grain of corn and much less obvious there are also brakes 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.260
 challenge but they are generally more expensive and more difficult to 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:24.210
 keep clean 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.700
 a stainless steel wire even with the brackets and the different ones 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.430
 sizes provides the pressure to move the teeth the elastics that 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.890
 now many trendy colors come in the wire manchin instead 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.210
 You can browse special elastic bands to accelerate the movement 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.479
 of the teeth in difficult cases can be used wires and accessories 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.390
 different in this case we are wearing fang your place those earring how much 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.409
 you can move your teeth in the post the weight responds the tension created by 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.080
 this work that chela month producing special cells on each side of the 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.210
 tooth these cells move bones and one side of the tooth and all are 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.569
 show the opposite side this allows the day you move 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.509
 How long the child should remain with the arms depends on the severity of 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.810
 the malocclusion but normally it is from one to three years 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.180
 once the brackets are placed, the cleaning of the teeth becomes more 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.890
 difficult for children then regular cleaning consultations are 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.870
 more important than ever if the bacterial plaque is not removed frequently 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.080
 Permanent white spots will form on the teeth after treatment 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.160
 they use retainers to keep the teeth in their new alignment some 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.170
 to forks are removable while others do enter a fixed place a 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.239
 orthodontics successes is a joint effort of all involved 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.879
 With a joint effort you can reach the goal a healthy mouth and 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:41.900
 a smile from her
