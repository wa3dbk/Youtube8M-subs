with<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> Harrier<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.140> had<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.410> be

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
with the Harrier you had to be

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.889 
with the Harrier you had to be
constantly<00:00:47.129> refining<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.120> controls<00:00:48.540> to<00:00:48.690> make

constantly refining the controls to make

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.020 
constantly refining the controls to make
sure<00:00:49.050> you're<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.070> right<00:00:50.250> piece<00:00:50.850> of

really<00:00:53.910> your<00:00:54.059> job<00:00:54.239> becomes<00:00:54.449> much<00:00:54.840> easier<00:00:54.920> it's

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
really your job becomes much easier it's

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.040 
really your job becomes much easier it's
a<00:00:56.070> much<00:00:56.220> less<00:00:56.489> stressful<00:00:56.790> task<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:57.899> so

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
a much less stressful task so it's so

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.149 
a much less stressful task so it's so
much<00:00:58.230> safer<00:00:58.410> aircraft<00:00:58.860> to<00:00:58.949> fly

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.039 

their<00:01:05.789> crafts<00:01:06.060> performing<00:01:06.479> fantastically

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
their crafts performing fantastically

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.590 
their crafts performing fantastically
out<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.289> sea<00:01:07.969> obviously<00:01:08.969> we<00:01:09.090> have<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.329> prior

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
out to sea obviously we have the prior

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.499 
out to sea obviously we have the prior
experience<00:01:10.109> on<00:01:10.380> dt1<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.729> couple<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.299> years<00:01:12.329> ago

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
experience on dt1 a couple of years ago

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.999 
experience on dt1 a couple of years ago
and<00:01:13.310> we<00:01:14.310> saw<00:01:14.579> then<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.509> f-35<00:01:16.380> suited<00:01:16.859> its

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
and we saw then that the f-35 suited its

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.190 
and we saw then that the f-35 suited its
environment<00:01:17.490> very<00:01:17.670> well<00:01:17.899> what<00:01:18.899> we've<00:01:19.020> now

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
environment very well what we've now

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.410 
environment very well what we've now
moved<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.469> to<00:01:19.649> is<00:01:20.069> pushing<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.939> envelope<00:01:21.030> out

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
moved on to is pushing the envelope out

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.440 
moved on to is pushing the envelope out
further<00:01:22.219> carrying<00:01:23.219> internal<00:01:23.670> stores<00:01:23.969> and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
further carrying internal stores and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.539 
further carrying internal stores and
flying<00:01:25.020> at<00:01:25.200> night<00:01:25.229> I'm<00:01:26.130> really<00:01:26.459> just

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
flying at night I'm really just

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.190 
flying at night I'm really just
expanding<00:01:27.149> the<00:01:27.240> envelope<00:01:27.539> to<00:01:27.689> make<00:01:27.840> sure<00:01:27.990> that

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
expanding the envelope to make sure that

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.139 
expanding the envelope to make sure that
when<00:01:28.289> the<00:01:28.380> marine<00:01:28.560> corps<00:01:28.799> go<00:01:29.099> to<00:01:29.159> initial

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
when the marine corps go to initial

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.149 
when the marine corps go to initial
operating<00:01:30.420> capability<00:01:30.679> they've<00:01:31.679> got<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
operating capability they've got the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.599 
operating capability they've got the
best<00:01:32.819> available<00:01:33.859> operating<00:01:34.859> envelope<00:01:35.159> that

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
best available operating envelope that

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.840 
best available operating envelope that
we<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:35.849> give<00:01:36.000> them

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.679 

taking<00:01:40.600> off<00:01:40.689> with<00:01:40.900> with<00:01:41.710> a<00:01:41.740> weapon<00:01:41.950> load<00:01:42.280> is

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
taking off with with a weapon load is

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.999 
taking off with with a weapon load is
relatively<00:01:43.689> transparent<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.439> the<00:01:44.470> pilot<00:01:44.920> the

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
relatively transparent to the pilot the

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.710 
relatively transparent to the pilot the
acceleration<00:01:45.610> is<00:01:45.700> still<00:01:45.970> good<00:01:46.150> down<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.509> deck

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
acceleration is still good down the deck

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.160 
acceleration is still good down the deck
the<00:01:47.229> handling<00:01:47.680> is<00:01:47.799> all<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.070> same<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.570> whether

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
the handling is all the same so whether

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.780 
the handling is all the same so whether
you've<00:01:50.350> got<00:01:50.470> weapons<00:01:50.619> or<00:01:50.920> not<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:51.430> be<00:01:51.520> honest

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
you've got weapons or not to be honest

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.690 
you've got weapons or not to be honest
it's<00:01:52.150> hard<00:01:52.360> to<00:01:52.479> tell

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.399 

I<00:01:55.850> was<00:01:56.299> initially<00:01:56.659> a<00:01:56.689> little<00:01:56.960> worried<00:01:57.229> about

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
I was initially a little worried about

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.100 
I was initially a little worried about
flying<00:01:57.680> at<00:01:57.829> night<00:01:57.860> with<00:01:58.280> my<00:01:58.509> harrier<00:01:59.509> legacy

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
flying at night with my harrier legacy

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.620 
flying at night with my harrier legacy
baggage<00:02:00.530> because<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.640> harrier<00:02:01.909> was<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.119> much

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
baggage because the harrier was a much

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.380 
baggage because the harrier was a much
more<00:02:02.840> difficult<00:02:03.320> aircraft<00:02:03.829> to<00:02:03.920> fly<00:02:04.390> happily

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
more difficult aircraft to fly happily

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.480 
more difficult aircraft to fly happily
the<00:02:05.570> f-35<00:02:06.049> is<00:02:06.079> much<00:02:06.560> easier<00:02:06.590> it's<00:02:07.130> definitely

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
the f-35 is much easier it's definitely

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
the f-35 is much easier it's definitely
5th<00:02:07.729> gen<00:02:08.000> in<00:02:08.479> every<00:02:09.259> respect<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.729> the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
5th gen in every respect and the the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.870 
5th gen in every respect and the the
night<00:02:11.720> flying<00:02:11.989> was<00:02:12.349> was<00:02:12.709> a<00:02:12.739> breeze

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.690 

what<00:02:16.480> we're<00:02:16.630> seeing<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.550> aircraft's<00:02:18.550> much

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
what we're seeing is the aircraft's much

all the components that we need to

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.940 
all the components that we need to

change the work we have to do is
considerably<00:02:30.850> easier<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:31.270> hence<00:02:31.570> quicker<00:02:31.900> the

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
considerably easier I hence quicker the
