also gonna have to figure out the new
soul<00:00:54.769> gauge<00:00:55.010> system<00:00:55.610> which<00:00:55.940> changes<00:00:56.420> the

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
soul gauge system which changes the

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.719 
soul gauge system which changes the
gameplay<00:00:56.780> somewhat<00:00:57.530> in<00:00:57.769> that<00:00:57.949> it's<00:00:58.280> no<00:00:58.549> longer

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
gameplay somewhat in that it's no longer

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:00.250 
gameplay somewhat in that it's no longer
an<00:00:58.909> option<00:00:59.030> for<00:00:59.299> you<00:00:59.390> just<00:00:59.570> a<00:00:59.690> block<00:00:59.930> block

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
an option for you just a block block

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.340 
an option for you just a block block
block<00:01:00.290> all<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:00.920> time<00:01:01.280> if<00:01:01.640> you<00:01:01.790> do<00:01:01.970> that

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
block all the time if you do that

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.180 
block all the time if you do that
ultimately<00:01:03.350> you're<00:01:03.500> gonna<00:01:03.589> get<00:01:03.769> punished

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
ultimately you're gonna get punished

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.219 
ultimately you're gonna get punished
because<00:01:04.339> your<00:01:04.610> soul<00:01:04.850> gauge<00:01:05.059> is<00:01:05.299> gonna<00:01:05.510> go<00:01:05.930> red

and jumps around so much that he can
actually<00:04:16.250> just<00:04:16.549> be<00:04:16.699> really<00:04:16.910> hard<00:04:17.090> about<00:04:17.329> here

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
actually just be really hard about here

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.479 
actually just be really hard about here
he's<00:04:18.229> definitely<00:04:18.650> a<00:04:18.709> tough<00:04:18.949> one<00:04:19.100> to<00:04:19.160> fight

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
he's definitely a tough one to fight

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.180 
he's definitely a tough one to fight
against<00:04:20.049> but<00:04:21.049> he<00:04:21.139> doesn't<00:04:21.440> use<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:21.590> force<00:04:21.979> a

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
against but he doesn't use the force a

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.300 
against but he doesn't use the force a
lot<00:04:22.370> and<00:04:22.639> he<00:04:22.880> isn't<00:04:23.419> very<00:04:24.110> fast<00:04:24.440> like<00:04:25.039> when

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
lot and he isn't very fast like when

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.060 
lot and he isn't very fast like when
moving<00:04:25.699> around<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.060> arena<00:04:26.300> so<00:04:26.770> he<00:04:27.770> still

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
moving around the arena so he still

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.650 
moving around the arena so he still
reasonably<00:04:28.490> won't<00:04:28.669> balance<00:04:28.910> though<00:04:29.300> he's<00:04:29.510> not

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
reasonably won't balance though he's not

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.190
