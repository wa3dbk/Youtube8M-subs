then again the note 3 was never supposed

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.729 
then again the note 3 was never supposed
to<00:00:50.789> be<00:00:50.879> just<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.329> one-hand<00:00:51.719> device<00:00:52.020> after<00:00:52.440> all

it comes with the s-pen that facilitates

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.510 
it comes with the s-pen that facilitates
two-handed<00:00:54.899> operation<00:00:55.379> but<00:00:55.860> design<00:00:56.129> wise<00:00:56.309> we

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
two-handed operation but design wise we

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.830 
two-handed operation but design wise we
are<00:00:56.640> seeing<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.969> new<00:00:57.120> philosophy<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.809> the
