lot different than you know team
deathmatch<00:00:59.270> type<00:00:59.540> mode<00:00:59.780> just<00:01:00.050> because<00:01:00.380> you

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
deathmatch type mode just because you

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.250

have<00:01:00.650> to<00:01:00.770> go<00:01:00.920> through<00:01:01.190> a<00:01:01.250> bunch<00:01:01.490> of<00:01:01.730> different

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
have to go through a bunch of different

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.359 
have to go through a bunch of different
strategical<00:01:03.260> considerations<00:01:03.560> when<00:01:04.220> you're

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
strategical considerations when you're

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.620 
strategical considerations when you're
playing<00:01:04.549> this<00:01:05.530> first<00:01:06.530> of<00:01:06.710> all<00:01:06.830> it<00:01:07.820> does<00:01:08.210> create

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
playing this first of all it does create

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.420 
playing this first of all it does create
some<00:01:08.750> bad<00:01:09.110> habits<00:01:09.350> for<00:01:09.740> your<00:01:09.860> team<00:01:10.040> deathmatch

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
some bad habits for your team deathmatch

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.760 
some bad habits for your team deathmatch
games<00:01:10.729> because<00:01:11.180> you<00:01:12.020> have<00:01:12.140> to<00:01:12.229> follow<00:01:12.409> up<00:01:12.619> your

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
games because you have to follow up your

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.130 
games because you have to follow up your
kills<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.189> grab<00:01:13.340> this<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.790> tags<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:14.450> I<00:01:14.930> know

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
kills and grab this the tags so I know

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.929 
kills and grab this the tags so I know
that<00:01:15.439> I<00:01:15.469> was<00:01:15.740> getting<00:01:15.979> into<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.219> bad<00:01:16.369> habit<00:01:16.579> of

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
that I was getting into the bad habit of

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.419 
that I was getting into the bad habit of
basically<00:01:17.619> sprinting<00:01:18.619> through<00:01:18.740> my<00:01:18.979> kills<00:01:19.219> and

00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:19.429 
basically sprinting through my kills and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:21.669 
basically sprinting through my kills and
team<00:01:19.579> deathmatch<00:01:19.969> games<00:01:20.719> even<00:01:21.289> if<00:01:21.530> i<00:01:21.619> don't

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
team deathmatch games even if i don't

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:24.330 
team deathmatch games even if i don't
have<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:22.189> tag<00:01:22.520> right<00:01:22.700> in<00:01:22.820> front<00:01:22.999> of<00:01:23.090> me<00:01:23.210> but

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
have the tag right in front of me but

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.230 
have the tag right in front of me but
essentially<00:01:25.340> that<00:01:25.429> the<00:01:25.609> idea<00:01:25.880> behind<00:01:26.030> the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
essentially that the idea behind the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.849 
essentially that the idea behind the
game<00:01:26.420> is<00:01:26.749> that<00:01:26.960> you<00:01:27.020> had<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.259> grab<00:01:27.439> the<00:01:27.649> tag

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
game is that you had to grab the tag

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.149 
game is that you had to grab the tag
after<00:01:28.189> you<00:01:28.969> kill<00:01:29.210> somebody<00:01:29.479> or<00:01:29.899> if<00:01:30.409> you<00:01:30.560> die<00:01:30.799> or

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
after you kill somebody or if you die or

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.219 
after you kill somebody or if you die or
and<00:01:31.520> your<00:01:31.670> teammates<00:01:31.969> die<00:01:32.179> grab<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.780> red<00:01:32.960> tag

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
and your teammates die grab the red tag

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.050 
and your teammates die grab the red tag
to<00:01:33.740> prevent<00:01:34.039> them<00:01:34.219> from<00:01:34.249> being<00:01:34.549> credited<00:01:34.939> with

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
to prevent them from being credited with

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.309 
to prevent them from being credited with
the<00:01:35.210> kill<00:01:35.509> of<00:01:36.289> course<00:01:36.649> you<00:01:37.579> know<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.840> idea

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
the kill of course you know you the idea

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.109 
the kill of course you know you the idea
behind<00:01:39.530> it<00:01:39.859> is<00:01:40.009> that<00:01:40.069> you<00:01:40.490> know<00:01:40.579> if<00:01:40.850> you<00:01:40.969> have

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
behind it is that you know if you have

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.149 
behind it is that you know if you have
your<00:01:41.899> running<00:01:42.170> in<00:01:42.259> a<00:01:42.350> team<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:42.859> you<00:01:42.950> have<00:01:43.130> a

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
your running in a team and you have a

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.370 
your running in a team and you have a
bunch<00:01:43.609> of<00:01:43.759> different<00:01:43.850> people<00:01:44.240> together<00:01:44.380> that

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
bunch of different people together that

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.590 
bunch of different people together that
you're<00:01:45.679> going<00:01:45.770> to<00:01:45.829> be<00:01:45.920> able<00:01:46.009> to<00:01:46.369> grab<00:01:47.090> tags<00:01:47.389> a

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
you're going to be able to grab tags a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.809 
you're going to be able to grab tags a
little<00:01:47.780> easier<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:48.499> if<00:01:49.100> you're<00:01:49.249> camping<00:01:49.700> in

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
little easier and if you're camping in

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.160 
little easier and if you're camping in
the<00:01:49.939> corners<00:01:50.389> it's<00:01:50.630> going<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:50.869> be<00:01:50.929> a<00:01:50.960> little

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
the corners it's going to be a little

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.050 
the corners it's going to be a little
harder<00:01:51.499> to<00:01:51.530> grab<00:01:51.829> tags<00:01:52.159> and<00:01:52.460> win<00:01:52.700> for<00:01:52.939> your

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
harder to grab tags and win for your

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.989 
harder to grab tags and win for your
team<00:01:53.270> so<00:01:53.659> it<00:01:54.229> definitely<00:01:54.499> adds<00:01:54.709> some

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:54.999 
team so it definitely adds some

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:56.770 
team so it definitely adds some
interesting<00:01:55.999> strategical<00:01:56.539> considerations

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
interesting strategical considerations

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.169 
interesting strategical considerations
it<00:01:57.619> doesn't<00:01:57.950> affect<00:01:58.189> my<00:01:58.459> game<00:01:58.520> all<00:01:58.880> that<00:01:59.030> much

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
it doesn't affect my game all that much

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
interesting addition to modern warfare 3

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.670 
interesting addition to modern warfare 3
in<00:02:21.909> my<00:02:22.909> killstreaks<00:02:23.269> set<00:02:23.629> up<00:02:23.750> i'm<00:02:23.900> running

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
in my killstreaks set up i'm running

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.270 
in my killstreaks set up i'm running
UAV<00:02:25.810> Sam<00:02:26.810> turret<00:02:27.079> which<00:02:27.379> I<00:02:27.590> don't<00:02:27.829> really<00:02:28.069> know

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
UAV Sam turret which I don't really know

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.580 
UAV Sam turret which I don't really know
why<00:02:28.459> it's<00:02:28.790> not<00:02:28.909> that<00:02:29.090> great<00:02:29.329> I<00:02:30.049> just<00:02:30.379> didn't

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
why it's not that great I just didn't

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.080 
why it's not that great I just didn't
change<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.189> because<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.430> was<00:02:31.579> spending<00:02:31.730> most<00:02:31.939> my

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
change it because I was spending most my

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.270 
change it because I was spending most my
you<00:02:32.599> know<00:02:32.689> killstreak<00:02:33.230> unlocks<00:02:33.650> on<00:02:33.890> stuff<00:02:34.189> I

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
you know killstreak unlocks on stuff I

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.679 
you know killstreak unlocks on stuff I
didn't<00:02:34.489> need<00:02:34.609> and<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:36.349> last<00:02:36.590> one<00:02:36.829> is<00:02:36.859> the

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
didn't need and the last one is the

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.119 
didn't need and the last one is the
advanced<00:02:38.689> UAV<00:02:38.870> which<00:02:39.409> is<00:02:39.590> sort<00:02:39.799> of<00:02:39.859> like<00:02:39.950> the

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
advanced UAV which is sort of like the

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.099 
advanced UAV which is sort of like the
blackboard<00:02:40.609> from<00:02:40.790> black<00:02:41.000> ops<00:02:41.239> the

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
blackboard from black ops the

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:43.959 
blackboard from black ops the
interesting<00:02:42.530> part<00:02:42.680> about<00:02:42.799> the<00:02:43.010> support

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:43.969 
interesting part about the support

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.879 
interesting part about the support
killstreaks<00:02:44.299> though<00:02:44.900> is<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.549> they<00:02:47.889> they

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
killstreaks though is that they they

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.979 
killstreaks though is that they they
chain<00:02:49.459> even<00:02:49.849> if<00:02:49.969> you<00:02:50.090> don't<00:02:50.299> you<00:02:50.510> know<00:02:50.599> even<00:02:50.900> if

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
chain even if you don't you know even if

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.479 
chain even if you don't you know even if
you<00:02:51.049> die<00:02:51.260> in<00:02:51.290> between<00:02:51.709> them<00:02:51.859> so<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.129> just<00:02:52.310> takes

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
you die in between them so it just takes

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.539 
you die in between them so it just takes
the<00:02:52.629> total<00:02:53.629> kills<00:02:54.099> consecutive<00:02:55.099> kills<00:02:55.340> you

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
the total kills consecutive kills you

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.220 
the total kills consecutive kills you
have<00:02:55.670> in<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.879> match<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.389> apply<00:02:56.780> some<00:02:57.019> towards

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
have in the match and apply some towards

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.190 
have in the match and apply some towards
a<00:02:57.260> kill<00:02:57.439> streak<00:02:57.530> so<00:02:58.370> for<00:02:58.639> instance<00:02:59.169> you<00:03:00.169> know

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
a kill streak so for instance you know

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.500 
a kill streak so for instance you know
if<00:03:00.349> you<00:03:00.409> have<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.560> four<00:03:00.889> and<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.400> set<00:03:01.700> for<00:03:02.150> kill

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
if you have a four and a set for kill

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.720 
if you have a four and a set for kill
streak<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.049> then<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.530> die<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:04.159> you<00:03:04.579> get<00:03:04.700> a

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
streak and then you die and you get a

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.460 
streak and then you die and you get a
three<00:03:05.000> kill<00:03:05.180> streak<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.989> counts<00:03:06.319> is<00:03:06.439> what

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
three kill streak that counts is what

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.399 
three kill streak that counts is what
would<00:03:06.889> be<00:03:07.010> like<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:07.250> seven<00:03:07.639> kill<00:03:07.790> streak<00:03:08.030> so<00:03:08.629> it

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
would be like a seven kill streak so it

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.409 
would be like a seven kill streak so it
makes<00:03:09.829> a<00:03:09.950> lot<00:03:10.099> easier<00:03:10.159> to<00:03:10.459> chain<00:03:11.000> these<00:03:11.209> things

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:11.419 
makes a lot easier to chain these things

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.470 
makes a lot easier to chain these things
up<00:03:11.659> and<00:03:11.959> in<00:03:12.379> a<00:03:12.560> way<00:03:12.769> if<00:03:13.159> you<00:03:13.669> get<00:03:13.909> a<00:03:13.939> couple<00:03:14.359> of

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
up and in a way if you get a couple of

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.209 
up and in a way if you get a couple of
you<00:03:14.599> know<00:03:14.719> for<00:03:15.200> killstreaks<00:03:15.799> you're<00:03:16.010> going<00:03:16.159> to

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:16.219 
you know for killstreaks you're going to

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.000 
you know for killstreaks you're going to
end<00:03:16.310> up<00:03:16.459> you<00:03:17.269> know<00:03:17.299> getting<00:03:17.599> a<00:03:17.810> blackbird<00:03:18.709> and

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
end up you know getting a blackbird and

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.349 
end up you know getting a blackbird and
really<00:03:19.459> helping<00:03:19.669> your<00:03:19.819> team<00:03:19.939> out<00:03:20.120> which<00:03:20.239> is
