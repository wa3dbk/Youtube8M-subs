00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.760
 one of the main trends 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.100
 alas more often 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.100
 this is the most important thing 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:13.609
 ed 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:14.850
 lead advantage 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.199
 priority of their work 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.869
 as I usually say 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.439
 Firstly 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:21.759
 we are all accustomed to tom 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.919
 tons of steel yes always a communication tool 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.509
 on the disk can be displayed 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.819
 let yourself notice that this is far from true 

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:34.280
 let's say actually splash the excess already 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.520
 not used 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.360
 not more than fifty percent 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.280
 of the total amount of work which is 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.790
 dental office 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.769
 can be done let's say 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:44.459
 or with a stone face to his service 

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:46.809
 position but far from the most important and 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.360
 the most important mode that we have 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.210
 net profit 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.050
 what can you do with a scanner 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.290
 rivals 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.070
 just a few words about exactly 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.770
 thanks to my joy 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.920
 manufacturers can fly 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.780
 process but why is it so wonderful 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.260
 workhorse 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.750
 and why I personally love this very much 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.610
 sport 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.260
 so several reasons for this 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.009
 forest under the most important post 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.369
 the former regime of stalin and the so-called 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.090
 mode 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.620
 China 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.080
 what is this mode another change instead 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.150
 difference 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.040
 it's all really very big 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.330
 extremely simple 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.170
 this mode of various 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.350
 accessories 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.550
 simply put 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.650
 while Stalin's regime is that mode 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.770
 the same large group of very large 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.329
 displacement cover 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.170
 passengers 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.670
 from point a to point b more simply if you 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.780
 decided status 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.620
 move from point a to point b 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.390
 no near approximation 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.540
 at the insistence 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.540
 Stalin g mode 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.430
 and mix 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.460
 here is a plant 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.979
 Often, often as to 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.290
 to show 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.560
 it's just easier and better 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.560
 will hear 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.310
 hear with rub 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.280
 Well ns A. Kostin for Stalin of the word 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.010
 after landing 4 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.960
 to the standards will be the wind she is 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.960
 ems standards 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.669
 we feel and try the most 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:14.189
 the main thing to hear 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:15.079
 fundamental difference 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.590
 the difference between moskalenko 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.830
 when the regime and then everything will be like 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.609
 Who 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.529
 what will we do of this will 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:23.999
 advantage to be executed exactly 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:25.849
 that's when the mode 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.439
 moments 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.569
 for any installation key as we always 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.540
 use the dynamo metric key 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.179
 calibrated metric wrench 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.519
 with which we are always guaranteed 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.279
 clamped landing as we need 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:40.440
 as needed 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.420
 never overtighten never 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.800
 We do not create pressball and as if he suddenly 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.179
 will be happily ever after 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:48.809
 living in greek key 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:50.519
 now exclude 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.609
 when we overtighten included three 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.090
 missed with this suggests that 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.199
 Mossad Kazakhstan good 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.989
 he works in Moscow very well 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.620
 im just for comparison 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.739
 what is the difference between stalin grind mode 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:03.829
 regime 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.759
 Stalin's regime 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:07.269
 power 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.029
 Pyaterochka time two three four five stars 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:11.859
 the white house colors it is in the power created 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.980
 itar tass class that came 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.589
 moves from point like 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:17.639
 always move to point b 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.749
 And here in this mode, the standard itself 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:22.969
 the usual simplest primitive thousand 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.169
 however in the starting lineup 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.980
 and just listen to this judgment 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.980
 in stalin mode 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.099
 very large 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.499
 very powerful 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:40.329
 all the same switch as 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.019
 war making 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.609
 and do not increase power 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.009
 house of culture 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:47.739
 now exactly the same 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:48.939
 because the rest 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:50.089
 the same 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:51.959
 semenko conditions 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.959
 but we already have 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.639
 this indicates 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.939
 yes that there will be moving the key to 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.939
 much 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.279
 so we will focus on this 

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:12.989
 and how to prepare for all the polls 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.299
 installation canceled 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.109
 it's hard to say some more now 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.539
 to put there is still so special 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.630
 which is very important than you need to work 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.670
 directly in the office on the first 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:27.630
 the queue is actually 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.650
 autonomous system 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.850
 irrigation fluid 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.300
 liquids and water 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.229
 in rocky completely autonomous 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.229
 included trailer 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.919
 and cis however very small very 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.409
 wonderful trick 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.539
 for good 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.539
 barys as allows us to work 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:51.569
 use it should be easy here 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:52.919
 rf robbery 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.499
 but the process 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:56.800
 in Mexico 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.090
 here you are from this stream enough 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.819
 there will be more than enough 100 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:02.270
 milliliters but percentage solution 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.740
 pore hexogen bibigon 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.569
 However, as noted in Warsaw point 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.520
 we choose researched 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.279
 bottle calculated popovkina 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:15.059
 200 directors film catch lynch 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:17.020
 fact check we get 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.360
 uneasy delegation solution is not easy 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.849
 the solution with which we will 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.020
 in the mode let's say as it will allow 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.180
 Yes, I certainly could not 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.400
 but also to conduct 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.809
 powerful enough seismic work 

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:32.309
 so always 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:35.079
 have become afraid we use buy 

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:37.279
 imagine if we use normal 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:39.019
 Tuesday Sydenko information he 0 5 

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:40.669
 percent that drink 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.930
 the team is able to use for water 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.300
 than enough 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.300
 antiseptic completely extinguished 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.300
 as we see that the moment about which we should 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.719
 do not forget a day 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:58.719
 any Hurwitz 1 belongs to the class 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.800
 more simply this is the drug 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.449
 extremely negative impact on the processes 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.809
 polymerization of any photo polymer 

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:09.359
 composite material any effective 

00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:11.159
 systems 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:12.830
 then the golden rule 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.749
 and which must always be remembered 

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.270
 simultaneously 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.110
 first carry out remove excess 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.919
 position 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:22.120
 cooling the phone by cooling 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.650
 relief solution 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.289
 our questions about the work of the system 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:27.900
 idea to carry out right away 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.719
 sealing 

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:30.900
 soup 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.009
 we can not we get a problem 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:34.770
 respectively 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.690
 we can do the preparation first 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:37.860
 perform restoration 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.639
 technicians the flow of this stage 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.800
 Do I need to sign a new agreement on 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.789
 manipulation definition 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:45.219
 Yes 

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:47.009
 but in any case was not sold order 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:48.260
 there is no spare 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.640
 and then
