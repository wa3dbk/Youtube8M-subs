00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
sure he's good to go

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.610 
sure he's good to go
and<00:02:13.340> before<00:02:14.340> we<00:02:14.580> release<00:02:15.000> him<00:02:15.110> we<00:02:16.110> build<00:02:16.530> a

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
and before we release him we build a

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.369 
and before we release him we build a
nest<00:02:16.800> box<00:02:17.099> for<00:02:17.519> him<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.420> gets<00:02:18.900> hung<00:02:19.110> on

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
nest box for him and that gets hung on

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.350 
nest box for him and that gets hung on
the<00:02:19.560> property<00:02:20.010> where<00:02:20.129> he<00:02:20.250> was<00:02:20.370> found<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:21.060> he

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
the property where he was found so he

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.330 
the property where he was found so he
not<00:02:21.480> only<00:02:21.540> leaves<00:02:22.230> with<00:02:22.379> his<00:02:22.530> health<00:02:22.769> Huey's

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
not only leaves with his health Huey's

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.100 
not only leaves with his health Huey's
with<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.610> new<00:02:23.760> house<00:02:23.940> that's<00:02:24.750> kind<00:02:24.959> of<00:02:25.019> nice

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
with a new house that's kind of nice

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.390 
with a new house that's kind of nice
because<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.410> think<00:02:25.590> one<00:02:25.800> thing<00:02:25.830> people<00:02:26.340> would

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
because I think one thing people would

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.070 
because I think one thing people would
say<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:26.670> like<00:02:26.819> you<00:02:27.750> know<00:02:27.780> if<00:02:27.959> you're

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
say is like you know if you're

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.540 
say is like you know if you're
interfering<00:02:28.500> with<00:02:28.680> an<00:02:28.860> animal's<00:02:29.190> life<00:02:29.250> does

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
interfering with an animal's life does

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.160 
interfering with an animal's life does
that<00:02:29.580> cause<00:02:29.910> more<00:02:30.209> harm<00:02:30.360> than<00:02:30.599> good<00:02:30.660> if<00:02:31.019> it's

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
that cause more harm than good if it's

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.380 
that cause more harm than good if it's
just<00:02:31.349> a<00:02:31.410> little<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.739> trouble<00:02:32.250> right<00:02:33.090> that's

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
just a little I trouble right that's

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.120 
just a little I trouble right that's
that's<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.870> really<00:02:34.230> excellent<00:02:34.769> question<00:02:35.430> and

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
that's a really excellent question and

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.350 
that's a really excellent question and
basically<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.340> way<00:02:38.430> we<00:02:38.550> think<00:02:38.730> about<00:02:38.880> that<00:02:39.150> is

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
basically the way we think about that is

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.850 
basically the way we think about that is
whether<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.870> problem<00:02:40.049> will<00:02:40.380> cause<00:02:40.560> the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
whether the problem will cause the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.800 
whether the problem will cause the
mortal<00:02:41.310> danger<00:02:41.640> can<00:02:41.940> they<00:02:42.090> die<00:02:42.269> from<00:02:42.660> not

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
mortal danger can they die from not

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.660 
mortal danger can they die from not
being<00:02:42.870> able<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.410> hunt<00:02:43.769> properly<00:02:44.250> because<00:02:44.430> they

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
being able to hunt properly because they

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.120 
being able to hunt properly because they
can't<00:02:44.879> see<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.599> answer<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:45.989> yes<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:46.950> that's

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
can't see the answer is yes so that's

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.880 
can't see the answer is yes so that's
why<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:47.340> worth<00:02:47.670> treating<00:02:48.120> those<00:02:49.080> raw<00:02:49.470> most

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
why it's worth treating those raw most

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.339 
why it's worth treating those raw most
points<00:02:50.250> look<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.700> tasty<00:02:51.030> though<00:02:51.660> he<00:02:51.840> has<00:02:52.049> to<00:02:52.230> be

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
points look so tasty though he has to be

00:02:52.349 --> 00:03:04.130 
points look so tasty though he has to be
next<00:02:52.769> in<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:52.980> chow<00:02:53.220> line<00:03:02.840> does<00:03:03.840> your<00:03:03.989> heart

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
next in the chow line does your heart

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.009 
next in the chow line does your heart
get<00:03:04.290> broken<00:03:04.349> in<00:03:04.799> this<00:03:04.920> kind<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.190> work<00:03:05.660> it<00:03:06.660> does

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
get broken in this kind of work it does

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.920 
get broken in this kind of work it does
on<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.069> good<00:03:08.370> days<00:03:08.400> there<00:03:09.180> are<00:03:09.209> more<00:03:09.630> happy
