00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
fast in the the fastest car in the cars

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.590 
fast in the the fastest car in the cars
in<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> game<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.579> not<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.879> fastest<00:01:03.329> car

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
in the game this is not the fastest car

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.690 
in the game this is not the fastest car
in<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.930> game<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.530> one<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.159> fastest

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
in the game but is one of the fastest

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.880 
in the game but is one of the fastest
when<00:01:06.330> you're<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:06.810> fast<00:01:07.020> sometimes<00:01:07.320> it's

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
when you're going so fast sometimes it's

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.260 
when you're going so fast sometimes it's
more<00:01:07.950> difficult<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:09.650> succeed<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.979> win<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
more difficult to succeed to win in the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.210 
more difficult to succeed to win in the
fastest<00:01:12.810> cars<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.140> game<00:01:13.380> now<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.010> would

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
fastest cars in the game now you would

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.310 
fastest cars in the game now you would
think<00:01:14.250> well<00:01:14.729> they're<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> best<00:01:15.360> why<00:01:15.720> why<00:01:16.259> is

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
think well they're the best why why is

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.590 
think well they're the best why why is
that<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.619> case<00:01:16.740> well<00:01:17.280> wow<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.030> almost<00:01:18.210> hit<00:01:18.540> that

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
that the case well wow I almost hit that

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.580 
that the case well wow I almost hit that
again<00:01:19.159> um<00:01:20.330> it's<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.080> hard<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.409> control

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
again um it's just so hard to control

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.280 
again um it's just so hard to control
like<00:01:23.220> you're<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.270> fast<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.900> some<00:01:25.200> of

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
like you're going so fast and some of

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.780 
like you're going so fast and some of
the<00:01:25.350> corners<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.920> don't<00:01:26.100> expect<00:01:26.430> or<00:01:26.610> maybe

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the corners you don't expect or maybe

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.300 
the corners you don't expect or maybe
you<00:01:26.939> forgot<00:01:27.090> about<00:01:27.479> them<00:01:27.829> especially<00:01:28.829> if<00:01:29.159> it's

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
you forgot about them especially if it's

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.760 
you forgot about them especially if it's
not<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> circuit<00:01:30.119> race<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.840> just<00:01:31.020> come

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
not a circuit race and you just come

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.730 
not a circuit race and you just come
across<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.369> sudden<00:01:33.090> corner<00:01:33.930> or<00:01:34.110> turn<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.590> you

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
across a sudden corner or turn that you

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.530 
across a sudden corner or turn that you
weren't<00:01:34.950> expecting<00:01:35.130> maybe<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.939> race<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.479> you

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
weren't expecting maybe a race that you

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.039 
weren't expecting maybe a race that you
just<00:01:36.930> are<00:01:37.860> doing<00:01:38.340> for<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.579> first<00:01:38.790> time<00:01:39.049> it's

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.069 
don't expect stuff you know yeah
basically<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:58.369> speed<00:01:59.369> can<00:01:59.670> be<00:01:59.700> detrimental<00:02:00.079> I

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
basically so speed can be detrimental I

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.810 
basically so speed can be detrimental I
guess<00:02:01.560> it's<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.920> more<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.310> what<00:02:02.460> I'm<00:02:02.549> trying

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
guess it's the more of what I'm trying

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.010 
guess it's the more of what I'm trying
to<00:02:02.880> say<00:02:03.290> also<00:02:04.939> tire<00:02:05.939> track<00:02:06.360> things<00:02:06.719> right

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
to say also tire track things right

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.410 
to say also tire track things right
there<00:02:07.290> are<00:02:07.530> detrimental<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:08.489> don't<00:02:09.119> think<00:02:09.330> I

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
there are detrimental I don't think I

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.510 
there are detrimental I don't think I
hit<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.629> single<00:02:09.929> one<00:02:10.229> because<00:02:10.619> when<00:02:10.860> i<00:02:11.220> first

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
hit a single one because when i first

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.190 
hit a single one because when i first
played<00:02:11.700> through<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.030> game<00:02:12.270> I

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
played through this game I

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.229 
played through this game I
just<00:02:13.440> could<00:02:13.590> not<00:02:13.739> stand<00:02:14.129> them<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.670> pretty

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
just could not stand them so I pretty

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.300 
just could not stand them so I pretty
much<00:02:15.390> made<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.770> my<00:02:17.400> goal<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:19.530> know<00:02:19.620> gave

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
much made it my goal and you know gave

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.300 
much made it my goal and you know gave
it<00:02:20.459> my<00:02:20.580> best<00:02:20.610> effort<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.480> avoid<00:02:21.980> tire<00:02:22.980> track

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
it my best effort to avoid tire track

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.430 
it my best effort to avoid tire track
our<00:02:23.580> tire<00:02:24.200> spikes<00:02:25.200> at<00:02:25.590> all<00:02:25.980> costs<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:27.480> didn't

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
our tire spikes at all costs I didn't

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.680 
our tire spikes at all costs I didn't
get<00:02:28.530> lucky<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:28.980> time<00:02:29.190> I<00:02:29.580> knew<00:02:30.060> there<00:02:30.360> was<00:02:30.480> one

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
get lucky that time I knew there was one

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.940 
get lucky that time I knew there was one
of<00:02:30.810> these<00:02:30.930> times<00:02:31.140> where<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:31.530> was<00:02:31.650> going<00:02:31.860> around

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
of these times where I was going around

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.949 
of these times where I was going around
that<00:02:32.099> corner<00:02:32.450> that's<00:02:33.450> just<00:02:33.540> one<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.840> those

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
that corner that's just one of those

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.710 
that corner that's just one of those
corners<00:02:34.440> man<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:35.970> easy<00:02:36.269> to<00:02:36.420> crash

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
corners man that is so easy to crash

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.990 
corners man that is so easy to crash
because<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:37.170> don't<00:02:37.410> expect<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.459> be<00:02:38.970> a

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.270 
because you don't expect it to be a
little<00:02:39.239> bit<00:02:39.450> wider<00:02:39.780> but<00:02:40.140> it's<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.739> tight<00:02:41.010> turn
