backwards because I don't like that on
the<00:01:17.729> front<00:01:18.350> so<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.409> put<00:01:19.890> them<00:01:20.040> together<00:01:20.250> put

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
the front so you put them together put

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.780 
the front so you put them together put
that<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.439> angry<00:01:23.130> or<00:01:23.670> smiling<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:25.610> then<00:01:26.610> you

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
that on angry or smiling and then you

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.340 
that on angry or smiling and then you
put<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.900> hair<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.290> covering<00:01:28.740> up<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.009> back<00:01:29.220> and

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
put the hair on covering up the back and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.289 
put the hair on covering up the back and
then<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> reason<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.979> didn't<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:33.060> you

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
then the reason you didn't that you

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.999 
then the reason you didn't that you
could<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.659> have<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:33.960> any<00:01:34.259> colors<00:01:34.590> because

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
could just have it any colors because

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.899 
could just have it any colors because
you<00:01:35.130> put<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.000> inside<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.420> base<00:01:36.570> book<00:01:36.810> app<00:01:37.020> and

you put it inside the base book app and

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:45.830 
you put it inside the base book app and
then<00:01:39.500> just<00:01:40.500> put<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.400> her<00:01:42.500> hand<00:01:44.540> there<00:01:45.540> isn't

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
then just put it in her hand there isn't

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.800 
then just put it in her hand there isn't
I<00:01:45.930> didn't<00:01:46.200> put<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.220> her<00:01:47.490> head<00:01:47.780> because<00:01:48.780> he

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
I didn't put it on her head because he

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.639 
I didn't put it on her head because he
can't<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.259> hair<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:51.049> baseball<00:01:52.049> cap<00:01:53.990> there<00:01:54.990> so
