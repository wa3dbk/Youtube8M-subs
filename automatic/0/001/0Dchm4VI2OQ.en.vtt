00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
interesting because we as we know

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.090 
interesting because we as we know
cointreau<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> very<00:00:21.960> very<00:00:22.140> big<00:00:22.410> ling<00:00:22.769> player

he was trying to take them out before

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.899 
he was trying to take them out before
they<00:01:49.890> were<00:01:50.040> right<00:01:50.280> next<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.520> those<00:01:50.640> turrets

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
they were right next to those turrets

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.940 
they were right next to those turrets
but<00:01:51.119> now<00:01:51.240> he's<00:01:52.079> there<00:01:52.320> can't<00:01:52.560> among<00:01:52.799> those

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
but now he's there can't among those

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.660 
but now he's there can't among those
turrets<00:01:53.250> um<00:01:53.490> those<00:01:54.450> raids<00:01:54.930> are<00:01:55.110> protected<00:01:55.530> now

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670

light this just does not have the econ
to<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:59.189> build<00:01:59.430> much<00:01:59.640> right<00:01:59.850> now<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.000> was<00:02:00.149> gonna

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
to to build much right now I was gonna

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.520 
to to build much right now I was gonna
say<00:02:00.509> like<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.840> wonder<00:02:01.049> why<00:02:01.170> light<00:02:01.350> isn't

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
say like I wonder why light isn't

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.959 
say like I wonder why light isn't
building<00:02:01.740> up<00:02:01.920> any<00:02:02.040> other<00:02:02.100> forces<00:02:02.520> but<00:02:02.790> those

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
building up any other forces but those

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.060 
building up any other forces but those
raids<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:04.200> because<00:02:04.500> he<00:02:04.530> really<00:02:04.829> doesn't

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
raids but it's because he really doesn't

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.130 
raids but it's because he really doesn't
have<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.250> economy<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.729> meanwhile<00:02:06.149> Quan<00:02:06.899> row

running 22 in take notes
and<00:02:13.549> finally<00:02:14.549> light<00:02:14.760> building<00:02:15.090> another

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
and finally light building another

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.209 
and finally light building another
barracks<00:02:15.629> over<00:02:15.870> here<00:02:16.049> and<00:02:16.230> looks<00:02:16.920> like<00:02:17.069> more

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
barracks over here and looks like more

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:18.080 
barracks over here and looks like more
insurance<00:02:17.310> or<00:02:17.609> something<00:02:17.639> like<00:02:17.879> that<00:02:17.939> so

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
insurance or something like that so

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.789 
insurance or something like that so
light<00:02:18.359> basically<00:02:18.780> kind<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:19.019> having<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.379> bunker

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
light basically kind of having a bunker

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.300 
light basically kind of having a bunker
in<00:02:19.950> right<00:02:20.249> now<00:02:20.930> amazingly<00:02:21.930> yeah<00:02:22.799> just

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
in right now amazingly yeah just

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.929 
in right now amazingly yeah just
bunkering<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:23.879> building<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.510> bunch<00:02:24.719> of<00:02:24.840> turrets

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
bunkering in building a bunch of turrets

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.489 
bunkering in building a bunch of turrets
and<00:02:26.939> maybe<00:02:27.180> he<00:02:27.329> might<00:02:27.749> be<00:02:27.900> planning<00:02:28.200> on

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:28.499 
and maybe he might be planning on

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.679 
and maybe he might be planning on
switching<00:02:28.709> back<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.030> medic<00:02:30.030> means<00:02:30.239> by<00:02:30.420> getting

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
switching back to medic means by getting

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:31.940 
switching back to medic means by getting
that<00:02:30.810> other<00:02:30.930> barracks<00:02:31.260> but<00:02:31.439> it's<00:02:31.560> possible

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
that other barracks but it's possible

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.699 
that other barracks but it's possible
also<00:02:32.129> think<00:02:32.430> he's<00:02:32.549> just<00:02:32.670> getting<00:02:33.709> the

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
also think he's just getting the

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.050 
also think he's just getting the
barracks<00:02:35.069> so<00:02:35.189> he<00:02:35.280> can<00:02:35.370> get<00:02:35.430> another<00:02:35.639> factory

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
barracks so he can get another factory

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.780 
barracks so he can get another factory
to<00:02:36.180> go<00:02:36.269> for<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.569> Goliath<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.709> they<00:02:38.489> do<00:02:38.549> have

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
to go for a Goliath and they do have

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.970 
to go for a Goliath and they do have
cloaking<00:02:39.180> technology<00:02:39.359> now<00:02:39.840> that's<00:02:40.739> another

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
cloaking technology now that's another

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.220 
cloaking technology now that's another
reason<00:02:41.159> why<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.659> corner<00:02:42.659> had<00:02:42.840> those<00:02:42.989> speed

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
reason why a corner had those speed

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.659 
reason why a corner had those speed
upgrade<00:02:43.499> overlords<00:02:43.859> the<00:02:43.950> overlords<00:02:44.370> come<00:02:44.549> in

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:44.669 
upgrade overlords the overlords come in

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:46.369 
upgrade overlords the overlords come in
they're<00:02:44.909> able<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.209> chase<00:02:45.389> down<00:02:45.419> those<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.079> he

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
they're able to chase down those and he

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.589 
they're able to chase down those and he
has<00:02:46.530> 30<00:02:46.829> boards<00:02:47.189> so<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:47.819> light<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:48.150> not<00:02:48.180> just<00:02:48.510> to

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
has 30 boards so so light is not just to

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.030 
has 30 boards so so light is not just to
be<00:02:48.629> able<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.900> go<00:02:49.049> in<00:02:49.169> and<00:02:49.439> kill<00:02:49.590> off<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.919> win

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
be able to go in and kill off the win

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.559 
be able to go in and kill off the win
over<00:02:50.159> Lord<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.549> then<00:02:50.669> start<00:02:51.180> picking<00:02:51.419> away<00:02:51.510> at

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
over Lord and then start picking away at

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.860 
over Lord and then start picking away at
the<00:02:51.689> moonless<00:02:52.459> basically<00:02:53.459> quadro<00:02:54.239> chasing

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
the moonless basically quadro chasing

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.159 
the moonless basically quadro chasing
down<00:02:55.280> lights<00:02:56.280> forces<00:02:56.819> here<00:02:57.000> light<00:02:57.510> smartly

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
down lights forces here light smartly

00:02:58.169 --> 00:02:59.659 
down lights forces here light smartly
splitting<00:02:58.709> up<00:02:58.799> his<00:02:58.949> forces<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.430> looks<00:02:59.579> like

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
splitting up his forces it looks like

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:01.099 
splitting up his forces it looks like
it's<00:02:59.819> going<00:02:59.909> to<00:02:59.969> lose<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.180> bunch<00:03:00.540> or<00:03:00.780> some<00:03:01.079> of

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
it's going to lose that bunch or some of

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.860 
it's going to lose that bunch or some of
it<00:03:01.260> they're<00:03:01.590> very<00:03:01.739> damaged<00:03:02.189> now<00:03:02.510> so<00:03:03.510> chasing

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
it they're very damaged now so chasing

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.420 
it they're very damaged now so chasing

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.099 
these written note light running
estranged<00:03:27.299> out<00:03:27.419> so<00:03:27.569> he's<00:03:27.720> going<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:27.959> keep

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.229 
estranged out so he's going to keep
those<00:03:28.290> rays<00:03:28.639> basically<00:03:29.639> it<00:03:29.729> depends<00:03:30.120> now

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
those rays basically it depends now

these these raids are basically

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.999 
these these raids are basically
neutralized<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:33.509> it<00:03:33.659> it<00:03:33.989> depends<00:03:34.349> now<00:03:34.560> on<00:03:34.769> what

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
raves and quadro just absolutely just

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.180 
raves and quadro just absolutely just
brute-forcing<00:04:43.110> taking<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.889> hits<00:04:44.040> from

couple turrets just to take down that
barracks<00:04:46.770> and<00:04:46.919> this<00:04:47.400> is<00:04:47.580> this<00:04:47.820> is<00:04:48.000> what<00:04:48.150> Connor

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
barracks and this is this is what Connor

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.090 
barracks and this is this is what Connor
does<00:04:48.630> best<00:04:48.870> is<00:04:49.050> just<00:04:49.229> absolute<00:04:49.710> proof<00:04:49.830> force

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
does best is just absolute proof force

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.230 
does best is just absolute proof force
here<00:04:50.250> there's<00:04:50.430> a<00:04:50.490> lot<00:04:50.699> of<00:04:50.729> turrets<00:04:51.150> here

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
here there's a lot of turrets here

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.189 
here there's a lot of turrets here
though<00:04:51.419> so<00:04:51.570> it's<00:04:51.690> going<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:51.900> be<00:04:52.020> interesting

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
though so it's going to be interesting

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.360 
though so it's going to be interesting
to<00:04:52.410> see<00:04:52.590> if<00:04:52.680> he's<00:04:52.740> able<00:04:52.919> to<00:04:53.040> take<00:04:53.190> that<00:04:53.220> out

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
to see if he's able to take that out

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.129 
to see if he's able to take that out
pronto<00:04:53.910> realizes<00:04:54.419> there's<00:04:54.630> too<00:04:54.780> many<00:04:54.870> turrets

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
pronto realizes there's too many turrets

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.150 
pronto realizes there's too many turrets
there<00:04:55.410> and<00:04:55.500> he's<00:04:55.620> going<00:04:55.710> to<00:04:55.770> fall<00:04:55.979> back<00:04:56.130> a

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
there and he's going to fall back a

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.250 
there and he's going to fall back a
little<00:04:56.400> bit<00:04:56.520> there<00:04:56.729> with<00:04:57.389> his<00:04:57.510> forces<00:04:57.870> flip<00:04:58.139> if

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
little bit there with his forces flip if

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.450 
little bit there with his forces flip if
he'd<00:04:58.380> been<00:04:58.500> able<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:58.770> attack<00:04:58.979> with<00:04:59.070> all<00:04:59.280> of<00:04:59.400> his

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
he'd been able to attack with all of his

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.650 
he'd been able to attack with all of his
forces<00:04:59.850> I<00:04:59.940> think<00:05:00.150> he<00:05:00.240> might<00:05:00.389> have<00:05:00.419> been<00:05:00.539> able

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
forces I think he might have been able

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.900 
forces I think he might have been able
to<00:05:00.780> do<00:05:00.840> something<00:05:01.050> there<00:05:01.289> but<00:05:01.770> light<00:05:02.190> smartly
