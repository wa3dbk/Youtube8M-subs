00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.430
 It's summer Berlin 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.230
 Brazil is here 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.350
 In Germany is there and you will yes 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.510
 we are still allowed to sniff 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.750
 the football World Cup 2006 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.000
 Welcome to the eight-star game 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.110
 the fivefold world champion against the 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.830
 triple world champion 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:37.000
 At least what's more, the stars do not work 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.000
 on the jersey 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.420
 himself drilled because he was previously for 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.420
 the miscarriage was also responsible 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.680
 what will oliver kahn think what is coming 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.270
 towards him 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.350
 but remember roberto carlos 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.930
 thigh circumference 58.5 cm who can 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.770
 I confess to such a degree of obstruction 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.070
 Do not want to be in the wall right now 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.070
 arise 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.220
 the topic of chemistry 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.110
 he can travel up to 170 kilometers per hour 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.180
 accelerate once 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.620
 shoots from 16 meters for 15 meters 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.620
 start when he shoots 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.649
 or is that ronaldinho who will 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.230
 then with two steps and compassion 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.930
 do 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.930
 and that 's how it works 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.130
 please do not make me 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.430
 responsible because I said before 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.430
 have 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.880
 man man man are the good it is the 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.880
 first goal shot of the brazilians 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.119
 Have a look at the laughs broken 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.730
 oliver kahn no reaction 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.859
 not have to get along in life 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.269
 but honestly, they say no reaction 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:22.989
 he certainly has with roberto 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.989
 carlos shot counted 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.080
 I suspect most have that 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.000
 shot by roberto carlos 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.530
 names 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.530
 bernschneider again peace 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:50.090
 kuranyi and co and that's right 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.090
 move out in the 17 minute 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.760
 So we look very well, I find the 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.370
 looked for a real game 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.569
 Creative action that was 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.190
 but of course we must also see whether 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.280
 the pass from torsten frings deflected 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.280
 was 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.849
 fake shot of frings and then 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:20.849
 kuranyi be it drum 11 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.430
 very important 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.920
 that the Germans get up early 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.800
 report back in this lot 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.410
 and kevin kuranyi at six of the last 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.510
 eight country goals scored this is one 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.930
 remarkable quote 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.150
 you know, kuranyi lived 15 years in 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.970
 Brazil you need it then 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.580
 if you balance against brazil 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.620
 it is a life dream that he is against the 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.200
 selection of his original 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.200
 Homeland land has predicted 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.170
 First of all, the joy here is nothing 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.170
 jogi lion 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.870
 and attention of sebastian deisler 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.870
 ronaldo 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.780
 from k finally again additional 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.780
 rausgeholt 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.950
 sebastian call there 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.230
 Remember this is one 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.930
 friendly 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.930
 kukksi also came to the face 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.930
 friendship play 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.160
 but sebastian deisler knows but has 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.160
 gepennt 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:46.220
 to explain motors 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.110
 you can now get out sebastian 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.030
 oliver kahn first of all congratulations 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.890
 1 2 1 against brazil which impression 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.610
 you have the overall level of play 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:58.580
 and the commitment of the team 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.050
 say very well i think we have about 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.370
 a long stretch of very good football 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.270
 shown very high speed and gone 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.040
 superstition is the result then 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.170
 The Brazilians also do justice to the end effect 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.150
 had their incredibly fast 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.370
 always have good chances 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.170
 in between times she did not do it 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.160
 have and but I believe in the great 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.750
 that's all right 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.650
 what did you laugh at the free kick? 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.290
 they have speculated a bit 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.980
 that roberto carlos i 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.270
 because there is not at all 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.740
 speculate because I do not see anything at all 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.760
 I do not see any case at all 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.350
 ten men in front of me 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.370
 that means I can only my goalkeeper corner 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.200
 I can not do more 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.610
 because normally you have to get away from it 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.960
 go out that distance from the 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.130
 do not fall on the wall solid enough 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.200
 that roberto carlos 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.730
 that was already done extraordinary 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.750
 I think from the distance you can 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.030
 The ball again not over the wall 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.740
 which expressive power is there because of this 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.780
 result with a look maybe on the wm 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.030
 2006 where she might be here in the final 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.620
 want to stand in need berlin 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.360
 i believe that the result is us 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.460
 There is a lot of self-confidence because why 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.450
 we would have this game with a bit 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.480
 maybe you can win happiness too 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.430
 and we are here with the 3 too 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.350
 only in austria in today mainz 2 1 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.729
 against the reigning world champion believe 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.450
 I'm on a very good way 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:04.450
 Thank you very much
