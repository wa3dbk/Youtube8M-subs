in three Hudson him if I magic I have 94
banked<00:00:53.969> for<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.829> i'll<00:00:55.829> probably<00:00:56.190> get<00:00:56.399> less

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
banked for that i'll probably get less

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.010

than<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.940> mini<00:00:57.270> eventually<00:00:59.510> just<00:01:00.510> for<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
than a mini eventually just for the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.410 
than a mini eventually just for the
money<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.800> be<00:01:01.920> honest<00:01:02.160> with<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.489> no<00:01:03.239> other
