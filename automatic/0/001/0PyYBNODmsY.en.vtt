00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.750
 then he decided to ask for the shirt 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.869
 number 10 and will have the number 10 because a 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.970
 sense of responsibility because they dress 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.680
 this shirt is not above all that 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.550
 number is not absolutely simple 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.349
 since the plans have the chamber 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.860
 I'm out of my teeth or have done it 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.469
 it seems to me to play a match 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.840
 playmaker but I believe his 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:45.210
 role both the left middle midfielder a 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.050
 right middle and maybe future that was 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.050
 to play in front of the defense 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.460
 today vandals work with the team 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.739
 so we will have an injured or not for 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.469
 as for the module , I will decide it 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.969
 however, the important thing is but it changes little 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.549
 try to face the game 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.049
 dictating the good game will do a lot 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.690
 hot 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.990
 we must think that we can arrive from 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.830
 120 euros with the success on May 20th 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.299
 we have only twenty days of 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.649
 preparation however the team believe that 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.649
 be a good condition 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:29.149
 honestly I have not thought and not 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.890
 I have this kind of daisy wish because 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.509
 last year both when he had played at 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.869
 four both when we played three 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:42.119
 I think we have always provided 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:44.280
 of good good performances and the common 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.840
 denominator was that almost always 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.929
 we won so i believe that that not 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.470
 it is not the module that determines or that 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:58.500
 will determine let's say victory or not 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.399
 of the day after tomorrow but they will be many others 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.399
 factors 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.770
 when first when you play one 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.390
 final a game dries the values â€‹â€‹yes 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.990
 very thin there will be a lot 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.840
 equilibrium 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.720
 have been tenant in the match of 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.690
 May 20 in Rome accordingly 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.980
 balance also on Saturday 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.980
 but this I believe is normal 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.350
 we changed, say at least half 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.310
 of the backbone of the 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.310
 last year's team 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:43.430
 renewing and rejuvenating I believe that 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:47.730
 in a vintage like this there are so many 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.450
 many stimuli for not having 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.450
 regrets at the end
