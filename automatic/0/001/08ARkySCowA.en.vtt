 it happened in the 1885 season 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.940
 now the party that currently 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.160
 has the record of the biggest win 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.500

 it was an incredible score of 149 to 0 the 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.120
 difference with the previous record is that 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.160
 in this case the result is due to a 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.290
 protest by the players of the 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.060
 narrative against the referee in the 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.010

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.200
 a huge amount of goals in own 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.450
 door still do not know what was the 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.330
 decision of the referee that caused such a thing 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.970
 this match by the way was given on 31 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.130
 October 2002 in the cup final

 it was from a distance of almost 92 meters 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.640
 contrary to what many people think 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.040
 Brazilian pelé is not the most goals 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.080
 annotated has that position in history 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.860
 it has the Czech Josef Bican who in

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.770
 1,468 goals counting friendly matches 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.230
 and officers surpassing the 1,284 pele 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.610
 however, because its apogee is 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.760
 gave in the time of the second war 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.200
 World many of his goals were not

 registered nor are they considered to be 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.850
 today as officers so the record 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.910
 officially remains in the hands of pele 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.990

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.880

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.840
