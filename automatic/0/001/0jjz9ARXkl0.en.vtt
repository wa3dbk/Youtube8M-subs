simple syrup simple syrup is very simple
to<00:01:26.100> make<00:01:26.310> all<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.940> is<00:01:27.149> it's<00:01:27.660> a<00:01:27.840> one-to-one

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
to make all it is it's a one-to-one

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.490 
to make all it is it's a one-to-one
ratio<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:29.970> how<00:01:30.090> much<00:01:30.420> sugar<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.899> use<00:01:31.289> you

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
ratio so for how much sugar you use you

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.419 
ratio so for how much sugar you use you
use<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.710> much<00:01:32.130> water<00:01:32.429> so<00:01:33.080> um<00:01:34.080> most<00:01:35.039> people

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429
