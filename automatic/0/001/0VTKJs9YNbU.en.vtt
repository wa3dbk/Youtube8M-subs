from a response where someone actually

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.240

and<00:03:13.640> we<00:03:13.760> had<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:13.910> discussion<00:03:14.090> about<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:14.870> and

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
and we had a discussion about that and

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.050 
and we had a discussion about that and
nothing<00:03:15.440> bad<00:03:15.890> i<00:03:15.920> mean<00:03:16.280> we're<00:03:16.519> friends<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:16.940> all

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
nothing bad i mean we're friends and all

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.569 
nothing bad i mean we're friends and all
but<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.360> was<00:03:17.450> just<00:03:17.510> an<00:03:17.780> interesting<00:03:18.579> dialogue

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
but it was just an interesting dialogue

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:20.979 
but it was just an interesting dialogue
and<00:03:20.000> then<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.299> went<00:03:20.390> from<00:03:20.540> there<00:03:20.630> and<00:03:20.780> i

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
and then it went from there and i

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.539 
and then it went from there and i
created<00:03:21.350> some<00:03:21.470> new<00:03:21.590> art<00:03:21.799> from<00:03:21.950> it<00:03:22.130> so<00:03:22.280> i<00:03:22.310> guess

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
created some new art from it so i guess

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.300 
created some new art from it so i guess
it's<00:03:22.760> it's<00:03:23.150> somewhat<00:03:23.600> self<00:03:23.959> selfish<00:03:24.560> to

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
it's it's somewhat self selfish to

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.920 
it's it's somewhat self selfish to
create<00:03:26.060> new<00:03:26.239> work<00:03:26.480> from<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:26.959> but<00:03:27.500> i<00:03:27.890> think<00:03:28.930> the

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
create new work from it but i think the

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.020 
create new work from it but i think the
main<00:03:30.110> part<00:03:30.380> about<00:03:30.530> art<00:03:30.769> for<00:03:30.980> me<00:03:31.070> is<00:03:31.280> talking

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
main part about art for me is talking

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.819 
main part about art for me is talking
about<00:03:32.120> it<00:03:32.480> it's<00:03:32.870> not<00:03:33.019> necessarily<00:03:33.380> just<00:03:33.500> doing

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
about it it's not necessarily just doing

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.500 
about it it's not necessarily just doing
it<00:03:33.950> because<00:03:33.980> i'm<00:03:34.310> not<00:03:34.459> a<00:03:34.489> hobby<00:03:34.760> artist<00:03:35.299> you

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
it because i'm not a hobby artist you

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
it because i'm not a hobby artist you
know<00:03:35.600> i'm<00:03:35.750> not<00:03:35.900> going<00:03:36.019> to<00:03:36.049> paint<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.380> pretty

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
know i'm not going to paint a pretty

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.050

that's how i'm trying to put myself into

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.550 
that's how i'm trying to put myself into
the<00:03:44.090> art<00:03:44.269> rather<00:03:44.600> than<00:03:44.750> painting<00:03:45.260> someone

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
the art rather than painting someone

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.500 
the art rather than painting someone
else<00:03:45.739> nude<00:03:46.070> because<00:03:46.790> i<00:03:46.940> don't<00:03:47.150> necessarily

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
else nude because i don't necessarily

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
else nude because i don't necessarily
have<00:03:47.630> a<00:03:47.690> connection<00:03:48.079> with<00:03:48.380> that<00:03:48.410> person<00:03:48.640> so

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
have a connection with that person so

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.590 
have a connection with that person so
that's<00:03:51.530> why<00:03:51.709> i<00:03:51.950> paint<00:03:52.250> myself<00:03:52.400> is<00:03:52.940> dealing

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
that's why i paint myself is dealing

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.690 
that's why i paint myself is dealing
with<00:03:53.750> personal<00:03:54.530> issues<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:55.130> so<00:03:55.250> hopefully

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
with personal issues and so hopefully

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.250 
with personal issues and so hopefully
like<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:56.120> does

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
like that does

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.320 
like that does
kind<00:03:57.920> of<00:03:57.980> amp<00:03:58.159> it<00:03:58.310> up<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.580> bit<00:03:58.610> when<00:03:58.970> someone's

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
kind of amp it up a bit when someone's

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.890 
kind of amp it up a bit when someone's
looking<00:03:59.599> at<00:03:59.810> this<00:04:00.760> you<00:04:01.760> know<00:04:01.939> I<00:04:02.209> never<00:04:02.510> thought

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
looking at this you know I never thought

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.809 
looking at this you know I never thought
I'd<00:04:02.989> be<00:04:03.019> just<00:04:03.230> enthused<00:04:03.920> about<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.489> art<00:04:04.640> than

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
I'd be just enthused about the art than

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.819 
I'd be just enthused about the art than
I'm<00:04:04.939> making<00:04:05.090> that's<00:04:05.840> all<00:04:06.049> I<00:04:06.110> think<00:04:06.439> about<00:04:06.650> now

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
I'm making that's all I think about now

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.670 
I'm making that's all I think about now
is<00:04:07.129> just<00:04:07.370> I<00:04:07.670> put<00:04:08.569> all<00:04:08.599> my<00:04:08.750> self<00:04:09.110> into<00:04:09.379> it<00:04:09.530> so<00:04:09.620> I

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
is just I put all my self into it so I

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.800 
is just I put all my self into it so I
guess<00:04:09.950> I<00:04:10.159> mean<00:04:10.310> besides<00:04:10.700> just<00:04:11.060> keep<00:04:11.239> on<00:04:11.390> going

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
guess I mean besides just keep on going

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.089 
guess I mean besides just keep on going
and<00:04:11.870> keep<00:04:12.049> on<00:04:12.170> working<00:04:12.530> on<00:04:12.680> it<00:04:12.799> and<00:04:12.920> getting

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
and keep on working on it and getting

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.180 
and keep on working on it and getting
better<00:04:13.370> I<00:04:14.239> don't<00:04:14.690> really<00:04:14.840> see<00:04:15.200> my<00:04:15.769> art<00:04:15.980> is

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
better I don't really see my art is

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.159 
better I don't really see my art is
something<00:04:16.940> that's<00:04:17.150> necessary<00:04:17.690> something

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
something that's necessary something

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.129 
something that's necessary something
want<00:04:18.380> someone's<00:04:18.739> to<00:04:18.919> buy<00:04:19.070> you<00:04:20.060> know<00:04:20.209> but<00:04:21.019> you
