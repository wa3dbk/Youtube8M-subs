00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.650
 talk to friends in the club welcome to the channel sharing 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.119
 knowledge 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.119
 7 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.789
 I'm back to bring one more picanto about conversion this time 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.830
 at the request of a kimi person 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.600
 requested a suggestion on the program 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.550
 to bira file conversion should say to a video file 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.060
 missed a search 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.450
 and I even got to hear the three program names 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.600
 but what to disappoint me 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.760
 finally I ended up choosing this one here 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.910
 the format fact 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.230
 I liked this program 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.239
 of the site but here 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.760
 would have visited 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.619
 say uncompressed article using olinda 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.340
 or the windows itself 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.230
 because it is a separate program then windows 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.680
 can also psychopaths program 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.170
 the program here 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.240
 ff sector 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.320
 because now there are two points six months 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.329
 then you are going to bury the program installer 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.020
 normally 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.010
 Why do you click on question? 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.010
 very simple installation 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.940
 pay attention to these competitions here 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.490
 here only to start the program because the installation 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.900
 and that box 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.290
 is for the installation of roofs 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.199
 and your own program I suggest 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.389
 You leave this box checked. 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.149
 because its installation 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:15.669
 of the complexes themselves 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:18.569
 for the program in fact format 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.489
 will certainly influence 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.609
 on the final conversion quality 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:25.659
 of the vehicle 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.019
 so leave this box a house 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.060
 if this is also for the initial program after installation 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.209
 these two boxes 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.599
 this option below you'll love uncheck all the boxes 

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:43.459
 To celebrate 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.499
 tuba 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.799
 be installed on your browser 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.799
 why is it that you can now click on phoenix 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.999
 clicking on movies that the program 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.999
 will initiate 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.309
 here is a 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:04.309
 wide range of options 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:09.509
 we will have until a decade before the option that supports me 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.259
 I'm excited because it's a vader file 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:17.539
 to a video file 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.279
 piquÃ© 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:22.829
 you must click this option 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.829
 rogo devices cd dvd 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:28.799
 I'm up here 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.629
 the first option has 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.010
 must have to 20 click file in photos are 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.889
 very simple this window is program well 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:45.839
 I really liked this practice. 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:48.789
 the interface that programs any good 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:51.079
 I hope you have an easy time. 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.079
 only if you have the dvd 

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:58.299
 on your computer the dvd burner 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.069
 will probably show 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.729
 on here 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:06.119
 dvd content 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:12.829
 in my case I'm around here with brde has a folder already on the computer 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.299
 so I'll check this option 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.749
 Why am I going to click here? 

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:20.019
 pay 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.099
 specify the program 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:27.639

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.069
 at the moment and context he and the daughter is by 4 to 3 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:41.590
 the program 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.590
 to avoid problems with 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.099
 copyright in bull 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.330
 dvd owner 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.469

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.659
 from then on the public 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:02.120
 so here I click on the apartment where are the dvd files click ok 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:05.779
 now you can see here 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:08.409
 all content on the DVD is 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.409
 being shown here 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:13.520
 the files 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.560
 minimum 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.020
 in the case she cites openings athens 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.089
 geologist marcos aquino 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:22.409
 he did not score 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.779
 good then that you go to the track you have the option to reconvert here 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:28.719
 the parts you want 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:31.300
 In this case, I'm going to commit 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.310
 only the bad era was only the smallest 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.009
 it's fourteen minutes 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.009
 Good you still have the option 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.120
 and only convert 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.339
 from the moment you want 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:49.080
 so you check 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.900
 the track you want to talk to here 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.430
 you mark does 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.430
 click here to set track 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:00.370
 Renan 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.460
 clicking and adjusting the track 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.460
 here you will determine which birth 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:10.289
 fourteen minutes 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.289
 if you want it to be converted 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.559
 in fact, what labor is converted 

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:20.559
 so you click here to drag the bar 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.619
 and see that the minutes below 

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:25.219
 I'm going running 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:28.339
 So you're going to end up with the initial part. 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:31.409
 and click n 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:33.349
 initial time 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:39.060
 and the initial time and four minutes and 35 seconds in that case 

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:42.839
 I come here to enter 

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:45.199
 now 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:46.520
 click 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.319
 idea to have nobody 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.099
 the final time 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:51.580
 doubt 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.749
 It's over 

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:53.710
 for example 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.219
 until three minutes 

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:59.219
 and click field the end 

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:07.789
 so these tracks from the DVD that has 14 minutes started to talk at 4 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:08.930
 minutes 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.840
 because 35 seconds and will end the conversion in ten minutes and 31 seconds 

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:17.499
 this is just for example 

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:19.319
 how it works 

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:23.669
 the conversion of a certain part of a date does not part 

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:27.059
 participated in the event 

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:30.559
 In case you want to do the total conversion 7 

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:34.169
 drag the bar to the side 

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:36.069
 fully left 

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:38.020
 and click start time 

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.539
 will start from scratch 

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:43.470
 then click go to full to the right 

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:47.739
 and click End Time and you will be converted 

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.580

 the ex-stop of the band 

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:53.740
 done that 

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.999
 you leave 

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:58.139
 the photo beak of the high rock channel 

00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:02.679
 in season if you leave only the left side of the right side 

00:08:02.679 --> 00:08:04.909
 not 

00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:07.919
 it will not be any good 

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:10.789
 christian the pattern 

00:08:10.789 --> 00:08:11.629
 and click ok
