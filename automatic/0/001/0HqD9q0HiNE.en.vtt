they can get us a right here we can see

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.690 
they can get us a right here we can see
these<00:01:52.530> pictures<00:01:52.740> here<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.130> give<00:01:53.580> them

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
these pictures here and give them

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.510 
these pictures here and give them
feedback<00:01:53.909> as<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.330> what<00:01:54.539> to<00:01:54.659> do

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.700 

you<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:00.960> very<00:02:01.079> useful<00:02:01.200> for<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
you can this is very useful for the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.789 
you can this is very useful for the
diagnosis<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.340> problems<00:02:02.969> but<00:02:03.750> from<00:02:04.500> our<00:02:04.619> point

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
diagnosis of problems but from our point

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.169 
diagnosis of problems but from our point
of<00:02:04.890> view<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.100> very<00:02:05.189> very<00:02:05.789> good<00:02:05.939> for

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
of view it's very very good for

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.270 
of view it's very very good for
management<00:02:06.630> when<00:02:07.409> somebody<00:02:07.860> calls<00:02:08.009> us<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
management when somebody calls us and

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.479 
management when somebody calls us and
they<00:02:08.429> said<00:02:08.700> they<00:02:08.789> have<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> fracture<00:02:10.310> it's<00:02:11.310> not

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
they said they have a fracture it's not

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.070 
they said they have a fracture it's not
a<00:02:11.550> big<00:02:11.790> problem<00:02:11.940> if<00:02:12.239> it's<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.480> very<00:02:12.720> obvious

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
a big problem if it's a very obvious

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.990 
a big problem if it's a very obvious
large<00:02:13.319> fracture<00:02:13.860> like<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.190> one<00:02:14.370> but<00:02:14.519> often

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
large fracture like this one but often

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.400 
large fracture like this one but often
they<00:02:15.120> they<00:02:15.629> have<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.780> case<00:02:16.019> and<00:02:16.200> they<00:02:16.290> don't

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
they they have a case and they don't

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.479 
they they have a case and they don't
know<00:02:16.590> whether<00:02:16.739> they<00:02:16.950> should<00:02:16.980> send<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
know whether they should send the

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.320 
know whether they should send the
patient<00:02:17.670> down<00:02:18.030> or<00:02:19.190> or<00:02:20.190> treat<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.879> up<00:02:21.000> there<00:02:21.180> and

patient down or or treat it up there and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.970 
patient down or or treat it up there and
this<00:02:21.390> can<00:02:21.569> be<00:02:21.720> fifteen<00:02:22.470> thousand<00:02:22.799> dollar

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
this can be fifteen thousand dollar

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.800 
this can be fifteen thousand dollar
decision<00:02:23.519> because<00:02:24.060> that's<00:02:24.209> what<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.390> medevac

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
decision because that's what a medevac

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.990 
decision because that's what a medevac
might<00:02:25.019> cost<00:02:25.290> this<00:02:26.250> way<00:02:26.400> we<00:02:26.549> can<00:02:26.580> look<00:02:26.790> at<00:02:26.879> the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
might cost this way we can look at the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000 
might cost this way we can look at the
same<00:02:27.030> x-ray<00:02:27.540> at<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:27.720> same<00:02:27.900> time<00:02:28.140> in<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.560> past

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
same x-ray at the same time in the past

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.289 
same x-ray at the same time in the past
that<00:02:29.250> you'd<00:02:29.400> have<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.670> put<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:29.879> extra<00:02:30.090> on<00:02:30.239> a

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
that you'd have to put the extra on a

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.729 
that you'd have to put the extra on a
plane<00:02:30.540> sent<00:02:30.840> down<00:02:31.049> we've<00:02:31.319> flown<00:02:31.500> them<00:02:31.709> back

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
plane sent down we've flown them back

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.970 
plane sent down we've flown them back
and<00:02:32.220> there<00:02:33.030> was<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> lot<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.420> delay<00:02:34.200> now<00:02:34.650> we're

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
and there was a lot of delay now we're

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.520 
and there was a lot of delay now we're
talking<00:02:35.340> about<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.700> same<00:02:36.079> about<00:02:37.079> the<00:02:37.349> same

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
talking about the same about the same

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.880 
talking about the same about the same
x-ray<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.959> it<00:02:39.959> goes<00:02:40.110> straight<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.560> person

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
x-ray so it goes straight to the person

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.580 
x-ray so it goes straight to the person
who<00:02:40.980> are<00:02:41.040> doing<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.340> management<00:02:41.849> and<00:02:42.440> you<00:02:43.440> may

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
who are doing the management and you may

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.860 
who are doing the management and you may
bypass<00:02:43.980> their<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.579> radiologist

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.890 

it's<00:02:50.440> very<00:02:51.099> easy<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.580> use<00:02:52.049> maximum<00:02:53.049> get<00:02:53.290> easier

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
it's very easy to use maximum get easier

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.720 
it's very easy to use maximum get easier
so<00:02:55.900> that's<00:02:56.590> not<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.799> prominent<00:02:57.310> benefactor

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
so that's not a prominent benefactor

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.729 
so that's not a prominent benefactor
it's<00:02:57.819> easier<00:02:58.299> to<00:02:58.450> manipulate<00:02:58.690> Victor<00:02:59.409> you<00:02:59.560> can

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
it's easier to manipulate Victor you can

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.259 
it's easier to manipulate Victor you can
you<00:03:00.280> can<00:03:00.489> zoom<00:03:00.790> in<00:03:01.060> on<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:02.549> on<00:03:03.549> an<00:03:03.760> auto<00:03:03.940> film

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
you can zoom in on the on an auto film

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.910 
you can zoom in on the on an auto film
once<00:03:04.810> again<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:06.280> can<00:03:06.430> zoom<00:03:06.640> in<00:03:06.849> on<00:03:07.000> you<00:03:07.329> can

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
once again you can zoom in on you can

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.289 
once again you can zoom in on you can
you<00:03:08.920> can<00:03:09.099> rotate<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.610> film's<00:03:09.879> you<00:03:10.000> can<00:03:10.150> do<00:03:10.269> all

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
you can rotate the film's you can do all

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.449 
you can rotate the film's you can do all
you<00:03:10.540> can<00:03:10.599> do<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:10.840> lot<00:03:11.049> of<00:03:11.110> things<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:11.950> couldn't

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
you can do a lot of things you couldn't

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.009 
you can do a lot of things you couldn't
do<00:03:12.610> with<00:03:12.760> an<00:03:12.879> ordinary<00:03:13.239> film<00:03:13.720> so<00:03:13.870> it's

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
do with an ordinary film so it's

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.470 
do with an ordinary film so it's
actually<00:03:14.290> better<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.940> can<00:03:16.060> measure<00:03:16.239> the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
actually better you can measure the

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.050 
actually better you can measure the
actual<00:03:16.629> angles<00:03:17.230> on<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:19.799> between<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:21.400> moments

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
actual angles on the between the moments

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.819 
actual angles on the between the moments
if<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.299> actually<00:03:22.450> wanted<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:23.440> measure<00:03:23.590> them

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
if you actually wanted to measure them

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.319 
if you actually wanted to measure them
shows<00:03:24.129> you<00:03:24.280> right<00:03:24.370> here<00:03:24.549> how<00:03:24.700> much<00:03:24.879> angulation

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
shows you right here how much angulation

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.240 
shows you right here how much angulation
that's<00:03:25.690> at<00:03:25.840> a<00:03:25.870> 32<00:03:26.319> and<00:03:26.349> a<00:03:26.500> half<00:03:26.650> degree<00:03:26.950> angle

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
that's at a 32 and a half degree angle

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.670 
that's at a 32 and a half degree angle
so<00:03:27.819> there's<00:03:28.030> not<00:03:28.180> any<00:03:28.359> doubt<00:03:29.109> as<00:03:29.349> to<00:03:29.410> whether

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
so there's not any doubt as to whether

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.710 
so there's not any doubt as to whether
it's<00:03:29.950> 30<00:03:30.160> degrees<00:03:30.250> or<00:03:30.700> 25<00:03:31.120> degrees<00:03:31.420> gives

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
it's 30 degrees or 25 degrees gives

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.869 
it's 30 degrees or 25 degrees gives
absolutely<00:03:32.349> identical<00:03:32.530> we<00:03:33.459> do<00:03:33.579> a<00:03:33.609> lot<00:03:33.819> of

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
absolutely identical we do a lot of

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.960 
absolutely identical we do a lot of
total<00:03:34.269> joint<00:03:34.840> replacements<00:03:35.560> here<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:36.700> then

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
total joint replacements here and then

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.559 
total joint replacements here and then
we<00:03:37.780> template<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.890> x-rays<00:03:39.310> right<00:03:39.519> on<00:03:39.790> it's

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
we template the x-rays right on it's

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.000 
we template the x-rays right on it's
kind<00:03:41.049> of<00:03:41.170> part<00:03:41.319> of<00:03:41.470> all<00:03:41.590> of<00:03:41.620> this<00:03:41.709> right<00:03:42.069> on<00:03:42.370> the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
kind of part of all of this right on the

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.559 
kind of part of all of this right on the
machine<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:45.040> it<00:03:45.459> shows<00:03:45.640> us<00:03:45.790> exactly<00:03:45.819> where<00:03:46.450> to

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
machine and it shows us exactly where to

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.920 
machine and it shows us exactly where to
make<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.840> cut<00:03:47.019> what<00:03:47.290> angle<00:03:47.620> it's<00:03:47.769> out<00:03:48.099> on<00:03:48.340> and

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
make the cut what angle it's out on and

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.149 
make the cut what angle it's out on and
how<00:03:49.930> much<00:03:50.079> more<00:03:50.319> to<00:03:50.440> take<00:03:50.590> off<00:03:50.739> and<00:03:50.769> what<00:03:51.010> kind

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
how much more to take off and what kind

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.559 
how much more to take off and what kind
of<00:03:51.250> angle<00:03:51.519> we<00:03:51.609> should<00:03:51.760> be<00:03:51.849> looking<00:03:52.060> at<00:03:52.180> so<00:03:52.450> it

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
of angle we should be looking at so it

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.150 
of angle we should be looking at so it
really<00:03:52.900> works<00:03:53.140> out<00:03:53.290> really<00:03:53.470> well<00:03:53.590> for<00:03:53.739> us<00:03:53.950> in

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
really works out really well for us in

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.770 
really works out really well for us in
orthopaedics

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.290 

I<00:03:59.900> think<00:04:00.620> it's<00:04:00.709> obvious<00:04:00.860> they've<00:04:01.490> crossed<00:04:02.060> on

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
I think it's obvious they've crossed on

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.230 
I think it's obvious they've crossed on
on<00:04:02.990> the<00:04:03.200> film's<00:04:03.470> itself<00:04:03.830> and<00:04:04.069> the<00:04:04.790> production

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
on the film's itself and the production

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.550 
on the film's itself and the production
that's<00:04:05.420> what<00:04:05.569> we've<00:04:05.660> been<00:04:05.780> told<00:04:06.020> but<00:04:06.230> we<00:04:06.380> know

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
that's what we've been told but we know

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.710 
that's what we've been told but we know
it<00:04:06.880> that<00:04:07.880> it<00:04:08.209> saves<00:04:08.480> us<00:04:10.300> probably<00:04:11.300> every<00:04:11.510> month

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
it that it saves us probably every month

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.750 
it that it saves us probably every month
one<00:04:11.990> or<00:04:12.110> two<00:04:12.290> flights<00:04:13.010> that<00:04:13.190> don't<00:04:13.459> need<00:04:13.610> to

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
one or two flights that don't need to

come down that cost about fifteen twenty

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.180 
come down that cost about fifteen twenty
thousand<00:04:15.800> dollars<00:04:16.040> each<00:04:16.130> time<00:04:16.400> so<00:04:17.680> it's<00:04:18.680> not

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
thousand dollars each time so it's not

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
this better treatment it does save a lot

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.650 
this better treatment it does save a lot

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
Magnus's I need to look at next day I

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.920 
Magnus's I need to look at next day I
just<00:04:40.760> said<00:04:40.880> hang<00:04:41.240> on<00:04:41.390> i'll<00:04:41.540> set<00:04:41.750> down<00:04:41.900> the

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
just said hang on i'll set down the

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.690 
just said hang on i'll set down the
computer<00:04:42.200> and<00:04:43.130> we'll<00:04:43.250> look<00:04:43.310> at<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.520> same

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
computer and we'll look at the same

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.380 
computer and we'll look at the same
x-ray<00:04:44.030> within<00:04:44.330> about<00:04:44.540> two<00:04:44.780> minutes<00:04:46.240> so<00:04:47.240> it's

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
x-ray within about two minutes so it's

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.550 
x-ray within about two minutes so it's
been<00:04:47.570> tremendous<00:04:47.720> for<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:49.070> car<00:04:49.250> savings<00:04:49.730> on

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
been tremendous for the car savings on

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.310 
been tremendous for the car savings on
the<00:04:51.560> for<00:04:52.130> the<00:04:52.220> avoidance<00:04:52.970> of<00:04:53.390> the<00:04:53.450> many<00:04:54.050> backs

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
the for the avoidance of the many backs

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.980 
the for the avoidance of the many backs
but<00:04:54.530> even<00:04:54.800> on<00:04:54.919> the<00:04:55.010> other<00:04:55.160> hand<00:04:55.370> when<00:04:55.760> they

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
but even on the other hand when they

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.030 
but even on the other hand when they
some<00:04:56.990> people<00:04:57.020> will<00:04:57.380> say<00:04:57.410> well<00:04:57.740> they've<00:04:57.889> got

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
some people will say well they've got

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.280 
some people will say well they've got
this<00:04:58.190> x-ray<00:04:58.550> and<00:04:58.700> i<00:04:58.760> don't<00:04:58.970> see<00:04:59.210> anything<00:04:59.479> we

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
this x-ray and i don't see anything we

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.350 
this x-ray and i don't see anything we
may<00:05:00.470> look<00:05:00.620> at<00:05:00.800> it<00:05:00.950> and<00:05:01.040> say<00:05:01.190> no<00:05:01.400> no<00:05:01.430> there's<00:05:02.270> a

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
may look at it and say no no there's a

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.450 
may look at it and say no no there's a
fracture<00:05:03.020> right<00:05:03.380> through<00:05:03.680> there<00:05:03.919> that<00:05:04.190> kind

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
fracture right through there that kind

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.430 
fracture right through there that kind
of<00:05:04.520> stuff<00:05:04.760> and<00:05:04.970> that<00:05:05.479> person<00:05:05.690> in<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:06.020> past<00:05:06.229> may

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
of stuff and that person in the past may

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.810 
of stuff and that person in the past may
not<00:05:06.620> have<00:05:06.770> been<00:05:06.860> many<00:05:07.070> back<00:05:07.310> but<00:05:07.580> may<00:05:07.700> have

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
not have been many back but may have

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.640 
not have been many back but may have
gone<00:05:07.970> on<00:05:08.180> too<00:05:08.390> long<00:05:08.419> term<00:05:08.750> problems<00:05:09.290> because

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
gone on too long term problems because

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.740 
gone on too long term problems because
of<00:05:09.830> a<00:05:09.890> mismanaged<00:05:10.280> fracture<00:05:10.880> undiagnosed

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
of a mismanaged fracture undiagnosed

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.350 
of a mismanaged fracture undiagnosed
fracture<00:05:12.229> whereas<00:05:12.950> now<00:05:13.160> we<00:05:13.640> can<00:05:13.880> see<00:05:14.090> it<00:05:14.210> right

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
fracture whereas now we can see it right

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.630 
fracture whereas now we can see it right
now<00:05:14.419> on<00:05:14.750> either<00:05:14.960> reassure<00:05:15.560> or<00:05:15.950> say<00:05:16.220> no<00:05:16.400> that's

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
now on either reassure or say no that's

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.980 
now on either reassure or say no that's
somebody<00:05:16.940> that<00:05:17.090> should<00:05:17.240> be<00:05:17.330> coming<00:05:17.600> down<00:05:17.750> here

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
somebody that should be coming down here

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.380 
somebody that should be coming down here
so<00:05:18.560> obviously<00:05:19.460> that<00:05:19.669> would<00:05:19.789> be<00:05:19.880> an<00:05:20.000> increased

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
so obviously that would be an increased

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.690 
so obviously that would be an increased
initial<00:05:20.810> cost<00:05:21.050> to<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:21.830> system<00:05:22.010> but<00:05:22.340> much

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
initial cost to the system but much

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.300 
initial cost to the system but much
better<00:05:22.910> management<00:05:23.539> for<00:05:23.660> the<00:05:23.750> patient<00:05:24.110> and

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
better management for the patient and

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.980 
better management for the patient and
probably<00:05:25.310> decrease<00:05:26.030> long-term<00:05:26.600> costs

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
probably decrease long-term costs

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.180 
probably decrease long-term costs
because<00:05:27.320> of<00:05:27.470> the<00:05:27.560> lack<00:05:27.710> of<00:05:27.740> a<00:05:27.979> long-term

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
because of the lack of a long-term

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.670 
because of the lack of a long-term
complications<00:05:30.550> even<00:05:31.810> even<00:05:32.810> follow<00:05:33.050> up<00:05:33.200> like<00:05:33.650> a

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
complications even even follow up like a

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.529 
complications even even follow up like a

month and then i'll just will often
reduce<00:05:40.580> a<00:05:40.700> fracture<00:05:41.060> like<00:05:41.210> that<00:05:41.390> and<00:05:41.600> will<00:05:41.690> say

reduce a fracture like that and will say

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.719 
reduce a fracture like that and will say
get<00:05:42.440> an<00:05:42.530> extra<00:05:42.830> in<00:05:42.890> the<00:05:42.979> community<00:05:43.400> in<00:05:43.490> a<00:05:43.550> month

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
could judge it on x-ray we will we just

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.460 
could judge it on x-ray we will we just
said<00:05:52.520> oh<00:05:52.550> that's<00:05:52.910> fine<00:05:53.090> turn<00:05:53.570> him<00:05:53.630> loose<00:05:53.720> he

great system I mean not I don't think we
