00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.170

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.030

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.230
 all the messages so beautiful that I 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.240
 have left both on facebook and in 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.879
 instagram and the truth is that that 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.039
 motivated to give them a piece of my 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.719
 birthday to make this recipe that 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.819
 It turns me crazy and I'm sure that 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.819
 you will love them I am going to teach you 

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:45.120
 make a vegan chocolate that I promise 

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:47.579
 It's good, great, good, just 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.729
 you need 4 ingredients is super 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.159
 easy and the best thing is that it is also very 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:55.709
 good choice for your whole family I used 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:58.579
 stevia then it is very low in its index 

00:00:55.709 --> 00:01:00.780
 glycemic but you can use another type of 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.670
 sweeteners like I'm going to mention when 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.309
 let's do it and I hope you like it 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.930
 very much that you give a like to this 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.510
 video when you finish 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.660
 and make the recipe and share with me your 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.990
 bots so let's start to start what 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.880
 What you need is carob powder 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.630
 Cocoa either of the two 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.310
 pajín and that can be raw or toasted 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.410
 I'm using stevia for then 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.270
 but you can use ongay maple syrup 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.760
 agave 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.160
 coconut nectar and here what I have are 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.680
 about three tablespoons 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.550
 organic coconut butter that is already 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.720
 melted here I have it and this is these 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.880
 they are the only ingredients that 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.520
 we need good let's start with 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.770
 our our butter that must already 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.640
 be melted here and we're going to 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.670
 add two tablespoons of tajín let's 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.020
 mix this very well and then you 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.649
 we add the rest of our 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.649
 ingredients 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.880
 well I already have here then my mix 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.300
 I want you to see how super 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.410
 homogeneous does not have any type of group 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:14.300
 then you can use a fork or a 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.330
 kitchen globe but make sure that 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.670
 be very creamy then let's add 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.070
 our carob cocoa 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.690
 I am using two scoops but 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.080
 It depends on how much you like the 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.870
 chocolate then starts with a 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.390
 try the idea and add the other if you do 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.489
 miss jamil everything nothing else I put a 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.739
 big scoop and it's more than 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.230
 enough has the consistency 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.690
 perfect and this is the only thing that we are going to 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.459
 to do is add our sweetener 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:49.910
 I am using this organic trip in 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:52.700
 in drops that is the most powerful and I'll go 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.850
 to put about three droplets to 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.580
 four or five because it's pretty strong 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.190
 and this you can use a spoonful of 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.080
 maple honey connects with agave or 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.850
 any other type of sweetener that you 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.710
 like it but be liquid 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.450
 just make sure you do not put 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.940
 too much because if it's not also going to 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.040
 affect the texture of our truffles 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.960
 we come back we mix everything very 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.470
 well and right now he taught them how we're doing 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.600
 to serve ok then our mix and 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.200
 is ready and the easiest thing is that what 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.560
 put on a disposable fret and I say 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.180
 removable plastic to make it more 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.160
 easy to take off after what 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.560
 refrigerate moss I will put here our 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.500
 mix and then let's put the 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.650
 refrigerator or freezer for 10 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.049
 minutes 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.780
 well then I have my mix here 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:47.470
 we give it a shake I want you to see 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:51.040
 how it looks and this we are going to cover it 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.870
 Do not absorb any type of color there 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.510
 in the refrigerator and we're going to 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.939
 refrigerate as I told them from 10 to 15 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.340
 minutes until it's firm but when 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:03.030
 I've seen the mix good and it's 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.030
 delicious 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.920
 wow 1 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.140

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.599

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.640

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.250
 I just unmold 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.449
 a few taps to the mold and right now 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.430
 what we are going to do is cut it in 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:28.410
 squares and they are ready what a delight 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.229
 they were in the freezer for 10 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.290
 minutes I tried to cut but the time 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:37.620
