00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
to make a bag we're going to just hit

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.170 
to make a bag we're going to just hit
seal<00:01:45.600> at<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.049> point<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.979> we've<00:01:47.820> got<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> little

push the lid down lock it and then as
you<00:02:31.500> can<00:02:31.590> see<00:02:31.739> it's<00:02:31.890> going<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.099> vacuum<00:02:32.310> seal<00:02:32.579> on

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
you can see it's going to vacuum seal on

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.430 
you can see it's going to vacuum seal on
it

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
it

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.560 
it
it's<00:02:34.890> got<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.040> sensor<00:02:35.460> built<00:02:35.640> into<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.240> machine

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
it's got a sensor built into the machine

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.450 
it's got a sensor built into the machine
itself<00:02:36.960> and<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.290> knows<00:02:37.470> when<00:02:37.680> all<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.280> air

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
itself and it knows when all of the air

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.160 
itself and it knows when all of the air
is<00:02:38.640> extracted<00:02:39.300> once<00:02:39.510> all<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.870> air<00:02:39.990> is

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
is extracted once all the air is

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.960 
is extracted once all the air is
extracted<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:40.860> automatically<00:02:41.340> turns<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.820> off

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
extracted it automatically turns it off

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.180 
extracted it automatically turns it off
and<00:02:42.210> that's<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.200> whole<00:02:43.350> process<00:02:43.560> for<00:02:44.070> you

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
and that's the whole process for you

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.760 
and that's the whole process for you
which<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.520> very<00:02:44.730> cool<00:02:45.170> it's<00:02:46.170> taking<00:02:46.470> out<00:02:46.560> all

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
which is very cool it's taking out all

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.770 
which is very cool it's taking out all
the<00:02:46.800> air<00:02:47.100> air<00:02:47.550> is<00:02:47.820> actually<00:02:48.000> what<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.570> cause

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
the air air is actually what the cause

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.760 
the air air is actually what the cause
is<00:02:48.810> of<00:02:49.910> when<00:02:50.910> your<00:02:51.060> meat<00:02:51.270> gets<00:02:51.540> spoiled<00:02:51.990> in<00:02:52.170> in

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
is of when your meat gets spoiled in in

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.710 
is of when your meat gets spoiled in in
your<00:02:52.980> icebox<00:02:53.460> with<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.850> freezer<00:02:54.090> burn<00:02:54.420> so

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
your icebox with the freezer burn so

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.740 
your icebox with the freezer burn so
once<00:02:55.230> all<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.590> air<00:02:55.770> is<00:02:55.980> out<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.760> have<00:02:56.910> no<00:02:56.940> no

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
once all the air is out you have no no

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.270 
once all the air is out you have no no
chance<00:02:58.020> of<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.230> happening<00:02:58.350> so<00:02:58.770> this<00:02:59.040> meats

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
chance of that happening so this meats

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.970 
chance of that happening so this meats
lasting<00:02:59.940> up<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.090> five<00:03:00.360> years<00:03:00.630> once<00:03:01.620> it's<00:03:01.800> done

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
lasting up to five years once it's done

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.700 
lasting up to five years once it's done
you<00:03:02.160> just<00:03:02.190> open<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.790> lid<00:03:03.200> got<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.320> right<00:03:04.470> there

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
you just open the lid got it right there

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.330 
you just open the lid got it right there
a<00:03:05.240> slick<00:03:06.240> little<00:03:06.270> process<00:03:06.960> like<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:07.980> say<00:03:08.160> well

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
a slick little process like I say well

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.800 
a slick little process like I say well
ago<00:03:08.550> I've<00:03:08.670> got<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.850> commercial<00:03:09.390> unit<00:03:09.600> in<00:03:09.690> my

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
ago I've got a commercial unit in my

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.650 
ago I've got a commercial unit in my
processing<00:03:10.410> facility<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.130> that<00:03:12.030> actually

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
processing facility and that actually

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.510 
processing facility and that actually
cycled<00:03:13.560> is<00:03:13.680> quicker<00:03:13.980> quicker<00:03:14.220> than<00:03:14.460> my

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
cycled is quicker quicker than my

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.550 
cycled is quicker quicker than my
commercial<00:03:14.970> model<00:03:15.240> did<00:03:15.390> that's<00:03:15.630> that's<00:03:16.110> great

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
commercial model did that's that's great

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.020 
commercial model did that's that's great
I'm<00:03:17.370> impressed

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
I'm impressed

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.550 
I'm impressed
think<00:03:18.570> about<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:18.870> very<00:03:19.140> very<00:03:21.170> now<00:03:22.170> this<00:03:22.380> is

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
think about that very very now this is

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.080 
think about that very very now this is
actually<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.070> only<00:03:23.190> machine<00:03:23.640> that<00:03:23.760> we've<00:03:23.880> got

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
actually the only machine that we've got

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.030 
actually the only machine that we've got
that<00:03:24.270> can<00:03:24.420> use<00:03:24.630> be<00:03:24.870> used<00:03:25.140> in<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.380> outdoors<00:03:25.770> as

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
that can use be used in the outdoors as

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.550 
that can use be used in the outdoors as
12-volt<00:03:26.640> got<00:03:27.240> another<00:03:27.540> machine<00:03:27.750> we've<00:03:28.290> just

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
12-volt got another machine we've just
