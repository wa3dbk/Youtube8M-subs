that could be taken into the wide world
I<00:02:22.030> think<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.270> that<00:02:24.110> is<00:02:24.260> where<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.440> lot<00:02:24.560> of

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
I think that that is where a lot of

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.490 
I think that that is where a lot of
agencies<00:02:25.220> fail<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:26.660> I<00:02:26.900> think<00:02:27.080> our<00:02:27.170> industry

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
agencies fail and I think our industry

agencies fail and I think our industry
fails<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.190> think<00:02:28.940> when<00:02:29.060> you<00:02:29.150> think<00:02:29.180> about<00:02:29.630> the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
fails I think when you think about the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.410 
fails I think when you think about the
same<00:02:30.050> very<00:02:30.530> same<00:02:30.709> clients<00:02:31.130> we<00:02:31.220> pitch<00:02:31.489> also

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
same very same clients we pitch also

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
higher legal and accounting firms and

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.570 
higher legal and accounting firms and
they<00:02:34.880> don't<00:02:35.060> ask<00:02:35.269> for<00:02:35.480> respect<00:02:35.599> legal<00:02:36.250> or<00:02:37.250> spec

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
they don't ask for respect legal or spec

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.420 
they don't ask for respect legal or spec
accounting<00:02:38.140> work<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.410> I<00:02:39.950> think<00:02:40.130> this<00:02:40.250> bad

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
accounting work and I think this bad

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.080 
accounting work and I think this bad
