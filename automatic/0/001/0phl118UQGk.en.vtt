00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
the box so obviously I went ahead and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.010 
the box so obviously I went ahead and
took<00:00:25.340> out<00:00:25.460> the<00:00:25.700> packaging<00:00:26.240> material<00:00:26.660> but<00:00:26.780> just

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
took out the packaging material but just

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.540 
took out the packaging material but just
know<00:00:27.140> that<00:00:27.320> this<00:00:27.440> is<00:00:27.619> very<00:00:27.800> well<00:00:28.100> packaged

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
know that this is very well packaged

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.960 
know that this is very well packaged
from<00:00:29.420> jbr<00:00:29.930> and<00:00:30.170> they<00:00:30.350> even<00:00:30.530> give<00:00:30.860> you<00:00:30.970> down

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
from jbr and they even give you down

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.060 
from jbr and they even give you down
here<00:00:32.210> in<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:32.390> bottom<00:00:32.509> a<00:00:32.900> cool<00:00:33.470> sticker<00:00:34.960> so

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
here in the bottom a cool sticker so

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.410 
here in the bottom a cool sticker so
well<00:00:37.070> just<00:00:37.100> go<00:00:37.550> ahead<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:37.760> toss<00:00:37.940> that<00:00:38.120> off<00:00:38.270> to

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
well just go ahead and toss that off to

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.580 
well just go ahead and toss that off to
the<00:00:38.450> side<00:00:38.510> cuz<00:00:38.810> really<00:00:39.110> what<00:00:39.260> we<00:00:39.350> care<00:00:39.560> about

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
the side cuz really what we care about

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.610 
the side cuz really what we care about
is<00:00:39.829> the<00:00:40.310> engine<00:00:41.149> mount<00:00:41.329> itself<00:00:41.540> now<00:00:42.410> a<00:00:42.440> couple

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
is the engine mount itself now a couple

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.080 
is the engine mount itself now a couple
of<00:00:42.739> things<00:00:42.800> to<00:00:43.100> point<00:00:43.250> out<00:00:43.399> on<00:00:43.550> this<00:00:43.579> this<00:00:43.880> is<00:00:44.060> a

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
of things to point out on this this is a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.930 
of things to point out on this this is a
41-30<00:00:44.989> alloy<00:00:45.260> still<00:00:45.890> so<00:00:46.160> incredibly<00:00:46.700> strong

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
41-30 alloy still so incredibly strong

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.700 
41-30 alloy still so incredibly strong
yet<00:00:47.149> pretty<00:00:47.660> lightweight<00:00:47.899> it's<00:00:48.590> all

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
yet pretty lightweight it's all

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.889 
yet pretty lightweight it's all
tig-welded<00:00:49.420> then<00:00:50.420> I<00:00:50.480> believe<00:00:50.690> this<00:00:50.840> is

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
tig-welded then I believe this is

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.630 
tig-welded then I believe this is
powder-coated<00:00:51.530> comes<00:00:52.340> with<00:00:52.460> all<00:00:52.610> the

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
powder-coated comes with all the

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.100 
powder-coated comes with all the
hardware<00:00:52.760> you're<00:00:53.239> going<00:00:53.450> to<00:00:53.570> need<00:00:53.690> to<00:00:53.719> install

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
hardware you're going to need to install

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.620 
hardware you're going to need to install
it<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.380> an<00:00:54.530> 88<00:00:54.950> durometer<00:00:55.520> bushing<00:00:56.300> there<00:00:56.480> on

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
it and an 88 durometer bushing there on

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.930 
it and an 88 durometer bushing there on
the<00:00:56.750> end<00:00:56.899> and<00:00:57.350> that<00:00:57.500> is<00:00:57.620> a<00:00:57.739> very<00:00:57.950> big<00:00:58.340> bushing

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
the end and that is a very big bushing

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.660 
the end and that is a very big bushing
so<00:00:59.149> whether<00:00:59.420> this<00:00:59.600> is<00:00:59.660> going<00:00:59.930> to<00:01:00.079> do<00:01:00.170> for<00:01:00.410> you

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
so whether this is going to do for you

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.490 
so whether this is going to do for you
obviously<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.760> mazdas<00:01:02.239> and<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.750> modulus<00:01:03.050> v3

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
obviously the mazdas and the modulus v3

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.620 
obviously the mazdas and the modulus v3
suffer<00:01:03.950> from<00:01:04.159> very<00:01:04.489> soft<00:01:04.879> motor<00:01:05.149> mounts<00:01:05.479> and

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
suffer from very soft motor mounts and

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.379 
suffer from very soft motor mounts and
so<00:01:06.079> when<00:01:06.829> you<00:01:06.950> shift<00:01:07.310> hard<00:01:07.609> eat<00:01:08.030> a<00:01:08.090> lot<00:01:08.240> of<00:01:08.299> time

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:08.389 
so when you shift hard eat a lot of time

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:09.550 
so when you shift hard eat a lot of time
you're<00:01:08.509> going<00:01:08.630> to<00:01:08.689> see<00:01:08.899> that<00:01:09.079> motor<00:01:09.289> mount

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
you're going to see that motor mount

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.499 
you're going to see that motor mount
flex<00:01:09.950> or<00:01:10.100> excuse<00:01:10.340> me<00:01:10.369> the<00:01:10.520> motor<00:01:10.789> itself<00:01:10.969> flex

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
flex or excuse me the motor itself flex

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.120 
flex or excuse me the motor itself flex
back<00:01:11.749> and<00:01:11.780> forth<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:12.709> going<00:01:12.979> with

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
back and forth and so going with

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.859 
back and forth and so going with
aftermarket<00:01:13.520> motor<00:01:13.909> mounts<00:01:14.240> will<00:01:14.359> greatly

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
aftermarket motor mounts will greatly

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.739 
aftermarket motor mounts will greatly
reduce<00:01:15.200> that<00:01:15.590> flex<00:01:15.950> gonna<00:01:16.429> improve<00:01:17.359> response

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:17.749 
reduce that flex gonna improve response

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:19.330 
reduce that flex gonna improve response
time<00:01:18.259> from<00:01:18.469> when<00:01:18.619> you<00:01:18.740> step<00:01:18.950> on<00:01:19.039> the<00:01:19.159> gas<00:01:19.279> when

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
time from when you step on the gas when

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.249 
time from when you step on the gas when
that<00:01:19.759> power<00:01:19.999> actually<00:01:20.299> transmitted<00:01:21.020> down<00:01:21.139> to

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
that power actually transmitted down to

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.559 
that power actually transmitted down to
the<00:01:21.380> tires<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:22.490> just<00:01:22.670> makes<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.029> car<00:01:23.240> feel<00:01:23.270> a

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
the tires and just makes the car feel a

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.629 
the tires and just makes the car feel a
lot<00:01:23.840> more<00:01:23.869> live<00:01:24.380> a<00:01:24.409> lot<00:01:24.740> more<00:01:24.859> responsive<00:01:25.490> and

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:25.639 
lot more live a lot more responsive and

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:28.899 
lot more live a lot more responsive and
a<00:01:25.670> lot<00:01:25.819> more<00:01:25.969> racy<00:01:26.299> I<00:01:26.679> really<00:01:27.679> like<00:01:27.889> that<00:01:28.100> now

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
a lot more racy I really like that now

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.279 
a lot more racy I really like that now
with<00:01:29.209> this<00:01:29.359> they<00:01:29.539> do<00:01:29.599> offer<00:01:29.899> different

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
with this they do offer different

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.980 
with this they do offer different
durometer<00:01:30.799> 'he's<00:01:30.999> in<00:01:31.999> the<00:01:32.299> bushing<00:01:32.630> itself

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
durometer 'he's in the bushing itself

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.959 
durometer 'he's in the bushing itself
depending<00:01:33.289> on<00:01:33.409> how<00:01:33.619> hard<00:01:34.310> you<00:01:34.459> want<00:01:34.759> it

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
depending on how hard you want it

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:36.879 
depending on how hard you want it
anything's<00:01:35.719> better<00:01:35.779> than<00:01:36.020> stock<00:01:36.409> pretty<00:01:36.709> much

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:36.889 
anything's better than stock pretty much

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:38.620 
anything's better than stock pretty much
this<00:01:37.069> is<00:01:37.219> the<00:01:37.340> 88<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:37.909> it's<00:01:38.029> a<00:01:38.090> pretty<00:01:38.299> stiff

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
this is the 88 so it's a pretty stiff

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.510 
this is the 88 so it's a pretty stiff
mount<00:01:38.959> now<00:01:39.289> of<00:01:39.439> course<00:01:39.499> with<00:01:39.889> the<00:01:40.039> stiffer

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
mount now of course with the stiffer

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.969 
mount now of course with the stiffer
bushing<00:01:41.060> you<00:01:41.119> go<00:01:41.299> with<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:42.020> more<00:01:42.289> direct
