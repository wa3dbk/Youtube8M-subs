00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
not this is just a piece of the web

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.810 
not this is just a piece of the web
totally<00:02:48.300> inside<00:02:48.870> your<00:02:49.500> web<00:02:49.830> now<00:02:50.610> that's

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
totally inside your web now that's

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.000 
totally inside your web now that's
probably<00:02:51.240> not<00:02:51.390> true<00:02:51.450> embedding<00:02:52.410> maybe<00:02:52.800> that's

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
probably not true embedding maybe that's

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.310 
probably not true embedding maybe that's
not<00:02:53.130> what<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.340> wanted<00:02:53.610> Nicole<00:02:53.910> but<00:02:54.240> it's<00:02:55.230> a

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
not what you wanted Nicole but it's a

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.590 
not what you wanted Nicole but it's a
great<00:02:55.560> start<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.100> it's<00:02:56.250> quick<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.910> didn't<00:02:57.480> have

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
great start and it's quick I didn't have

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.870 
great start and it's quick I didn't have
to<00:02:57.690> do<00:02:57.780> any<00:02:58.020> coding<00:02:58.410> at<00:02:58.590> all<00:02:58.740> and<00:02:59.010> hopefully

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
to do any coding at all and hopefully

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.790 
to do any coding at all and hopefully
that'll<00:03:00.150> work<00:03:00.300> for<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:00.960> let<00:03:01.500> me<00:03:01.590> know<00:03:01.680> if

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
you need more than that that's how to

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.980 
you need more than that that's how to
