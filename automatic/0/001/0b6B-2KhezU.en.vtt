00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.759
 and the internet beauty advice galley 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.830
 Let's go another video today 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.260
 now a little more dedicated and maybe the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.600
 fishermen then it is also 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.609
 also from the beach also what 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.680
 Close this sword, I usually use it. 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.930
 quite a sword fishery 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.460
 when the ball has burst and is 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.610
 that loose ball 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.450
 So let's do a save, okay? 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.450
 Good luck guys 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.920
 Ok folks coming back here so it 's a 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:45.559
 material you will need to use 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.089
 to make your save float that many 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.429
 often ends up saving in most 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.979
 Sometimes stress really supports there it is. 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:54.110
 Well, this is easy and practical. 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:57.199
 Super hero, sure you have all 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.549
 these materials at home let's be a 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.820
 pliers 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:03.859
 You'll need a ticket only. 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.680
 also needs a piece of it can be 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.939
 thicker then this one that is a thread 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.770
 of steel 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.200
 this is to create flexible that is 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.869
 Coated with larger is a sinker 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:20.470
 Olive format and you see the weight that 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:23.630
 you think you 're going to need a booster 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.030
 need a gaga mission can be a 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.610
 model you think is best and a little light 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.220
 The team we finish is here. 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.140
 on the other end here of steel in this case 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.270
 here's good, let 's go there, we'll go 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.049
 do the guys I already learned an attack 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.759
 fees may no longer apply here 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.140
 You can see here that I already learned 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.299
 this part 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.159
 It's up to us to move the video to the people. 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.850
 will do one thing is one thing and another 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.439
 side so here this is a normal garatÃ©ia 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.600
 Who do we come here that we do? 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.229
 now this other part that is without anything 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.289
 still 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:02.179
 We pass on the mission of my blood. 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.429
 staying here as a brake can not 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.450
 beating here in that other part 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:08.269
 here from the terminal 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:13.370
 Okay, and we're going to spend the 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:16.430
 our lead olive format as I said 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.859
 okay there 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.650
 now we come because finally it is not 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:23.540
 very easy when I said supersimples 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.709
 people come here in here 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:30.319
 distort until you make only one ball 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.430
 little longer table but is that 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.560
 I'm doing another demonstration here 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.410
 so, it's okay, we passed 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.540
 A fan passes us inside the United States. 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.940
 I came here to see these people passed in 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.620
 I'll be right back here then 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.150
 people have become fans 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:51.470
 we're going through here in the cloud 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:53.540
 now it's beauty, and now 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.380
 now we passed that vine goes 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:01.450
 leave this piece here ok 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:05.900
 The distance here is for us to be able to 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.330
 of this mobility here in the paid fan 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.260
 Let's go now and we can give one more 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.810
 I came back here in this one here 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.100
 to spend here in new here to have 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.700
 one more firmness 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:23.090
 I'll try to do it here in position. 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.520
 I'm here for the video, come on, beauty. 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.250
 people already passed here are here coming back 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.720
 here then and now that we have to 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.250
 do it just close the glove that the friend 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.550
 pliers that we had shown on the 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.550
 beginning of the forced video here 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.520
 It's cool, we'll get this part. 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.820
 here's the cut here make a light 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.810
 pressure here to give more firmness also 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:04:00.380
 without forcing too much not to cut the team 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:05.000
 it's ready, just give it a cuddle here 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:08.900
 the final whistle here then that our sun 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.140
 It's just a float, and then it showed 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.840
 was here then was the fan here 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.459
 We put our kitchen and 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.669
 piece of steel can be one size 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.970
 little smaller or a line is of coarse sea 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:26.270
 to 0 80 0 90 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.470
 here comes the lead the rain can get 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:34.010
 even if this is the case. 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.450
 bride model here come our mission here 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.390
 can be any model of emission 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:42.490
 I still came here to learn 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:45.500
 now even if you want you can 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.450
 cut the claw bill here until it 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.419
 I do not need more if I want you. 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:53.600
 can make a touch cut more or less 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.590
 at this distance it is showing 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.720
 on here 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.330
 the papers more or less this distance 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.060
 here we would take this end of the 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.120
 The table is even for her to be without 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.370
 that weighs more is for your 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.320
 for safety even okay I'll let 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.370
 this one with the same tip but you can 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.919
 take this one out 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.139
 Come on then I hope this video here is 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.699
 has been useful to you and that saves 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.620
 story, that's when they stay 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.900
 loose and for some reason 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.180
 in the case of the sea many times the sword 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.320
 ends up cutting the ball because it jumps 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:30.220
 She passes by passing that part of 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.860
 behind the tip of her fin who who 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.900
 really cut enough the line is 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.330
 then often there we get to 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.039
 loose ball and because of the sword itself 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.419
 and sometimes you can lose in a 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:43.300
 can also happen 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.610
 thing suddenly left the band in the 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.100
 third, and you're going to have your 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.930
