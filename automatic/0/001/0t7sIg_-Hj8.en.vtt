install so this little cutout on the

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.180 
install so this little cutout on the
back<00:03:30.540> lines<00:03:31.139> up<00:03:31.380> with<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.680> little<00:03:31.920> circular

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
back lines up with the little circular

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.740 
back lines up with the little circular
mechanism<00:03:32.910> here<00:03:33.090> and<00:03:33.299> creates<00:03:33.540> like<00:03:33.660> a

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
mechanism here and creates like a

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.690 
mechanism here and creates like a
tongue-and-groove<00:03:34.019> type<00:03:34.650> lock<00:03:34.980> which<00:03:35.579> you

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
tongue-and-groove type lock which you

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.390 
tongue-and-groove type lock which you
can<00:03:35.910> slide<00:03:36.299> together<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.709> lock<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.250> battery

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
can slide together to lock the battery

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.819 
can slide together to lock the battery
portion<00:03:39.090> onto<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.569> case<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:40.380> once<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.680> have

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
portion onto the case so once you have

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.039 
portion onto the case so once you have
it<00:03:40.980> lined<00:03:41.190> up<00:03:41.400> like<00:03:41.609> so<00:03:41.850> you<00:03:42.329> simply<00:03:42.540> slide

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
it lined up like so you simply slide

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.009 
it lined up like so you simply slide
down<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.950> case<00:03:44.489> until<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.150> meets<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.600> 30-pin

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.780 
down the case until it meets the 30-pin
connector<00:03:46.079> and<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:46.739> can<00:03:47.220> see<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.639> the

still<00:04:06.720> gives<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:06.989> a<00:04:07.019> nice<00:04:07.139> amount<00:04:07.319> of<00:04:07.530> grip

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
still gives you a nice amount of grip

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.140 
still gives you a nice amount of grip
though<00:04:07.889> because<00:04:08.069> you've<00:04:08.280> got<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.639> grip<00:04:08.880> enos

though because you've got the grip enos

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.199 
though because you've got the grip enos
from<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.720> snap<00:04:10.260> on<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.530> back<00:04:10.709> cover<00:04:11.099> and<00:04:12.030> you

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
from the snap on the back cover and you

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.879 
from the snap on the back cover and you
still<00:04:12.480> get<00:04:12.599> a<00:04:12.660> good<00:04:12.900> amount<00:04:13.079> of<00:04:13.230> grip<00:04:13.410> with<00:04:13.709> it

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
still get a good amount of grip with it

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.670 
still get a good amount of grip with it
I<00:04:14.040> think<00:04:14.579> this<00:04:14.730> remains<00:04:15.060> relatively<00:04:15.630> slim<00:04:16.079> I

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
I think this remains relatively slim I

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.500 
I think this remains relatively slim I
think<00:04:17.099> it's<00:04:17.220> about<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.579> same<00:04:17.820> size<00:04:18.030> as<00:04:18.359> say

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
think it's about the same size as say

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.870 
think it's about the same size as say

unfortunately<00:05:14.760> this<00:05:14.940> case<00:05:15.420> did<00:05:15.840> give<00:05:16.080> me

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
unfortunately this case did give me

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.260 
unfortunately this case did give me
issues<00:05:16.590> with<00:05:16.770> flashback<00:05:17.370> when<00:05:17.850> using<00:05:18.060> the

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
issues with flashback when using the

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.750 
issues with flashback when using the
flash<00:05:18.510> when<00:05:19.080> the<00:05:19.260> battery<00:05:19.590> piece<00:05:19.920> is<00:05:20.160> on<00:05:20.370> I've

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
flash when the battery piece is on I've

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.000 
flash when the battery piece is on I've
run<00:05:21.360> into<00:05:21.510> this<00:05:21.720> problem<00:05:21.780> with<00:05:22.320> basically

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
run into this problem with basically

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.130 
run into this problem with basically
every<00:05:23.550> single<00:05:23.580> external<00:05:24.240> battery<00:05:24.690> case<00:05:24.930> I've

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
every single external battery case I've

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.810 
every single external battery case I've
tried<00:05:25.410> I<00:05:25.680> think<00:05:26.190> it's<00:05:26.370> just<00:05:26.520> that<00:05:26.700> these

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
tried I think it's just that these

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.330 
tried I think it's just that these
cutouts<00:05:27.240> are<00:05:27.450> so<00:05:27.870> deep<00:05:28.080> even<00:05:28.320> with<00:05:28.950> the<00:05:29.130> black

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
cutouts are so deep even with the black

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.190 
cutouts are so deep even with the black
ring<00:05:29.670> on<00:05:29.850> there<00:05:30.030> you<00:05:30.150> still<00:05:30.390> get<00:05:30.570> a<00:05:30.600> tremendous

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
ring on there you still get a tremendous

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.230 
ring on there you still get a tremendous
amount<00:05:31.380> of<00:05:31.590> flash<00:05:31.890> back<00:05:32.220> when<00:05:32.820> taking

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
amount of flash back when taking

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.900 
amount of flash back when taking
pictures<00:05:33.630> with<00:05:33.870> this<00:05:34.290> case<00:05:34.680> on<00:05:34.920> I<00:05:35.340> don't<00:05:35.790> use

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
pictures with this case on I don't use

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.460 
pictures with this case on I don't use
my<00:05:36.060> flash<00:05:36.300> very<00:05:36.540> often<00:05:36.930> so<00:05:37.080> I<00:05:37.110> don't<00:05:37.290> really

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
my flash very often so I don't really

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.630 
my flash very often so I don't really
think<00:05:37.530> it's<00:05:37.800> a<00:05:37.860> big<00:05:38.040> deal<00:05:38.190> but<00:05:38.400> if<00:05:38.520> you're

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
think it's a big deal but if you're

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.850 
think it's a big deal but if you're
someone<00:05:38.910> that<00:05:38.940> uses<00:05:39.180> a<00:05:39.330> flash<00:05:39.450> a<00:05:39.660> lot<00:05:40.020> be<00:05:40.620> aware

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
someone that uses a flash a lot be aware

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.440 
someone that uses a flash a lot be aware
that<00:05:40.920> this<00:05:41.160> is<00:05:41.220> going<00:05:41.640> to<00:05:41.700> cause<00:05:41.880> you<00:05:42.060> issues

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
that this is going to cause you issues

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.380 
that this is going to cause you issues
so<00:05:43.020> as<00:05:43.350> far<00:05:43.650> as<00:05:43.710> external<00:05:44.310> battery<00:05:44.700> cases<00:05:45.180> go

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
so as far as external battery cases go

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.970 
so as far as external battery cases go
the<00:05:45.570> Boost<00:05:45.810> case<00:05:46.020> has<00:05:46.200> quickly<00:05:46.410> become<00:05:46.620> one<00:05:46.950> of
