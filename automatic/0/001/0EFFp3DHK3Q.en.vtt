00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.310 

I<00:01:25.299> think<00:01:26.299> the<00:01:26.390> first<00:01:26.570> game<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:26.840> I<00:01:27.080> played

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
I think the first game that I played

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.320 
I think the first game that I played
that<00:01:27.350> really<00:01:28.280> affected<00:01:28.729> me<00:01:28.909> on<00:01:29.030> a<00:01:29.060> deep<00:01:29.270> level

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
that really affected me on a deep level

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.890 
that really affected me on a deep level
was<00:01:30.080> missed<00:01:30.440> and<00:01:30.650> it<00:01:31.369> was<00:01:31.780> something<00:01:32.780> about

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
was missed and it was something about

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.859 
was missed and it was something about
how<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:34.490> first<00:01:34.700> time<00:01:34.940> we<00:01:35.060> really<00:01:35.090> captured<00:01:35.720> an

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
how the first time we really captured an

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.190 
how the first time we really captured an
atmosphere<00:01:37.180> it<00:01:38.180> was<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:38.570> was<00:01:38.600> a<00:01:38.720> world<00:01:39.020> that

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
atmosphere it was it was a world that

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.580 
atmosphere it was it was a world that
was<00:01:39.380> fully<00:01:40.180> realized<00:01:41.180> and<00:01:41.479> really<00:01:41.960> special<00:01:42.380> at

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
was fully realized and really special at

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.859 
was fully realized and really special at
that<00:01:42.770> time<00:01:43.040> because<00:01:43.570> no<00:01:44.570> one<00:01:44.690> had<00:01:44.840> really

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
that time because no one had really

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.740 
that time because no one had really
pushed<00:01:45.320> things<00:01:45.700> quite<00:01:46.700> as<00:01:46.850> far<00:01:47.060> before<00:01:47.300> and

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
pushed things quite as far before and

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.020 
pushed things quite as far before and
and<00:01:48.440> misted<00:01:48.950> it<00:01:49.040> in<00:01:49.159> a<00:01:49.250> really<00:01:49.430> compelling<00:01:49.759> way

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
and misted it in a really compelling way

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.170 
and misted it in a really compelling way
and<00:01:50.360> I<00:01:51.259> guess<00:01:52.070> with<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.250> gallery<00:01:52.670> that's<00:01:52.940> what

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
and I guess with the gallery that's what

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.870 
and I guess with the gallery that's what
we're<00:01:53.330> trying<00:01:53.540> to<00:01:53.750> break<00:01:53.930> for<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.200> table

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
we're trying to break for the table

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.749 
we're trying to break for the table
using<00:01:55.880> new<00:01:56.810> technologies<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:57.500> putting<00:01:58.250> that

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
using new technologies and putting that

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:12.110 
using new technologies and putting that
kind<00:01:59.300> of<00:01:59.450> game<00:01:59.720> into<00:02:00.200> modern<00:02:00.530> context

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.660 

so<00:02:12.720> our<00:02:13.200> game<00:02:13.470> places<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.400> shoes<00:02:14.610> of

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
so our game places you in the shoes of

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.149 
so our game places you in the shoes of
an<00:02:15.090> urban<00:02:15.209> explorer<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.110> while<00:02:17.010> you're

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
an urban explorer and while you're

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.369 
an urban explorer and while you're

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.070 

the<00:02:48.250> gallery<00:02:48.580> itself<00:02:48.910> once<00:02:49.300> you<00:02:49.420> do<00:02:49.600> find<00:02:49.900> it

the gallery itself once you do find it

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.300 

to<00:03:10.660> escape<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.260> gallery<00:03:11.590> you<00:03:11.890> actually

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
to escape the gallery you actually

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.890 
to escape the gallery you actually
physically<00:03:12.940> enter<00:03:13.270> into<00:03:13.660> these<00:03:13.900> pain

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
physically enter into these pain

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:27.880 
physically enter into these pain

so<00:03:28.790> in<00:03:28.910> some<00:03:29.120> sections<00:03:29.510> of<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.720> game<00:03:29.870> the

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
so in some sections of the game the

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.320 
so in some sections of the game the
environments<00:03:30.830> are<00:03:30.950> randomized<00:03:31.430> so<00:03:31.850> no<00:03:32.270> two

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
environments are randomized so no two

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.240 
environments are randomized so no two
people<00:03:32.720> will<00:03:32.840> experience<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.440> same<00:03:33.620> path<00:03:33.890> to
