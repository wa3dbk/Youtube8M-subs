00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
tell you this one thing about this

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.529 
tell you this one thing about this
camera<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.230> do<00:00:52.350> not<00:00:52.590> like<00:00:53.120> one<00:00:54.120> when

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
camera that I do not like one when

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.600 
camera that I do not like one when
you're<00:00:54.690> plugging<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.050> into<00:00:55.199> target<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.980> gets

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
you're plugging it into target it gets

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.889 
you're plugging it into target it gets
really<00:00:56.850> really<00:00:57.000> hot<00:00:58.160> so<00:00:59.510> if<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.629> get<00:01:00.750> this

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
really really hot so if you get this

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.650 
really really hot so if you get this
camera<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.640> would<00:01:02.640> highly<00:01:02.969> suggest<00:01:03.000> not

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
camera I would highly suggest not

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.710 
camera I would highly suggest not
charging<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.229> overnight<00:01:05.600> to<00:01:08.330> when<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.360> started

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
charging it overnight to when I started

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.480 
charging it overnight to when I started
using<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:10.080> camera<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.650> tried<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.280> use<00:01:11.460> it

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
using this camera I tried to use it

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.920 
using this camera I tried to use it
without<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.909> waterproof<00:01:12.420> case<00:01:12.740> it

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
without the waterproof case it

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.440 
without the waterproof case it
apparently<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.110> camera<00:01:16.439> itself<00:01:16.740> does<00:01:17.340> have

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
apparently the camera itself does have

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.350 
apparently the camera itself does have
let's<00:01:18.450> see<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.659> could<00:01:18.869> pull<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.259> open<00:01:20.360> camera

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
let's see I could pull it open camera

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.719 
let's see I could pull it open camera
itself<00:01:21.750> does<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.320> way<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.189> put

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
itself does have a way that you can put

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.190 
itself does have a way that you can put
it<00:01:23.880> onto<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.810> tripod<00:01:25.590> right<00:01:26.570> there<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.080> you

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
it onto a tripod right there and you

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.539 
it onto a tripod right there and you
can't<00:01:28.439> really<00:01:28.560> see<00:01:28.680> right<00:01:29.130> now

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
can't really see right now

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.999 
can't really see right now
but<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.210> already<00:01:30.420> stripped<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.890> is

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
but it already stripped so that is

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.130 
but it already stripped so that is
another<00:01:32.220> problem<00:01:32.460> right<00:01:32.729> there<00:01:32.970> I've<00:01:33.960> only

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
another problem right there I've only

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.770 
another problem right there I've only
had<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.350> for<00:01:34.560> two<00:01:34.710> days<00:01:35.329> as<00:01:36.329> far<00:01:36.570> as<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
had it for two days as far as the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.859 
had it for two days as far as the
quality<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.590> not<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.890> greatest<00:01:38.689> seems<00:01:39.689> like

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
quality it's not the greatest seems like

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.120 
quality it's not the greatest seems like
the<00:01:40.020> lens<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.590> somewhat<00:01:41.009> lacking<00:01:41.280> itself<00:01:43.130> but

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the lens is somewhat lacking itself but

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.100 
the lens is somewhat lacking itself but
honestly<00:01:44.670> you're<00:01:45.390> looking<00:01:45.659> for<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> cheap<00:01:46.079> way

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
honestly you're looking for a cheap way

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.440 
honestly you're looking for a cheap way
to<00:01:46.320> get<00:01:46.619> into<00:01:46.860> action<00:01:47.189> cameras<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:48.329> is

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
to get into action cameras this is

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.630 
to get into action cameras this is
probably<00:01:48.720> your<00:01:48.810> best<00:01:48.869> bet<00:01:49.159> like<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.280> said<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.520> do

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
probably your best bet like I said I do

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.319 
probably your best bet like I said I do
not<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.090> recommend<00:01:51.750> using<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:53.180> amount<00:01:54.180> on

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
not you recommend using the amount on

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.800 
not you recommend using the amount on
the<00:01:54.450> camera<00:01:54.750> itself<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.979> will<00:01:56.280> strip<00:01:56.640> just<00:01:57.509> use

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the camera itself it will strip just use

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.230 
the camera itself it will strip just use
the<00:01:58.020> use<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.560> waterproof<00:01:59.100> case<00:01:59.310> it's

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
the use the waterproof case it's

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.490 
the use the waterproof case it's
probably<00:02:00.600> your<00:02:00.689> best<00:02:00.840> bet<00:02:02.390> these<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:04.170> haven't

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
probably your best bet these I haven't

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.459 
probably your best bet these I haven't
tried<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.219> helmet<00:02:05.610> one<00:02:05.759> yet<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.020> don't<00:02:07.409> know

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
tried the helmet one yet so I don't know

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.890 
tried the helmet one yet so I don't know
how<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.710> works<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.069> what

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:08.900 
how it works so what

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.730 
how it works so what
works<00:02:09.830> but<00:02:10.580> it's<00:02:10.850> supposed<00:02:11.210> to<00:02:11.270> just<00:02:11.540> stick<00:02:12.530> on

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
works but it's supposed to just stick on

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.120 
works but it's supposed to just stick on
