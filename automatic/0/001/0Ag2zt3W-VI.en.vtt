00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 You are the last clip of your mothers Lucine Salute 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.629
 and 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.610
 I realized that it was certainly a little closer 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.670
 petipa 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.029
 but probably not in time graceful 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.369
 in short who is very angry that he stood very 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.369
 long on the streets 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:37.560

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.560
 transfer to cafe 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.510
 of course you did several sites 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.739
 but once it happened the library 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.690
 the problem is that next time 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.359
 maybe it will work again because 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.589
 I'm scared on because next time 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.589
 there will be more people 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.830

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.770
