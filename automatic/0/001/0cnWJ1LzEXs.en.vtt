yes<00:00:00.850> homeostasis<00:00:01.850> is<00:00:02.420> essential<00:00:03.139> for<00:00:03.320> the

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:04.190 
yes homeostasis is essential for the

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.259 
yes homeostasis is essential for the
health<00:00:04.459> and<00:00:04.669> vitality<00:00:05.379> of<00:00:06.379> living<00:00:06.740> systems

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:07.269 
health and vitality of living systems

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:09.459 
health and vitality of living systems
among<00:00:08.269> the<00:00:08.450> organs<00:00:08.839> that<00:00:09.049> regulate

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:09.469 
among the organs that regulate

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:11.829 
among the organs that regulate
homeostasis<00:00:09.980> in<00:00:10.280> the<00:00:10.370> body<00:00:10.610> the<00:00:11.120> kidneys<00:00:11.570> are

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:11.839 
homeostasis in the body the kidneys are

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.159 
homeostasis in the body the kidneys are
of<00:00:12.320> great<00:00:12.530> importance<00:00:13.389> which<00:00:14.389> of<00:00:14.900> the

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:15.169 
of great importance which of the

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:16.570 
of great importance which of the
following<00:00:15.379> is<00:00:15.799> not<00:00:15.860> homeostatic

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
following is not homeostatic

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.230 
following is not homeostatic
functionally<00:00:17.560> okay<00:00:18.580> so<00:00:19.580> really<00:00:19.760> we're<00:00:20.060> just

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
functionally okay so really we're just

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.560 
functionally okay so really we're just
asked<00:00:20.660> here<00:00:20.930> about<00:00:21.260> what<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:21.980> kidney<00:00:22.310> does<00:00:22.580> in

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
asked here about what the kidney does in

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.350 
asked here about what the kidney does in
terms<00:00:23.810> of<00:00:23.990> your<00:00:24.140> stasis<00:00:24.500> percent<00:00:25.370> so<00:00:25.970> it's<00:00:26.210> not

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
terms of your stasis percent so it's not

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.250 
terms of your stasis percent so it's not
really<00:00:26.720> asking<00:00:26.930> us<00:00:27.350> to<00:00:27.770> dissect<00:00:29.020> anything<00:00:30.020> in

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
really asking us to dissect anything in

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.230 
really asking us to dissect anything in
detail<00:00:30.410> a<00:00:30.920> lot<00:00:31.430> of<00:00:31.580> the<00:00:31.670> questions<00:00:32.059> in<00:00:32.180> the

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.240 
detail a lot of the questions in the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.090 
detail a lot of the questions in the
MCAT<00:00:32.570> are<00:00:32.689> like<00:00:32.870> that<00:00:33.080> they<00:00:33.800> generally

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
MCAT are like that they generally

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.920 
MCAT are like that they generally
provide<00:00:34.460> a<00:00:34.580> lot<00:00:34.730> of<00:00:34.850> information<00:00:35.510> that<00:00:35.750> you

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
provide a lot of information that you

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.050 
provide a lot of information that you
don't<00:00:36.080> necessarily<00:00:36.170> need<00:00:36.830> you<00:00:37.520> just<00:00:37.700> kind<00:00:37.970> of

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.060 
don't necessarily need you just kind of

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.819 
don't necessarily need you just kind of
have<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:38.240> focus<00:00:38.600> so<00:00:38.960> here<00:00:39.140> we're<00:00:39.320> asked<00:00:39.650> about

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
have to focus so here we're asked about

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.790 
have to focus so here we're asked about
homeostasis<00:00:40.760> or<00:00:41.510> homeostatic<00:00:41.990> function<00:00:42.620> and

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
homeostasis or homeostatic function and

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.460 
homeostasis or homeostatic function and
we're<00:00:43.760> asked<00:00:44.090> about<00:00:44.240> the<00:00:44.420> kidney<00:00:44.720> so<00:00:45.260> what<00:00:45.380> are

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
we're asked about the kidney so what are

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.020 
we're asked about the kidney so what are
some<00:00:45.530> of<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:45.829> functions<00:00:46.310> of<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.730> kidney

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
some of the functions of the kidney

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.910 
some of the functions of the kidney
that's<00:00:47.540> essentially<00:00:48.470> what<00:00:48.620> we're<00:00:48.739> being

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
that's essentially what we're being

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.660 
that's essentially what we're being
asked<00:00:49.340> here

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
asked here

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.080 
asked here
okay<00:00:50.030> so<00:00:50.480> let's<00:00:50.810> see<00:00:50.960> choice<00:00:51.200> a<00:00:52.010> says<00:00:52.340> renal

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
okay so let's see choice a says renal

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.530 
okay so let's see choice a says renal
absorption<00:00:53.930> choice<00:00:54.560> the<00:00:54.770> renal<00:00:55.250> excretion<00:00:55.540> C

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
absorption choice the renal excretion C

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.660 
absorption choice the renal excretion C
is<00:00:56.750> hormone<00:00:57.230> secretion<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:58.100> then<00:00:58.309> B<00:00:58.610> is

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
is hormone secretion and then B is

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.870 
is hormone secretion and then B is
micturition<00:00:59.530> okay<00:01:00.530> so<00:01:01.040> if<00:01:01.130> you<00:01:01.250> recall<00:01:01.399> let's

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
micturition okay so if you recall let's

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.270 
micturition okay so if you recall let's
take<00:01:02.059> a<00:01:02.090> look<00:01:02.329> when<00:01:03.320> we<00:01:03.500> learned<00:01:03.860> about<00:01:04.009> the

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
take a look when we learned about the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.539 
take a look when we learned about the
kidney<00:01:04.639> in<00:01:04.819> physiology<00:01:05.569> classes<00:01:06.200> we<00:01:07.189> learned

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
kidney in physiology classes we learned

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.010 
kidney in physiology classes we learned
that<00:01:07.729> there<00:01:07.909> is<00:01:07.999> of<00:01:08.149> course<00:01:08.179> these<00:01:08.689> different

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
that there is of course these different

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.080 
that there is of course these different
sections<00:01:09.499> and<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:09.920> functional<00:01:10.460> unit<00:01:10.789> is<00:01:10.909> the

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
sections and the functional unit is the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.849 
sections and the functional unit is the
nephron<00:01:11.569> so<00:01:12.200> we<00:01:12.319> have<00:01:12.469> of<00:01:12.560> course<00:01:12.740> the

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:12.859 
nephron so we have of course the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:14.770 
nephron so we have of course the
proximal<00:01:13.520> convoluted<00:01:13.729> tubules

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
proximal convoluted tubules

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.289 
proximal convoluted tubules
we<00:01:14.929> have<00:01:15.109> Bowman's<00:01:15.619> capsule<00:01:15.889> we<00:01:16.850> have<00:01:17.060> the

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
we have Bowman's capsule we have the

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.480 
we have Bowman's capsule we have the
descendant<00:01:17.780> loop<00:01:17.899> of<00:01:18.049> Henle<00:01:18.439> because<00:01:19.100> all<00:01:19.280> of

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
descendant loop of Henle because all of

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.399 
descendant loop of Henle because all of
this<00:01:19.609> is<00:01:19.789> the<00:01:19.939> loop<00:01:20.060> of<00:01:20.209> Henle<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:20.899> ascendant

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
this is the loop of Henle the ascendant

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.260 
this is the loop of Henle the ascendant
portion<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.130> then<00:01:22.280> of<00:01:22.429> course<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.850> distal

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
portion and then of course the distal

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.889 
portion and then of course the distal
convoluted<00:01:23.450> tubules<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:24.520> it<00:01:25.520> was<00:01:26.329> a<00:01:26.359> pain<00:01:26.689> to

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
convoluted tubules and it was a pain to

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.840 
convoluted tubules and it was a pain to
learn<00:01:27.109> what<00:01:27.530> each<00:01:27.709> region<00:01:28.189> does<00:01:28.399> but<00:01:28.670> here's

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
learn what each region does but here's

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.760 
learn what each region does but here's
my<00:01:28.909> cell<00:01:29.209> diagram<00:01:29.389> says<00:01:30.139> hey<00:01:30.319> here's<00:01:30.560> the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
my cell diagram says hey here's the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.559 
my cell diagram says hey here's the
nephron<00:01:31.219> we<00:01:31.520> know<00:01:31.670> that<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:31.999> renal<00:01:32.240> corpuscle

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
nephron we know that the renal corpuscle

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:34.870 
nephron we know that the renal corpuscle
is<00:01:32.869> responsible<00:01:33.679> for<00:01:33.709> filtration<00:01:34.429> because

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
is responsible for filtration because

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.090 
is responsible for filtration because
remember<00:01:35.359> the<00:01:35.539> purpose<00:01:35.810> of<00:01:36.139> the<00:01:36.529> kidney<00:01:36.859> is<00:01:36.889> of

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
remember the purpose of the kidney is of

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.219 
remember the purpose of the kidney is of
course<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.579> filter<00:01:38.060> impurities<00:01:39.049> from<00:01:39.079> the

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
course to filter impurities from the

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.199 
course to filter impurities from the
body<00:01:39.499> so<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:39.979> course<00:01:40.249> it<00:01:40.459> filters<00:01:40.819> of<00:01:41.029> blood

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
body so of course it filters of blood

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:45.639 
body so of course it filters of blood
here<00:01:41.630> then<00:01:42.499> we<00:01:42.679> have<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:44.299> proximal<00:01:44.899> proximal

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
here then we have the proximal proximal

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.919 
here then we have the proximal proximal
means<00:01:45.889> closed<00:01:46.340> so<00:01:46.700> this<00:01:46.849> is<00:01:46.999> a<00:01:47.029> closer<00:01:47.389> region

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
means closed so this is a closer region

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:49.779 
means closed so this is a closer region
closer<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:48.499> the<00:01:48.590> corpus<00:01:48.950> go<00:01:49.159> where<00:01:49.399> of<00:01:49.579> course

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
closer to the corpus go where of course

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.089 
closer to the corpus go where of course
the<00:01:49.909> fluid<00:01:50.149> enters<00:01:51.049> or<00:01:51.319> the<00:01:51.439> process<00:01:51.799> begins

00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:52.099 
the fluid enters or the process begins

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:54.429 
the fluid enters or the process begins
and<00:01:52.429> it's<00:01:52.969> here<00:01:53.149> that<00:01:53.329> we<00:01:53.450> have<00:01:53.659> reabsorption

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
and it's here that we have reabsorption

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.609 
and it's here that we have reabsorption
and<00:01:54.770> secretion<00:01:55.779> here<00:01:56.779> we<00:01:56.959> see<00:01:57.109> the<00:01:57.229> entrance

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
and secretion here we see the entrance

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.480 
and secretion here we see the entrance
of<00:01:57.770> things<00:01:58.189> like<00:01:58.369> urea<00:01:59.590> you<00:02:00.590> know<00:02:00.740> dopamine

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
of things like urea you know dopamine

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.859 
of things like urea you know dopamine
the<00:02:01.669> question<00:02:02.029> doesn't<00:02:02.179> ask<00:02:02.389> for<00:02:02.509> this<00:02:02.630> great

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
the question doesn't ask for this great

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.690 
the question doesn't ask for this great
detail<00:02:03.229> but<00:02:03.439> this<00:02:03.529> is<00:02:03.679> just<00:02:03.829> a<00:02:03.889> quick<00:02:04.039> you<00:02:04.609> know

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
detail but this is just a quick you know

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.089 
detail but this is just a quick you know
refresher<00:02:05.349> then<00:02:06.349> we<00:02:06.499> have<00:02:06.679> of<00:02:06.829> course<00:02:06.979> the

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
refresher then we have of course the

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.759 
refresher then we have of course the
actual<00:02:07.609> loop<00:02:07.789> the<00:02:08.299> descending<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.560> ascending

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
actual loop the descending and ascending

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.460 
actual loop the descending and ascending
limbs<00:02:10.429> we<00:02:10.700> see<00:02:10.879> that<00:02:11.090> water<00:02:11.390> leaves<00:02:11.689> here<00:02:12.049> salt

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
limbs we see that water leaves here salt

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.080 
limbs we see that water leaves here salt
leaves

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
leaves

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.490 
leaves
and<00:02:13.510> then<00:02:13.599> over<00:02:13.870> here<00:02:13.900> we<00:02:14.080> also<00:02:14.200> have

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
and then over here we also have

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.339 
and then over here we also have
reabsorption<00:02:15.250> in<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:16.360> distal<00:02:17.319> convoluted

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
tubules and collecting duct regions so

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.780 
tubules and collecting duct regions so
this<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:21.010> really<00:02:21.250> nice

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
this is really nice

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.970 
this is really nice
you<00:02:22.239> could<00:02:22.390> probably<00:02:22.599> look<00:02:22.930> at<00:02:23.110> this<00:02:23.319> pause

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
you could probably look at this pause

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.130 
you could probably look at this pause
the<00:02:24.160> screen<00:02:24.459> just<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.819> refresh<00:02:25.060> your<00:02:25.180> memory

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.589 
the screen just to refresh your memory
about<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.800> but<00:02:27.280> we<00:02:27.400> do<00:02:27.550> see<00:02:27.790> that<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:28.030> kidney<00:02:28.420> is

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
about it but we do see that a kidney is

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.130 
about it but we do see that a kidney is
involved<00:02:29.440> in<00:02:29.560> reabsorption<00:02:30.130> absolutely

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
involved in reabsorption absolutely

filtration means of course separating
the<00:02:33.849> impurities<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.630> retaining<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.200> things

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
the impurities and retaining the things

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.759 
the impurities and retaining the things
that<00:02:36.069> are<00:02:36.250> needed<00:02:36.610> by<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:37.180> body<00:02:37.330> so<00:02:38.200> we<00:02:38.380> return

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
that are needed by the body so we return

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.370 
that are needed by the body so we return
we<00:02:39.190> see<00:02:39.459> that<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.330> answer<00:02:40.660> choices<00:02:40.690> had<00:02:41.230> of

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
we see that the answer choices had of

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.370 
we see that the answer choices had of
course<00:02:41.730> absorption<00:02:42.730> excretion<00:02:43.380> absolutely

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
course absorption excretion absolutely

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.870 
course absorption excretion absolutely
we<00:02:44.560> saw<00:02:44.769> that<00:02:44.980> those<00:02:45.130> things<00:02:45.430> were<00:02:45.549> leaving

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
we saw that those things were leaving

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.390 
we saw that those things were leaving
and<00:02:46.000> hormone<00:02:46.690> secretion<00:02:47.260> now<00:02:47.709> of<00:02:47.890> course<00:02:48.100> when

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
and hormone secretion now of course when

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.280 
and hormone secretion now of course when
we<00:02:48.519> look<00:02:48.549> at<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.330> function<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.110> kidney

we look at the function of the kidney

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.309 
we look at the function of the kidney
here<00:02:50.890> in<00:02:51.069> terms<00:02:51.549> of<00:02:51.760> what<00:02:52.030> we<00:02:52.269> when<00:02:52.900> we<00:02:53.049> study

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
here in terms of what we when we study

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.289 
here in terms of what we when we study
it<00:02:53.440> as<00:02:53.560> part<00:02:53.830> of<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.040> urinary<00:02:54.430> system<00:02:54.580> or

hormones okay some of them for instance

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.820 
hormones okay some of them for instance
are<00:03:06.549> involved<00:03:07.269> in<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:08.049> production<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.590> red

remember<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.739> kidney<00:03:21.100> is<00:03:21.220> also<00:03:22.560> capable

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
remember that the kidney is also capable

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.009 
remember that the kidney is also capable
of<00:03:23.799> secreting<00:03:24.310> hormones<00:03:24.430> okay<00:03:25.269> so<00:03:25.690> that's<00:03:25.870> the

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
of secreting hormones okay so that's the

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.440 
of secreting hormones okay so that's the
hormone<00:03:26.320> secretion<00:03:26.859> now<00:03:27.370> mix<00:03:27.670> your<00:03:27.940> Isham<00:03:28.269> is

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
hormone secretion now mix your Isham is

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.199 
hormone secretion now mix your Isham is
actually<00:03:28.900> just<00:03:28.959> a<00:03:29.109> fancy<00:03:29.530> way<00:03:29.650> for<00:03:29.680> saying

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
actually just a fancy way for saying

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.400 
actually just a fancy way for saying
release<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.450> urine<00:03:31.690> from<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:31.959> body<00:03:32.170> or

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
release and urine from the body or

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.920 
release and urine from the body or
urination<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.250> so<00:03:33.850> we<00:03:34.030> know<00:03:34.180> that<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.510> kidney

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
urination and so we know that the kidney

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.289 
urination and so we know that the kidney
even<00:03:35.410> though<00:03:35.500> it<00:03:35.769> is<00:03:36.069> endocrine<00:03:36.579> because<00:03:37.180> it

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
even though it is endocrine because it

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.360 
even though it is endocrine because it
releases<00:03:37.569> hormones<00:03:37.900> we<00:03:38.739> know<00:03:38.859> that<00:03:39.040> it's<00:03:39.190> part

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
releases hormones we know that it's part

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.740 
releases hormones we know that it's part
of<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.549> excrete<00:03:39.850> ori<00:03:40.030> system<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:40.630> it's

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
of the excrete ori system and it's

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.199 
of the excrete ori system and it's
involved<00:03:41.170> in<00:03:41.200> filtration<00:03:41.819> reabsorption<00:03:42.819> and

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
involved in filtration reabsorption and

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.629 
involved in filtration reabsorption and
excretion<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.560> kidney<00:03:44.920> is<00:03:45.010> not<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.220> part<00:03:45.579> of

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
excretion the kidney is not a part of

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.490 
excretion the kidney is not a part of
nutrition<00:03:46.269> that<00:03:46.420> is<00:03:46.780> something<00:03:47.170> that<00:03:47.350> we

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
nutrition that is something that we

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.229 
nutrition that is something that we
associate<00:03:47.739> of<00:03:48.040> course<00:03:48.280> with<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.730> bladder<00:03:48.970> and

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
associate of course with the bladder and

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.210 
associate of course with the bladder and
the<00:03:49.359> muscles<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:50.019> urethra<00:03:50.470> so<00:03:50.980> in<00:03:51.069> this
