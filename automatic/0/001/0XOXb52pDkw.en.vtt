but<00:01:36.869> anyway<00:01:37.200> we're<00:01:37.799> pretty<00:01:37.979> much<00:01:38.130> behind

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
but anyway we're pretty much behind

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.609 
but anyway we're pretty much behind
right<00:01:38.759> now<00:01:38.790> because<00:01:39.390> we've<00:01:39.869> blown<00:01:40.200> all<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.500> our

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
right now because we've blown all of our

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.920 
right now because we've blown all of our
defensive<00:01:41.009> cooldowns<00:01:41.130> as<00:01:41.640> far<00:01:41.850> as<00:01:42.000> my<00:01:42.720> healing

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
defensive cooldowns as far as my healing

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.050 
defensive cooldowns as far as my healing
cool<00:01:43.229> downs<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:44.399> we're<00:01:44.640> getting<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.880> lot<00:01:45.000> of

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
cool downs but we're getting a lot of

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.609 
cool downs but we're getting a lot of
damage<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.899> their<00:01:46.049> team<00:01:46.259> at<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
damage on the on their team at the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.350 
damage on the on their team at the
moment<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.460> we've<00:01:47.759> made<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.060> priests<00:01:48.329> used

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
moment and we've made the priests used

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.330 
moment and we've made the priests used
most<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.899> his<00:01:49.049> cooldowns<00:01:49.290> except<00:01:49.829> for<00:01:49.979> trinket

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
most of his cooldowns except for trinket

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.950 
most of his cooldowns except for trinket
but<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.670> don't<00:01:50.880> have<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.060> trick<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.390> right<00:01:51.420> now<00:01:51.689> so

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
but I don't have a trick it right now so

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.359 
but I don't have a trick it right now so
if<00:01:52.170> i<00:01:52.259> get<00:01:52.409> cycle<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.920> then<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.100> could<00:01:53.220> be

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
if i get cycle and then it could be

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.370 
if i get cycle and then it could be
really<00:01:53.729> bad<00:01:54.149> for<00:01:54.210> us<00:01:54.479> or<00:01:54.840> either<00:01:55.020> our<00:01:55.200> rep

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
really bad for us or either our rep

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.560 
really bad for us or either our rep
paladin<00:01:55.799> but<00:01:56.369> we<00:01:56.490> land<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.850> really<00:01:57.060> real<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.450> a

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
whole beer on their team and the water

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.499 
whole beer on their team and the water
doesn't<00:01:59.250> have<00:01:59.549> anything<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.030> get<00:02:00.149> out<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.329> it

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
doesn't have anything to get out of it

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.789 
doesn't have anything to get out of it
which<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.899> really<00:02:00.930> good<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.619> get<00:02:01.770> some

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
which is really good so you get some

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.940 
which is really good so you get some
damage<00:02:02.219> out<00:02:02.399> sprays<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.560> it's<00:02:04.560> really<00:02:04.799> good

damage out sprays and it's really good
that<00:02:04.979> time<00:02:05.310> i<00:02:05.549> didn't<00:02:06.030> let<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.240> peril<00:02:06.479> result

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
that time i didn't let the peril result

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.749 
that time i didn't let the peril result
if<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.039> would<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.220> noticed<00:02:08.429> her

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
if you would have noticed her

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.949 
if you would have noticed her
here<00:02:08.879> I'll<00:02:08.970> let<00:02:09.119> him<00:02:09.179> result<00:02:09.599> which<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.869> a

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
here I'll let him result which is a

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.600 
here I'll let him result which is a
really<00:02:10.170> big<00:02:10.349> mistake<00:02:10.769> something<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.519> you

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
really big mistake something that you

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.509 
really big mistake something that you
want<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.819> avoid<00:02:12.060> at<00:02:12.239> all<00:02:12.330> times<00:02:12.739> so<00:02:13.739> since<00:02:14.370> the

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
want to avoid at all times so since the

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.190 
want to avoid at all times so since the
priest<00:02:14.819> is<00:02:14.939> not<00:02:15.120> dying<00:02:15.420> what<00:02:15.870> our<00:02:15.989> strategy

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
priest is not dying what our strategy

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.140 
priest is not dying what our strategy
needs<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.769> be<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.220> it's<00:02:17.340> about<00:02:17.579> to<00:02:17.760> be<00:02:17.879> is<00:02:18.120> to

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
needs to be and it's about to be is to

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.149 
needs to be and it's about to be is to
control<00:02:18.689> the<00:02:18.840> priests<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.409> hit<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.799> warrior

control the priests and hit the warrior
and<00:02:20.370> that's<00:02:21.060> exactly<00:02:21.209> what<00:02:21.569> we<00:02:21.659> do<00:02:21.810> we<00:02:21.989> put<00:02:22.170> the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
and that's exactly what we do we put the

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.350 
and that's exactly what we do we put the
priests<00:02:22.470> into<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.769> full<00:02:23.010> fear<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.549> we<00:02:24.180> just

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
able to cast a little bit since the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.539 
able to cast a little bit since the
barrel<00:02:28.440> gets<00:02:28.620> put<00:02:28.769> into<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.980> full<00:02:29.220> beer<00:02:29.430> as<00:02:29.519> well

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
barrel gets put into a full beer as well

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.069 
barrel gets put into a full beer as well
they<00:02:30.120> really<00:02:30.390> shouldn't<00:02:30.569> have<00:02:30.720> been<00:02:30.810> stacked

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
they really shouldn't have been stacked

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.720 
they really shouldn't have been stacked
like<00:02:31.349> this<00:02:31.620> they<00:02:31.920> would<00:02:32.040> have<00:02:32.159> not<00:02:32.340> had<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.579> eat

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
like this they would have not had to eat

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.170 
like this they would have not had to eat
this<00:02:33.470> double<00:02:34.470> fear<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.400> get<00:02:35.519> a<00:02:35.549> full<00:02:35.790> hex<00:02:36.000> on

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
this double fear and I get a full hex on

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.179 
this double fear and I get a full hex on
the<00:02:36.359> crease<00:02:36.629> but<00:02:36.930> unfortunately<00:02:37.890> for<00:02:37.920> our

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
the crease but unfortunately for our

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.649 
the crease but unfortunately for our
team<00:02:38.430> miss<00:02:38.790> Farrell<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.150> actually<00:02:39.450> really

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
team miss Farrell is actually really

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.720 
team miss Farrell is actually really
good<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.260> he<00:02:40.739> was<00:02:41.040> very<00:02:41.069> quick<00:02:41.489> at<00:02:41.640> the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
good and he was very quick at the

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.309 
good and he was very quick at the
spelling<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.510> he<00:02:42.659> just<00:02:42.810> felt<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.079> priests

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
spelling so he just felt the priests

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.619 
spelling so he just felt the priests
instantly<00:02:43.799> out<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.099> hags<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.609> just<00:02:45.420> need<00:02:45.599> to

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
instantly out of the hags I just need to

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.199 
instantly out of the hags I just need to
avoid<00:02:46.049> my<00:02:46.590> rep<00:02:46.829> out<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.220> getting<00:02:47.459> my<00:02:47.819> colon<00:02:48.090> at

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
avoid my rep out and getting my colon at

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.430 
avoid my rep out and getting my colon at
this<00:02:48.299> point<00:02:48.569> because<00:02:48.780> if<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.079> does<00:02:49.230> get

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
this point because if it does get

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.349 
this point because if it does get
cyclone<00:02:49.950> then<00:02:50.579> that's<00:02:50.790> going<00:02:50.909> to<00:02:51.000> take<00:02:51.120> away

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
cyclone then that's going to take away

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.390 
cyclone then that's going to take away
like<00:02:51.569> all<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:52.079> our<00:02:52.170> pressure<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.829> we<00:02:53.190> can't

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
like all of our pressure and we can't

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.539 
like all of our pressure and we can't
have<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:53.609> so<00:02:54.599> as<00:02:54.989> you<00:02:55.230> can<00:02:55.319> see<00:02:55.530> i<00:02:55.829> grounded

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
have that so as you can see i grounded

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.550 
have that so as you can see i grounded
the<00:02:56.670> cyclone<00:02:57.090> here<00:02:57.389> it's<00:02:57.720> really<00:02:58.049> important

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
the cyclone here it's really important

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.780 
the cyclone here it's really important
that<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.859> have<00:02:59.010> your<00:02:59.040> grounding<00:02:59.639> down

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
that you have your grounding down

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.490 
that you have your grounding down
whenever<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.420> see<00:03:00.569> the<00:03:00.720> peril<00:03:01.049> trying<00:03:01.349> to

earlier on the crease which was I mean I
don't<00:03:09.420> know<00:03:09.510> it's<00:03:09.659> it's<00:03:09.959> really<00:03:10.500> if<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.190> think

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
don't know it's it's really if you think

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.680 
don't know it's it's really if you think
that<00:03:11.670> they're<00:03:11.819> feral<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.239> good<00:03:12.450> enough<00:03:12.629> to

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
that they're feral is good enough to

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.110 
that they're feral is good enough to
dispel<00:03:13.139> quickly<00:03:13.530> or<00:03:13.650> not<00:03:13.829> then<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.579> mean<00:03:14.910> if<00:03:15.030> you

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
dispel quickly or not then I mean if you

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.400 
dispel quickly or not then I mean if you
think<00:03:15.359> that<00:03:15.510> he<00:03:15.569> can't<00:03:15.780> dispel<00:03:16.109> it<00:03:16.139> quickly

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
think that he can't dispel it quickly

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.640 
think that he can't dispel it quickly
then<00:03:16.709> just<00:03:16.919> do<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.220> it's<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.180> great<00:03:18.359> idea<00:03:18.389> and<00:03:19.049> it

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
then just do it it's a great idea and it

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.110 
then just do it it's a great idea and it
calls<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:19.980> feral<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.430> have<00:03:20.549> to<00:03:20.669> shift<00:03:20.879> out

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.440 
basically they were just trying to feel
the<00:05:11.070> entire<00:05:11.370> game<00:05:11.550> because<00:05:11.850> their<00:05:12.030> sean<00:05:12.240> is

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
the entire game because their sean is

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.810 
the entire game because their sean is
running<00:05:12.720> out<00:05:12.810> and<00:05:12.960> open<00:05:13.320> and<00:05:13.560> so<00:05:14.490> obvious<00:05:14.700> is

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
running out and open and so obvious is

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.920 
running out and open and so obvious is
something<00:05:15.150> that<00:05:15.240> you<00:05:15.360> don't<00:05:15.480> want<00:05:15.660> to<00:05:15.720> do<00:05:15.780> is<00:05:15.900> a

something that you don't want to do is a

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.690

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
should have known this but basically

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.100 
should have known this but basically
what<00:06:14.940> we're<00:06:15.090> going<00:06:15.180> to<00:06:15.270> do<00:06:15.480> is<00:06:15.750> we're<00:06:15.960> going<00:06:16.050> to

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.110 
what we're going to do is we're going to
get<00:06:16.230> the<00:06:16.410> rogue<00:06:16.650> and<00:06:16.950> the<00:06:17.010> Warlock<00:06:17.370> in<00:06:17.640> the<00:06:17.730> CC

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
get the rogue and the Warlock in the CC

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.820 
get the rogue and the Warlock in the CC
and<00:06:18.330> once<00:06:18.780> we<00:06:18.930> can<00:06:19.080> do<00:06:19.230> that<00:06:19.440> we're<00:06:19.650> going<00:06:19.740> to

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
and once we can do that we're going to

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.650 
and once we can do that we're going to
go<00:06:19.920> really<00:06:20.220> hard<00:06:20.550> on<00:06:20.640> the<00:06:20.760> shaman<00:06:21.120> with<00:06:21.240> all<00:06:21.420> of

our cooldowns that's basically our

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.880 
our cooldowns that's basically our
general<00:06:23.610> strategy<00:06:24.090> versus<00:06:24.510> RLS<00:06:24.930> so<00:06:25.650> here<00:06:25.860> we

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
general strategy versus RLS so here we

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.290 
general strategy versus RLS so here we
get<00:06:26.130> the<00:06:26.160> shaman<00:06:26.550> caught<00:06:26.700> in<00:06:26.820> a<00:06:26.880> bad<00:06:26.970> spot
