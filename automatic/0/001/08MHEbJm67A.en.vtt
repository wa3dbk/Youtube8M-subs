00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:13.750 
we're very impressed by the fact that it

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.570 
we're very impressed by the fact that it
is<00:00:13.900> a<00:00:13.929> unibody<00:00:14.500> polycarbonate<00:00:16.350> device<00:00:17.350> and<00:00:17.859> a

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
is a unibody polycarbonate device and a

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.550 
is a unibody polycarbonate device and a
very<00:00:19.119> very<00:00:19.449> sleek<00:00:20.340> glass<00:00:21.340> with<00:00:22.180> curves

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
very very sleek glass with curves

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.009 
very very sleek glass with curves
slightly<00:00:23.560> curved<00:00:24.210> not<00:00:25.210> yet<00:00:25.390> as<00:00:25.570> it<00:00:25.720> is<00:00:25.840> Gorilla

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:26.019 
slightly curved not yet as it is Gorilla

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:27.870 
slightly curved not yet as it is Gorilla
so<00:00:26.619> although<00:00:26.920> you<00:00:27.099> might<00:00:27.340> be<00:00:27.550> worried<00:00:27.849> that

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
so although you might be worried that

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.370 
so although you might be worried that
you<00:00:28.060> might<00:00:28.210> scratch<00:00:28.630> it<00:00:28.869> because<00:00:29.199> of<00:00:29.230> the

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
you might scratch it because of the

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.460 
you might scratch it because of the
curves<00:00:29.710> and<00:00:30.369> I<00:00:30.880> guess<00:00:31.090> is<00:00:31.269> that<00:00:31.300> this<00:00:32.170> is<00:00:32.230> not

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
curves and I guess is that this is not

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.680 
curves and I guess is that this is not
the<00:00:32.500> K<00:00:32.830> as<00:00:33.550> far<00:00:33.940> as<00:00:34.150> the<00:00:34.300> rest<00:00:34.480> of<00:00:34.570> the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
the K as far as the rest of the

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.450 
the K as far as the rest of the
technical<00:00:34.990> specifications<00:00:35.800> are<00:00:35.980> concerned

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
technical specifications are concerned

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.520 
technical specifications are concerned
it<00:00:37.270> will<00:00:37.450> be<00:00:37.600> available<00:00:37.720> in<00:00:38.410> 16<00:00:39.070> gigabytes<00:00:39.940> or

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
it will be available in 16 gigabytes or

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.930 
it will be available in 16 gigabytes or
64<00:00:41.530> gigabytes<00:00:42.690> memory<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.950> screen<00:00:45.670> as<00:00:45.910> you

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
64 gigabytes memory the screen as you

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.720 
64 gigabytes memory the screen as you
see<00:00:46.270> is<00:00:46.690> it<00:00:47.410> has<00:00:47.620> a<00:00:47.650> three<00:00:47.950> point<00:00:48.190> nine<00:00:48.280> inch

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
see is it has a three point nine inch

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.200 
see is it has a three point nine inch
diameter<00:00:49.420> which<00:00:49.630> is<00:00:50.040> as<00:00:51.040> far<00:00:51.850> as<00:00:52.030> we've

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
diameter which is as far as we've

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.270 
diameter which is as far as we've
learned<00:00:52.240> so<00:00:52.720> far<00:00:52.750> it<00:00:53.170> will<00:00:53.320> be<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:53.560> diagonal

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
learned so far it will be the diagonal

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.330 
learned so far it will be the diagonal
diagonal<00:00:54.720> but<00:00:55.720> the<00:00:56.020> a<00:00:56.050> new<00:00:56.380> iphone<00:00:56.800> 5<00:00:57.040> will

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
diagonal but the a new iphone 5 will

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.330 
diagonal but the a new iphone 5 will
have<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:59.260> can<00:00:59.410> see<00:00:59.530> that<00:00:59.680> it<00:00:59.770> has<00:00:59.800> two<00:01:00.160> cameras

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
have you can see that it has two cameras

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
have you can see that it has two cameras
18<00:01:03.340> megapixel<00:01:03.700> one<00:01:04.330> with<00:01:04.780> a<00:01:04.809> Carl<00:01:05.650> Zeiss<00:01:05.740> lens

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
18 megapixel one with a Carl Zeiss lens

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.740 
18 megapixel one with a Carl Zeiss lens
double<00:01:07.360> flash<00:01:07.630> LED<00:01:08.320> flash<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:09.180> one<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.450> front

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
double flash LED flash and one the front

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.620 
double flash LED flash and one the front
so<00:01:11.440> that<00:01:11.470> you<00:01:11.710> will<00:01:11.890> be<00:01:11.950> able<00:01:12.220> to<00:01:12.520> do<00:01:12.700> not<00:01:13.360> face

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
so that you will be able to do not face

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.510 
so that you will be able to do not face
line<00:01:13.900> but<00:01:14.200> video<00:01:14.530> calls<00:01:14.970> with<00:01:15.970> your<00:01:16.540> friends

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
line but video calls with your friends

it is a second phone in this world that

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.070 
it is a second phone in this world that
will<00:01:20.560> accept<00:01:20.980> a<00:01:21.280> micro<00:01:22.030> sim<00:01:22.210> card<00:01:22.510> the<00:01:22.750> first

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
will accept a micro sim card the first

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.500 
will accept a micro sim card the first
one<00:01:23.320> was<00:01:23.470> iphone<00:01:23.890> 4<00:01:24.190> of<00:01:24.340> course<00:01:24.610> and<00:01:24.940> it<00:01:25.330> will

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
one was iphone 4 of course and it will

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.750 
one was iphone 4 of course and it will
definitely<00:01:25.990> be<00:01:26.200> iphone<00:01:26.860> 5<00:01:28.050> it<00:01:29.050> runs<00:01:29.710> in<00:01:30.250> a
