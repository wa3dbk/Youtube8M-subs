such a good climber
two<00:00:31.320> things<00:00:31.730> come<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.880> mind

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
two things come to mind

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.810 
two things come to mind
and<00:00:33.390> that's<00:00:34.080> that's<00:00:34.500> power<00:00:34.830> and<00:00:35.160> that's<00:00:35.610> wait

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
and that's that's power and that's wait

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.820 
and that's that's power and that's wait
you<00:00:36.570> obviously<00:00:36.870> work<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.230> your<00:00:37.350> power<00:00:37.559> by

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
you obviously work on your power by

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.870

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
that sort of base level of fitness and

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.250 
that sort of base level of fitness and
then<00:00:44.370> doing<00:00:44.580> the<00:00:44.699> more<00:00:44.970> specific<00:00:45.570> work<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
then doing the more specific work on the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.049 
then doing the more specific work on the
climb<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.770> learning<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.670> able<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.850> sustain

climb and learning to be able to sustain

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.180 
climb and learning to be able to sustain
that<00:00:48.330> kind<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.840> power<00:00:49.019> then<00:00:49.559> obviously<00:00:49.769> being

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
that kind of power then obviously being

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.189 
that kind of power then obviously being
it<00:00:50.340> at<00:00:50.519> the<00:00:50.640> right<00:00:50.790> body<00:00:51.059> weight<00:00:51.269> if<00:00:51.540> if<00:00:51.989> you're

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
it at the right body weight if if you're

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.380 
it at the right body weight if if you're
carrying<00:00:52.410> an<00:00:52.949> extra<00:00:53.190> five<00:00:53.580> kilos<00:00:54.030> that's

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
carrying an extra five kilos that's

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.299 
carrying an extra five kilos that's
that's<00:00:54.809> massive<00:00:55.290> it's<00:00:55.620> absolutely<00:00:56.129> massive

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
that's massive it's absolutely massive

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.569 
that's massive it's absolutely massive
and<00:00:56.879> if<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.390> can<00:00:57.540> drop<00:00:57.720> a<00:00:57.780> kilo<00:00:58.649> win-win<00:00:59.340> when

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
and if you can drop a kilo win-win when

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.459 
and if you can drop a kilo win-win when
you<00:00:59.700> really<00:00:59.969> need<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:00.899> light<00:01:01.200> in<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
you really need to to be light in the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.990 
you really need to to be light in the
mountains<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.980> can<00:01:02.190> feel<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> huge

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
mountains you can feel it a huge

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.999 
mountains you can feel it a huge
difference<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.140> much<00:01:04.320> easier<00:01:04.379> to

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
difference it's just that much easier to

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.590 
difference it's just that much easier to
race<00:01:05.430> when<00:01:05.640> when<00:01:05.940> you're<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.149> little<00:01:06.479> bit

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
race when when you're that little bit

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
race when when you're that little bit
lighter

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
not climber for me it's suffering I can

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.440 
not climber for me it's suffering I can
train<00:01:19.980> in<00:01:20.160> and<00:01:20.370> I<00:01:20.550> could<00:01:20.910> get<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.300> bit

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
train in and I could get a little bit

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.750 
train in and I could get a little bit
better<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.230> could<00:01:22.470> never<00:01:22.710> follow<00:01:22.890> them<00:01:23.220> and

everything a co-driver thing but I would

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.480 
everything a co-driver thing but I would
never<00:01:26.850> be<00:01:27.200> like<00:01:28.200> cable<00:01:28.770> work<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.070> follow<00:01:29.280> them
