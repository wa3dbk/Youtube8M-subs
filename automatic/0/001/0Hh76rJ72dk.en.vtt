00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 bless you with the rhymes with 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.990
 love for me today because otherwise I am 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.450
 fantastic others less we all have here 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.429
 and two in one because this cake band from 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.570
 a part chiseled from the other neighborhood 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.570
 because we discover together 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:30.330
 yes here it is a talk b1 band huawei 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.260
 little bucks compared to other smart bands 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.059
 I have 2 here to make a comparison 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.090
 we immediately remove the bracelet in two 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.920
 measure s measures and measures the extent I 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.280
 l therefore having a small wrist ne 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.710
 it was great but let's say the part 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.079
 superior remains remains large and so 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.969
 even with the bracelet measures s because it is 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.340
 great because it integrates a headset 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.969
 bluetooth then you see possibility of 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.190
 call in total privacy and respond 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.960
 to calls directly from the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.480
 there is no bracelet in the package 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.450
 nothing but the bracelet is this 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.310
 this little box this sachet with 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.119
 inside two rubber adapters for 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.890
 adapt the auricle la 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.500
 the serious bluetooth headset 26 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.420
 bluetooth 3.0 nfc for perin with lo 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.770
 smartphone among other applications 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.979
 smartphone that is available for both 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.810
 android is for ios 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.100
 when to match between first time you will 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.689
 download an application update 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.549
 of servers and huawei not from the play store 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.650
 therefore you must authorize the phone to 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.290
 do this and unfortunately there is not one 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.509
 cloud data synchronization then i 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.400
 data that you will have on your smartphone 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.750
 they will not be transferred when 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.420
 you will buy another smartphone that 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.430
 you will use this band with another one 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.659
 ip57 smartphone I could take showers 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.450
 you can go there 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.220
 the bluetooth pool now and the battery 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.229
 main forces then clicking this 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.270
 button you go to see the steps 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.790
 made the calories burned and how much 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.040
 we slept between the other adjustment 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.540
 automatic sleep very very comfortable 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.520
 Convenient direct charging via USB 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.619
 we see him back here directly on the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.470
 bracelet then just thread the 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.290
 bracelet in a pc and in a few hours 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.780
 it recharges materials that lasts five 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.270
 days with intense use that I did 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.770
 so I used it almost as often 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.810
 bluetooth headset among other things when 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.940
 you are in the car you pair the phone with a 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.959
 earphone not regular but a speakerphone 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.849
 bluetooth 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.430
 the band is there, shut up and shut us up 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.989
 the call on the display but not 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.790
 interferes found on the display 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.239
 only notifications call not 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.129
 notification messages and other events that 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.599
 arrive on the smartphone 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.300
 but let's see the application 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.100
 then here eh 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.690
 the indication of the steps how many steps 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.880
 durations exercise those distance 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.640
 burned and percentage of goal that 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.370
 you can set it and then there's sleep again 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.290
 automatic sleep detection how much 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.000
 I'm deep when I'm light 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.670
 etc. there was, however, unfortunately there is no 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.640
 ability to change the time at which 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.220
 we are given a bed in which we got up 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.270
 if the band had taken over a 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.850
 incorrect data 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.620
 among other things you can here in the 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.160
 settings go to set 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.270
 the goal of both calories and steps 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.970
 activate the task reminder that 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.190
 what is the first reactivity when the band 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.640
 does not feel that we are moving for a 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.730
 pre-established interval from to cv 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.260
 good to say wave go for a ride 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.600
 regarding the debasement of 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.050
 people can activate it yes yes 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.760
 set the alarm time and the band 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.520
 automatically detects how we are 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.490
 sleeping is the right time for 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.230
 wake up in an earlier interval 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.810
 does not awaken that we are going to 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.270
 set a little like saber ap 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.010
 so much so to speak here are 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.450
 user information 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.170
 oh yes guys today to my birthday 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.910
 so wishes for me is up here 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.910
 indication of the connection between 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.680
 bluetooth and the battery level 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.740
 in my opinion, how precise this is 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.690
 talk band these are the data collected 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.830
 yesterday from the big beat flex that uses a little 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.950
 such as 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:15.370
 meter of comparison yesterday 11100 28 steps 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.459
 while the 6,386 talk band therefore 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.370
 significantly underestimates the steps it is true 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.490
 that feedback a 10 15 percent in 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.920
 more than steps you give them but here we are at 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.510
 half then a firmware slightly from 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.540
 review regarding the 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.280
 detection of optimal activity 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.530
 the audio quality of the two- ear headset 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.250
 two microphones for noise suppression 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.020
 feels very good 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.340
 what you like and what I don't like then 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.020
 instead the very fact of having a 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.450
 earphone always on the wrist to be able to 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.830
 respond very comfortably in several 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.660
 situations with a really recharge 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.700
 fast via usb 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.940
 I'm not crazy about design 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.190
 too big too there are not 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.260
 applications that go to synchronize 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.600
 the words burned with maybe what 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.390
 i eat i ever think fitness pal o 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.460
 however to similar applications the 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.540
 battery 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.480
 however he convinced me five days ed 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:14.140
 Intense use is not as bad as it costs 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.450
 119 euros is perfect for those who want to have 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.850
 Always have a bluetooth headset 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.090
 without having it in your ear pocket 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.730
 instead it makes a little laugh instead for a use 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.080
 I would say that fitness still needs to be refined 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.480
 software and above all I would be 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.910
 liked also justified messages 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.020
 whatsapp in addition to calls for hdblog 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.020
