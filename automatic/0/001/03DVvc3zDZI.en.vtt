up<00:01:32.220> see<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:33.030> know<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.390> said<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.960> Porsche

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
up see you know so I said in the Porsche

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.929 
up see you know so I said in the Porsche
mode<00:01:34.439> hence<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.950> why<00:01:35.220> it's<00:01:35.369> called<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.610> 3-way

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
mode hence the why it's called a 3-way

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.030 
mode hence the why it's called a 3-way
head<00:01:36.200> three-way<00:01:37.200> head<00:01:37.409> at<00:01:37.650> least<00:01:37.829> this

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
head three-way head at least this

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.530 
head three-way head at least this
particular<00:01:38.369> one<00:01:38.640> smart<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.000> call<00:01:39.150> it's<00:01:39.360> more<00:01:39.479> of

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
particular one smart I call it's more of

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.120 
particular one smart I call it's more of
a<00:01:39.570> hybrid<00:01:39.780> head<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.439> great<00:01:40.619> for<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.860> video

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
a hybrid head so it's great for a video

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.819 
a hybrid head so it's great for a video
it's<00:01:41.369> great<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.759> photo<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.560> want

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
it's great for a photo and if you want

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.499 
it's great for a photo and if you want
one<00:01:44.130> solely<00:01:44.490> for<00:01:44.759> video<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.090> definitely

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
one solely for video I definitely

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.630 
one solely for video I definitely
recommend<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.140> fluid<00:01:46.979> heads<00:01:47.280> there<00:01:47.549> are<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
recommend the fluid heads there are a

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.210 
recommend the fluid heads there are a
lot<00:01:47.759> more<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.780> longer<00:01:49.020> handles<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.979> there's

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
lot more that longer handles and there's

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.649 
lot more that longer handles and there's
just<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.640> other<00:01:50.820> fluid<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:51.390> not<00:01:51.509> more

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
just the other fluid so it's not more

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.719 
just the other fluid so it's not more
smoother<00:01:52.140> if<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.380> want<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.979> know<00:01:53.040> pan<00:01:53.399> or

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
smoother if you want to you know pan or

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.249 
smoother if you want to you know pan or
you<00:01:53.820> know<00:01:53.939> move<00:01:54.450> up<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.720> down<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.020> stuff<00:01:55.170> like

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
you know move up and down and stuff like

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:55.639 
you know move up and down and stuff like
that

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
that

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.410 
that
so<00:01:55.860> that's<00:01:56.009> definitely<00:01:56.159> great<00:01:56.520> head<00:01:56.729> there's

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
so that's definitely great head there's

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.670 
so that's definitely great head there's
nothing<00:01:57.689> there's<00:01:57.930> another<00:01:58.170> type<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.439> head

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
nothing there's another type of head

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.440 
nothing there's another type of head
that<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.829> saw<00:01:59.009> online<00:01:59.250> called<00:01:59.729> ball<00:01:59.939> type<00:02:00.180> hits

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
that I saw online called ball type hits

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.880 
that I saw online called ball type hits
and<00:02:00.750> those<00:02:00.899> are<00:02:01.049> great<00:02:01.200> for<00:02:01.350> photos<00:02:01.710> I

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
and those are great for photos I

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.200 
and those are great for photos I
wouldn't<00:02:02.189> really<00:02:02.280> recommend<00:02:02.369> them<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.030> a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
wouldn't really recommend them for a

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.389 
wouldn't really recommend them for a
video<00:02:03.479> since<00:02:03.810> they're<00:02:04.049> pretty<00:02:04.259> young<00:02:04.979> well

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
video since they're pretty young well

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.889 
video since they're pretty young well
this<00:02:05.700> way<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.909> like<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.210> tribute<00:02:06.479> ones<00:02:06.630> because

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
this way I like the tribute ones because

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.300 
this way I like the tribute ones because
it's<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> lot<00:02:07.140> more<00:02:07.259> stabilized<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.069> we<00:02:08.160> just

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
it's a lot more stabilized and we just

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.710 
it's a lot more stabilized and we just
only<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.610> only<00:02:08.789> move<00:02:09.000> three<00:02:09.300> ways<00:02:09.450> with<00:02:09.660> a

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
only it can only move three ways with a

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.889 
only it can only move three ways with a
ball<00:02:09.959> head<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.289> can<00:02:10.410> move

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
ball head it can move

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.899 
ball head it can move
and<00:02:11.409> if<00:02:11.829> you<00:02:11.920> screw<00:02:12.159> up<00:02:12.220> you<00:02:12.430> can<00:02:12.549> have<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.730> video

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909 
and if you screw up you can have a video

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.490 
and if you screw up you can have a video
slanted<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:13.599> that's<00:02:13.720> not<00:02:13.900> gonna<00:02:14.019> look<00:02:14.170> nice<00:02:14.349> so

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
slanted so that's not gonna look nice so

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.319 
slanted so that's not gonna look nice so
that's<00:02:14.650> why<00:02:14.769> I<00:02:14.799> like<00:02:15.010> this<00:02:15.159> one<00:02:15.340> here<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.790> ball

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
that's why I like this one here and ball

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:17.819 
that's why I like this one here and ball
heads<00:02:16.540> are<00:02:16.629> great<00:02:16.810> for<00:02:16.959> photos<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.620> course

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
video or fluid heads are great for a

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.039

this is plastic here though and then

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.539 
this is plastic here though and then
furnace<00:02:37.450> definitely<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.230> more<00:02:38.470> premium<00:02:39.069> and

brands for tripods anyways this is the
three-stage<00:02:43.120> tripod<00:02:43.900> actually<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.379> want<00:02:45.069> to

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
three-stage tripod actually I want to

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.349 
three-stage tripod actually I want to
have<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.430> in<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.609> second<00:02:45.970> stage<00:02:46.120> where<00:02:46.269> you

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
have it in the second stage where you

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.360 
have it in the second stage where you
can<00:02:46.420> unhook<00:02:47.170> those<00:02:47.409> two<00:02:47.650> clamps<00:02:48.010> here<00:02:48.099> and<00:02:48.310> I

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
can unhook those two clamps here and I

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.039 
can unhook those two clamps here and I
can<00:02:48.519> go<00:02:48.670> even<00:02:48.790> higher<00:02:49.090> but<00:02:49.359> I<00:02:49.389> think<00:02:49.690> this<00:02:49.840> is<00:02:50.019> a

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
can go even higher but I think this is a

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.379 
can go even higher but I think this is a
high<00:02:50.739> enough<00:02:50.950> for<00:02:51.129> me<00:02:51.280> for<00:02:51.730> what<00:02:51.879> it<00:02:52.000> is<00:02:52.030> but

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
high enough for me for what it is but

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.149 
high enough for me for what it is but
anyway<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.530> yeah<00:02:53.739> it's<00:02:53.859> an<00:02:53.950> all-metal

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
anyway so yeah it's an all-metal

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.229 
anyway so yeah it's an all-metal
construction<00:02:54.340> which<00:02:54.849> is<00:02:54.940> pretty<00:02:55.150> awesome

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
greatest because you're fairly flimsy

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.920

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
with this tripod home you can also set

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.450 
with this tripod home you can also set
this<00:04:23.169> in<00:04:23.380> two<00:04:23.560> different<00:04:23.590> angle

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
this in two different angle

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.650 
this in two different angle
so<00:04:24.550> you<00:04:24.610> can<00:04:24.729> most<00:04:24.940> technically<00:04:25.270> you<00:04:25.389> can<00:04:25.479> set

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
so you can most technically you can set

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.689 
so you can most technically you can set
this<00:04:25.750> out<00:04:25.930> to<00:04:26.050> any<00:04:26.199> angle<00:04:26.410> but<00:04:27.100> there's<00:04:27.550> these

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
this out to any angle but there's these

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.610 
this out to any angle but there's these
little<00:04:28.030> clamps<00:04:28.240> here<00:04:28.600> and<00:04:28.810> you<00:04:29.259> can<00:04:29.350> set<00:04:29.500> this

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
little clamps here and you can set this

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.249 
little clamps here and you can set this
a<00:04:29.680> to<00:04:29.949> stabilized<00:04:30.460> angle<00:04:30.910> so<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.330> one<00:04:31.479> is<00:04:31.720> like

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
a to stabilized angle so the one is like

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:33.629 
a to stabilized angle so the one is like
this<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:32.740> other<00:04:32.860> one<00:04:33.039> is<00:04:33.250> a<00:04:33.310> more

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
this and the other one is a more

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.370 
this and the other one is a more
downward<00:04:33.970> angle<00:04:34.419> so<00:04:34.599> it's<00:04:34.720> great<00:04:34.870> for<00:04:34.900> macro

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
downward angle so it's great for macro

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.290 
downward angle so it's great for macro
shots<00:04:35.620> or<00:04:35.770> something<00:04:35.800> like<00:04:36.039> that<00:04:36.099> but<00:04:36.880> yeah

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
shots or something like that but yeah

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.580 
shots or something like that but yeah

all<00:05:50.320> the<00:05:50.440> way<00:05:50.530> in<00:05:50.710> because<00:05:50.949> if<00:05:51.310> it<00:05:51.430> isn't<00:05:51.550> you

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
all the way in because if it isn't you

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:52.980 
all the way in because if it isn't you
can<00:05:51.880> knock<00:05:52.120> your<00:05:52.270> camera<00:05:52.509> over<00:05:52.690> which<00:05:52.870> I

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
can knock your camera over which I

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.649 
can knock your camera over which I
almost<00:05:53.590> done<00:05:53.919> so<00:05:54.460> just<00:05:54.520> keep<00:05:54.909> in<00:05:55.030> mind<00:05:55.060> that<00:05:55.419> so

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:55.659 
almost done so just keep in mind that so

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:58.290 
almost done so just keep in mind that so
just<00:05:55.719> you<00:05:56.139> know<00:05:56.259> yeah<00:05:56.680> just<00:05:57.009> watch<00:05:57.159> that<00:05:57.430> not

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
just you know yeah just watch that not

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.879 
just you know yeah just watch that not
the<00:05:58.419> most<00:05:58.570> this<00:05:58.960> clamp<00:05:59.289> here<00:05:59.380> is<00:05:59.500> not<00:05:59.560> my<00:05:59.710> most

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
the most this clamp here is not my most

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:01.110 
the most this clamp here is not my most
favorite<00:06:00.219> thing<00:06:00.370> because<00:06:00.610> the<00:06:00.699> screw<00:06:00.940> hole

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
favorite thing because the screw hole

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.240 
favorite thing because the screw hole
that<00:06:01.300> screws<00:06:01.509> into<00:06:01.659> the<00:06:01.930> camera<00:06:02.320> you<00:06:02.889> need

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
that screws into the camera you need

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.800 
that screws into the camera you need
like<00:06:03.460> a<00:06:03.490> quarter<00:06:04.000> or<00:06:04.240> something<00:06:04.389> like<00:06:04.599> that

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
like a quarter or something like that

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.050 
like a quarter or something like that
because<00:06:05.050> there's<00:06:05.469> no<00:06:05.680> space<00:06:06.669> for<00:06:06.820> your

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
because there's no space for your

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.310 
because there's no space for your
fingers<00:06:07.360> to<00:06:07.449> actually<00:06:07.690> twist<00:06:07.780> it<00:06:07.990> yourself

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
fingers to actually twist it yourself

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.249 
fingers to actually twist it yourself
which<00:06:08.469> kind<00:06:08.680> of<00:06:08.770> sucks<00:06:09.039> but<00:06:09.400> I<00:06:09.870> think<00:06:10.870> yeah

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259 
which kind of sucks but I think yeah

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:12.959 
which kind of sucks but I think yeah
