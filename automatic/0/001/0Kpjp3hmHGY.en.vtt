00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 very first fitness cooking school I come 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.440
 straight from the workout today poor training 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.719
 and a bit of a neck workout 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.750
 In any case, there are more common ones today 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:17.880
 a delicious new recipe and that 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:22.529
 We cook salmon wild salmon costs two 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.869
 euro 80 at lidl with tomatoes as in 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.740
 tomato onions in the pan 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.250
 seared 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.099
 in combination with Brussels sprouts super low 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.719
 carb a meal under four euros 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.110
 how this works I show you 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.110
 right now 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.650
 come to the first step first 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.930
 Of course you have to if you have the 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.850
 Buy cauliflower fresh you can 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.100
 of course from the danger of the 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.870
 Buy freezer if you are fresh 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.059
 do you buy it you have to do it relatively fast 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.370
 use up and that works 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.680
 like this you have this one here 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.530
 cauliflower and usually they still have 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.940
 a little go on already 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.040
 registered page 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:09.070
 that means you cut your head and 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:13.750
 then just shoot the outside of the 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:18.039
 first 12 34 sheets down so you 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.830
 in the end, only the beautiful 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.229
 clean cauliflower hastily shows it all 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.369
 short time the camera 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:31.140
 So he sees from below as I said 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.460
 Can you do the style for a TV 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.009
 then you have the whole thing in the end 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:41.720
 so out and then he is finished many pot 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.950
 that means you take a pot 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.950
 [Music] 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.670
 [Music] 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.030
 live, so to speak, directly with cooking 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.360
 first the head 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.869
 pot the head of the pot fuller 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.909
 water and make the flowers with 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.950
 cauliflower pure and you do of course 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.690
 then put as much as you like to have 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.160
 by that if you course for two persons 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.319
 then of course you do a little bit 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.970
 more pure 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.450
 And because a person cooks for that 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.730
 of course only for you little hint 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.970
 from the professional so to speak h 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.430
 and best of all, set your time 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:29.230
 and down because the world is the one 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.720
 big bunch of cauliflower is sprouts 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.040
 sorry is the whole of cauliflower and 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.930
 brussels sprouts then have 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.540
 you can just say it will take off 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.040
 so again in the bio-waste is natural 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.959
 a little bit simpler so go ahead 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.780
 the third diligently lay the net for you 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.569
 is learning and the pot is plump 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.580
 filled with delicious Brussels sprouts 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.400
 Now I'm still in the pot 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.980
 before it begins 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:02.860
 about one to two tablespoons or 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.600
 Teaspoon salt with it pure at the time 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.340
 do not cook the taste too 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:11.670
 a little salty on top of it 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:16.410
 and off to simmer in the time where the 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.820
 brussels sprouts or bought by 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.720
 Can you ever get the salmon 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.890
 to prepare 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.650
 that means it's nice here 24 left 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.670
 250 grams and 100 grams contain 20 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.180
 protein 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:37.480
 So I'm counting the whole time 25 are 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:39.730
 There are 40 and 50 round about 50 grams 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.519
 protein what you 're in there so is one 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.359
 right white borbeck and you can 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:48.700
 Of course sometimes even the onions 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.450
 and the garlic ever small 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.010
 to cut 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.989
 as well as tomatoes 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.209
 the cherry tomatoes have just four 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.010
 share when the big tomato has 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.930
 Quick to see dice when the tomatoes 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.239
 onions and garlic cut into small pieces 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.989
 you can do that now 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.579
 salmon fillet salt and pepper and each 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.500
 What spices are you after ? 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.150
 like to have it on but also want 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.049
 I still season with these spices 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.920
 I have so Italian 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.480
 herbal mix 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.699
 that means I do not start first 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:28.340
 more salt could be generously appointed 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:29.389
 then have a page then cousin then 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.979
 So here I am an Italian 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.270
 herbal mixtures there are cases 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.600
 it would not have to look everywhere in the world 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:42.350
 Supermarket because I have something else 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:44.660
 it once then apply now you have 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.570
 let's test if he's done or already 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.020
 I cut a ruse like that 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:57.949
 best on in two halves and on 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:58.430
 he tasted white is very good 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.830
 Super 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:07.910
 that means we can fish now 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:10.160
 Now just pick up the Brussels sprouts 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:14.330
 the other plate turns it on 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.669
 small flame now you need panic 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.820
 on the titanic your pan puts this 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.080
 on the plate fully on full throttle 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:27.919
 then fill a bit of olive oil there 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:30.620
 pure and wait until the olive oil 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.310
 it takes about 10 to 20 hours to heat it up 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.110
 seconds 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.810
 the tomatoes are neat 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.120

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.590
 [Music] 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.490
 then you can now the onions and 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.490
 add the garlic 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.160
 there you have to 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.930
 spice up the whole thing a bit 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.930
 again just a bit of salt pepper 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:09.170
 and gladly again with local herbs 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.190
 if you do not have italian herbs 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.840

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:41.430
