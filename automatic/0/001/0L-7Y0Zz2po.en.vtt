charger and watch it drop from 100 to 99

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.729 
charger and watch it drop from 100 to 99
percent<00:00:28.279> and<00:00:28.970> I<00:00:29.059> could<00:00:29.300> do<00:00:29.509> just<00:00:30.470> a<00:00:30.529> couple

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:30.739 
percent and I could do just a couple

logging<00:00:34.250> on<00:00:34.340> your<00:00:34.489> Facebook<00:00:35.000> and<00:00:35.300> maybe

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
logging on your Facebook and maybe

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.050 
logging on your Facebook and maybe
playing<00:00:35.990> a<00:00:36.110> quick<00:00:36.260> game<00:00:36.380> and<00:00:37.370> I<00:00:37.520> could<00:00:37.700> do<00:00:37.880> all

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.060 
playing a quick game and I could do all

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.120 
playing a quick game and I could do all
of<00:00:38.090> that<00:00:38.420> within<00:00:38.630> like<00:00:38.900> a<00:00:38.930> 15<00:00:39.380> minute<00:00:39.680> span<00:00:39.890> and

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
of that within like a 15 minute span and

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.840 
of that within like a 15 minute span and
my<00:00:40.250> phone<00:00:40.520> would<00:00:40.790> be<00:00:40.820> down<00:00:41.380> to<00:00:42.380> almost<00:00:42.590> 80%<00:00:42.980> so

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
my phone would be down to almost 80% so

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.460

ridiculous and I was doing a little
searching<00:00:48.740> around<00:00:49.130> and<00:00:49.280> coming<00:00:49.430> to<00:00:49.550> find<00:00:49.700> out

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
searching around and coming to find out

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.590
