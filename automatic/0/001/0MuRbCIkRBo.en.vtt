00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.060
 hello everyone though I was leakspin yes 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.530
 finally the new one has come out in Spain 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.140
 collection of collectible letters of 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.420
 pokemon and good for a long time 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.160
 I wanted to get it you know you have the 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.680
 letters the english version it has come out 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.050
 a version previously among the 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.450
 next decide if it gives a picture soros 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.880
 there was another collection what happens is that 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.400
 never came out in Spain so they took out 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.470
 that version only in that collection only 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.050
 has come out in the English version of 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.750
 card game and the Spanish ones so if 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.609
 well they also highlighted what is 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.910
 majestic that came 7 with 6 walter in the 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:48.910
 sexual drone in english so so who 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.629
 I have three packages here in theory, 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:57.329
 he had bought and camped five but 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.329
 good as these are those are packages 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:04.059
 examples and well let's make those 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.310
 of those packages and in jags so 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.240
 so much I think they are 12 and the trick of 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.240
 letters are 12 and then 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.040
 that is to drink only from jolÃ³ if we have 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.770
 luck let's give it already at first 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.870
 we have here this action-based 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.670
 cane 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.130
 to see about all 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.479
 and we can do it well better not to know 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.479
 I still believe 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.210
 we know better so you can save the 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.670
 envelopes 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.420
 and there comes 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.030
 the usual code we're going to do the 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.280
 trick 12 and the data have to be 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:48.759
 these if I'm not wrong it has to be 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.640
 that we have an achievement the island with a 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:55.860
 Condor 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.650
 a droplet a tall and a books 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.720
 with durant 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.700
 a bad act this letter I like a lot 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:09.979
 dislike in all the letters here 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:13.460
 we have a blog that is not bad and here 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.680
 we have wet in these verses and 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.090
 we will look at the trick of his girlfriend of 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.590
 fixer articles a common and it's youtube 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.020
 It's not a game, but I invented the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.220
 letter let's leave you here we're going 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:32.410
 to put as it came and then what 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.430
 I give therefore sorting according to 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.430
 If they are new 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.260
 let's go to the next one we have here exposes 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.630
 I said tina and latina go where I never 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:49.200
 liked it 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:50.770
 let's see if we have this level in the 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.110
 trash 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.460
 the code everywhere we're going to do 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.400
 directly because I do not know what it is like 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:04.900
 that the widget 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:06.530
 aaron wolff world pixels is a white 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.050
 cool 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.250
 you start a bucket and I love it and then 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.810
 we have those of a common and 12 objects by 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.630
 I love this letter, especially 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.180
 you ended up really well we're going to put 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.560
 again as they were as it came 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.060
 as I said earlier and only 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.270
 There are some but I do not touch an eye 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.270
 states, nothing, I already know things 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:37.620
 things are going last action 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:48.389
 let's do to open if we can 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:48.389
 if it 's outside 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:57.960
 I do not know if it's three or three 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:03.720
 to see if that works, let's see if you go 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:05.060
 blind that flower more crowd calls me 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.900
 love 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:12.049
 with sun and is also very pretty and brawn 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.209
 we have a heaven upon receiving our 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.850
 times a virus and our age is one more 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:20.180
 deadly and then for the letter also not 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.560
 I'm far from sad because I do not 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.479
 touches none just because I do not have 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.430
 none as it says earlier so 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.539
 nothing girls we have left here that you 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.910
 I liked it and soon you will see 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.410
 the boxing of the box aware once I've 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.900
 order that is going to possibly get like this 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.160
 that nothing we leave you here I hope that you 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.449
