00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
it off I actually prefer NC settings

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.070 
it off I actually prefer NC settings
because<00:04:11.520> it<00:04:11.850> blend<00:04:12.180> very<00:04:12.420> well<00:04:12.540> into<00:04:12.870> the

because it blend very well into the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.260 
because it blend very well into the
notification<00:04:13.740> center<00:04:14.220> so<00:04:14.820> that<00:04:14.850> it<00:04:15.090> does<00:04:15.240> not

notification center so that it does not
stuck<00:04:15.810> a<00:04:15.840> liar<00:04:16.140> so<00:04:16.410> Tom<00:04:16.770> and<00:04:17.040> it<00:04:17.459> does<00:04:17.609> not<00:04:17.760> use

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
stuck a liar so Tom and it does not use

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.030 
stuck a liar so Tom and it does not use
the<00:04:18.060> additional<00:04:18.299> swipe<00:04:18.840> on<00:04:19.080> the<00:04:19.109> status<00:04:19.950> bar

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
the additional swipe on the status bar

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.099 
the additional swipe on the status bar
like<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.459> sps<00:04:20.790> I<00:04:20.910> think<00:04:21.150> however<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:21.840> does

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
like the sps I think however it does

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.330 
like the sps I think however it does
have<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.380> downside<00:04:22.800> does<00:04:23.010> not<00:04:23.160> have

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
have the downside does not have

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.040 
have the downside does not have
additional<00:04:23.640> toggles<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:24.720> you<00:04:24.780> get<00:04:24.900> you

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
like for example the sps i think that

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.720

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
like the qaul background application

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.150 
like the qaul background application
