00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
could see definitely something that I

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.330 
could see definitely something that I
probably<00:01:14.100> wouldn't<00:01:15.000> ever<00:01:15.150> want<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.659> do<00:01:15.840> again

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
probably wouldn't ever want to do again

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.690 
probably wouldn't ever want to do again
but<00:01:17.720> it<00:01:18.720> does<00:01:18.930> look<00:01:19.110> pretty<00:01:19.170> cool<00:01:19.700> definitely

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
but it does look pretty cool definitely

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.120 
but it does look pretty cool definitely
unique<00:01:21.000> different<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.810> feels<00:01:22.710> pretty<00:01:22.950> nice

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
unique different and feels pretty nice

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.520 
unique different and feels pretty nice

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.020 
also that's the actual color what it
looks<00:01:25.710> like

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
looks like

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.950 
looks like

could<00:01:40.680> be<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.829> little<00:01:41.070> bit<00:01:41.189> better<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:42.020> they<00:01:43.020> do

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
could be a little bit better but they do

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.330 
could be a little bit better but they do
hold<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.649> fine<00:01:44.390> then<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.479> also<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.990> the
