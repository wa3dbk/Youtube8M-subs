00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.000
 another video that still lacks water from the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.460
 channel free games own - room 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.640
 free games for the point with today one 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.520
 video a little different I'll go 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.800
 Talk about this game and son michael dodd 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.090
 number that I played and I know that this is a 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.289
 game that I and the Mayan David we created 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.949
 exclusively for this site here that 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.149
 is called coaching and here you can 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.550
 sell games in the sense that the person 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.710
 what to buy can publish where it 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.960
 however, it does not resell the product. 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:48.570
 game so here type a game screen 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.190
 this is a game screen that has a 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.760
 bit of description some 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.910
 features on two levels can be 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.399
 export to mobo the game in html5 os 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.530
 files include consultant 2's 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.159
 the code is all commented that they are 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.450
 some screens and if you click 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.200
 life predicted 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.260
 You'll have the game will have this screen. 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.100
 load here and focus on the game, right? 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.720
 he has two options more or less you 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:25.560
 here is the song that you can take the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.049
 volume if you want and if you will play the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.520
 What is interesting about this game here in 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.829
 reality was going to whoever is 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.670
 learning from you two would be very 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.250
 nice if you could buy type in 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.310
 reality our goal in making this game 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.350
 It was not so much to earn that much money. 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.659
 but it was more to test the market for 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.189
 see how the market in this style 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.829
 here it works and also because they 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.170
 were having a promotion a contest 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.170
 they were going to pay a premium in 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.060
 money for the best games and we 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.439
 we would enter the category of games 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.420
 educational 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.860
 The game is really cool, you have, it 's like 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.899
 It is played that I turned the volume on 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.829
 reality when you hit him too 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.709
 the 11 going like we have is that if 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:19.989
 You win everyone and can pass from stage 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.640
 some questions that you will have 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.040
 example is how do you go back 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.530
 to the home screen for 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.200
 children and we never have and never 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.689
 want to have a certain time to come back because 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.930
 you want to capture the child's attention 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:37.390
 maximum possible, especially if it has 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.459
 only one to five years and never wants 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.370
 let her choose anything the way the 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.540
 game is the way she's going to have to play 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.879
 it's better this way 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.000
 I have seen several educational games in these 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:52.359
 characteristics and some people even 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.180
 say that it is much better for the sense of 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:57.790
 that the child will not leave 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.549
 understood, will not leave the game until she 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.639
 End then that happens 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:07.810
 It happens that you will have you go 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:09.819
 capture the child for much longer and 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.010
 maybe even she'll be interested in 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.139
 play later when you leave 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.079
 End up here just for you to see only 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:19.780
 when she finishes all these with 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:24.790
 these accounts is that she will have the 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.409
 opportunity to be able to return his 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.810
 almost the last I'll do well 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:31.959
 but I know this bar is growing 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.669
 the food is going on there and on the game you 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.250
 you will be able to buy course will 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:38.680
 to see all the commented code right 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.760
 So when you hit the last one and it goes 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.770
 To leave with me, I'll let the sound 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.240
 you 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:50.520
 it will happen to listen he does not see a 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.550
 other employee different children 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.850
 joking talks and enem is you won and 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:59.910
 hit the game back there yes it's just now 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:03.030
 you have the option to click more or less 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.520
 again explain - now is that the 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.140
 character is a bit different and the 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.360
 mathematical operations are also 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.080
 different but most of the streets are 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.080
 almost the same 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.670
 so it's there I'll leave the link on 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.549
 description for you to see if 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.230
 you guys can buy 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.450
 If I remember correctly, I have a period that 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.740
 Can not return, I'm not saying one thing. 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.060
 that I am 100% but there is something that yes 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.650
 There is something that I do not really think 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.120
 that this is not just training you 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.790
 can it also have a section that the 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.680
 training not think I do not think 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.670
 can not not 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:45.120
 I created on the 8th Thursday, 16th, in the 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.680
 reality that on day 8 and only was accepted 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.570
 on the 16th 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.400
 had a lot of thing had to do a 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.920
 lots of stuff about that page 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.570
 than in relation to the game in relation to 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.510
 documentation I had to do is to 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:00.060
 documentation to look great and well 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.680
 easier for people to understand but only 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.510
 after they accept here are the 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.620
 inscribed annoying that you have already seen 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.630

 tip if you are interested if here a 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.170
 interesting game for those who are 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.360
 starting to learn to build two 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.840

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.310

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.870
 files are comment it is clear that the 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.880
 comments in the comments are in 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.230
 English because the English site 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.630
