other project purposes at the upper end

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.929 
other project purposes at the upper end
of<00:02:33.439> system<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:33.860> have<00:02:34.099> several<00:02:34.519> lakes<00:02:34.730> that

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:34.939 
of system you have several lakes that

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:39.159 
of system you have several lakes that
support<00:02:35.689> flood<00:02:36.019> control<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:37.239> water<00:02:38.239> quality

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:39.169 
support flood control and water quality

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:39.950 
support flood control and water quality
and<00:02:39.260> water<00:02:39.409> supply

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
and water supply

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.430 
and water supply
so<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.710> entire<00:02:41.070> system<00:02:41.580> has<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:42.170> take<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> look

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
so the entire system has to take a look

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.680 
so the entire system has to take a look
at<00:02:43.560> all<00:02:43.710> those<00:02:43.890> demands<00:02:44.730> on<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.120> system<00:02:45.300> and

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
at all those demands on the system and

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.760 
at all those demands on the system and
try<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.520> meet<00:02:47.520> those<00:02:47.700> as<00:02:47.910> best<00:02:48.150> we<00:02:48.240> can<00:02:48.770> during

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
try to meet those as best we can during

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.730 
try to meet those as best we can during
times<00:02:50.160> of<00:02:51.050> increased<00:02:52.050> flows<00:02:52.290> like<00:02:52.530> we're

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
times of increased flows like we're

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.100 
times of increased flows like we're
experiencing<00:02:53.400> right<00:02:53.460> now<00:02:53.790> where<00:02:54.120> it's<00:02:54.360> kind

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
of in the flood season that's not a

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.640 
of in the flood season that's not a
problem<00:02:57.630> because<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.900> got<00:02:58.020> adequate<00:02:58.320> water

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.500

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
but when you get into the drought

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.030 
but when you get into the drought
conditions<00:03:01.140> that's<00:03:01.350> when<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.650> problems

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
conditions that's when the problems

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.770 
conditions that's when the problems
arise<00:03:02.340> because<00:03:02.670> there's<00:03:03.150> just<00:03:03.600> not<00:03:03.720> enough
