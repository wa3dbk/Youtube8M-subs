00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.170
 In recent years, natural gas has 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.300
 been recognized worldwide as a 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.660
 energy with great development potential 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.150
 and overcrowding due to its abundance 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.270
 comfort and safety in addition to its low 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.680
 Transportation removal cost 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.440
 distribution and the low level of 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.720
 emissions that they generate in the case of 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.030
 chile are consumed about 2,300 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.940
 millions of cubic meters of gas 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.570
 natural to the year mainly in 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.930
 industrial use electric generation 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.390
 domicile and vehicular 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.710
 vehicular natural gas has been 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.810
 developed with results 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.420
 satisfactory in some regions of the 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.239
 country constituting an alternative 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.190
 innovative, more sustainable and less 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.760
 cost to nourish the sector of the 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.460
 transportation currently in chile exist 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.780
 vehicles converted to natural gas 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.010
 circulating through the streets of Santiago and 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.040
 Punta Arenas 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.160
 a positive impact that is already a reality 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.410
 also for northern Chile 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.650
 tocopilla is today the protagonist of 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.050
 an innovative pilot plan driven by 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.230
 sl the main electric generator of the 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.550
 great north that in conjunction with 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.700
 district royce has implemented the 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.520
 initiative called gn in the city 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.760
 later to be extended to other 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.460
 localities of the big north the 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.440
 mechanism is simple currently 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.810
 we have a gas pipeline network at 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.570
 throughout the region of Antofagasta 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.120
 distribution networks of natural gas 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.740
 located near urban areas in 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.580
 natural gas from the 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.080
 terminal of gn l located in mussels 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.030
 caters to these networks thus allowing 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.090
 the shape distribution chain 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.440
 continues to the end customers for 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.540
 the development of this pilot plan 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.660
 we have a supplier for the 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.910
 supply of vehicular natural gas as well 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.369
 the gas coming from mussels is 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.350
 transferred through the pipeline the 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.730
 regulation and compression systems 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.980
 fuel up 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.230
 of vehicles in the pumps located 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.870
 at the gn services station 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.739
 which have high standards of 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.290
 security in a first stage sl 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.200
 It has 21 vans with system 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.080
 bike is to say that you can use gas 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.480
 natural or gasoline thanks to this 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.670
 mechanism the vehicles do not lose their 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.040
 original condition and can use the 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.760
 traditional gasoline as fuel if 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.760
 well you want 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.250
 currently a group of taxis and 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.010
 collectives of tocopilla is a pioneer in 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.960
 conversion to the visual system plan that 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.440
 intends to extend to other 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.440
 localities 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.700
 innovate today for the future of chile is 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.770
 the premise 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.270
 the use of natural gas in 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.610
 vehicles will be a contribution in the 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.530
 development of cleaner energies that 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.260
 collaborate in the reduction of emissions 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.480
 to the environment 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.970
 all this as a product of a look 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.879
 go ahead in search of capable solutions 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.709
 to add value to the quality of life of 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.379
 the citizens and generate improvements 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.409
 substantial in the care of the environment 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.409
 ambient 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.750
 today is tocopilla tomorrow will be north 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.690
 big the bet is that in the next 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:41.620
 all Chileans have access to 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:45.360
 this is essential energy that in the gas 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.360
 natural is essential
