the chest lots of airflow pumping

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.039 
the chest lots of airflow pumping
through<00:01:29.759> there<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.390> back<00:01:30.420> side<00:01:30.869> as

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
through there and on the back side as

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.469 
through there and on the back side as
well<00:01:31.320> you've<00:01:31.890> got<00:01:32.100> adjustable<00:01:32.670> vents<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.270> each

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.280 
well you've got adjustable vents on each

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
side and this is actually a vent as well

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.050 
side and this is actually a vent as well
now<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.770> serves<00:01:37.979> several<00:01:38.280> purposes<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.939> can

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
now this serves several purposes it can

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.510 
now this serves several purposes it can
open<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> vent<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.650> exhaust<00:01:40.979> or

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
open up as a vent and on the exhaust or

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.359 
open up as a vent and on the exhaust or
it<00:01:42.180> actually<00:01:42.509> accepts<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.320> hydration<00:01:43.890> pack<00:01:44.100> so

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
it actually accepts a hydration pack so
