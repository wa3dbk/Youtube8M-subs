forever me personally in that situation

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.910 
forever me personally in that situation
I<00:02:48.120> would<00:02:48.540> have<00:02:48.750> went<00:02:48.870> for<00:02:49.079> it<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.650> know<00:02:49.799> what<00:02:49.890> i

I would have went for it you know what i

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.350 
I would have went for it you know what i
mean<00:02:50.040> i<00:02:50.099> think<00:02:50.579> that<00:02:50.819> right<00:02:51.090> there<00:02:51.269> is<00:02:51.299> a

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
mean i think that right there is a

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.600 
mean i think that right there is a
better<00:02:51.569> situation<00:02:51.840> cuz<00:02:52.170> if<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.920> don't<00:02:53.220> get<00:02:53.459> it

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
better situation cuz if you don't get it

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.240 
better situation cuz if you don't get it
I'm<00:02:54.180> very<00:02:54.209> close<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.079> end<00:02:55.349> zone<00:02:55.440> so<00:02:56.220> that

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
I'm very close to the end zone so that

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.670 
I'm very close to the end zone so that
limits<00:02:56.790> my<00:02:57.329> chances<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.810> being<00:02:57.989> able<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.319> clock

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
limits my chances of being able to clock

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.099 
limits my chances of being able to clock
you<00:02:58.829> know<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:58.980> can't<00:02:59.370> clock<00:02:59.670> for<00:03:00.660> yards<00:03:00.989> away

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
you know I can't clock for yards away

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.330 
you know I can't clock for yards away
from<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.530> end<00:03:01.650> zone<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:02.010> know<00:03:02.099> what<00:03:02.190> i<00:03:02.220> mean

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
from the end zone you know what i mean

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.809 
from the end zone you know what i mean
so<00:03:02.400> if<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.390> score<00:03:04.190> well<00:03:05.190> if<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.579> was<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.760> a

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
so if I score well if I was in a

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.640 
so if I score well if I was in a
position<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.329> other<00:03:06.480> guy<00:03:06.599> if<00:03:06.660> he<00:03:06.900> scores<00:03:07.319> I

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
position the other guy if he scores I

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.379 
position the other guy if he scores I
will<00:03:08.430> be<00:03:08.549> able<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.819> get<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.000> ball<00:03:09.180> back<00:03:09.329> with

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
will be able to get the ball back with

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.059 
will be able to get the ball back with
enough<00:03:09.750> time<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:09.959> be<00:03:10.139> able<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.349> retaliate<00:03:10.799> now

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
enough time to be able to retaliate now

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.160 
enough time to be able to retaliate now
I<00:03:11.400> have<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.880> drive<00:03:12.090> them<00:03:12.269> taking<00:03:12.569> time<00:03:12.780> off<00:03:13.019> of

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
I have to drive them taking time off of

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.270 
I have to drive them taking time off of
the<00:03:13.260> clock<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.620> see<00:03:13.739> now<00:03:13.829> is<00:03:13.889> releasing<00:03:14.220> this

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
the clock you see now is releasing this

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.979 
the clock you see now is releasing this
time<00:03:14.459> outs<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:14.880> felt<00:03:15.420> like<00:03:15.480> going<00:03:15.690> for<00:03:15.959> it

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
time outs I felt like going for it

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.050 
time outs I felt like going for it
would've<00:03:16.170> been<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.290> smarter<00:03:16.739> move<00:03:16.889> if<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.849> get

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
would've been a smarter move if you get

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.550 
would've been a smarter move if you get
it<00:03:18.209> that's<00:03:18.450> even<00:03:18.720> better<00:03:18.840> but<00:03:19.049> if<00:03:19.139> you<00:03:19.260> don't

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
it that's even better but if you don't

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.220 
it that's even better but if you don't
I'm<00:03:19.919> close<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.700> end<00:03:20.849> zone<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.780> know<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:21.930> was

I'm close to the end zone you know I was

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.990 
I'm close to the end zone you know I was
score<00:03:22.560> give<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.220> another<00:03:23.489> chance<00:03:23.609> to<00:03:23.910> score

of worked out for him you know he punted

of worked out for him you know he punted
he<00:03:28.919> held<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.190> two<00:03:29.340> three<00:03:29.579> I<00:03:29.780> get<00:03:30.780> more<00:03:30.959> than

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
he held you two three I get more than

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.620 
he held you two three I get more than
half<00:03:31.260> time<00:03:31.470> so<00:03:31.799> I<00:03:32.310> scored<00:03:33.120> touchdown<00:03:33.540> I'm

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
half time so I scored touchdown I'm

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.210 
half time so I scored touchdown I'm
still<00:03:33.870> up<00:03:33.989> two<00:03:34.139> possessions<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:34.859> still<00:03:35.099> going

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
still up two possessions and still going

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.740 
still up two possessions and still going
to<00:03:35.310> be<00:03:35.400> tough<00:03:35.579> for<00:03:35.639> him<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.849> come<00:03:35.970> back<00:03:36.030> you

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
to be tough for him to come back you

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.589 
to be tough for him to come back you
know<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:36.870> think<00:03:36.989> he<00:03:37.290> was<00:03:37.410> better<00:03:37.650> off<00:03:38.269> him<00:03:39.269> going

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
know I think he was better off him going

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.000 
know I think he was better off him going
for<00:03:39.630> it<00:03:39.959> let's<00:03:40.109> see<00:03:40.200> if<00:03:40.260> he<00:03:40.319> doesn't<00:03:40.620> get<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.829> I

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
for it let's see if he doesn't get it I

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.559 
for it let's see if he doesn't get it I
probably<00:03:41.489> would<00:03:41.760> have<00:03:41.819> scored<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.150> one<00:03:42.299> or<00:03:42.419> two

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
probably would have scored a one or two

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.870 
probably would have scored a one or two
plays<00:03:42.889> he<00:03:43.889> would<00:03:44.040> have<00:03:44.190> enough<00:03:44.459> time<00:03:44.639> to<00:03:44.700> be

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
plays he would have enough time to be

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.180 
plays he would have enough time to be
able<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.090> drive<00:03:45.209> down<00:03:45.540> field<00:03:45.870> maybe<00:03:46.530> score<00:03:46.919> tie

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
able to drive down field maybe score tie

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.470 
able to drive down field maybe score tie
the<00:03:47.250> game<00:03:47.579> and<00:03:47.790> we're<00:03:47.910> going<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.150> halftime
