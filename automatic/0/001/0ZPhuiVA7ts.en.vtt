00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.960
 e 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.810
 I previously applied 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.240
 aspirin as on where I 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.370
 go to ask the company so that the steve 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.080
 coll comes next I apply from the 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.390
 Vaseline on my fingers so that the top 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.850
 from call box to my fingers and I'm going 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.600
 go wax model you're going to key 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.120
 two forms of 2006 so a bigger one 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.000
 that water to make dao teeth and 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.930
 the teeth from below eventually I'm going 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.300
 go flatten the sides of the bite 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.970
 with me therefore have to outside as to 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.770
 the interior was also killed a stature so 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.479
 you prefer I advise you to 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.640
 keep your base line at your fingertips 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.640
 to narrate applied on your fingers for 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.650
 avoid that Vaseline cola vaudois and 1 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.650
 608 a little bit the shape 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.539
 now we will go and create our tracks 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.500
 of teeth with a bill doubled 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.049
 personally this is the step with 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.939
 which I had the most misery because 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.969
 that I like them to have a trace of 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.399
 really defined time so much better if you 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.259
 are better than me this table ah yes 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.270
 that's how I proceeded if you 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.429
 Have plums fluff left in the 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.729
 comments but in the meantime here is the 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:06.770
 method that I used personally 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.720
 by the way if you find that horses 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.849
 red males inside death is 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.530
 job is not painful 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.480
 everything and it's not an irritation it's 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.280
 really just because I was doing 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.890
 still strong enough to have a 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.819
 good place in defined but nothing 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.819
 grave and riad 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.299
 I go alone and all with a hairspray 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.310
 of wax it's important to stay that's 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.159
 in this product there before going to 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.440
 stitch the colors the fossa and so on 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.569
 and we can even apply powder 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:56.640
 free translucent from above to go 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:58.620
 remove the gloss effect but you got it 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.519
 finished the form we will go add 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.190
 a color 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.769
 firstly I use a black a crime 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.540
 with a brush to go create the 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.489
 depth at the edges of the bite 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.530
 to fill the center of the bite I 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.410
 am going to use a lighthouse a red crime 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.750
 dark now to go match and the 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.180
 outline of the bite with the rest of 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.980
 my mouth childish style to mix 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.640
 with a little worried look even from a 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.640
 greenish color 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.190
 we will now take the breast in 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.980
 part on the English brush and we're going 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.160
 applying them to the edges of the 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.160
 bite 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.880
 we will now use a cream blush 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.280
 a little more yellow around 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.990
 of the wound with a sponge to go 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.990
 create an infected wound effect 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.390
 we go back with our hungry red cream 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.070
 dark around the wound is 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:06.350
 again with a sponge for 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:08.450
 go to create a dried blood effect I 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.970
 turns with black mount for harry 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.700
 add depth precisely 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.700
 where I have the incisions debate 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.720
 and I repeat the same table that everything to 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.120
 time the angular peso with blood 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.800
 talk about it but this time more about 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.120
 the outside of the bite 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.970
 I now apply the liquid sense 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.430
 everywhere inside my death on to 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.690
 the inside in the borders we put 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.630
 as much as you want and the final touch 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.420
 my famous plastic sponge I have 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.640
 covered with that so it makes an effect of 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.220
 fifth tier all around the 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.110
 wound we apply as much as we 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.030
 Tell me personally I like it 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:03.150
 go strong but it's really up to your 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:05.010
 taste all were flat and here's match 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.410
 whose final ten years was worth a 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.830
 little bit everywhere in our neck and in 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.830
 our face 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.550
 this ends our makeup series 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.500

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.370

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.560

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.410

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.810
