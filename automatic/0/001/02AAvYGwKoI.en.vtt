00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:08.580
 youtube today we are packing the winners 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.719
 extension from that is an external 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.839
 USB hard disk and not from these 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:20.310
 genus are the hard drive from the 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:28.050
 actual external housing as well as the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:30.480
 good piece from good to predecessor videos 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:37.920
 Besides, that's not why I do that 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:41.460
 whole tool also two screwdrivers 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.040
 but no big one then in this one 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.910
 tool to express 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.910
 this lever 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:58.100
 thin fixed screwdrivers already three 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:02.030
 or four millimeters and then another 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.870
 scalpel around the whole thing 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.870
 to be able to open a bit 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:15.740
 The two thing and that we start there 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.520
 on the bottom where these holes are 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.100
 there when we immediately against this plate 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.810
 Press because this is all around 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:30.530
 First we have to open 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.550
 that is to say, you can do that 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:41.720
 the interlocking ones solve and 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:45.340
 then the whole also say it here 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.340
 has heads in now 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:07.050
 turn a bit and then have to 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:09.710
 you should these with the other tool 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.710
 come gap 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.180
 that's not exactly how long that belongs 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.180
 push 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.870
 that was pretty serious bad all 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.830
 the tools do not really need 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.530
 more if it works and now 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.930
 we have to see it in the best 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.190
 because you have such a board 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.350
 because you have to be careful that you do not 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.440
 but against this just pushes off 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:55.200
 My request to martin is only in this 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:03:01.860
 area one direction can be 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:06.660
 whole and pure if you see here 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.910
 offers that was easy on it must 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.740
 get a bit violent then work 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:28.050
 but beheads that relatively simply because the 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:37.880
 whole page on get the 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:37.880
 screwdrivers consume cawley 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.980
 that's how the good piece looks like 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.160
 you can see the brace go lightly 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.510
 unfortunately easily broken 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.410
 At least that is not possible 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.490
 prevent 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.870
 at least not as they are there 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:04.570
 wanted to open it all up 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:12.790
 you take out directly and there it is 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:18.630
 good piece then you can these fumes 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:21.370
 take off with the big screwdriver 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:25.530
 the bracket still unscrew 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:29.650
 a little further, find it relatively tight ok 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.550
 or not at least in the previous ones 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.550
 I always went on 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.919
 so 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:03.289
 screws solve the smaller one 

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:03.289
 screwdriver 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:14.239
 That's it! Now these slides are coming 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:14.239
 lift up 

00:05:18.049 --> 00:05:22.129
 That may be on the top too 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:36.150
 and there are already 18 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.660
 and you have a normal sata 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:45.480
 hard drive for a cheaper price 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:47.100
 there is no guarantee for this anymore 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.450
 now that can be another 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.240
 you want to install hard disk 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.970
 make sure that he empty this here 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.530
 faces perhaps sweats is where 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.350
 is not a problem but other 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.450
 locked you could contact it 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.010
 cover and short circuit 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.700
 That's why maybe a piece 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:07.430
 make paper between the film or the film 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.220
 Remove completely from the bottom 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:15.740
 otherwise I hope I have the whole 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.740
 helped again you ask imitation
