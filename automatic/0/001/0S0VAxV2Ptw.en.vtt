00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.430 
can see though I'm on the 3G right now
and<00:04:17.479> it<00:04:17.539> works<00:04:17.690> pretty<00:04:17.900> good<00:04:19.959> if<00:04:20.959> you<00:04:21.049> want<00:04:21.349> to

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
and it works pretty good if you want to

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.960 
and it works pretty good if you want to
stick<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.709> watching<00:04:22.039> your<00:04:22.159> videos<00:04:22.460> I<00:04:22.610> suggest

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
stick to watching your videos I suggest

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.370 
stick to watching your videos I suggest
you<00:04:23.090> stick<00:04:23.300> to<00:04:23.419> your<00:04:23.449> phone<00:04:23.780> on<00:04:23.960> that<00:04:24.169> because

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
you stick to your phone on that because

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.860 
you stick to your phone on that because
YouTube<00:04:25.280> you<00:04:25.400> know<00:04:25.580> tries<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.330> use<00:04:26.539> higher

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
YouTube you know tries to use higher

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.339 
YouTube you know tries to use higher
quality<00:04:27.440> so<00:04:28.599> therefore<00:04:29.599> it<00:04:29.690> takes<00:04:29.840> more<00:04:30.139> data

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
quality so therefore it takes more data

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:36.550 
quality so therefore it takes more data
to<00:04:30.470> pull<00:04:30.770> up<00:04:30.889> a<00:04:30.979> video<00:04:31.870> but<00:04:32.870> it<00:04:33.169> works<00:04:34.930> so<00:04:35.930> yeah
