the general overall shape and design of

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.890 
the general overall shape and design of
lipless<00:00:20.130> crankbaits<00:00:20.609> are<00:00:20.789> all<00:00:20.939> fairly

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
lipless crankbaits are all fairly

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.810 
lipless crankbaits are all fairly
similar<00:00:22.350> there<00:00:23.010> are<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> few<00:00:23.430> differences

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
similar there are a few differences

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.349 
similar there are a few differences
within<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.420> most<00:00:24.570> part<00:00:24.869> pretty<00:00:25.740> easy<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.430> tell

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
within the most part pretty easy to tell

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.259 
within the most part pretty easy to tell
what<00:00:27.570> you're<00:00:27.720> looking<00:00:27.960> at<00:00:29.150> there's<00:00:30.150> really

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
what you're looking at there's really

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.780 
what you're looking at there's really
three<00:00:30.689> main<00:00:30.990> differences<00:00:31.380> between<00:00:31.790> regular

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
three main differences between regular

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.670 
three main differences between regular
crankbaits<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.600> lipless<00:00:33.899> crankbaits<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
crankbaits and lipless crankbaits the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.170 
crankbaits and lipless crankbaits the
first<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.579> most<00:00:35.880> obvious<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.940> lack

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
first is the most obvious the the lack

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.660 
first is the most obvious the the lack
of<00:00:39.210> lip<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.500> lip<00:00:40.530> less<00:00:40.890> crankbaits<00:00:41.340> they<00:00:41.489> don't

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
of lip on lip less crankbaits they don't

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.049 
of lip on lip less crankbaits they don't
have<00:00:41.850> lips<00:00:43.190> second<00:00:44.190> would<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.550> shape<00:00:44.789> and

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
have lips second would be the shape and

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.369 
have lips second would be the shape and
the<00:00:45.149> action<00:00:45.629> third<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:47.760> overall<00:00:48.379> versatility

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
the action third the overall versatility

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.880 
the action third the overall versatility
and<00:00:49.829> fish<00:00:50.039> ability<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:51.410> lipless<00:00:52.410> crankbaits

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
and fish ability of lipless crankbaits

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.270 
and fish ability of lipless crankbaits
compared<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> regular<00:00:53.789> crankbaits<00:00:55.280> first

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
compared to a regular crankbaits first

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.779 
compared to a regular crankbaits first
of<00:00:56.399> all<00:00:57.680> lipless<00:00:58.680> crankbaits<00:00:59.100> obviously<00:00:59.640> do

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
of all lipless crankbaits obviously do

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.280 
of all lipless crankbaits obviously do
not<00:00:59.940> have<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> lip<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:01.170> regular<00:01:01.590> crankbaits

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
not have a lip like regular crankbaits

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.329 
not have a lip like regular crankbaits
so<00:01:04.290> what<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.500> means<00:01:04.799> there<00:01:05.010> has<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.159> be<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
so what that means there has to be a

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.250 
so what that means there has to be a
different<00:01:05.610> place<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> line<00:01:06.659> tie<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.990> go

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
different place for the line tie to go

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.190 
different place for the line tie to go
most<00:01:08.220> crankbaits<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.600> lip<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.049> where

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
most crankbaits on on the lip is where

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.020 
most crankbaits on on the lip is where
the<00:01:10.290> line<00:01:10.470> tie<00:01:10.680> would<00:01:10.740> be<00:01:11.010> since<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.820> doesn't

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the line tie would be since this doesn't

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.350 
the line tie would be since this doesn't
have<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> lip<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:13.650> line<00:01:13.860> ties<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.400> lipless

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
have a lip the line ties on lipless

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.520 
have a lip the line ties on lipless
crankbaits<00:01:15.840> are<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:17.159> back<00:01:18.259> that<00:01:19.259> kind<00:01:19.439> of

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
crankbaits are on the back that kind of

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.350 
crankbaits are on the back that kind of
changes<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.159> way<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> baits<00:01:21.060> are<00:01:21.240> going

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
changes the way that the baits are going

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.310 
changes the way that the baits are going
to<00:01:21.420> move<00:01:21.600> through<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.930> water<00:01:22.080> as<00:01:22.320> Wells<00:01:23.090> since

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
to move through the water as Wells since

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.719 
to move through the water as Wells since
crank<00:01:25.320> baits<00:01:25.500> have<00:01:25.710> lifts<00:01:26.130> most<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.580> them

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
crank baits have lifts most of them

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.550 
crank baits have lifts most of them
float<00:01:27.090> when<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.630> start<00:01:27.840> reeling<00:01:28.080> down<00:01:28.350> that

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
float when you start reeling down that

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.469 
float when you start reeling down that
lip<00:01:28.770> catches<00:01:29.159> water<00:01:29.400> causing<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.939> bait<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.329> go

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
lip catches water causing the bait to go

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.890 
lip catches water causing the bait to go
deeper<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.369> lipless<00:01:32.369> crankbaits

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
deeper the lipless crankbaits

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.630 
deeper the lipless crankbaits
overwhelming<00:01:33.900> majority<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.380> them<00:01:34.560> sink<00:01:34.920> so

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
overwhelming majority of them sink so

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.800 
overwhelming majority of them sink so
they're<00:01:35.759> gonna<00:01:35.880> hit<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.150> bottom<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.570> start

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
they're gonna hit the bottom you start

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.749 
they're gonna hit the bottom you start
reeling<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.259> baits<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> come<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:38.100> so

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
reeling that baits going to come up so

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.219 
reeling that baits going to come up so
it's<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.970> complete<00:01:39.270> opposite<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.780> regular

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
it's the complete opposite of regular

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.060 
it's the complete opposite of regular
crankbaits<00:01:44.000> another<00:01:45.000> difference<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
crankbaits another difference is the

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.399 
crankbaits another difference is the
body<00:01:47.070> shape<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.970> lipless<00:01:48.450> crankbaits<00:01:48.899> they're

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
body shape of lipless crankbaits they're

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.080 
body shape of lipless crankbaits they're
all<00:01:49.530> pretty<00:01:50.040> similar<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.670> mean<00:01:50.939> there<00:01:51.060> are

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
all pretty similar I mean there are

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.880 
all pretty similar I mean there are
subtle<00:01:51.570> differences<00:01:51.750> as<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.259> can<00:01:52.409> tell<00:01:52.619> but

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
subtle differences as you can tell but

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.899 
subtle differences as you can tell but
basically<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.729> all<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.060> same<00:01:54.290> but<00:01:55.290> one<00:01:55.909> key

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
basically it's all the same but one key

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.719 
basically it's all the same but one key
feature<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.689> local<00:01:57.990> strength<00:01:58.259> bait<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
feature of a local strength bait is the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.920 
feature of a local strength bait is the
very<00:02:01.310> slender<00:02:02.310> or<00:02:02.340> slim<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.329> streamlined

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
very slender or slim the streamlined

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.310 
very slender or slim the streamlined
shape<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.530> flat<00:02:04.890> sides<00:02:05.750> there<00:02:06.750> are<00:02:06.780> crank

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
shape the flat sides there are crank

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.820 
shape the flat sides there are crank
baits<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.680> are<00:02:07.770> flat<00:02:08.099> sided<00:02:08.750> but<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:10.619> is

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
baits that are flat sided but this is

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.860 
baits that are flat sided but this is
kind<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.250> standard<00:02:11.760> as<00:02:11.910> far<00:02:11.940> as

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
kind of a standard as far as

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.309 
kind of a standard as far as
lipless<00:02:13.590> crankbaits<00:02:14.069> are<00:02:14.220> concerned<00:02:15.319> what

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
lipless crankbaits are concerned what

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.610 
lipless crankbaits are concerned what
that<00:02:16.640> flat<00:02:17.640> sided<00:02:18.030> shape<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.810> skinny<00:02:19.140> design

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
that flat sided shape and skinny design

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.710 
that flat sided shape and skinny design
does<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.280> when<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.000> baits<00:02:21.180> being<00:02:21.480> reeled
