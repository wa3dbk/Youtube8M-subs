00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.640
 of this total 200 thousand choristers leader in color management solutions 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.840
 each pen application comes out well the angle but this decision was successful 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:14.909
 information 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:17.919
 hugged 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:18.900
 karzai 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.800
 versatile 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.439
 We're talking here at the factory in the store as you can see. 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.699
 here the factory behind me 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.039
 We'll check it out today. It's a little more about it. It's the steering wheel. 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.420
 formula 1 marked a 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.740
 all functions are all you need to know 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.519
 he practices more informed 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:40.730
 on what can a driver with the steering wheel and paulão do 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.870
 so let's go to this factory at the naval reception on May 1st 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.750
 to present 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.750
 all steering wheel functions 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.300
 to have health is great 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.460
 at the factory in argentina the pcp 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.370
 he is here in the steering wheel was a spectacle without citing all the 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.170
 functions that have schools that are 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.130
 it's a 2011 decision 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.120
 we came in with this one here with the yellow tidal wave here 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.880
 but it's called Beijing - I want you to get into the pit stop 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.189
 then played in the bout has been so great 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.469
 is the pec when rogério pedroso enters the box 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.580
 that's what those athletes that are here to say that you're confirming 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.020
 who will get into his pocket his mechanics can prepare 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.340
 here the landlord the button that is called man that is there 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.600
 The highlight is the drag reduction system 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.530
 so when you press the button here you have 100% with the case narrated 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.869
 held down 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.099
 the house will be activated 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.469
 So back here I need to intervene. 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:17.439
 which is a mixture of buildings also that three of these 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.769
 I have defended by defenders 33 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.339
 that would be difficult to enter the central people acted as a differential 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:27.959
 dubai it works that at the moment 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.189
 none that at the time of acceleration and output counts almost 100% and accelerator 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.189
 then No. 103 possibility 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.299
 jidá and have different positions and dilma 12 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.940
 - How you with your money will work to know what the position is 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:48.039
 that you 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:51.039
 he will normally use the pilots on the streets 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.299
 2 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.299
 buildings that already know that they already know very little 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:03.829
 depleted in May gets more fuel 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.239
 when the 7 catar on track 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.749
 so stop 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:11.059
 to improve performance during the race maybe spend more fuel 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:12.879
 located in penedo that 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.239
 they are looking at that moment 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.469
 as soon as I have more of an inter button for the pilot to have 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.829
 a tube that goes to the mouth here can be pressed what will come to play in the mouth 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.829
 to bring things that have 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.219
 on the other side we have a little button 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:35.989
 what is counted is the pilot 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.669
 want to talk on the radio and hit the button with the red light more I left here 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:40.879
 This side 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.649
 ef 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:44.359
 the person will power 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.420
 I was talking normally, then I have to go. 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.339
 press a button and not to deactivate 

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:53.409
 soon had been taken previously black bridge font arrives in protest 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:55.799
 want to push this neutral button 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.220
 then as if the pit stop has been so after 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.209
 if the guy 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.319
 Little giraldo you still can put first test 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:06.999
 this Achilles button 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:09.109
 it's a button that works together 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.059
 with a push of a button 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:14.609
 this kit that ceded many Palestinians 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.159
 that in the title are actually you have several positions that you can 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:20.609
 put an end to itself 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.770
 this button which is one to 12 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:23.620
 for example 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.449
 It was a lot of money during a meeting in Munich she wanted you to be a 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:29.479
 constant speed on the line 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.270
 carol 230 km - so 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.370
 then you will put in position 5 here he will speak 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.639
 clinton foundation is not because they are first five 75 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.639
 so if the note 15 700 central position 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:45.599
 is to score attack seven times 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.959
 one two three four five six seven that makes 70 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.819
 and here I feel seconds 3 the subject 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:57.679
 and with the confidence of that sack attack until today that you press mp my message 

00:04:57.679 --> 00:04:59.199
 rc 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.839
 is activated 

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:03.409
 then you'll have to have minutes 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.930
 with a mix it's actually the mix of autumn 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.250
 so as you want we want you to have fined him more 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.080
 aggressive little bike with a sound more 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.860
 fuel and which is a maximum of the superstrings 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.860
 the scenery changes the phoenix that's yours too 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:25.050
 authorized by water personnel 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.159
 character 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.749
 which provides motorcycle 

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:32.069
 so we have a great impact andy murray that in fact is when 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:33.330
 do you want 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.379
 is to change the braking aid not 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.009
 a car promoter 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.080
 then put the child in the truth 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.849
 she can change the recipe 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.999
 during this operation between other organs 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:50.370
 at the time of breaking the law also like the other positions 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.139
 can change it september 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.580
 a constant speed on the straight line it will look for which while torque and 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.539
 fined tata in that moment so he is surprised with the eldest 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.409
 if you have any problems 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:08.240
 are two infractions and knows the sector well if we can go wrong we are 

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:09.729
 facing 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:11.400
 twelve positions it 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.449
 touching tamaki plate 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:16.309
 that this button is here 

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:18.130
 change with a visual 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.569
 for example, you are also the highest punishment 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:26.659
 with a clutch lower than that of the pinocchio he actually prefers 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:30.309
 and also at the time of departure in sepang in the residence clutch 

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:31.889
 ef 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.889
 put the one you prefer more at that moment 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.199
 as soon as it has the atl that would be the engine turn it would actually be us to use 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:42.199
 crack 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:45.150
 usually using a very low free workout 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.569
 we heard 17 800 minutes only 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:53.129
 enter not spend much fought does not have the level of qualification to motorcycles people 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:55.189
 up to 80 there was pressure 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:58.949
 have some attention with Marcelinho because he's going to adopt a Watson tone 

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:02.479
 other intention 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:03.979
 a little pear button 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:07.309
 if in fact you can use in 12 positions 

00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:12.209
 those things that you can not stop during the race there was a lot 

00:07:12.209 --> 00:07:13.219
 qualified 

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:15.069
 if for example you have 

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:16.550
 a prize 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.139
 said he found an intermediary that worked for his staff 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:23.729
 are franklin martins besides the accelerator can not be 

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:27.439
 changing my mind have it 

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:28.839
 we have here 

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:34.659
 b pfff or ibiza with italy and in fact you will do know 

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:38.849
 is to find exactly the point with air clutch 

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:42.229
 so if you put here in position 4 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:46.749
 and then at the time of the start press the end button find exactly where 

00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:48.010
 there are four 

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:48.860
 he will leave 

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.529
 fully calibrated 

00:07:50.529 --> 00:07:53.889
 projection but if you want more information about this kind of subject 

00:07:54.539 --> 00:07:58.319
 you can enter the middle of the site www pontifex make that account 

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:03.319
 this minute the inter for up to a year and a half to give brait @ planetaosasco com 

00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:07.259
 where you can ask some questions that you would like to have in the next 

00:08:07.259 --> 00:08:07.919
 eight years
