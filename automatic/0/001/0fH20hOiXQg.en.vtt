let's see how the competitive unit
there's<00:03:06.390> on<00:03:06.510> us

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.470 

so<00:03:15.170> first<00:03:16.040> in<00:03:16.189> the<00:03:16.249> putting<00:03:16.519> guys<00:03:16.639> up<00:03:16.999> to<00:03:17.239> five

so first in the putting guys up to five

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.479 
so first in the putting guys up to five
times<00:03:17.719> more<00:03:17.989> durable<00:03:18.260> now<00:03:18.889> this<00:03:19.040> is<00:03:19.159> obviously

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489

what<00:03:31.469> we're<00:03:31.560> about<00:03:31.650> here<00:03:31.769> at<00:03:31.980> MIT<00:03:33.319> so<00:03:34.319> in

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
what we're about here at MIT so in

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.739 
what we're about here at MIT so in
addition<00:03:34.889> to<00:03:35.099> having<00:03:35.340> this<00:03:35.639> excellent

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:36.749 
addition to having this excellent

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.199 
addition to having this excellent
crazy<00:03:37.499> durable<00:03:37.980> fabric<00:03:38.340> we<00:03:38.459> also<00:03:38.670> riveted<00:03:39.090> the

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
crazy durable fabric we also riveted the

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.360 
crazy durable fabric we also riveted the
main<00:03:39.359> seams<00:03:41.000> so<00:03:42.000> I<00:03:42.030> think<00:03:42.120> season

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
main seams so I think season

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.490 
main seams so I think season
well<00:03:44.150> riveted<00:03:44.599> that<00:03:44.750> gives<00:03:44.930> us<00:03:45.050> up<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.260> four

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
well riveted that gives us up the four

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.110 
well riveted that gives us up the four
times<00:03:45.739> stronger<00:03:46.010> seems<00:03:46.459> than<00:03:47.030> the
