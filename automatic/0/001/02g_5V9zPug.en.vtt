 they said you are going to see the final ahead 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.780
 there are simply hundreds of missionaries 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.759
 They overturned the stadium box office 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.229

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.670
 pesos this represented for you 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.860
 this spending this is a lot of money 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.780
 many times they stop buying or eating 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.340

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.909
 this time we do not come that is worth the 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.640
 worth the expense of all we sacrifice a 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.920
