00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.400 
GoPro Hero 3 suction cup mount a little
bit<00:00:17.910> more<00:00:18.090> redesigned<00:00:18.660> than<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.990> previous

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
bit more redesigned than the previous

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.689 
bit more redesigned than the previous
model<00:00:20.150> primarily<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:22.470> base<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:23.010> flat<00:00:23.220> here

model primarily the base is flat here

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.650 
model primarily the base is flat here
instead<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.359> being<00:00:24.660> curved<00:00:24.990> like<00:00:25.350> before<00:00:26.660> and

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
instead of being curved like before and

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.179 
instead of being curved like before and
that<00:00:28.019> allows<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.260> little<00:00:28.560> bit<00:00:28.650> more<00:00:28.769> air<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.070> be

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
that allows a little bit more air to be

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.990 
that allows a little bit more air to be
pressed<00:00:29.970> out<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.390> suction<00:00:30.599> cup<00:00:30.869> giving<00:00:31.140> a

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
pressed out of the suction cup giving a

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.540 
pressed out of the suction cup giving a
better<00:00:33.000> suction<00:00:33.630> there<00:00:34.010> other<00:00:35.010> than<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.370> is

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
better suction there other than that is

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.920 
better suction there other than that is
pretty<00:00:35.820> much<00:00:35.910> identical<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.570> ones<00:00:36.750> before

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
pretty much identical to the ones before

does have your two adjustment dials here
one<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.230> bottom<00:00:40.379> one<00:00:40.710> up<00:00:41.160> there<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.879> course

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
one on the bottom one up there of course

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.209 
one on the bottom one up there of course
you<00:00:42.270> always<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.809> one<00:00:42.989> right<00:00:43.800> there<00:00:43.829> for

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
you always have the one right there for

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.270 
you always have the one right there for
the<00:00:44.370> camera<00:00:44.550> itself<00:00:45.079> but<00:00:46.079> very<00:00:46.800> simple<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.250> use

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
the camera itself but very simple to use

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.610 
the camera itself but very simple to use
you<00:00:47.579> just<00:00:47.610> loosen<00:00:48.329> those<00:00:48.450> up<00:00:48.510> by<00:00:49.110> twisting

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
you just loosen those up by twisting

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.299 
you just loosen those up by twisting
them<00:00:49.739> counterclockwise<00:00:50.930> that<00:00:51.930> would<00:00:52.050> be<00:00:52.309> this

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
them counterclockwise that would be this

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.520 
them counterclockwise that would be this
way<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.649> once<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:55.800> loosened<00:00:55.980> up<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.550> can

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
way and once it's loosened up you can

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.869 
way and once it's loosened up you can
you<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.680> bend<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.010> forwards<00:00:59.670> or<00:00:59.850> backwards

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
you can bend it forwards or backwards

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.420 
you can bend it forwards or backwards
depending<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.960> how<00:01:01.079> you're<00:01:01.320> trying<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.100> use<00:01:02.280> it

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
depending on how you're trying to use it

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.280 
depending on how you're trying to use it
the<00:01:03.030> other<00:01:03.090> things<00:01:03.329> he<00:01:03.420> comes<00:01:03.600> with<00:01:03.809> if<00:01:04.170> you

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
the other things he comes with if you

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.170 
the other things he comes with if you
have<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> mount<00:01:04.769> that's<00:01:05.220> set<00:01:05.519> up<00:01:05.549> for<00:01:05.850> GoPro

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
have a mount that's set up for GoPro

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.429 
have a mount that's set up for GoPro
camera<00:01:06.510> already<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.530> use<00:01:07.760> this<00:01:08.760> mount

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
camera already you can use this mount

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.260 
camera already you can use this mount
basically<00:01:10.439> all<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.740> do<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.820> take<00:01:12.030> this

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
basically all you do is you take this

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.350 
basically all you do is you take this
little<00:01:12.540> thing<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.720> comes<00:01:12.990> with<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.360> you

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
little thing that comes with it and you

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.899 
little thing that comes with it and you
will<00:01:15.479> attach<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:17.490> base<00:01:17.670> mount

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
will attach it on to the base mount

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.740 
will attach it on to the base mount
there<00:01:18.439> and<00:01:20.090> it<00:01:21.090> gives<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> little<00:01:21.540> bit<00:01:21.659> of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
there and it gives you a little bit of

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.630 
there and it gives you a little bit of
an<00:01:21.840> extension<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.439> your<00:01:22.590> camera<00:01:22.950> another

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
an extension for your camera another

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.070 
an extension for your camera another

thing if you wanted your camera to be
facing<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.470> different<00:01:25.710> direction<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
facing a different direction on the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.550 
facing a different direction on the
mount<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.490> does<00:01:26.670> come<00:01:26.880> with<00:01:26.909> one<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.210> these

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
mount it does come with one of these

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.370 
mount it does come with one of these
Universal<00:01:29.000> mounts<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.030> turns<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.689> 90

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
Universal mounts that turns it 90

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.719 
Universal mounts that turns it 90
degrees<00:01:31.880> but<00:01:32.880> overall<00:01:33.420> they<00:01:33.810> work<00:01:33.990> great<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
degrees but overall they work great and

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.190 
degrees but overall they work great and
they<00:01:35.729> say<00:01:35.939> they're<00:01:36.119> rated<00:01:36.390> up<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.509> 150<00:01:37.049> miles

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
they say they're rated up to 150 miles

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.730 
they say they're rated up to 150 miles
an<00:01:37.350> hour

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
an hour

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.130 
an hour
I<00:01:37.770> Drive<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.579> Jeep<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.240> therefore<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.720> cannot

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
I Drive a Jeep so therefore I cannot

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.530 
I Drive a Jeep so therefore I cannot
test<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.650> theory<00:01:40.890> however<00:01:41.759> my<00:01:42.000> father<00:01:42.180> does

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
test that theory however my father does

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.960 
test that theory however my father does
fly<00:01:42.810> private<00:01:43.200> aircraft<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.549> have<00:01:44.729> plans

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
fly private aircraft and we have plans

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.719 
fly private aircraft and we have plans
to<00:01:45.119> suction<00:01:45.810> cup<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> wing<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.009> see

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
to suction cup it to the wing and see

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.480 
to suction cup it to the wing and see
how<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.970> does<00:01:48.290> but<00:01:49.369> for<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> little

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
how it does but for a little

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.310 
how it does but for a little
demonstration<00:01:50.700> right<00:01:51.299> now<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.509> floor<00:01:51.899> that

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
demonstration right now the floor that

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.209 
demonstration right now the floor that
it's<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.799> obviously<00:01:53.159> textured<00:01:54.979> but<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
it's on is obviously textured but the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.450

off the ground and staying right there
the<00:02:43.380> smooth<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.920> surface<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.910> better

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
the smooth of the surface the better

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.740 
the smooth of the surface the better
it's<00:02:45.300> going<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.540> stay<00:02:45.750> such<00:02:46.350> as<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> car<00:02:46.770> hood<00:02:46.980> or

anything relative ly smooth if it is

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.000 
anything relative ly smooth if it is
textured<00:02:51.269> you<00:02:51.390> can<00:02:51.540> see<00:02:51.780> by<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.620> reflection

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
textured you can see by the reflection

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.710 
textured you can see by the reflection
off<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.280> this<00:02:53.550> wood<00:02:54.180> here<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.600> it<00:02:54.690> is

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
off of this wood here that it is

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.199 
off of this wood here that it is
slightly<00:02:55.350> textured<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.640> will<00:02:56.790> stay<00:02:57.000> pretty

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
slightly textured it will stay pretty

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.870 
slightly textured it will stay pretty
good<00:02:57.420> but<00:02:57.830> it<00:02:58.830> will<00:02:59.040> come<00:02:59.280> off<00:02:59.430> because<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.790> is

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
good but it will come off because it is

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.120 
good but it will come off because it is
a<00:02:59.910> suction<00:03:00.209> cup<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:00.810> as<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.350> can<00:03:01.500> see<00:03:01.680> it's

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
a suction cup so as you can see it's

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.949 
a suction cup so as you can see it's
holding<00:03:02.430> pretty<00:03:02.580> good<00:03:02.820> but<00:03:03.000> if<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.209> twist<00:03:03.600> this

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
holding pretty good but if I twist this

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.130 
holding pretty good but if I twist this
it<00:03:04.650> scoots<00:03:05.100> around<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:06.660> make<00:03:06.959> sure<00:03:06.989> that

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
it scoots around so make sure that

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.500 
it scoots around so make sure that
whatever<00:03:07.380> you're<00:03:07.650> using<00:03:07.739> it<00:03:08.070> on<00:03:08.190> is<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.510> really

whatever you're using it on is a really
a<00:03:09.540> flat<00:03:09.780> surface<00:03:10.310> now<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.400> take<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.820> back<00:03:11.970> off

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
a flat surface now to take it back off

straight up and that will release the

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.580 
straight up and that will release the
