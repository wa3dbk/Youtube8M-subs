00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.080
 self 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.080
 face face 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:15.329
 today we are talking about an 8-year-old house in the province of varese to be precise 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:16.240
 Gavirate 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.380
 here was realized what we were able to do on the whole 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.869
 of the new inefficient Italian buildings I have a can 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.740
 energy requalification with great benefits in terms of cost consumption 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.550
 for co. levels dublin 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.730
 casakyoto in the name of this interesting project which is divided into 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.780
 10 points or better in 10 moves applicable in their entirety I have only 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.760
 partially 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.200
 it was a house like many others 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.750
 with the usual cold problems 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.750
 best wishes humidity the very high management costs 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.330
 today the undertaker 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.970
 has been redeveloped 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.150
 and besides being of great comfort it does not consume energy 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.690
 but how can you turn your home into a closed house. 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.420
 the first move to make and the energy audit 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.460
 if stage of an analysis carried out using sophisticated tools 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.789
 technology to identify how and where the house is lost 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:21.210
 once discovered it is easy to intervene one at a time on each of the defects 

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:23.640
 to delete 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.830
 the second move lambarene intervene on the walls and on the roof 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.520
 weather 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.030
 you are not like a man when you take the second chapel 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.990
 lot even our house had to be properly data room so as to 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.990
 be warm in winter this strange summer 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.350
 this is possible thanks to the advanced technology of the construction systems that 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.280
 provide for the use of 100% reliable materials in terms of 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.169
 performance 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.169
 like breathable membranes 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:18.689
 the insulation also concerns the floor in contact with unheated rooms such as 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.689
 the cellars 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.700
 marsala the warm al fresco is not enough sand urchins cinema photo 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:28.459
 montage 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.750
 and this requires the third move to soundproof the floor of the building 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:35.719
 thermo-hydraulic systems 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:40.119
 the acoustic comfort of the interior spaces can be kept isolating the 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:44.719
 floor with floating screeds or using light technology 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.170
 dry easily achievable even on existing structures 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.500
 the rooms in the house are therefore quiet and peaceful 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.990
 insulating in particular from trampling noise and cuts 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.409
 exhaust systems are in fact soundproofing thanks to all 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:01.959
 stratified 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.809
 anti-vibration collars 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.809
 the drawers sound 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:10.889
 and pregnant traffic 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.379
 fourth gear 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.660
 to defend against external noise is essential 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.569
 window insulation 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.149
 the time fixtures and fixtures - still in the city 

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:26.599
 they must be made with new-generation materials fitted to order 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.289
 art to avoid acoustic bridges but also heat dispersion antispifferent 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:32.309
 air 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:37.779
 fifth move the glass insulation here we see the frame live covered with 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:42.899
 special films and cavity walls fill them with air-insulating gases 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:47.499
 I miss current levels of pollution in our cities 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:51.119
 how do we ensure clean air in home environments 

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:56.279
 ours is your sixth in controlled mechanical ventilation 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:57.809
 the purity of the air 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.809
 it is a fundamental element for well-being at home 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.239
 acasa kyoto a special ventilation system has been installed a 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.219
 double flow 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:08.889
 that recovers the heat of the rescue 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.879
 ensures you in addition to better energy performance 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.879
 even in the absence of pollutants inside the rooms 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:18.999
 if a house is truly ecological it does not consume energy 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.979
 what to say about the seventh move installations the solar thermal 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:29.400
 in this house the hot water is produced with a solar collector system 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.499
 because installed on the cover 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:36.129
 take advantage of solar energy to produce your disappointed health care without needing to 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:40.249
 use fossil energy in electricity with emissions savings in 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:42.430
 atmosphere and racing 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.160
 the eighth move is the hey joe damiani heat pump 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.199
 if a house is well insulated the heat exchange with the hey minimized exterior 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.860
 and it is therefore sufficient only the minimum of energy to heat the winter 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.309
 cool summer beer 

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:03.729
 the best solution if you have a deacons land close to your own 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:04.580
 house 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.580
 is the heat pump with geothermal source 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:14.680
 and then the ninth grip the photovoltaic system is installed solar panels 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.740
 on the cover 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.189
 that allow you to produce electricity by yourself 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:23.139
 just a few panels are needed to produce surplus electricity 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.139
 the electricity grid operator can be resold with an exchange mechanism 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.139
 advantageous in economic terms years 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.089
 tenth move 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:33.529
 home automation 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:38.159
 electricity so virtuously the product from the sun is finally controlled and 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:41.349
 managed by the home automation system 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:44.449
 with this system it is possible to manage the climate inside the rooms 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.429
 the ignition, the regulation, the switching off of all the appliances 

00:05:48.429 --> 00:05:49.979
 electrical 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:54.520
 thanks to this panel you can control all the appliances 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.000
 warm up and be sure not to forget lights on when you don't have them 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.169
 in home 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:04.360
 it can also be done remotely, for example when traveling by phone 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.159
 cellphone boh from the internet 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:11.489
 casakyoto is a concrete example of how it is possible to transform a building 

00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:15.080
 inefficient in 1 to 0 consumption pizarro emissions 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:18.260
 the solutions applied at home kyoto 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.310
 they are accessible and available on the market 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.460
 that allow access to the tax relief provided for the redevelopment 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.460
 energy 

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:04.579
