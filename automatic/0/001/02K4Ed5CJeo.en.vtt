00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.040
 yes hello you love here again 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.020
 Mr moment asparagus time is not only 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.420
 asparagus has so much time but has 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.189
 asparagus also shows what not 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.170
 actually hit earlier 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.910
 most of all it is disturbing that 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.960
 the asparagus either too far or too 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.910
 has been hard 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.739
 with the potatoes exactly the same 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.810
 either you have the potato ready 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.489
 or the save was finished 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.190
 thermomix is ​​a great option 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.040
 the whole thing really on the point and 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.980
 Although at the same time to the second 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.160
 have in the tennis hard place 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.400
 kilo of potatoes in the garden so baskets 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.900
 here a kilo of potatoes 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.270
 who does not see his people like that 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.150
 is possible for up to six so you 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.010
 Quite often, customers are the ones who say before they come 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.540
 in thermally at home have enough for 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.670
 That's even four of us 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.350
 to five so we have now always here 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.759
 roma 32 kilo asparagus so even in the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.220
 Economics is often to turn 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.530
 schnitzel is part of it 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.000
 one 250 grams asparagus so if we 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.509
 we would have to calculate here now 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.069
 Actually, you can do it yourself 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.960
 We would have eight portions 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:29.340
 asparagus and therefore it is really something 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.030
 and also closer to the potato 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.590
 yes i have calories now 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.850
 liter of water with sugar and salt 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.280
 a liter of water is already in it 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.179
 as I said just sugar and salt 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.490
 add 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:51.240
 There is no indication of quantity at all 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.889
 everyone via smart we have here now 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.100
 a bit of butter inside too 

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:58.459
 in content and now i am giving here 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.259
 just something true 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:04.469
 and as I said afterwards the sugar and a 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.399
 masters already so that remains now 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.850
 everything in here 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:12.569
 then come on first 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:16.709
 leaf körbchen comes down here purely 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.189
 so it gets stuck in the water 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.260
 lid attached 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:23.989
 nix measuring cup that of course right 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.879
 because he also brings the pile 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.280
 at the same time the swallows come 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.219
 Now here is always oma on top of it that is 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.989
 We also work two floors down here 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:37.019
 in the potatoes cooked up here the 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.419
 just close the asparagus 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.090
 putting the crown up here are too 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:44.700
 louvers and now quite simple 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.290
 35 minutes we switch 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.329
 ever first the thermomix one then 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.269
 35 minutes so once - then the 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:58.319
 Then press plus button 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:00.689
 we have to do it now, of course 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.129
 So we always work that 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.349
 actually always explains itself nicely 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.819
 also crush yourself why 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.129
 So then we really have constant 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.840
 Steam from below and have 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.449
 really the potatoes and the savings 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.250
 at the same time finished the whole 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:15.870
 Stage 1 and then we actually see 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.340
 already finished in time we came now 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.040
 Of course, who wants a few schnitzel? 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.680
 bread and fry in the pan 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.290
 roast or just really many 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.699
 yes, eat asparagus potatoes with the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.859
 ham and a little melted butter 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:31.169
 so those will be for those values 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.949
 so you are complete after 35 minutes 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.540
 finished 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:35.459
 otherwise you can just stop in the 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.750
 thermomix on the holland this again 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.590
 I'll show you myself 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.810
 other times 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.659
 I'll show you the result of the 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.370
 potatoes and asparagus in 35 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.370
 minutes and then we'll see you soon 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.200
 Spain finished and the potatoes 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.110
 at the same time as I said 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.150
 I'll show you one now and 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.500
 Of course, prepare again in valleys 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.879
 I have a role to do this yet 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.200
 I'll show you the next time 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.420
 and have a few fast 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.909
 pork schnitzel advised 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.040
 So here you have two now 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.829
 So kilo asparagus madness 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.210
 he is probably something now 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.620
 Bad to film is there to have 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.510
 we have the two kilo asparagus 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.479
 I think it's true again 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.699
 is what you have done and show here 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.020
 I give you all ego potatoes especially 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.710
 I think the potatoes have 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.940
 thermomix asks a hammer all aroma 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.620
 not me why it probably lies 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:44.199
 that really with steam so 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.330
 a kilo of potatoes and on it you see 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:49.300
 everything is boiling hot and it tastes good 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.520
 super delicious I'm pointing now 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.800
 the result for all the others 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.110
 switch off here now because they still because 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.479
 they melted butter and send to it 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.520
