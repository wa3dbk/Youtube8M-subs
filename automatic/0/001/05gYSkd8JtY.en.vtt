00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.600
 preferences 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.870
 about four times a year you need one 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.060
 few check and last number 5 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.560
 namely stuff for yourself it yourself 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.850
 not need another one if you 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.920
 take own page 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.690
 riding clothes probably and already make that 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.670
 you own a horse it's nice to have one 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.700
 number of extra term sets because you have to be there 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.010
 of course every day go and join 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.580
 and a heavy car to handle the trailer 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.110
 to pull 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.180
 because if you also want a competition or you go 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.890
 often and written it is easy 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.600
 to have your own trailer 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.880
 you almost never go away then you can too 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.670
 rent a trailer 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.980
 a lot of time guys please one 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.260
 own horse costs a lot of time 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.870
 if you put a guest house, then 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.730
 they can feed often and sometimes we can 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.530
 also such a stable mucking day outside 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.080
 but most of all you have to do yourself 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.060
 shower must brush every day they stole 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.010

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.020

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.860
 for the farrier and veterinarian 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.900
 embroider 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.640
 so it really takes a lot of time 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.920
 but if you are willing to pay for it 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.900
 should do a little practice if you like that 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.660
 spatially really I best friend 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.209

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.040
 the most amazing thing there is know well 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.690
 you therefore what you all need as a minimum 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.090
 for your own horse if you have it 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.500
 all still quietly 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.930
 read back to fall under the video 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.150

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.519
