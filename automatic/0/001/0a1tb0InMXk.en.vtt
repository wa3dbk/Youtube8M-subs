00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.910
 in 4 2 3 1 a team that has a lot 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.770

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.150

 rookie this is florian raspentino 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.450
 the young hope from football club 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.790
 nantes so this is the first match of 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.500
 reims in league 1 since 1979 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.850
 do you realize and who better than 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.920
 the olympique de marseille to make the 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.600
 party at auguste delaune stadium full to 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.089
 crack obviously over twenty thousand 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.129
 people have garnished the stands of the 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:41.449
 auguste delaune stadium and it's a match 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.350
 which starts on the hats of wheel 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.879
 but for the people of Marseille 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.399
 with this hit of charles kaboré 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.949
 slammed by kossi agassa the porter 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.199
 Togolese of this team Remy people to 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.249
 kaboré who will be its holder this 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.620
 season in place of alou diarra 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:56.960
 party in england on west ham side 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.370
 the Reims too have assets to 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.539
 argue with a center of 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.760
 besides fortis for gildas and the 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.040
 exceptional parade of the foot a reflex 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.290
 amazing steve mandanda kamel ghilas 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.030
 who was second best scorer of 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.380
 league 2 last year with 14 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.530
 accomplishments and sign it definitively 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.390
 to reims this summer and 0 0 so at the break 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.710
 and very few opportunities to get under 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.509
 the tooth andré pierre gignac also from 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.310
 back in grace in the eleven holder 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.049
 since Marseilles since 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.909
 om coach and andré pierre 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.070
 gignac who stumbles once again on 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.420
 kossi agassa who disgusts all 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.049
 Marseille attackers from the beginning 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.399
 of the meeting 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.810
 it's not for nothing that reims was 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.700
 one of the best defenses of 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.560
 championship of France league 2 la 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.390
 last season is also one of 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.340
 best attacks 54 goals the season 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.890
 last in league 2 and this time the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.359
 head of the Reims player misses the 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.159
 goal of steve mandanda who was defeated 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:51.200
 on this blow ci for two years has known 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.429
 the defeat that twice home at 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.780
 auguste delaune stadium and that's in great 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.909
 part thanks to this man 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.189
 kossi agassa who justifies his status as 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.929
 best league goalie 2 and he the 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.149
 last season by his peers and by 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.979
 league technicians 2 a superb head 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.590
 and a reflex of the left hand then 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.929
 a relaxation to grab the ball on 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.310
 his line 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.560
 and the Marseillais who continue to 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.810
 push that make fears would have 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.730
 less again kossi agassa hero 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.650
 2 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.709
 this meeting Reims side he écoeure 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.140
 is literally andré pierre gignac 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.180
 only leading striker today at 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.890
 marseille accompanied on the wings by 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.370
 the two brothers ayew son karim wishes 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.560
 hit the goal the goal of benoît cheyrou 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.390
 which opens the volley resume score of 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.120
 left foot this time to gaza can 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.980
 absolutely nothing here is the first goal 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.989
 marseillais this season marseille who 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.420
 did not win anymore in 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.650
 championship since last January 29th 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.840
 it was a reindeer win 2 goals to 1 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.920
 and marseille who imposes himself so 1 0 on 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.769
 the lawn of reims 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.239
 it was difficult to believe the 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.480
 expressions of steve mandanda 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:01.859
 the Reims inevitably disappointed 34 shots in 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.859
 this meeting is almost a record
