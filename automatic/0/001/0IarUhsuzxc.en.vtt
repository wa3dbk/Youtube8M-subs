 computer with computer programs 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.570
 the most unexpected as they say 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.550
 faults which malfunction 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.809
 you can't call it 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.529
 Today we will talk about how to return 

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:34.690
 task bar to place such an incident 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.180
 occurs quite often therefore 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.539
 here I want to show you here 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.879

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:56.739
 happens first 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:01.870
 taskbar may be you with 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:06.400
 the side of the left to the right above only because of 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.800
 the fact that it is not fixed here 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.020
 look see I have a tick on 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.120
 fasten the panel for the night here if its 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:19.210
 take off you by chance during work 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:22.320
 you can accidentally hold one mouse 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.680
 some not careful movement and 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.710
 taskbar moved the other side 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.500
 see now it is on my side exactly 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.840
 i can do the top 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.300
 some of course there are some of them not 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.210
 touches me but for example it just 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.800
 enrages rubs out i don't like when u 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.770
 I have a taskbar somewhere 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.440
 where the hell 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.080
 so here to get her back 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.000
 first right click on 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.510
 this taskbar wherever you have it 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.590
 was in a free place not where 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.470
 we have these hands here and 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.460
 completely free and he is allowed here 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.890
 we right-click and look 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.110
 if with him a tick 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.890
 fix the taskbar we can 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.230
 drag and drop 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.090
 if it is not removed here, look, I put 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.980
 set yes we can not drag it 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.940
 so first check not 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.840
 secured 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.820
 she has you removed this tick and just 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.740
 here again for free space 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:34.270
 where not such an arrow appears 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.360
 take it here and so neatly and 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:40.870
 dragging where we need here now 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.920
 the mouse button released now means 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.280
 necessarily 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.220
 again click from the right mouse button and 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.270
 choose to fix the taskbar more 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.200
 she won't run away from you anywhere but this is a lesson 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.730
 little well, I hope that you need 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.580
 subscribe to my channel will 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.930
 we managed to wait for a meeting with you and 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.610
 try to lay out all the 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.710
 necessary better good if you are still 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.160
 of course would ask questions at least under 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.540
 video 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:14.050
 what exactly would you like to know that you have 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.850
 straining system programs and more 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.030
 until I forget I want to say this to you 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.230
 showed on the xp operating system 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.900
 but windows 7 is exactly the same 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.860
 so try 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.260
 move your taskbar 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.190
 bring them back and do not be nervous 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.190
 and bye bye
