00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
of thing I don't know what the exact

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.620 
of thing I don't know what the exact
term<00:00:18.900> for<00:00:19.230> them<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.590> but<00:00:19.859> they're<00:00:19.980> basically

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
term for them is but they're basically

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.950 
term for them is but they're basically
mobile<00:00:21.630> food<00:00:21.779> trucks<00:00:22.279> and<00:00:23.480> it's<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> same

general<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.710> guess<00:00:25.740> platform<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.640> could<00:00:26.760> say

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
general I guess platform you could say

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.609 
general I guess platform you could say
it's<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.210> delivery<00:00:27.660> truck<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.170> mean<00:00:28.320> they<00:00:28.439> look

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
it's the delivery truck I mean they look

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.410 
it's the delivery truck I mean they look
pretty<00:00:28.949> much<00:00:29.070> identical<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.970> first<00:00:30.179> glance

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
pretty much identical on first glance

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.299 
pretty much identical on first glance
but<00:00:30.900> there<00:00:31.740> are<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> couple<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.160> key

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
but there are a couple of key

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.830 
but there are a couple of key
differences<00:00:32.910> mainly<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:34.940> that<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.600> doesn't

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
differences mainly in that it doesn't

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.510 
differences mainly in that it doesn't
have<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.170> back<00:00:37.350> door<00:00:37.590> there's<00:00:37.980> gonna<00:00:38.160> be<00:00:38.340> some

don't know if you can hear about but
it's<00:01:31.200> very<00:01:31.380> loud<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.890> my<00:01:31.920> end<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.430> we're<00:01:32.640> just

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
it's very loud on my end so we're just

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.270 
it's very loud on my end so we're just
gonna<00:01:32.880> go<00:01:33.060> ahead<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.210> throw<00:01:33.330> those<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.900> there

gonna go ahead and throw those in there
that's<00:01:35.280> pretty<00:01:35.550> much<00:01:35.670> all<00:01:35.880> there<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
that's pretty much all there is to the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.600 
that's pretty much all there is to the
inside<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.320> mean<00:01:37.740> there<00:01:37.860> isn't<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.159> whole<00:01:38.369> lot<00:01:38.580> of

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
inside I mean there isn't a whole lot of

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.430 
inside I mean there isn't a whole lot of
space<00:01:39.000> for<00:01:39.630> much<00:01:39.810> more<00:01:41.630> so<00:01:42.630> that's<00:01:42.810> about<00:01:42.930> it

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
space for much more so that's about it

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.080 
space for much more so that's about it
as<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.040> see<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.369> here<00:01:44.550> I<00:01:44.610> already<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:44.970> a

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
as you can see in here I already have a

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.730 
as you can see in here I already have a
little<00:01:45.390> steering<00:01:45.659> wheel<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.140> stuff<00:01:46.409> set<00:01:46.710> up

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
little steering wheel and stuff set up

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.870 
little steering wheel and stuff set up
and<00:01:47.990> as<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.500> probably<00:01:49.979> see<00:01:50.340> I've<00:01:50.490> already

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
and as you can probably see I've already

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.120 
and as you can probably see I've already
built<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.210> truck<00:01:51.450> itself<00:01:51.869> just<00:01:52.320> because<00:01:52.649> it's

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
built the truck itself just because it's

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.910 
built the truck itself just because it's
pretty<00:01:53.310> much<00:01:53.520> identical<00:01:53.820> for<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.360> one<00:01:54.920> so

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
pretty much identical for this one so

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.859 
pretty much identical for this one so
with<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.490> having<00:01:56.820> been<00:01:56.970> taken<00:01:57.210> care<00:01:57.600> of

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
with that having been taken care of

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.840

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
that's pretty much it

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.440 
that's pretty much it
we're<00:02:26.310> gonna<00:02:26.400> go<00:02:26.700> ahead<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:26.850> do<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.090> on<00:02:27.269> the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
we're gonna go ahead and do that on the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.250 
we're gonna go ahead and do that on the
other<00:02:27.660> side<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:29.329> just<00:02:30.329> check<00:02:30.780> here<00:02:31.019> where

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
other side I just check here where

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.220 
other side I just check here where
exactly<00:02:31.860> okay<00:02:33.560> alright<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:34.829> this<00:02:34.980> is<00:02:35.489> a

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
exactly okay alright so this is a

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.600 
exactly okay alright so this is a
variant<00:02:37.230> here<00:02:37.530> could<00:02:37.739> be<00:02:37.829> used<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.190> create<00:02:38.549> a

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
variant here could be used to create a

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.400 
variant here could be used to create a
lot<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.060> different<00:02:39.480> things<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.959> mean<00:02:40.079> not<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.260> lot

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
lot of different things I mean not a lot

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.030 
lot of different things I mean not a lot
lot<00:02:41.070> per<00:02:41.400> se<00:02:41.670> but<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:43.410> could<00:02:43.560> also<00:02:43.709> make<00:02:44.010> it

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
lot per se but you could also make it

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.430 
lot per se but you could also make it
into<00:02:44.400> an<00:02:44.489> ice<00:02:44.610> cream<00:02:44.970> truck<00:02:45.420> which<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.140> might

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
into an ice cream truck which I might

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.350 
into an ice cream truck which I might
actually<00:02:46.709> do<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.160> video<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.610> lot<00:02:48.030> on<00:02:48.180> though<00:02:48.329> I

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
actually do a video a lot on though I

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.050 
actually do a video a lot on though I
still<00:02:48.900> have<00:02:49.049> yet<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.500> figure<00:02:49.829> out<00:02:50.160> how<00:02:50.400> exactly

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
still have yet to figure out how exactly

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.690 
still have yet to figure out how exactly
you<00:02:51.269> go<00:02:51.450> about<00:02:51.690> making<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.680> ice<00:02:52.799> cream<00:02:53.100> :<00:02:53.549> and

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
you go about making the ice cream : and

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.729 
you go about making the ice cream : and
all<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.940> stuff<00:02:54.180> that

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
all the stuff that

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.130 
all the stuff that
makes<00:02:56.280> ice-cream<00:02:56.849> trucks<00:02:57.209> as<00:02:57.450> distinct<00:02:57.989> as

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
makes ice-cream trucks as distinct as

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.350 
makes ice-cream trucks as distinct as
they<00:02:58.409> are<00:02:58.560> no<00:02:59.340> no<00:02:59.549> for<00:02:59.730> some<00:02:59.879> reason<00:03:00.239> is

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
they are no no for some reason is

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.869 
they are no no for some reason is
they're<00:03:00.540> always<00:03:00.689> like<00:03:00.959> coming<00:03:01.260> in<00:03:01.500> here<00:03:01.530> Oh

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
they're always like coming in here Oh

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:07.910 
they're always like coming in here Oh
turn<00:03:02.879> it<00:03:03.030> around<00:03:04.610> and<00:03:06.200> yeah<00:03:07.200> anyway<00:03:07.530> like<00:03:07.739> I

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
turn it around and yeah anyway like I

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.410 
turn it around and yeah anyway like I
said<00:03:08.220> I'm<00:03:08.489> still<00:03:08.640> kind<00:03:08.939> of<00:03:09.000> trying<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.269> figure

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
said I'm still kind of trying to figure

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.300 
said I'm still kind of trying to figure
out<00:03:09.689> how<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.900> like<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.439> :<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:10.980> sort<00:03:11.280> of

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
out how to like the : and that sort of

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.099 
out how to like the : and that sort of
stuff<00:03:11.640> just<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.120> make<00:03:12.269> it<00:03:12.390> look<00:03:12.510> more<00:03:12.689> like<00:03:12.930> an

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
stuff just to make it look more like an

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.800 
stuff just to make it look more like an
actual<00:03:13.379> ice-cream<00:03:13.980> truck<00:03:14.370> but<00:03:15.299> if<00:03:15.390> I<00:03:15.480> do<00:03:15.540> get

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
actual ice-cream truck but if I do get

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.660 
actual ice-cream truck but if I do get
that<00:03:16.019> figured<00:03:16.349> out<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.799> assuming<00:03:17.400> somebody

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
that figured out and assuming somebody

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.490 
that figured out and assuming somebody
else<00:03:17.939> doesn't<00:03:18.209> jump<00:03:18.480> on<00:03:18.629> it<00:03:18.810> before<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.109> do

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
else doesn't jump on it before I do

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.740 
else doesn't jump on it before I do
I<00:03:19.799> think<00:03:20.340> that'll<00:03:20.939> probably<00:03:21.090> be<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.510> next

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
I think that'll probably be the next

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.789 
I think that'll probably be the next
video<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:22.109> this<00:03:22.230> little<00:03:22.560> series<00:03:23.750> and<00:03:24.750> as<00:03:25.650> I

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
video of this little series and as I

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.319 
video of this little series and as I
said<00:03:26.010> this<00:03:26.159> one<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:26.340> pretty<00:03:26.730> much<00:03:26.849> complete

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
said this one is pretty much complete

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.780 
said this one is pretty much complete
and<00:03:27.599> it's<00:03:27.720> starting<00:03:28.109> putting<00:03:28.290> more<00:03:29.010> frames<00:03:29.489> on

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
and it's starting putting more frames on

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.720 
and it's starting putting more frames on
the<00:03:29.819> back<00:03:30.120> here<00:03:31.069> just<00:03:32.069> for<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.370> bit<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.519> decor

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
the back here just for a bit of decor

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.420 
the back here just for a bit of decor
there<00:03:35.730> we<00:03:35.909> go

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
there we go

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.149 
there we go
yeah<00:03:38.430> store<00:03:39.239> on<00:03:39.389> another<00:03:39.780> sign<00:03:40.170> for<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.680> license

yeah store on another sign for a license
plate<00:03:41.870> that's<00:03:42.870> here<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.709> guess<00:03:44.609> this<00:03:44.819> will<00:03:44.939> be

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
plate that's here I guess this will be

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.280 
plate that's here I guess this will be
booty<00:03:46.549> there<00:03:47.549> you<00:03:47.639> go<00:03:47.849> Ruby<00:03:50.450> so<00:03:51.450> yeah<00:03:52.049> that's

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
booty there you go Ruby so yeah that's

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.259 
booty there you go Ruby so yeah that's

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
pretty much it today without me rambling

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.690 
pretty much it today without me rambling
on<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.829> artificially<00:03:55.829> extending<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.549> length

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
on and artificially extending the length

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.210 
on and artificially extending the length
of<00:03:56.939> this<00:03:57.090> video<00:03:57.299> or<00:03:57.720> unnecessarily<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:58.799> guess<00:03:59.040> I

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
of this video or unnecessarily I guess I
