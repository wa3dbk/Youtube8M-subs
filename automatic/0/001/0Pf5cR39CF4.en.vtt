00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
beads for about the same price only it

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.110 
beads for about the same price only it
had<00:02:27.390> different<00:02:27.599> colors<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.620> had<00:02:28.890> like

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
had different colors and it had like
