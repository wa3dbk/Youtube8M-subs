00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.249 
of how I look at it when people are
gonna<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:27.090> off<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.270> college<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.049> moving

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
gonna be going off to college and moving

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.740 
gonna be going off to college and moving
and<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:28.799> leaving<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:30.180> kind<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.420> feel<00:01:30.600> like

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
and just leaving and I kind of feel like

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.020 
and just leaving and I kind of feel like
they'll<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.710> time<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.009> go<00:01:32.400> somewhere<00:01:32.850> new

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
they'll have time to go somewhere new

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.120 
they'll have time to go somewhere new
and<00:01:33.060> grow<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.930> meet<00:01:34.049> new<00:01:34.200> people<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.710> I'll<00:01:34.890> go

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
and grow and meet new people and I'll go

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.219 
and grow and meet new people and I'll go
meet<00:01:35.340> new<00:01:35.460> people<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.000> all<00:01:36.180> grow<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.720> then

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
meet new people and all grow and then

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.710 
meet new people and all grow and then
when<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:37.680> come<00:01:37.829> back<00:01:38.100> home<00:01:38.400> we<00:01:38.909> kind<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.420> start

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
when we come back home we kind of start

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.179 
when we come back home we kind of start
back<00:01:39.900> where<00:01:40.079> we<00:01:40.110> were<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.680> that's<00:01:40.829> kind<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.070> how

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
back where we were so that's kind of how

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.340 
back where we were so that's kind of how
I<00:01:41.250> think<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.759> but<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.630> know<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.780> lot<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.020> people

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
I think of it but I know a lot of people

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.530 
I think of it but I know a lot of people
say<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.189> know<00:01:44.520> that's<00:01:44.700> what<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> really<00:01:45.329> like

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
say you know that's what the really like

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.060 
say you know that's what the really like
the<00:01:45.659> hardest<00:01:46.020> part<00:01:46.229> about<00:01:46.350> going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.740> college

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the hardest part about going to college

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.770 
the hardest part about going to college
and<00:01:47.220> stuff<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.549> just<00:01:47.579> leaving<00:01:47.939> your<00:01:48.210> fear<00:01:48.509> like

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
and stuff is just leaving your fear like

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.330 
and stuff is just leaving your fear like
your<00:01:48.960> friends<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.470> your<00:01:49.560> family<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:49.979> just

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
your friends and your family and just

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.340 
your friends and your family and just
all<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:51.030> change<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.780> I'd<00:01:51.899> love<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.110> hear

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
all that change and so I'd love to hear

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.480 
all that change and so I'd love to hear
what<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.560> guys<00:01:52.619> think<00:01:52.710> about<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.310> because

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
what you guys think about that because

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.490 
what you guys think about that because
obviously<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.210> haven't<00:01:54.659> gone<00:01:54.899> through<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.259> yet

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
obviously I haven't gone through it yet

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.499 
obviously I haven't gone through it yet
but<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:55.979> think<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.549> can<00:01:56.700> definitely<00:01:57.060> handle<00:01:57.210> it

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
but I think I can definitely handle it

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.539 
but I think I can definitely handle it
and<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.750> kind<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.170> I've<00:01:58.770> already<00:01:58.979> had<00:01:59.340> that

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
and I kind of I've already had that

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.249 
and I kind of I've already had that
mindset<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.090> guess<00:02:00.329> with<00:02:00.540> my<00:02:00.689> friend<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.229> that

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
mindset I guess with my friend so that

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.560 
mindset I guess with my friend so that
part<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.549> feel<00:02:02.729> calmed<00:02:03.119> about<00:02:03.329> that

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
part of it I just feel calmed about that

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.709 
part of it I just feel calmed about that
and<00:02:03.780> I'm<00:02:04.409> also<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:05.070> for<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.210> really<00:02:06.540> close

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
and I'm also like for the really close

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.330 
and I'm also like for the really close
friends<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.229> have<00:02:07.530> I've<00:02:07.799> never<00:02:08.069> really

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
like lost a friend I guess we normally

like lost a friend I guess we normally
just<00:02:11.790> grow<00:02:12.030> apart<00:02:12.360> it's<00:02:12.660> not<00:02:12.870> like

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
just grow apart it's not like

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.540 
just grow apart it's not like
I<00:02:13.200> don't<00:02:13.440> really<00:02:13.590> have<00:02:13.950> any<00:02:14.100> friends<00:02:14.430> that

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
I don't really have any friends that

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.370 
I don't really have any friends that
I've<00:02:14.640> like<00:02:14.790> completely<00:02:15.240> lost<00:02:15.570> just<00:02:15.930> in<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.200> big

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
I've like completely lost just in a big

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.780 
I've like completely lost just in a big
fight<00:02:16.590> or<00:02:16.800> anything<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:17.610> that's

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
fight or anything like that so that's

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.690 
fight or anything like that so that's
nice<00:02:18.740> so<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.770> guess<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.280> guess<00:02:20.490> we'll<00:02:20.670> just

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
nice so I guess the I guess we'll just

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.600 
nice so I guess the I guess we'll just
see<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.120> know<00:02:21.420> who<00:02:21.630> kind<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.020> grows<00:02:23.010> apart<00:02:23.430> and

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
see you know who kind of grows apart and

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.280 
see you know who kind of grows apart and
does<00:02:23.760> their<00:02:23.940> own<00:02:23.970> thing<00:02:24.090> for<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.720> most<00:02:24.990> part<00:02:25.200> I

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
does their own thing for the most part I

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.290 
does their own thing for the most part I
think<00:02:25.350> we'll<00:02:25.710> stay<00:02:26.130> pretty<00:02:26.460> close<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:27.150> I'm

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
think we'll stay pretty close and so I'm

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.270 
think we'll stay pretty close and so I'm
happy<00:02:27.900> about<00:02:28.050> that<00:02:28.230> but<00:02:28.710> of<00:02:28.800> course<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.130> little

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
happy about that but of course a little

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.550 
happy about that but of course a little
bit<00:02:29.400> nervous<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:30.210> mean<00:02:30.360> just<00:02:31.110> starting<00:02:31.440> over

say that things that happened previously

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.130 
say that things that happened previously
don't<00:02:38.460> matter<00:02:38.820> but<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:39.330> just<00:02:39.630> feel<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.870> lot<00:02:40.080> more
