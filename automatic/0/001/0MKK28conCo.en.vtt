00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.630
 gainer from nsp 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.190
 called mass volume good gamer i 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.200
 I think does not need advertising on the Internet 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.509
 find a lot of positive feedback about 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.670
 This gamer and he probably wins 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.330
 leading position manufacturers 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.660
 of the company 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.600
 emochki do everything possible so that their 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.390
 its line ulus sports nutrition 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.019
 raise the leading position well it 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.060
 not without reason 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.700
 I will briefly tell you about him 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.160
 so now let's get to know the product 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.410
 start jar we have two whole ship 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.180
 it lasts from 3 tenths of a kilogram means 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.969
 here we have 17 servings per container 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.070
 portions is 132 grams while 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.510
 per serving 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:51.480
 510 kilocalories of fat 11 grams means 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.440
 carbohydrate count 58 and the most important protein 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.270
 46 grams 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.550
 with this way the ratio of proteins and 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.170
 carbohydrate equals us summer 60 by 40 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.270
 probably a very impressive result 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.030
 believe me by examining the composition of everything and 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.600
 gamer I want to say that this here 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.670
 leading figure among gamers but 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.590
 let's say not just like that number but on 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.840
 actually active ingredient here 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.600
 very good effect why 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.110
 because they make up this gamer 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.820
 contains three different types of proteins 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.430
 they differ in their action means 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.380
 eating proteins quickly digestible means and 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.600
 long digestible average digestibility 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.549
 eat and also here are carbohydrates from various 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:36.329
 sources are taken both fast and long 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.890
 will have to mean like in favor of not 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.310
 only to athletes who say so only 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.409
 begin well and professionals of course 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.020
 you have to pay for such quality 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.990
 and its price is slightly higher than that of
