00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.620
 hello welcome beautiful hair duo the day 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.230
 today we are going to do the hairstyle of 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.869
 sampacho I already made half of the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.840
 hairstyle that the idea is to achieve a clover 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.050
 let's start in the middle and make two 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.880
 small pigtails or pixels 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.880
 and we are going to start from this side 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.940
 we need to have dry hair and well 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.940
 brushed 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.789
 and we're going to use a little bit of spray 

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:44.440
 hair that is a light spray that does not 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:47.530
 leave your hair very hard 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.329
 they place it on both sides halfway 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.150
 of the hair until the first part of the 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.600
 hair 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:58.170
 and with help from the top if you have to 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.180
 focus very well that you enter right in the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.480
 half and go right in half here 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.480
 behind 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.670
 and we leave a small bundle here for 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.440
 continue now let's take the hair 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.890
 taking care that they are not going to any other 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.890
 little horse 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.250
 and we place 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.250
 again it is three of the two sides 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.650
 since it's important let's go to the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.650
 left side 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.729
 they will place the toxin on this side 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.130
 trying to go under the lock 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.070
 hair related 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.070
 and coming out on this side of the hairstyle 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.579
 if this part moves right now we adjust 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:04.280
 everything here we take in the second part and 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.880
 we do the same for the third 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.880
 we brush 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.510
 and now it's very important here they go to 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.209
 come close to the first of the first 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.330
 account that we made and place there and 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:25.550
 they go under 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.550
 of the lock and this one that is here 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.840
 we have here the clover and the only thing 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.400
 is at the end is to place some pins 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.260
 to prevent it from falling apart 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.910
 let's put a pin here to 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.200
 above 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.200
 holding the lock 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.140
 and another crossed 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.780
 so they stop very well we have left 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.090
 and at 23 bowls it is very easy this 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.920
 hairstyle and how I also told you what 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.370
 can use for any other 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.379
 chance 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.379
 Enjoy it and see you next time
