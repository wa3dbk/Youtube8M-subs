00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Weed Ta-channel!

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.380
Hey guys! Ta-chan from Weed here!

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.380
This is our 8th video.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.380
And this time we’re continuing on from last time,

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.380
where we shared Weed’s FJ Cruiser.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:33.080
This here is the car I introduced last time. It’s a BK style FJ Cruiser, with all black body, lift-up, and bulky mud terrain tires.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:40.480
But today I’d like to show you a different accented black style that we can get with FJ Cruiser.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.060
Weed FJ Cruiser version 2.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.140
Her is our BK style version 2.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.080
So, what is different with this version?

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.600
The body is completely black, just like the previous version.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.220
You can see the biggest difference in the lower section.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.420
The height has been adjusted to normal height for this version.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.380
But, look here, there it’s not completely normal.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.860
We have these malice 20 inch wheels.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.840
The 20 inches add a powerful stroke of luxury.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.760
These here are Weed original brand "Heritage" original 20 inch aluminium wheels.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.380
And with these we have BF Goodrich all-terrain tires.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.140
These tires are all terrain,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.620
when compared to the rugged mud-terrain tires in the last version that are specialised for off-road terrain,

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.840
these here are an all-rounder tire.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.920
They are suitable for all seasons,

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.400
and have more of a gentler appearance when compared with the rugged mud-terrain version.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.820
They make little road noise, and are perfect for driving in urban areas.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.080
You can see another difference with this version here on the exterior at the rear.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.220
One difference is this here; the tail lights.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.660
The first version had red LED tail lights

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.600
but here we have smokey LED tail lights.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.280
In the first version we smacked a big tire up here on the back,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.000
but in this version we’re going for  more of an urban luxury feel

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.520
so we’ve used Weed original cover on the back here for an all black look,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.140
that is just so sweet,

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.500
Ok so, I’d like to share one more style with you guys.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.960
This is it; the LA style.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.500
Just like the second version that we are just after taking a look at, it’s normal height with 20 inches,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.080
but has been given an all white finish.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:16.540
Take a look. Even in the rain, it’s a work of art.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.200
This elegant style is popular with women at the moment.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.900
Have a think about getting this style for yourself too.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.880
Today we look at the FJ Cruiser, continuing on from our last video.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.320
Demand for this kind of car is heating up, next to Hilux Surf.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.940
Why not make this style your own.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.200
And next time,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.120
we’ll finally get around to taking a peek at the interior of FJ Cruiser.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.820
Until then! Ta-chan from Weed here, over and out!
