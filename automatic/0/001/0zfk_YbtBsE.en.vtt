in<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.829> bolt<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:45.210> don't<00:00:45.420> need<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.720> and<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.989> can

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
in a bolt we don't need to and you can

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.660 
in a bolt we don't need to and you can
see<00:00:46.199> my<00:00:46.350> setup<00:00:46.620> here<00:00:48.110> 15<00:00:49.110> millimeter<00:00:49.530> wrench

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
see my setup here 15 millimeter wrench

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.770 
see my setup here 15 millimeter wrench
down<00:00:50.670> there<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.269> kind<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.540> tight<00:00:51.750> fit

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
down there it's kind of a tight fit

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.180 
down there it's kind of a tight fit
right<00:00:52.350> against<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> jug<00:00:52.980> but<00:00:53.220> it's<00:00:53.339> possible

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.790 

then<00:00:58.190> you<00:00:58.280> interlock<00:00:58.699> your<00:00:58.969> wrench<00:00:59.539> here<00:00:59.870> and

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
then you interlock your wrench here and

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.229 
then you interlock your wrench here and
then<00:01:00.949> you<00:01:01.010> can<00:01:01.129> just<00:01:01.219> pull<00:01:01.430> forward<00:01:01.699> with<00:01:02.120> your

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
then you can just pull forward with your

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.140 
then you can just pull forward with your
leverage<00:01:03.190> and<00:01:04.190> loosen<00:01:04.519> up<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:04.729> belt<00:01:04.909> you<00:01:05.059> can

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
leverage and loosen up the belt you can

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.810 
leverage and loosen up the belt you can
see<00:01:05.330> it's<00:01:05.449> loose

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.710 

and<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:09.630> pull<00:01:09.870> it<00:01:09.960> off<00:01:10.080> right<00:01:10.230> there

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.600 

you<00:01:13.290> know<00:01:13.440> I<00:01:13.470> didn't<00:01:13.770> show<00:01:13.890> how<00:01:14.040> taking<00:01:14.370> it<00:01:14.460> off

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
you know I didn't show how taking it off

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.800 
you know I didn't show how taking it off
but<00:01:16.310> there<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.370> go<00:01:17.430> nice<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.120> easy<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.690> don't

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
but there you go nice and easy you don't

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.750 
but there you go nice and easy you don't
have<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.080> move<00:01:19.230> the<00:01:19.350> jug<00:01:19.590> at<00:01:19.710> all<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:20.550> a<00:01:20.580> good

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
have to move the jug at all have a good

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.230 
have to move the jug at all have a good
leverage<00:01:21.680> this<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:23.520> can<00:01:23.700> flip<00:01:24.060> over

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
leverage this this can flip over

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.000 
leverage this this can flip over
sometimes<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.200> be<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> little<00:01:25.470> careful<00:01:25.560> of

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
sometimes so just be a little careful of

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.190 
sometimes so just be a little careful of
that<00:01:26.160> but<00:01:26.370> otherwise<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.910> is<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.140> make<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
that but otherwise this is a make a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.200 
that but otherwise this is a make a
pretty<00:01:28.380> great<00:01:28.560> tip<00:01:28.950> when<00:01:29.160> you<00:01:29.370> don't<00:01:29.520> have<00:01:29.670> all

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
pretty great tip when you don't have all

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.490 
pretty great tip when you don't have all
the<00:01:30.870> special<00:01:31.230> tools<00:01:31.440> sometimes<00:01:33.290> if<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.410> can

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the special tools sometimes if you can

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
get the belt off there with that move

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.300

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.470 

well<00:01:49.620> I<00:01:49.680> realized<00:01:50.070> when<00:01:50.670> doing<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.030> being

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
well I realized when doing this being

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.780 
well I realized when doing this being
left-handed<00:01:52.220> causes<00:01:53.220> me<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.340> do<00:01:53.490> things<00:01:53.700> a

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
left-handed causes me to do things a

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.890 
left-handed causes me to do things a
little<00:01:53.850> differently<00:01:54.210> sometimes<00:01:54.450> because

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
little differently sometimes because

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.160 
little differently sometimes because
you're<00:01:55.020> right-handed<00:01:55.460> just<00:01:56.460> pull<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:57.170> and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
you're right-handed just pull this and

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.200 
you're right-handed just pull this and
you<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.470> slip<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.740> felt<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.520> off<00:01:59.640> right

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
you can slip the felt on and off right

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.140 
you can slip the felt on and off right
here<00:02:00.480> with<00:02:00.660> your<00:02:00.840> left<00:02:01.080> hand<00:02:01.760> so<00:02:02.760> just<00:02:02.910> get<00:02:03.060> in

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
here with your left hand so just get in

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.600 
here with your left hand so just get in
here<00:02:03.240> with<00:02:03.480> your<00:02:03.630> left<00:02:03.780> hand<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.470> then<00:02:05.340> pull

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
here with your left hand and then pull

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.800 
here with your left hand and then pull
that<00:02:05.730> tensioner<00:02:06.180> over<00:02:06.360> doesn't<00:02:06.570> need<00:02:06.660> to<00:02:06.720> go

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
that tensioner over doesn't need to go

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.350 
that tensioner over doesn't need to go
very<00:02:06.930> far<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.410> can<00:02:07.530> slip<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.860> belt<00:02:07.980> right

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
very far and you can slip the belt right

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.740 
very far and you can slip the belt right
off<00:02:09.619> so<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.890> double<00:02:11.490> wrench<00:02:11.730> setup<00:02:12.450> works

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
off so that double wrench setup works

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.300 
off so that double wrench setup works
pretty<00:02:13.080> nice<00:02:13.230> though<00:02:13.440> but<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.740> might<00:02:14.160> not

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
pretty nice though but you might not

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.150 
pretty nice though but you might not
need<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.520> do<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.670> right<00:02:15.450> here<00:02:15.720> but<00:02:16.710> I<00:02:16.830> include

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
need to do it right here but I include

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.130 
need to do it right here but I include
this<00:02:17.280> little<00:02:17.490> bit<00:02:18.120> right<00:02:18.360> here<00:02:18.600> about<00:02:18.870> being

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
this little bit right here about being

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.930 
this little bit right here about being
left-handed<00:02:19.380> versus<00:02:19.830> right-handed<00:02:20.370> it's<00:02:20.880> a

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
left-handed versus right-handed it's a

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.690 
left-handed versus right-handed it's a
little<00:02:21.120> awkward<00:02:21.240> sometimes
