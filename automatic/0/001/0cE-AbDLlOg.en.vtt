 the hardest part of the trailer for him 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.450
 profitable in the long run is what I 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.730
 I think the poker player is coming

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.210
 Silva market is rich you needed 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.100

 I came here with reality is another 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.260
 as well as the little that the micros have 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.660
 texlom gitex on the market you can also 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.030
 operate with low values ​​with little 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.490
 money is what is most important to you 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.620
 know how to control it but manage 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.200
 no value teaches every hand has a 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.850
 logic of a situation because it was the will 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.350
 what are you doing because as in 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.440

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.330
 photographic and have a logical situation 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.370
 silver ' trading during entering market 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.920
 bought or sold until it was 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.720
 in the part related to the studies is 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.030
 market is a huge advantage over the 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.860
 I bit you can follow the 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.020
 analysts while operating 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.520
 so it would be more or less like you 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.229
 sit at a table when you are 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.600
 starting to play little and could call 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.879
 for me the score for the other player of 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.260
 mouth and keep asking him that I 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.299
 I make this hand that you think 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.040
 in this hand if I could play with the 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.170
 Legal support a little player 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.060
 have no addictions to the market, sometimes 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.980
 people think it's got 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.200
 influence with the economy with a 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.730
 company behaves and for the trade pro 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.129
 buy sell and make money in 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.720
 short term this has no influence 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.599
 I think the player's head is 100% 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.129
 ready to learn the part I 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.110
 I find it even easier than it is 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.909
 identify situations from your hand 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.650
 reads the graph to be able to identify 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.780
 these operations 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.060
 and then be a winner in the long run 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.640

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.430
 present this universe of showing the 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.470
