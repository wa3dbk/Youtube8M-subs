00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.760
 hello, I'm all Elysium and this was a 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.410
 minecraft video in which I 'm going to 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.290
 talk about the utility of the sponge 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.150
 finally it is finally useful before 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.070
 sponges I found them jones de 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.110
 filly and then basically he put 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.990
 coordinates or did not put anything simply 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.349
 is a sponge is worth and now the 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.230
 sponge is obtained from the temples under 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.509
 the water of these bugs the guardians and 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.570
 when defeating the forest is the boss then 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.620
 you get an important wet sponge 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.410
 wet 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.420
 then to dry it, you have to 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.510
 put it in the oven putting as 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:48.930
 coal or wood fuel with what 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.930
 you know, we divide the work here 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:56.520
 and good when it dries is for example 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.520
 I take another one 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.000
 perfect it and have two dry good 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.980
 and as you have seen you gain experience 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.460
 just like taking out the whole man oven 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:12.180
 come on now if you put a sponge yes or 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.660
 be dry without getting wet in the water absorbs 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.670
 all the water as you see is already a 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:22.460
 very curious utility the truth 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.860
 and well that is not either it is that it serves us 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.140
 a lot but we are very curious and 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.880
 good if you want to say that I know how to remove 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.470
 space then a water area that 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.110
 annoying or whatever it is because you do that and already 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.460
 perfect they absorb a lot of water and good 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.220
 basically this is all of the 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.350
 update of 1.8 on this 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.320
 sponge obviously and makes unique utility 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.049
 until the moment good at least have 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.409
 put a curious utility and I do not know what 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.780
 you've learned and well that's the only thing 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.429
 that brings this and well I hope that I have 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.110
 served that has served a like and 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.670

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:02.049
