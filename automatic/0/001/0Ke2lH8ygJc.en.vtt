00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.490 
anti three-star basis for town on lines
was<00:01:00.090> becoming<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.750> thing<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.109> was<00:01:01.199> still<00:01:01.379> in

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
was becoming a thing it was still in

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.650 
was becoming a thing it was still in
development<00:01:01.980> nowadays<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.910> see<00:01:03.149> anti

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
development nowadays you see anti

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.539 
development nowadays you see anti
three-star<00:01:04.049> bases<00:01:04.409> are<00:01:04.500> very<00:01:04.680> spacious<00:01:05.339> and

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
three-star bases are very spacious and

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.480 
three-star bases are very spacious and
that<00:01:06.000> provides<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.600> lot<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.960> ambiguity<00:01:07.490> for

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
that provides a lot of ambiguity for

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.640 
that provides a lot of ambiguity for

and hogs and all that stuff a lot of

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.890 
and hogs and all that stuff a lot of
bases<00:01:22.680> can<00:01:23.159> be<00:01:23.189> three<00:01:23.850> starts<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.420> technically

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
bases can be three starts so technically

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.929 
bases can be three starts so technically
so<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.380> speak<00:01:25.650> there<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.100> no<00:01:26.310> such<00:01:26.520> thing<00:01:26.549> as

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
so to speak there is no such thing as

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.960 
so to speak there is no such thing as
anti<00:01:27.330> three-star<00:01:27.720> basis<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:28.729> what<00:01:29.729> comes

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
anti three-star basis but what comes

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.840 
anti three-star basis but what comes
down<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:32.280> techniques<00:01:32.729> that

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
down to it is the the techniques that

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.280 
down to it is the the techniques that
people<00:01:33.030> apply<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.840> basis<00:01:34.140> like

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
people apply to the basis like

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.410 
people apply to the basis like
