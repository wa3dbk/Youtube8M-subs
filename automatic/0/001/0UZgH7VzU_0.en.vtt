has like two little mouthpieces here

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.839 
has like two little mouthpieces here
that<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.000> little<00:02:17.379> charger<00:02:18.379> goes<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.280> you

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
that a little charger goes to and you

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.550

only have to charge it like once every
three<00:02:21.890> cleanses<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:23.239> is<00:02:23.390> really<00:02:23.569> good

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
three cleanses and this is really good

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.440 
three cleanses and this is really good
but<00:02:24.260> you<00:02:24.470> can't<00:02:24.769> really<00:02:25.040> scrub<00:02:25.790> your<00:02:25.939> face<00:02:26.150> too
