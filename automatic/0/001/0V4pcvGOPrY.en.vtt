complicated and after that you would

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.479 
complicated and after that you would
have<00:00:40.839> duplicate<00:00:41.469> items<00:00:41.559> but<00:00:41.890> they<00:00:42.190> patched

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
have duplicate items but they patched

by the way anyway guys these are the
items<00:06:28.280> that<00:06:28.520> we<00:06:28.730> duplicated<00:06:29.150> so<00:06:29.480> it's<00:06:29.990> pretty

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
items that we duplicated so it's pretty

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.410 
items that we duplicated so it's pretty
simple<00:06:30.830> so<00:06:30.980> once<00:06:31.790> you<00:06:31.850> get<00:06:31.940> the<00:06:32.030> glitch<00:06:32.210> down

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:32.420 
simple so once you get the glitch down

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.120 
simple so once you get the glitch down
you<00:06:32.600> can<00:06:32.750> get<00:06:32.900> a<00:06:32.930> lot<00:06:33.200> of<00:06:33.380> money<00:06:33.530> or<00:06:33.830> you<00:06:33.860> can
