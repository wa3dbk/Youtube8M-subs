00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.389
 hello who are you what are you doing i am 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.070
 JÃ¶rg I'm a member of 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.509
 Management of zattoo and us 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.639
 establish the internet as 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.199
 distribution route for the linear 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.930
 watching TV means watching TV videos 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.380
 from the living room we bring on pc 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.480
 smartphone tablet is not dead 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.949
 not so when to many communication with 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.679
 the internet actually that's about 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:34.050
 the archaic or not dead in ours 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.130
 senses of witte can also be used 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.050
 we just say yes we have so many 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.750
 users in germany 700,000 at the moment 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.250
 per month on the platform the linear 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.230
 tv as you know it is always again 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.020
 dead said how many years it still 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.390
 I do not know today it is 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.280
 is still the main medium what 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.239
 is consumed 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.860
 Do you have such a thing anyway ? 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.789
 interactive components with something in it 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.530
 you do or perhaps the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.199
 thought i somehow watch tv 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.320
 Incidentally, to the benefit of the material mix 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.000
 core of our product is very clear 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.710
 that the content of the sender on this 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.299
 Equipment brings that is explain that we 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.330
 around it have additional features 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.220
 like a program guide like new in the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.930
 switzerland personal tv recommendations 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.189
 that is clear that we are always where 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.170
 just look at the advantages of the 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.759
 Internets then synonymous with this rather 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.070
 traditional medium to connect 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.720
 but we are clearly in focus 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.970
 still only the core product and 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.520
 this is really the tv program as well 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.840
 it is meant to be transmitted sentence for 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.630
 him but actually so I have 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.950
 your platform you have looked at the ndr 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.090
 public law but also learned 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.960
 You are now also in private 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.850
 watch TV on the go 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.909
 that's right we had the last ones 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.409
 years ago so all of them 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.310
 public broadcaster on the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.950
 platform is not the only one that speaks 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.960
 big the first zdf but also all 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.590
 regional transmitters and transmitter 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.929
 we have many smaller private ones 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.009
 sender on the platform such as dmax 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.560
 are very very important to us or 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.610
 also a sport1 until now we were missing 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.500
 the two major private broadcasting groups 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.390
 in Germany so the rtl group and 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.460
 the prosiebensat 1 group and with the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.170
 rtl group we have recently 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.220
 cooperative agreement closed so that 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.270
 We will be with you shortly 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.030
 be on 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.649
 how does not win such a group so 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.660
 tell her the promotional change with those 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.280
 or what do you have of it 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.870
 on the one hand, that's what he has 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.519
 access to a very exciting 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.590
 user group or viewer group 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.930
 some of them do not open up 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.099
 own television so have more 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.510
 otherwise no longer the sender as 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.269
 range would be available 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.010
 the first the second is that that would be 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.239
 Of course, pay for the content 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.280
 and there are many different ones 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.590
 Models like side so market technically 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.650
 positioned in Germany we are the 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.140
 only provider of legal offers 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.850
 We are traveling in a market where the 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.290
 So right clarification so how ok is that 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.209
 transmitter of the collecting societies and 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.450
 so on to get this service 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.680
 It is still very exhausting if 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.569
 not just of Switzerland is where the 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.010
 whole legal much easier is okay 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.750
 that can be seen if you too 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.100
 if you have the letters like "gez" 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.269
 not anymore so if you add it 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.470
 do not want to put up with one 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.950
 toenails up or how do you stand 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.049
 to 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.040
 my nails do not want that at all 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.049
 upwards because we have nothing to do with it 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.780
 the charge have signed is indeed paid 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.510
 thus the public-legal transmitter 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.560
 refinance your model 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.150
 that has nothing with our model first 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.139
 to do no touch points with 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.310
 no 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:19.170
 So you are user says yes we have 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.030
 currently well over a month 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.670
 million unique users on the platform 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.959
 of which around 700,000 in Germany 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.639
 is already a lot, so to speak 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.180
 Charge again on your servers 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:31.560
 weighs this whole topic so prof 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.459
 how is the picture quality click the 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.049
 if still like a scene 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.000
 big event is my complete one 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.810
 cameraman said the last one has 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.799
 sometimes the tears are in the eyes 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.540
 driven 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.949
 if you say watch was there 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.120
 ever the picture pointed away so yes 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.530
 So we lied now if I did 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.200
 one would claim one has 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.400
 consistently stable image is de facto 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.860
 but so most of our users 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.690
 in fact most of the time stable 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.459
 picture we have one again 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.640
 Recommendation quote from i think last 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.670
 user survey 98 that is total 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.650
 which is the satisfaction big it is 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.270
 always comes back to problems 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.980
 that's because we are on the one hand 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.630
 not the way to the inn user 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.520
 control the open internet 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.890
 that is, although we try our 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.300
 Partner the signal as close as possible 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.190
 to bring to the end user 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.720
 but it always stays one piece on the 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.640
 way the end of the chain over the local 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.049
 Internet service provider is ours 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.519
 can not control because of that 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.090
 it at different places 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.590
 possibilities where it to or the 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.150
 Satisfied problems can result 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.310
 How do you get that kind of thing? 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.290
 massive user requests as with an em 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.500
 or wm at a free-air concert no 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.970
 I do not know how to cushion something 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.030
 through years of further development of the 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.610
 certain technology exists now 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.260
 2006 live and of course came in the 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.060
 history of the tourist again and again 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.100
 to narrow at different points 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.360
 yes and one bottleneck after another 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.310
 has been fixed over time 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.340
 nice to have us always a bit too 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.960
 farewell to the horizon when we look 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.760
 speak again for twelve months now 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.110
 my favorite question at the end what 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.660
 are your goals that you have set 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.250
 does not flow very much for this year 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.640
 quite clearly on our Germany 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.350
 list 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.789
 We are in Switzerland if you have it 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.930
 compares a lot to germany 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.789
 present in switzerland knows 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.810
 Actually, almost everyone does and if he does 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.700
 no one does not know any of ours 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.900
 Competitor if you are in a year 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.760
 we still have to speak again 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.500
 more stations on the platform we have 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.270
 are on even more devices on it 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.340
 we are opening up smardtv devices 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.110
 are present on the xbox so in the 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.160
 direction to go on if you put them in 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.900
 We would speak again for a year 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.390
 probably even in a little bit even 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.620
 be active in two other countries and 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.450
 surely it will be the one or the other 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.410
 other bigger b-to-b's till then 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.900
 also to report 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:38.060
 and then we push the thumb thank you 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.060
 this conversation and heartfelt thanks
