00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.399
 [Music] 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.980
 Talk about beauty, but here too. 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.000
 bringing you another video 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.480
 tutorial this time to teach you 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.350
 how to do zé nilson how to revisit the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.550
 cm oz which is responsible for keeping the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.970
 street settings of your god né 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.669
 it is a simple quick and easy method 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.840
 but whoever has never done so will have 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.969
 difficulties 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.149
 the first step if you do not know the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.090
 open the instruction manual and 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.230
 look for something related to 10 bilson 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.390
 objects in oz there will show the position 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.110
 correct that you will locate your 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.620
 motherboard for you will be able to reset 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:01:02.370
 there are two types to reject the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:05.610
 that takes you out of that battery you take out 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.140
 the battery and leave it for about 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:15.570
 five minutes a little to 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.210
 I can only take it. 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.810
 this thesis you can take the battery 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.810
 that this is a lithium battery in the 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.600
 drums 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.270
 You leave outside for a few minutes. 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.040
 still depending on your motherboard you 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.840
 will have to leave about 15 minutes 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.150
 because the capacitors performed a 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.220
 lightweight of it manages to maintain energy 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.350
 for a while some components of part 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.689
 you can keep it then you 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.700
 power outlet 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.430
 the battery and leave the battery 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:56.850
 time later you put the battery 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:02:00.329
 again alone there because it is through 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.869
 one certain did this forehead if rejected 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.210
 beauty results will reject the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.629
 second option 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.770
 some old motherboards they already come 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:18.430
 Position Forward I already know 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:19.630
 here's called chassis cmr tc is the 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.850
 Customer is yes 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:31.270
 I will show you here is this okay 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:34.150
 Certain, he's responsible for rejecting. 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:43.750
 place an auto focus here 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:45.280
 you can see the chassis if it is 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.360
 third 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.550
 So this dinner is this for who 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.700
 Never saw this is a front is a 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.390
 basically in is made with the 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.600
 that allows you to join the 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:05.440
 idea of espionage then are three pins 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.290
 here the position 1 and 2 becomes normal 2 and 3 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.730
 that moving here on semiose bread 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.320
 Are you going to try to connect your computer? 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.360
 computer and may even fight but it will not 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.590
 give video or simply it will not 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.550
 to deny right? 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.430
 done that you just remove pinning 2 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.070
 position 23 playing at a point in the league 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.709
 two that way here 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.320
 the beyoncé reset sure will be 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.570
 made then the settings come back 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.150
 according to the pattern the factory idea 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.700
 be the asus gigabyte msi etc 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.580
 this test this editorial video was 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.730
 made with the motherboard asus in 1488 tv 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.640
 go is basically all 17 thousand cef 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.490
 near the battery or near the bilstein 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.740
 this pinning these tires do not currently 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.930
 is three more just two pins and no 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.740
 come with this fast because you put 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.870
 the front 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.550
 he will stay to reset without dinner and 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.070
 It gets normal so you have to 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.550
 get a front to put on that 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.530
 customer's position was basically 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.170
 this has the procedure in mind 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.640
 Doing the test can be doing not 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.530
 has no risk even because as well as 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.570
 we are going back standard is usually 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.239
 done when there is a problem on the board 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.380
 mother to government put forum where the 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.480
 motherboard can not run 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.040
 these settings automatically on the 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.050
 so you can be doing it there 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.930
 to get rid of some 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.520
 haul a beauty a course to a defect goes 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.900
 go out to those who like the big hug to 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.900
 and all paid for by
