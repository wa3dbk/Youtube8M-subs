00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
Leno everyone I found some parts of them

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.080 
Leno everyone I found some parts of them
to<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:36.869> vastly<00:01:37.380> overrated<00:01:37.979> how<00:01:38.579> we<00:01:38.640> played<00:01:38.970> in

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
to be vastly overrated how we played in

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.880 
to be vastly overrated how we played in
game<00:01:39.329> well<00:01:39.720> some<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> other<00:01:40.229> stats<00:01:40.590> were

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
game well some of the other stats were

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.670 
game well some of the other stats were
on<00:01:41.070> par<00:01:41.340> from<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.420> rating<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.899> found<00:01:43.259> him<00:01:43.560> in

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
on par from the rating I found him in

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.770 
on par from the rating I found him in
some<00:01:43.950> respects<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.759> very<00:01:45.030> similar<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
some respects to be very similar to a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.149 
some respects to be very similar to a
second<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.290> form<00:01:46.530> which<00:01:46.680> goes<00:01:46.890> for<00:01:47.070> about

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
second in form which goes for about

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.160 
second in form which goes for about
seventy<00:01:47.729> thousand<00:01:48.240> coins<00:01:48.360> cheaper<00:01:48.899> this

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
seventy thousand coins cheaper this

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.080 
seventy thousand coins cheaper this
doesn't<00:01:49.439> mean<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.890> he's<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> bad<00:01:50.549> card<00:01:50.939> in

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
doesn't mean that he's a bad card in

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.149 
doesn't mean that he's a bad card in
general<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.930> felt<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.229> when<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.829> looked

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
out of this card he looked better than

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.770 
out of this card he looked better than
most<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.130> team<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.490> seasons<00:01:59.909> or<00:02:00.180> informs

gonna<00:02:04.680> start<00:02:05.009> off<00:02:05.130> with<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.430> positioning

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
gonna start off with this positioning

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.700 
gonna start off with this positioning
which<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.390> found<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.930> be<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.290> biggest

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
which I found to be the biggest

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.520 
which I found to be the biggest
overrated<00:02:08.369> part<00:02:08.640> about<00:02:09.300> him<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.750> did<00:02:10.080> not<00:02:10.229> bring

the<00:02:19.019> problem<00:02:19.379> was<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:19.799> 10<00:02:20.010> opportunities<00:02:20.670> he

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
the problem was on 10 opportunities he

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.030 
the problem was on 10 opportunities he
would<00:02:21.209> not<00:02:21.420> cut<00:02:21.690> down<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.140> angle<00:02:22.500> well<00:02:22.620> he

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
would not cut down the angle well he

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.949 
would not cut down the angle well he
would<00:02:23.220> leave<00:02:23.400> too<00:02:23.700> much<00:02:23.849> space<00:02:24.150> for<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.780> ball

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
would leave too much space for the ball

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.089 
would leave too much space for the ball
to<00:02:25.110> be<00:02:25.230> kicked<00:02:25.440> through<00:02:25.680> him<00:02:25.769> he<00:02:25.890> wouldn't

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
to be kicked through him he wouldn't

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.619 
to be kicked through him he wouldn't
take<00:02:26.280> up<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.580> lot<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.760> space<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.120> net<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.599> he

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
take up a lot of space in net and he

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.390 
take up a lot of space in net and he
would<00:02:28.110> leave<00:02:28.349> space<00:02:28.680> for<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.980> ball<00:02:29.129> to<00:02:29.280> go

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
would leave space for the ball to go

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.550 
would leave space for the ball to go
past<00:02:29.760> him<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.390> see<00:02:30.599> here<00:02:30.840> it's<00:02:30.989> across<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.470> the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
past him you see here it's across to the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.920 
past him you see here it's across to the
left<00:02:31.739> side<00:02:31.980> he<00:02:32.610> moves<00:02:32.849> over<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.209> look<00:02:33.420> to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
left side he moves over to the look to

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.360 
left side he moves over to the look to
the<00:02:34.019> right<00:02:34.140> side<00:02:34.349> and<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.590> that's<00:02:34.769> good<00:02:35.099> but

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
the right side and that that's good but

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.860 
the right side and that that's good but
he<00:02:35.579> leaves<00:02:35.760> way<00:02:36.000> too<00:02:36.060> much<00:02:36.329> space<00:02:36.540> on<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.840> left

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
he leaves way too much space on the left

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.110 
he leaves way too much space on the left
side<00:02:37.170> he<00:02:37.590> runs<00:02:37.860> too<00:02:38.040> far<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.519> that<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:38.819> an<00:02:38.940> easy

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
side he runs too far and that is an easy

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.910 
side he runs too far and that is an easy
goal<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.900> shouldn't<00:02:40.409> happen<00:02:40.560> for<00:02:40.890> a

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
goal that shouldn't happen for a

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.949 
goal that shouldn't happen for a
goalkeeper<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.519> this<00:02:41.700> caliber<00:02:42.239> I<00:02:42.420> would<00:02:42.720> find

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
goalkeeper of this caliber I would find

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.809 
goalkeeper of this caliber I would find
on<00:02:43.170> 101<00:02:43.530> opportunities<00:02:44.129> he<00:02:44.280> would<00:02:44.400> just<00:02:44.579> fall

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
on 101 opportunities he would just fall

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.699 
on 101 opportunities he would just fall
down<00:02:44.849> not<00:02:45.629> even<00:02:45.750> falling<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.290> where<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.530> ball

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
down not even falling to where the ball

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:47.960 
down not even falling to where the ball
was<00:02:46.890> so<00:02:47.040> he<00:02:47.129> could<00:02:47.160> save<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.519> just<00:02:47.670> falling

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
was so he could save it just falling

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.430 
was so he could save it just falling
down<00:02:48.090> in<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.299> ball<00:02:48.510> would<00:02:48.720> go<00:02:48.930> past<00:02:49.200> him

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
down in the ball would go past him

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.990 
down in the ball would go past him
generally<00:02:49.980> his<00:02:50.129> position<00:02:50.579> wouldn't<00:02:50.849> be<00:02:50.970> a

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
generally his position wouldn't be a

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.940 
generally his position wouldn't be a
problem<00:02:51.359> against<00:02:51.959> longer<00:02:52.349> shots<00:02:52.590> cuz<00:02:52.829> he<00:02:52.920> has

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
problem against longer shots cuz he has

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.009 
problem against longer shots cuz he has
nice<00:02:53.280> timing<00:02:53.609> but<00:02:54.120> on<00:02:54.239> closer<00:02:54.450> shots<00:02:54.840> they

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
nice timing but on closer shots they

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.599 
nice timing but on closer shots they
would<00:02:55.140> be<00:02:55.230> more<00:02:55.410> of<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.680> problem<00:02:55.859> now<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.430> move

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
would be more of a problem now to move

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.640 
would be more of a problem now to move
on<00:02:56.849> to<00:02:57.090> his<00:02:57.239> reflexes<00:02:57.599> you<00:02:58.140> can<00:02:58.290> just<00:02:58.440> start

the reflexes they were at 92 he would

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.140 
the reflexes they were at 92 he would
react<00:03:28.349> slowly<00:03:28.739> on<00:03:29.069> parts<00:03:29.430> they<00:03:29.609> weren't<00:03:29.940> bad

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
react slowly on parts they weren't bad

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.089 
react slowly on parts they weren't bad
reflexes<00:03:30.900> but<00:03:31.260> they<00:03:31.410> weren't<00:03:31.590> consistent

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
reflexes but they weren't consistent

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.430

enough<00:03:32.669> to<00:03:32.849> be<00:03:32.970> generally<00:03:33.480> good<00:03:33.660> I've<00:03:33.959> played

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440

really<00:03:41.160> feel<00:03:41.310> like<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.699> for<00:03:41.879> me<00:03:41.970> is<00:03:42.120> handling

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
really feel like that for me is handling

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.470 
really feel like that for me is handling
an<00:03:42.870> 88<00:03:43.440> he<00:03:43.949> wouldn't<00:03:44.280> catch<00:03:44.549> every<00:03:44.819> ball<00:03:45.030> what

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
an 88 he wouldn't catch every ball what

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.970 
an 88 he wouldn't catch every ball what
I<00:03:45.510> found<00:03:45.750> useful<00:03:46.019> about<00:03:46.319> his<00:03:46.440> handling<00:03:46.829> is

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
I found useful about his handling is

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.020 
I found useful about his handling is
that<00:03:47.099> he<00:03:47.250> would<00:03:47.370> push<00:03:47.579> it<00:03:47.669> off<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:47.940> side

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
that he would push it off to the side

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.330 
that he would push it off to the side
really<00:03:48.810> before<00:03:48.989> so<00:03:49.319> you<00:03:49.379> can<00:03:49.500> swap<00:03:49.949> the<00:03:49.980> ball

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
really before so you can swap the ball

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.220 
really before so you can swap the ball
out<00:03:50.549> to<00:03:50.699> the<00:03:50.819> side<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:51.449> I<00:03:51.510> felt<00:03:51.750> was<00:03:51.810> handling

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
out to the side so I felt was handling

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.110 
out to the side so I felt was handling
something<00:03:52.709> pretty<00:03:52.919> good<00:03:53.069> because<00:03:53.370> with<00:03:53.849> near

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
something pretty good because with near

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.000 
something pretty good because with near
ponds<00:03:54.359> with<00:03:54.599> near<00:03:54.840> shots<00:03:55.199> you<00:03:55.500> can't<00:03:55.769> really

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
ponds with near shots you can't really

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.500 
ponds with near shots you can't really
catch<00:03:56.430> every<00:03:56.730> single<00:03:57.060> ball<00:03:57.180> which<00:03:57.329> I've

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
catch every single ball which I've

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.849 
catch every single ball which I've
noticed<00:03:57.780> with<00:03:57.810> goalkeepers<00:03:58.379> well<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:58.650> felt

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
noticed with goalkeepers well I felt

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.439 
noticed with goalkeepers well I felt
like<00:03:58.949> that's<00:03:59.160> a<00:03:59.400> quick<00:03:59.579> positive<00:04:00.120> one<00:04:00.299> of<00:04:00.389> the
