I<00:01:13.850> could

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
I could

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.220 
I could
and<00:01:14.580> then<00:01:15.120> support<00:01:15.480> was<00:01:15.600> kind<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.960> release

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
and then support was kind of a release

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.190 
and then support was kind of a release
button<00:01:16.620> and<00:01:17.250> then<00:01:17.910> when<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.390> got<00:01:18.600> injured<00:01:18.780> I

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
didn't have that release button so I

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.950 
didn't have that release button so I
thought<00:01:20.790> I'll<00:01:21.180> just<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.510> out<00:01:21.660> and<00:01:21.840> do
