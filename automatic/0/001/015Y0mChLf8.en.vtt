points in this video the absolute basics

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.140 
points in this video the absolute basics
and<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.350> fourth<00:00:16.619> one<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.490> one<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> lot<00:00:18.060> of

for<00:01:43.979> commentaries<00:01:44.399> but<00:01:44.579> they<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.850> cost

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
for commentaries but they can cost

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.679
