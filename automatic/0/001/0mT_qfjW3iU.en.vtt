00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
have mine magic and of course Magic the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.660 
have mine magic and of course Magic the
Gathering<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:40.200> probably<00:00:40.680> one<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.219> oldest

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
Gathering is probably one of the oldest

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.430 
Gathering is probably one of the oldest
and<00:00:41.879> one<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.120> most<00:00:42.329> reliable<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:43.050> terms<00:00:43.260> of

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
and one of the most reliable in terms of

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.889 
and one of the most reliable in terms of
that<00:00:43.620> type<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.219> John<00:00:44.489> rah<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.690> think

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that type of a John rah but I think

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.930 
that type of a John rah but I think
really<00:00:46.140> what<00:00:46.320> hearthstone<00:00:46.920> does<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.460> kind<00:00:47.820> of

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
really what hearthstone does is kind of

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.029 
really what hearthstone does is kind of
captures<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.539> novelty<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.469> trading<00:00:49.860> card

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
captures that novelty of a trading card

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.939 
captures that novelty of a trading card
game<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:51.059> still<00:00:51.480> makes<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.320> casual

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
game but still makes it a casual

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.350 
game but still makes it a casual
experience<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.789> that's<00:00:53.940> something<00:00:54.149> you

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
experience and that's something you

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.990 
experience and that's something you
can't<00:00:54.629> really<00:00:54.899> say<00:00:55.140> about<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:56.000> magic

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
can't really say about on magic

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.510 
can't really say about on magic
especially<00:00:57.859> games<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.100> hearth<00:00:59.250> stone

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
especially games in the hearth stone

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.959 
especially games in the hearth stone
like<00:00:59.940> last<00:01:00.210> from<00:01:01.079> two<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.160> ten<00:01:02.579> minutes

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
like last from two to ten minutes

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.359 
like last from two to ten minutes
they're<00:01:03.270> short<00:01:03.629> games<00:01:03.979> they're<00:01:04.979> accessible

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
they're short games they're accessible

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.109 
they're short games they're accessible
they're<00:01:05.880> easy<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.270> play<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.780> very<00:01:07.229> simple

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
they're easy to play it's very simple

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.910 
they're easy to play it's very simple
gaming<00:01:09.119> concept<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:10.049> course<00:01:10.409> there's<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.740> lot

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
gaming concept of course there's a lot

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.109 
gaming concept of course there's a lot
of<00:01:10.950> different<00:01:11.369> moves<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.820> there's<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
of different moves and there's the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.270 
of different moves and there's the
really<00:01:12.570> high<00:01:12.720> skill<00:01:13.260> curve<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.770> skill<00:01:14.040> gap

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
really high skill curve in the skill gap

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.990 
really high skill curve in the skill gap
but<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.330> overall<00:01:15.689> fundamental<00:01:17.000> structure

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
but the overall fundamental structure

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.210 
but the overall fundamental structure
and<00:01:18.330> idea<00:01:18.600> for<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.080> game<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> gameplay

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and idea for the game and the gameplay

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.390 
and idea for the game and the gameplay
itself<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:21.290> really<00:01:22.290> really<00:01:22.830> simple<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.280> that

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
itself is really really simple and that

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.190 
itself is really really simple and that
makes<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.790> easy<00:01:23.939> just<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.479> anyone<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.900> pick<00:01:25.049> it

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
makes it easy just for anyone to pick it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.800 
makes it easy just for anyone to pick it
up<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.560> have<00:01:25.680> fun<00:01:25.920> with<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.600> that's<00:01:27.600> kind

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
up and have fun with it and that's kind

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.960 
up and have fun with it and that's kind
of<00:01:27.840> mean<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.049> nutshell<00:01:28.350> because<00:01:28.950> I'm<00:01:29.610> not
