 hello youtube friends very good 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:09.030
 Welcome to my new video tutorial on 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.710
 which will teach you how to download a 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.700
 iso image for a wii games or 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.190
 for an emulator it's worth 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.170
 the next video is dedicated to a 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.689
 my friend of the month in which I wonder 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.150
 how to get a wii game not and how 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.700
 download it but it seems that it cost 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.140
 a little bit and it's good the first thing 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.669
 we have to do is the following for 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.009
 can download the game and it's called 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.509
 easy and anything goes we have to have in 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.380
 this program that is here that is called 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.840
 youtube what under vale 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.790
 because we need this 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.430
 this program this program what does 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.590
 is to collect all the links of the 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.210
 download that is all 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.810
 all the links that come in the 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.800
 download for the image is worth as they 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.540
 I will teach here for example here 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.300
 imagine that they want to declare a game 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.720
 of 47 league not 30 or 20 whatever 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.720
 OK 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.800
 will disappear as well as this is worth 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.540
 these are all clean examples of 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.710
 the things that I want to download in 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.660
 what this program does is pick up 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.820
 all and start downloading without that 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.950
 you have to crush or wait anything is worth 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.140
 goes one by one to one for one is like that 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.970
 depending on the speed of your 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.710
 internet that you have clear 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.940
 good let's continue good this is the program 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.380
 that I have already told you what is called google 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.840
 of the Andes' you can download it is a 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.630
 free program easy to use both for 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:31.310
 xp like for windows vista ok 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.310
 well I will minimize this 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.310
 I will open here he 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.230
 the explorer that you have for 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.350
 default 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.650
 daley in my case uses firefox that is going 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.960
 very well 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.810
 here I already had an image of a game 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.450
 it is for pc that I opted for 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.520
 Mario Kart because he 's the one who asked me 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.350
 my friend is worth for example if I want 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.000
 download the easy mario kart game 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.539

 put here bums 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.150
 uy it's worth it without any more we put here 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.610
 it's worth once we 're here it will open a 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.890
 as many pages as normal and where 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.190
 put nintendo wii forum vago we are going to

 OK 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.959
 this does not appear that is where 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.969
 supposedly the games are good a 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.189
 advice the best thing will be to register for 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:39.159

 make it easier for me everything is worth it 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.980
 I'm not an expert in making videos 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.270
 but well I try to help people who 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.270

 this is true once we enter the 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.960

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:10.240
 enter you will appear this here vale 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.370
 the first to the first 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.140
 the things that are here are for example 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.130
 who talk a little about the games of the 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.810
 wii virtualization is and everything is 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.310
 then go down a little and you can appreciate 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.130
 all the games that there is all of this

 if you keep going down you will find much more and 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.330
 if you give here for example to the second 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.820
 page 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.590

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:45.000
 variety of games for both apple and 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.520
 for in etc it's worth to transform you 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.980
 here my games appear to me 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.810
 as my friend asked me the one of mario kart 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.860
 I'm going to do that I'm going to look for mario's 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.200
 kart if they want to look for a game in 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.549
 Specifically what they have to do is 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.409
 put in the search engine the game that 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.790
 they want in the search engine I mean the 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.550
 seeker that is inside the page 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:07.350
 I 'll put it here here 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.950
 vagos.es I'll give it here and I'll put 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.950
 here 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.560
 mario care 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.840
 go perfect I give you click 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.250
 I hope you download good vale here 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.990
 teaches everything that is worth 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.030
 well here you know that it is depending 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.249
 of what you are looking for and if you are looking 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.660
 pal 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:36.690
 because if you're looking 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.970
 the region uses depending for example 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.560
 here is a mario kart that is used that 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.060
 was putting the pin that is for the 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.130
 emulator 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.630
 because it's worth as much to the emulator as 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.569
 for the wii because it is an image 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.309
 iso no problem 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:51.160
 for example I 'm going to wear this mario 

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:53.730
 kart wii pal in Spanish 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.730
 I give him here 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.360
 but what will there be 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.980
 ok we have it here 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.030
 sometimes what I meant 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.920
 let's load well usually understand 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.920
 images 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.370
 it's taking a little 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:33.370
 well ok I do not know why I'm going to 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:35.960
 put the description of the game how much 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.840
 weigh and everything is worth 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.120
 it's very easy and this would be the links of the 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.820
 game 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.390
 like this name at the beginning of the video 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.490
 this program what does 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.290
 in collecting all this I am here so that 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.020
 you do not have to be giving it one by one 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:55.140
 for one what it does is choose and make 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:58.440
 this then left click you give to 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:01.230
 copy it and automatically you 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.440
 will appear here where it puts capturing 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:06.360
 links worth it would come out to you once you 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.640
 you have them here that I put you that are 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.800
 online the links are active 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.320
 that what it does is give you add all 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.270
 the links and they will appear to you here then 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.670
 It's worth as I have these here and to the point 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.470
 download 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.050
 once you have them here what does 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:24.020
 is to play and start the download and 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.620
 outside and you forget to be watching and 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.500
 controlling the download voucher 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.240
 well this is easy as we have seen 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:36.510
 I hope you have served this video 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.820
 tutorial and if you have any questions 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.930
 or something, I do not know, what does it tell me? 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.930
