color action and this is just going to

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.840 
color action and this is just going to
give<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.500> very<00:01:22.530> clean<00:01:23.340> deep<00:01:23.790> rich<00:01:24.180> color<00:01:24.930> and

look we're just gonna give that at about

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.389 
look we're just gonna give that at about
35%<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:54.299> can<00:01:55.259> also<00:01:55.380> come<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.920> tweak<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
35% I can also come in and tweak the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.889 
35% I can also come in and tweak the
layers<00:01:56.610> make<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.210> little<00:01:57.390> bit<00:01:57.509> brighter

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.450 

or<00:02:01.729> decrease<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.969> vignette<00:02:03.359> or<00:02:04.460> increase

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
or decrease the vignette or increase

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.969 
or decrease the vignette or increase
make<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.030> little<00:02:06.210> warmer<00:02:06.630> still<00:02:06.979> should

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
make it a little warmer still should

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.029 
make it a little warmer still should
probably<00:02:08.429> would<00:02:08.580> do<00:02:09.019> okay<00:02:10.019> so<00:02:10.080> there<00:02:10.709> we<00:02:10.739> have

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
probably would do okay so there we have

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.509 
probably would do okay so there we have
the<00:02:11.069> velvet<00:02:11.819> color<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:13.080> deep<00:02:13.379> color<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:14.069> could

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
the velvet color the deep color I could

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.640 
the velvet color the deep color I could
also<00:02:14.640> make<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.090> little<00:02:15.269> bit<00:02:15.420> deeper<00:02:15.660> by

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
also make it a little bit deeper by

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.740 
also make it a little bit deeper by
clicking<00:02:17.310> either<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.640> depth<00:02:18.030> or<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.360> boost

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
clicking either the depth or the boost

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.320 
clicking either the depth or the boost
actions<00:02:20.480> okay<00:02:22.700> let's<00:02:23.700> go<00:02:23.910> for<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.150> different

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
actions okay let's go for a different

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:32.030 
actions okay let's go for a different
edit<00:02:24.780> now<00:02:24.930> let's<00:02:25.230> try<00:02:25.530> fawn<00:02:30.829> and<00:02:31.829> that's

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
edit now let's try fawn and that's

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.140 
edit now let's try fawn and that's
without<00:02:32.459> living<00:02:32.700> yet<00:02:34.099> on<00:02:35.099> top<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.579> fawn<00:02:35.819> let's

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
without living yet on top of fawn let's

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.610 
without living yet on top of fawn let's
try<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.569> little<00:02:36.780> blue<00:02:37.110> secret<00:02:39.260> it's<00:02:40.260> one<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.530> the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
try a little blue secret it's one of the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.979 
try a little blue secret it's one of the
artistic<00:02:40.920> add-ons<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:42.510> I'm<00:02:42.630> just<00:02:42.840> going<00:02:42.959> to

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
artistic add-ons and I'm just going to

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.300 
artistic add-ons and I'm just going to
decrease<00:02:43.319> that<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.650> little<00:02:43.920> bit<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:44.280> just

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
decrease that a little bit and just

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.420 
decrease that a little bit and just
bring<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.730> up<00:02:44.849> a<00:02:44.940> tiny<00:02:45.180> bit<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.920> can<00:02:46.980> always

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
bring it up a tiny bit and I can always

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.640 
bring it up a tiny bit and I can always
run<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.269> depth<00:02:48.569> or<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.930> boost<00:02:49.170> this<00:02:49.440> time

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
run the depth or the boost this time

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.750 
run the depth or the boost this time
I'll<00:02:49.799> run<00:02:49.950> depth<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:52.920> don't<00:02:53.099> actually<00:02:53.280> like

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
I'll run depth and I don't actually like

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.809 
I'll run depth and I don't actually like
the<00:02:53.790> depth<00:02:54.209> all<00:02:54.420> there<00:02:56.120> okay<00:02:58.220> so<00:02:59.220> finally

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
the depth all there okay so finally

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.629 
the depth all there okay so finally
let's<00:03:00.060> try<00:03:00.360> it<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:01.260> one<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.560> my<00:03:01.650> very<00:03:02.099> favorite

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
let's try it in one of my very favorite

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.220 
let's try it in one of my very favorite
options<00:03:02.970> in<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.209> set<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.660> is<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.930> dusk

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
options in the set and that is the dusk

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.979 
options in the set and that is the dusk
action<00:03:06.019> and<00:03:07.019> there<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.069> is<00:03:08.359> likely<00:03:09.359> I<00:03:09.870> would

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
action and there it is likely I would

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.220 
action and there it is likely I would
decrease<00:03:10.859> the<00:03:10.920> foggy<00:03:11.540> foggy<00:03:12.540> brown<00:03:12.870> in<00:03:13.109> this

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
decrease the foggy foggy brown in this

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.839 
decrease the foggy foggy brown in this
photo<00:03:13.470> there<00:03:13.980> we<00:03:14.250> go

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
photo there we go

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.370 
photo there we go
that's<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.389> right<00:03:15.599> there<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:17.450> again<00:03:18.450> I<00:03:18.900> can<00:03:19.230> go

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
that's it right there and again I can go

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.920 
that's it right there and again I can go
down<00:03:19.560> here<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:20.069> click<00:03:20.280> boost<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:21.090> just<00:03:21.720> give

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
down here and click boost and just give

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.580 
down here and click boost and just give
it<00:03:22.049> that<00:03:22.440> much<00:03:22.680> more<00:03:22.980> punch<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.579> pop<00:03:24.590> just

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
it that much more punch and pop just

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.259 
it that much more punch and pop just
also<00:03:26.040> comes<00:03:26.310> with<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.519> brush<00:03:26.730> on<00:03:26.880> light<00:03:27.090> and

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
also comes with a brush on light and

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.909 
also comes with a brush on light and
brush<00:03:27.450> on<00:03:27.599> dark<00:03:27.840> layer<00:03:28.079> if<00:03:28.349> you<00:03:28.410> want<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:28.799> go

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
brush on dark layer if you want to go

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.229 
brush on dark layer if you want to go
ahead<00:03:29.069> and<00:03:29.220> do<00:03:29.489> some<00:03:29.730> dodging<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.209> burning

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
ahead and do some dodging and burning

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.670 
ahead and do some dodging and burning
and<00:03:31.370> let's<00:03:32.370> lower<00:03:32.639> the<00:03:32.849> opacity<00:03:32.970> way<00:03:33.510> down<00:03:33.750> and

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
and let's lower the opacity way down and

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.789 
and let's lower the opacity way down and
see<00:03:34.980> how<00:03:35.130> that<00:03:35.190> looks<00:03:36.019> just<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.410> give<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.590> a

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
see how that looks just to give it a

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.750 
see how that looks just to give it a
little<00:03:38.280> bit<00:03:38.549> more<00:03:39.620> depth<00:03:40.620> here

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.089 

okay<00:03:45.760> so<00:03:46.390> then<00:03:46.540> we<00:03:46.659> have<00:03:46.840> our<00:03:47.049> before<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:48.010> our

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
okay so then we have our before and our

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.430 
okay so then we have our before and our
after<00:03:48.580> and<00:03:48.879> those<00:03:49.840> were<00:03:49.989> just<00:03:50.110> quick<00:03:50.409> edits

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
after and those were just quick edits

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.899 
after and those were just quick edits
but<00:03:53.440> I<00:03:54.629> actually<00:03:55.629> think<00:03:55.900> my<00:03:55.989> favorite<00:03:56.560> is<00:03:56.909> the

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
but I actually think my favorite is the

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.300 
but I actually think my favorite is the
velvet<00:03:58.390> color<00:03:58.629> with<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:58.930> mushroom<00:03:59.349> whoa
