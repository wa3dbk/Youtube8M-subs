thing<00:00:26.110> about<00:00:26.350> it<00:00:26.680> is<00:00:26.770> actually<00:00:26.950> this<00:00:27.250> is<00:00:27.400> html5

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
thing about it is actually this is html5

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.650 
thing about it is actually this is html5
so<00:00:28.930> this<00:00:29.050> is<00:00:29.080> html5<00:00:29.650> canvas<00:00:29.950> and<00:00:30.340> WebGL<00:00:30.550> so<00:00:31.360> if

them<00:02:10.000> live<00:02:10.240> in<00:02:10.270> canvas<00:02:10.990> so<00:02:11.200> we<00:02:11.320> can<00:02:11.470> saturate

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
them live in canvas so we can saturate

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.070 
them live in canvas so we can saturate
the<00:02:12.160> image<00:02:12.430> or<00:02:12.940> we<00:02:13.180> can<00:02:13.330> actually<00:02:13.510> blur<00:02:13.900> the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
you developer it to quite a time saver

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.699 
you developer it to quite a time saver
because<00:04:14.150> it's<00:04:14.450> really<00:04:14.690> annoying<00:04:14.930> to<00:04:15.079> debug<00:04:15.500> on

you're sending things to the phone so a

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.550 
you're sending things to the phone so a
quick<00:04:19.609> question<00:04:20.180> for<00:04:20.389> you<00:04:20.449> on<00:04:20.690> Android<00:04:21.229> it's

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
quick question for you on Android it's

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.159 
quick question for you on Android it's
important<00:04:22.160> to<00:04:22.310> some<00:04:22.729> users<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.389> have<00:04:23.570> root

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
important to some users to have root

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.960 
important to some users to have root
access<00:04:24.460> is<00:04:25.460> there<00:04:25.820> something<00:04:26.600> similar<00:04:27.289> on

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
access is there something similar on

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.629 
access is there something similar on
firefox<00:04:28.970> that<00:04:29.440> not<00:04:30.440> on<00:04:30.590> firefox<00:04:31.130> i<00:04:31.310> mean<00:04:31.490> you

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
firefox that not on firefox i mean you

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.390 
firefox that not on firefox i mean you
can<00:04:31.820> boot<00:04:32.180> to<00:04:32.360> gecko<00:04:32.389> so<00:04:32.990> i'm<00:04:33.949> not<00:04:34.099> quite<00:04:34.370> sure

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
can boot to gecko so i'm not quite sure

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.550 
can boot to gecko so i'm not quite sure
but<00:04:34.699> i'm<00:04:35.060> thinking<00:04:35.389> and<00:04:35.960> think<00:04:36.229> it<00:04:36.320> will<00:04:36.440> be

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
but i'm thinking and think it will be

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.500 
but i'm thinking and think it will be
the<00:04:36.650> same<00:04:36.860> way<00:04:37.099> you<00:04:37.400> can<00:04:37.580> get<00:04:37.699> root<00:04:37.910> access<00:04:38.090> to

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
the same way you can get root access to

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.939 
the same way you can get root access to
it<00:04:38.630> as<00:04:38.750> well<00:04:38.780> because<00:04:39.139> it's<00:04:39.380> just<00:04:39.500> another

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
it as well because it's just another

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.279 
it as well because it's just another
unique<00:04:40.669> score<00:04:40.940> on<00:04:41.180> at<00:04:41.360> lose<00:04:41.570> power<00:04:41.870> but<00:04:42.169> by

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
unique score on at lose power but by

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.260 
unique score on at lose power but by
default<00:04:42.530> it's<00:04:42.979> not<00:04:43.160> going<00:04:43.430> to<00:04:43.580> provide<00:04:43.880> root

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
default it's not going to provide root

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.870 
default it's not going to provide root
access<00:04:44.510> to<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.110> user<00:04:45.289> probably<00:04:46.010> for<00:04:46.250> security

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
access to the user probably for security

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.659 
access to the user probably for security
I<00:04:47.030> think<00:04:47.690> you<00:04:47.780> actually<00:04:48.620> not<00:04:48.860> security<00:04:49.430> the

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
I think you actually not security the

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.700 
I think you actually not security the
more<00:04:49.849> like<00:04:49.970> confusion<00:04:50.330> Sonoma<00:04:51.050> and<00:04:51.139> user<00:04:51.470> is

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
more like confusion Sonoma and user is

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.010 
more like confusion Sonoma and user is

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
terminal as I am for example okay so if

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.839 
terminal as I am for example okay so if
you<00:04:57.500> have<00:04:57.650> games<00:04:57.889> you<00:04:58.220> can<00:04:58.370> cut<00:04:58.550> the<00:04:58.669> rope

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
you have games you can cut the rope

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:00.400 
you have games you can cut the rope

exactly the same as you would expect it
on<00:05:59.020> Android<00:05:59.440> and<00:05:59.710> the<00:06:00.130> responsiveness<00:06:00.850> is

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
on Android and the responsiveness is

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.520 
on Android and the responsiveness is
really<00:06:01.450> really<00:06:01.570> good<00:06:01.780> as<00:06:01.930> well<00:06:01.960> and<00:06:02.320> therefore

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
really really good as well and therefore

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.650 
really really good as well and therefore
I<00:06:03.010> to<00:06:03.070> pain<00:06:03.340> to<00:06:03.520> do<00:06:03.670> is<00:06:04.090> this<00:06:04.330> your<00:06:04.390> own

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
I to pain to do is this your own

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.350 
I to pain to do is this your own
keyboard<00:06:04.930> technology<00:06:05.830> no<00:06:06.760> I<00:06:06.790> think<00:06:07.000> it's

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
keyboard technology no I think it's

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.730 
keyboard technology no I think it's
actually<00:06:07.540> something<00:06:07.960> that<00:06:08.170> we've<00:06:08.530> written

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
actually something that we've written

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.310 
actually something that we've written
