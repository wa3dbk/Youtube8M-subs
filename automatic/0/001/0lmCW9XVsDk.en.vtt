alright review on the 78 a zombie hawgs

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.919 
alright review on the 78 a zombie hawgs
76-millimeter<00:00:06.799> they<00:00:08.300> don't<00:00:09.300> sound<00:00:09.540> like<00:00:09.690> they

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
76-millimeter they don't sound like they

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.240 
76-millimeter they don't sound like they
would<00:00:09.960> slide<00:00:10.320> but<00:00:10.910> they<00:00:11.910> do<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.380> I<00:00:13.380> mean<00:00:13.590> if

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
would slide but they do and I mean if

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.980 
would slide but they do and I mean if
you're<00:00:14.429> looking<00:00:14.790> into<00:00:14.910> getting<00:00:15.120> into<00:00:15.809> some

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
you're looking into getting into some

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.470 
you're looking into getting into some
nice<00:00:16.619> slides<00:00:17.039> might<00:00:18.029> want<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.510> move<00:00:19.320> up<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
nice slides might want to move up to the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.670 
nice slides might want to move up to the
itaa<00:00:21.480> or<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.990> 82<00:00:22.350> where<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.800> 84<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> but<00:00:24.680> yeah

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
itaa or the 82 where the 84 a but yeah

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.240 
itaa or the 82 where the 84 a but yeah
there<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:27.349> mean<00:00:28.349> they've<00:00:28.529> got<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> rounded

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
there I mean they've got the rounded

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.250 
there I mean they've got the rounded
lips<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.970> helps<00:00:30.210> them<00:00:30.269> push<00:00:31.050> out<00:00:31.230> a

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
lips so that helps them push out a

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.709 
lips so that helps them push out a
little<00:00:31.470> better<00:00:31.740> tiny<00:00:32.640> contact<00:00:33.210> fact<00:00:33.450> real

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
little better tiny contact fact real

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.700 
little better tiny contact fact real
small<00:00:34.370> but<00:00:35.420> that<00:00:36.420> that's<00:00:36.719> good<00:00:37.020> if<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.530> like

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
small but that that's good if you like

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.380 
small but that that's good if you like
sliding<00:00:37.980> their<00:00:38.700> side<00:00:38.969> set<00:00:39.770> which<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.850> don't

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
sliding their side set which is I don't

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.720 
sliding their side set which is I don't
know<00:00:42.450> more<00:00:43.170> preference<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.710> guess<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.160> they

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
know more preference I guess and they

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.520 
know more preference I guess and they
got<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.000> big<00:00:45.210> plastic<00:00:45.480> core<00:00:45.930> inside<00:00:46.260> which

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
got this big plastic core inside which

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.080 
got this big plastic core inside which
kind<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.920> sketch<00:00:47.129> me<00:00:47.370> out<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.520> little<00:00:47.730> bit<00:00:47.910> when

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
kind of sketch me out a little bit when

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.090 
kind of sketch me out a little bit when
I<00:00:48.120> got<00:00:48.329> these<00:00:48.539> because<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.230> thought<00:00:49.440> maybe<00:00:49.890> if

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
I got these because I thought maybe if

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.549 
I got these because I thought maybe if
that<00:00:50.280> cracks<00:00:50.610> or<00:00:50.820> something<00:00:51.210> then<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.809> know

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
that cracks or something then you know

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.160 
that cracks or something then you know
wheels<00:00:52.949> will<00:00:53.160> be<00:00:53.280> worth<00:00:53.699> listen<00:00:54.120> but<00:00:54.899> it's

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
wheels will be worth listen but it's

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.689 
wheels will be worth listen but it's
actually<00:00:55.350> held<00:00:55.770> up<00:00:55.890> really<00:00:56.039> well<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.670> think

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
actually held up really well and I think

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.000 
actually held up really well and I think
that<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.539> actually<00:00:58.170> makes<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.739> wheel<00:00:58.980> a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
that it actually makes the wheel a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.549 
that it actually makes the wheel a
little<00:00:59.129> bit<00:00:59.430> harder<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:01.670> helps<00:01:02.670> it

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
little bit harder so that helps it

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.980 
little bit harder so that helps it
anyway<00:01:04.559> um<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.960> 78<00:01:07.590> days<00:01:07.740> are<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.130> blue<00:01:08.990> atas

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
anyway um the 78 days are in blue atas

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.840 
anyway um the 78 days are in blue atas
are<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:11.240> yellow<00:01:12.530> not<00:01:13.530> sure<00:01:13.799> what<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.070> 82<00:01:14.460> azar

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
are in yellow not sure what the 82 azar

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.789 
are in yellow not sure what the 82 azar
inn<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.590> know<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.009> 84<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.270> turquoise

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
inn I know the 84 a is in turquoise

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.590 
inn I know the 84 a is in turquoise
don't<00:01:19.799> know<00:01:19.920> what<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.159> 80<00:01:20.310> there<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.000> no<00:01:21.119> 86

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
don't know what the 80 there is no 86

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.320 
don't know what the 80 there is no 86
and<00:01:22.140> then<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.439> goes<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.770> DA<00:01:22.970> 88a<00:01:23.970> which<00:01:24.180> is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and then it goes to a DA 88a which is

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.179 
and then it goes to a DA 88a which is
black<00:01:24.600> um<00:01:25.490> I<00:01:27.200> recommend<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.530> mean<00:01:28.979> if<00:01:29.070> you're

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
black um I recommend I mean if you're

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.260 
black um I recommend I mean if you're
getting<00:01:29.369> these<00:01:29.549> wheels<00:01:29.850> you're<00:01:30.030> probably

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
getting these wheels you're probably

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.120 
getting these wheels you're probably
looking<00:01:31.020> into<00:01:31.229> some<00:01:31.380> slides<00:01:31.710> because<00:01:31.890> they

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
looking into some slides because they

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.440 
looking into some slides because they
got<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> tiny<00:01:32.579> contact<00:01:33.030> patch<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
got the tiny contact patch in the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.280 
got the tiny contact patch in the
rounded<00:01:33.750> leben<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.290> such<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:36.090> I'd<00:01:36.869> go<00:01:37.079> with<00:01:37.229> a

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
rounded leben and such so I'd go with a

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.710 
rounded leben and such so I'd go with a
higher<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> than<00:01:38.130> i<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.430> here<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.909> thought<00:01:39.659> I

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
higher a than i have here I thought I

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.880 
higher a than i have here I thought I
was<00:01:39.930> getting<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.229> 84<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:41.070> ended<00:01:42.000> up<00:01:42.060> 78<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
was getting the 84 but ended up 78 and

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.480 
was getting the 84 but ended up 78 and
they're<00:01:43.890> still<00:01:44.070> good<00:01:44.189> wheels<00:01:44.399> um<00:01:46.490> plastic

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
they're still good wheels um plastic

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.190 
they're still good wheels um plastic
core<00:01:47.700> pushers<00:01:48.060> all<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.390> urethane<00:01:48.659> together

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
core pushers all that urethane together

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.609 
core pushers all that urethane together
and<00:01:50.060> makes<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.240> really<00:01:51.420> really<00:01:51.600> dense<00:01:52.079> which

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
and makes it really really dense which

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.590 
and makes it really really dense which
is<00:01:52.829> good<00:01:53.299> um<00:01:55.070> yeah<00:01:56.070> 76<00:01:56.700> millimeters<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.390> there
