00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
and there you go it's running off of

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.650 
and there you go it's running off of
propane<00:02:46.080> as<00:02:47.080> you<00:02:47.319> can<00:02:47.530> tell<00:02:47.770> it<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:48.660> misfiring

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
propane as you can tell it is misfiring

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.250 
propane as you can tell it is misfiring
and<00:02:50.350> that<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.890> once<00:02:51.370> again<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.660> air

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
and that is to once again to the air

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.500 
and that is to once again to the air
fuel<00:02:53.620> mixture<00:02:53.650> carburetor<00:02:54.580> adjustment

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.619 

propane<00:03:00.640> has<00:03:01.640> a<00:03:01.700> higher<00:03:02.030> combustion<00:03:04.629> ratio

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
propane has a higher combustion ratio

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.290 
propane has a higher combustion ratio
and<00:03:06.080> what<00:03:06.830> I<00:03:06.890> mean<00:03:07.099> by<00:03:07.340> that<00:03:07.370> is<00:03:07.790> when<00:03:08.120> the

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
and what I mean by that is when the

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.530 
and what I mean by that is when the
propane<00:03:08.930> is<00:03:09.260> ignited<00:03:10.129> inside<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.970> engine<00:03:11.120> in

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
propane is ignited inside the engine in

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.210 
propane is ignited inside the engine in
the<00:03:11.660> cylinder<00:03:12.080> it<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:13.640> explosion<00:03:14.890> has<00:03:15.890> more

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
the cylinder it the explosion has more

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.070 
the cylinder it the explosion has more
of<00:03:16.310> an<00:03:16.400> impact<00:03:16.550> than<00:03:16.970> gasoline<00:03:17.269> it's<00:03:17.870> more

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
of an impact than gasoline it's more

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.650 
of an impact than gasoline it's more
flammable<00:03:18.819> therefore<00:03:19.819> that's<00:03:20.180> probably

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
flammable therefore that's probably

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.960 
flammable therefore that's probably
increasing<00:03:21.349> the<00:03:21.440> horsepower<00:03:21.920> by<00:03:22.310> maybe<00:03:22.580> one

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
increasing the horsepower by maybe one

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.420 
increasing the horsepower by maybe one
not<00:03:23.810> very<00:03:23.840> much<00:03:24.380> but<00:03:24.650> it<00:03:24.800> does<00:03:24.830> make<00:03:25.099> a<00:03:25.160> little

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
not very much but it does make a little

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.789 
not very much but it does make a little
bit<00:03:25.549> of<00:03:25.610> a<00:03:25.670> difference<00:03:26.030> it<00:03:26.930> also<00:03:27.140> burns<00:03:27.530> about

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
bit of a difference it also burns about

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.199 
bit of a difference it also burns about
correct<00:03:30.799> me<00:03:30.980> if<00:03:31.069> I'm<00:03:31.220> wrong<00:03:31.250> but<00:03:31.610> I<00:03:31.670> do<00:03:31.790> believe

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
correct me if I'm wrong but I do believe

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.520 
correct me if I'm wrong but I do believe
it's<00:03:32.420> about<00:03:32.660> full<00:03:33.519> take<00:03:34.519> that<00:03:34.700> bat<00:03:34.880> more<00:03:35.180> about

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
it's about full take that bat more about

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.240 
it's about full take that bat more about
1555<00:03:36.530> maybe<00:03:37.069> even<00:03:37.280> 60%<00:03:37.730> cleaner<00:03:38.890> I'm<00:03:39.890> gonna<00:03:40.099> go

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
1555 maybe even 60% cleaner I'm gonna go

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.580 
1555 maybe even 60% cleaner I'm gonna go
and<00:03:40.549> do<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.880> research<00:03:41.079> it's<00:03:42.079> been<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:42.319> while

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
and do the research it's been a while

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.819 
and do the research it's been a while
and<00:03:43.239> if<00:03:44.239> I'm<00:03:44.540> wrong<00:03:44.720> I'll<00:03:45.140> post<00:03:45.500> it<00:03:45.709> in<00:03:45.799> the

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
and if I'm wrong I'll post it in the

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:46.630 
and if I'm wrong I'll post it in the
comments<00:03:46.310> below

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
comments below

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.020 
comments below
or<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:47.090> description<00:03:47.510> rather

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:04:09.420 

anyways<00:03:51.720> here's<00:03:51.960> a<00:03:52.050> close-up<00:03:52.320> of<00:03:52.740> the<00:03:53.720> piping

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.539 

it's<00:04:10.000> hydro<00:04:10.360> static<00:04:10.780> a<00:04:11.019> hydro<00:04:12.010> static<00:04:12.370> mower

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
it's hydro static a hydro static mower

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.630 
it's hydro static a hydro static mower
now<00:04:13.510> like<00:04:13.690> I<00:04:13.810> was<00:04:13.959> telling<00:04:14.200> you<00:04:14.349> the<00:04:15.250> throttle

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
now like I was telling you the throttle

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.909 
now like I was telling you the throttle
here<00:04:15.790> is<00:04:16.060> not<00:04:16.269> working<00:04:16.690> so<00:04:16.870> you<00:04:17.560> have<00:04:17.769> to

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
here is not working so you have to

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:47.340 
here is not working so you have to
regulate<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:18.959> with<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.169> backflow<00:04:20.949> valve

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.410 

and<00:04:48.350> that's<00:04:48.830> it<00:04:49.070> you<00:04:49.580> just<00:04:49.790> shut<00:04:50.030> it<00:04:50.120> off<00:04:50.240> right

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
and that's it you just shut it off right

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.520 
and that's it you just shut it off right
here<00:04:50.480> and<00:04:50.840> then<00:04:51.800> close<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:52.520> main<00:04:52.700> valve<00:04:52.970> and

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
here and then close the main valve and

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.810 
here and then close the main valve and
then<00:04:54.530> if<00:04:54.800> you<00:04:54.920> like<00:04:55.130> you<00:04:55.340> can<00:04:55.460> just<00:04:55.640> hit<00:04:55.760> the

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
then if you like you can just hit the

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.300 
then if you like you can just hit the
key<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:57.350> main<00:04:57.470> reason<00:04:57.890> that<00:04:57.920> you<00:04:58.070> want<00:04:58.250> to

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
key the main reason that you want to

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.740 
key the main reason that you want to
turn<00:04:58.430> it<00:04:58.580> off<00:04:58.670> here<00:04:58.880> though<00:04:59.090> is<00:04:59.390> so<00:04:59.540> that<00:04:59.690> you

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
turn it off here though is so that you

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.510 
turn it off here though is so that you
can<00:04:59.810> run<00:05:00.110> all<00:05:00.260> the<00:05:00.380> fuel<00:05:00.620> out<00:05:00.650> of<00:05:00.800> the<00:05:00.950> line<00:05:01.160> and

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
can run all the fuel out of the line and

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.780 
can run all the fuel out of the line and
you<00:05:01.610> don't<00:05:02.150> have<00:05:02.270> any<00:05:02.450> back<00:05:02.660> pressure<00:05:03.020> or

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
you don't have any back pressure or

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.180 
you don't have any back pressure or
possible<00:05:04.790> accidents<00:05:05.740> so<00:05:06.740> that<00:05:06.890> nothing

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
possible accidents so that nothing

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.190 
possible accidents so that nothing
accidently<00:05:07.730> explodes<00:05:08.710> anyways<00:05:10.990> it's<00:05:11.990> very

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
accidently explodes anyways it's very

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.080 
accidently explodes anyways it's very
simple<00:05:12.590> to<00:05:12.710> do<00:05:12.830> this<00:05:13.040> like<00:05:13.370> I<00:05:13.490> was<00:05:13.610> telling<00:05:13.940> you

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
simple to do this like I was telling you

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.150 
simple to do this like I was telling you
it's<00:05:14.990> not<00:05:15.140> very<00:05:15.380> hard<00:05:15.560> probably<00:05:15.860> takes<00:05:16.100> about

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
it's not very hard probably takes about

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.690 
it's not very hard probably takes about
an<00:05:16.430> hour<00:05:16.490> of<00:05:16.820> your<00:05:16.910> time<00:05:16.970> and<00:05:18.040> it<00:05:19.040> really<00:05:19.280> it

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
an hour of your time and it really it

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.520 
an hour of your time and it really it
makes<00:05:20.210> a<00:05:20.360> difference<00:05:20.720> it's<00:05:20.900> the<00:05:20.960> small<00:05:21.260> things

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
makes a difference it's the small things

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
makes a difference it's the small things
that<00:05:21.650> make<00:05:21.740> the<00:05:21.950> difference

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
that make the difference

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.920 
that make the difference
so<00:05:24.010> yeah<00:05:25.010> anyhow<00:05:25.520> I<00:05:25.550> got<00:05:25.880> that<00:05:26.150> that<00:05:26.660> by<00:05:26.870> the

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
so yeah anyhow I got that that by the

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.370 
so yeah anyhow I got that that by the
way<00:05:27.110> is<00:05:27.260> a<00:05:27.290> 20<00:05:27.620> pound<00:05:27.770> a<00:05:28.360> 20<00:05:29.360> pound<00:05:29.510> what<00:05:30.260> do<00:05:30.320> you

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
way is a 20 pound a 20 pound what do you

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.760 
way is a 20 pound a 20 pound what do you
call<00:05:30.470> it

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
call it

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.530 
call it
propane<00:05:31.640> can<00:05:32.330> canister<00:05:33.140> whatever<00:05:34.300> that<00:05:35.300> cost

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
propane can canister whatever that cost

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.420 
propane can canister whatever that cost
me<00:05:35.750> 17<00:05:36.200> dollars<00:05:36.560> worth<00:05:36.740> of<00:05:36.830> propane<00:05:37.220> right

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
me 17 dollars worth of propane right

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.980 
me 17 dollars worth of propane right
there<00:05:37.640> for<00:05:38.390> 20<00:05:38.630> pounds<00:05:40.210> so<00:05:41.210> you<00:05:41.240> do<00:05:41.660> the<00:05:41.810> math

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
there for 20 pounds so you do the math

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.200 
there for 20 pounds so you do the math
that's<00:05:42.740> that's<00:05:43.190> a<00:05:43.280> lot<00:05:43.400> of<00:05:43.460> that's<00:05:43.970> a<00:05:44.060> lot<00:05:44.180> of
