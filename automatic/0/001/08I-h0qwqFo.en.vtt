00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.539
 look for a mod like that 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.689

 No, we donâ€™t need a frame. 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:10.190
 which will serve as good lighting it 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:12.850
 we also don't need many many mods many 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.970
 Now I will pause the video as Iâ€™ll find and 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.640
