00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:09.510
 hello commanders future commanders pp 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:12.509
 pp to eth1 and so on 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.730
 come on if you have doubt on how 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.180
 solve the issue 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.119
 letter in a letter is not a tip here 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.550
 for the lambert letter 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.970
 so let's read it here in a letter 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.439
 lamblet 3 ° and 25 minutes of latitude 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:38.149
 they correspond to the face of 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.149
 Are you going to solve it yourself? 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:56.460
 3 and 25 minutes 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:56.460
 so each degree has 60 sixty minutes 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:15.310
 one hour then 60 times three 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:17.920
 equal 180 hundred and eighty beauty 180 and 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:26.399
 now is you sum with this rest of the 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:26.399
 minutes but 25 that will give 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.610
 205 05 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:46.689
 sixty times three goals 180 plus 25 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:52.119
 205 minutes to go and 205 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:55.740
 to nautical miles to remember that 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.740
 will always give nautical miles 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.500
 So what is the answer here? 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.860
 two hundred and five nautical miles 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:20.700
 then there is the floor of the letter lambert 3 ° 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:22.940
 25 minutes correspond to 205 miles 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.940
 nautical 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.030
 Many thanks, lady, please.
