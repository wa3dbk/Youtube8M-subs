00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.600 
think this was all about just pushing
yourself<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.150> taking<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.660> child<00:02:53.610> during

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
yourself and taking that child during

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.720 
yourself and taking that child during
the<00:02:54.700> process<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:56.350> make<00:02:56.530> new<00:02:56.680> friends<00:02:56.739> and<00:02:57.340> you

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
the process you make new friends and you

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.360 
the process you make new friends and you
learn<00:02:57.910> something<00:02:58.300> new<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:59.280> you're<00:03:00.280> really

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
learn something new and you're really

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.370
