you<00:02:59.280> just<00:03:00.280> demonstrate<00:03:00.850> for<00:03:01.060> echoes<00:03:02.610> actually

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
you just demonstrate for echoes actually

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.760 
you just demonstrate for echoes actually
goes<00:03:03.790> in<00:03:04.090> between<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.510> see<00:03:04.810> now<00:03:05.530> like<00:03:05.650> a

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
goes in between the see now like a

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.150 
goes in between the see now like a
partition<00:03:06.400> for<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.700> dog<00:03:07.420> or<00:03:07.810> luggage<00:03:08.160> and

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
partition for a dog or luggage and

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.470 
partition for a dog or luggage and
probably<00:03:09.580> better<00:03:09.820> see<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.120> on<00:03:10.210> the<00:03:10.300> other<00:03:10.360> side

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
probably better see it on the other side

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.710 
probably better see it on the other side
so<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.290> also<00:03:11.530> comes<00:03:12.010> with<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:13.480> rack

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
so it also comes with the the rack

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.050 
so it also comes with the the rack
system<00:03:14.260> for<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.100> top<00:03:15.280> so<00:03:15.520> if<00:03:15.580> you<00:03:15.700> like<00:03:15.820> to<00:03:15.940> go
