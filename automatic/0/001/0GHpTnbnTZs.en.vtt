00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:14.449
 hi everyone naked on the challenges of this tunnel today I propose you 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.769
 his chocolate cake recipe and here is that of the big greenhouse he 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.340
 was the cement of divine you'll see it's very very simple it's 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.050
 left 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.330
 we start to be made by melting chocolate can not do obama 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.269
 arrives in a small saucepan like me 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.369
 so you have to break it so on a very very high flow of water is going to make 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.270
 melt and when the chocolate became smooth it was seen adding the 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.320
 Butter 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.080
 so always on a very very soft fire we will melt the butter you 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.140
 have it incorporated with the chocolate and when the preparation is well the 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.500
 melted and shiny you turn off the fire and you have booked this 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.500
 chocolate pan to let it cool a little 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.329
 continue the recipe with the smells do you separate the whites from the yellows 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.060
 then you added the sugar with the young bella you're going to mix 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.690
 until the mixture whitens 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.520
 when it's a bleached blend you'll be able to add the chocolate that has 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.200
 so slightly cooled ap he wanted to add little by little so as and when 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.580
 measure you pour and you mix thank you again for excess ground 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.060
 until all the chocolate is well incorporated with it the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.060
 yellow and sugar then you have reserved 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.500
 we continue the recipe has the whites in snow so you go climbs 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.520
 together in snow really well closed that a pinch of salt 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.370
 when it's done you'll take a quarter of that preparation and you 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.240
 go throw it so could blame the cola they will go mix gently 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.970
 with a wooden spatula avoid the liver and because it is really it 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.900
 something that does not work read rather a spatula of 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.300
 preferably by drinking plastic south or in the east is not so you 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.630
 take no money 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.150
 for you to put them together and you actually mix it up you have to dive in 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.060
 bowl background 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.659
 and we go back and mix it up gently that we did not have 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.590
 incorporated in this first quarter of whites in snow you added rsf able 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.070
 d tries to do roughly in three 3 4 times 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.940
 when whites in snow are entirely a port can it is a 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.630
 little harm to this preparation so homogeneous enough is enough have killed the 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.240
 that's perfect so no if you used a mold so it's a 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.180
 cupcake so do not take a huge world it will not work it's not 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.480
 the penalty so the round square rectangle no matter who miss it it is not 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.349
 not too big party 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:25.280
 so for you 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.569
 we should not have many more placed then you're going to put the 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:29.440
 preparation 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.569
 cakes 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.429
 you do not put in the middle of the oven at 150 degrees for 40 minutes or so 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:38.639
 so it always depends of course on the power of the oven the 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.980
 kind of fake we have to monitor 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.380
 it is not necessary that it is overcooked and in fact for its part cooking the top 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.159
 it's going to make a crust and 5 this beating so you can always 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.070
 planted a small knife and he must stand out united in the cedar mans a 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.230
 cake that will not state that will stay well wet and well I wish you 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.459
