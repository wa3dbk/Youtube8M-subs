00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 a few days ago you hear a person 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.690
 to say that cooking is the most sensual 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.210
 art form what I also am 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.099
 completely convinced I wondered why 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.490
 it is not only in the life of all 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.130
 days 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.870
 do not know in we know we are always careful 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.550
 to the line especially when the arrives 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.710
 time to discover that is to prove oneself 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.630
 maybe on the beach for this I have today 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.039
 thought of a recipe that could 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.930
 do for us 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.599
 or a dessert that I christened 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.609
 anti-cellulite because it is prepared with 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.410
 of the ingredients they own 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.660
 properties that can stimulate the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.559
 microcirco is not about strengthening and 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.230
 protect the capillary walls 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:43.260
 substances that we will use today are the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.120
 centella asiatica and the blueberry that 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.329
 I have reported the features in 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.789
 then the first ingredient is the blackboard 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.860
 the centella centella is important 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.960
 Asian with whom we will make an infusion 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.719
 therapeutic because we will leave it in 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.309
 infusion about 20 minutes the name 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.289
 scientific centella asiatica e 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.420
 hydro coated and Asian that belongs 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.540
 to the family of the like or even 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.729
 of Umbelliferae as part used 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.920
 we have the flowers in the centella 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.869
 Asian for internal ethnic use of the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.790
 excellent vasoactive properties e 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.220
 stimulants of the microcirculation and in the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.680
 same time also anti-edema so that is 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.600
 it means that it goes to decrease the swelling 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.490
 not by chance the centella also finds 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.060
 use in the formulation of creams 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.040
 anti-cellulite and tired legs i 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.530
 second important ingredient that 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.530
 we use today is the cranberry juice 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.860
 blueberry recognized in botany with the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.560
 term basins a blueberry belongs 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.350
 to the eric arce family where the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.790
 part used can be either le 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.070
 leaves both fruits us today 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.049
 we will use the fruits for what 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.119
 concerns the properties and blueberry expresses 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.369
 I would also say antioxidant properties 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.810
 excellently thought antioxidants 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.000
 which among the natural sources of 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.930
 antioxidants the blueberry is placed at 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.659
 second place 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.329
 then we also have properties 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.979
 protective of microcirculation and also 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.810
 also de min hygiene just like the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.190
 centella asiatica but because they are protective 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.950
 of the microcirculation because it is going to increase 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.250
 capillary resistance in the same 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.140
 time to decrease 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.790
 the permeability said this let us see 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.760
 how to prepare the hyphen 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.770
 anti-cellulite to prepare dessert 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.800
 anti-cellulite which is nothing but one 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.320
 speak prepared with blueberry and centella 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.380
 Asian 300 milliliters are needed 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:35.740
 of water 10 grams of centella asiatica 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:39.370
 125 g of blueberries then blueberry fruits 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:43.060
 still juice squeezed out of half a lemon 20 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:48.400
 about milliliters of milk 200 milliliters 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:54.040
 of cranberry juice 14 grams of glue 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.450
 of fish and then 150 g of creamy yogurt 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.489
 then guys we put in 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.370
 infuse the centella leaves 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.590
 Asian in the infused king we have it 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.330
 left inside then with the fire out 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.430
 from the moment of the positions clearly 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.980
 we have extinguished the fire we have 120 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.110
 minutes in this way we have prepared 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.209
 a therapeutic infusion 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.019
 now we can dissolve in the 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.150
 jelly because we're going to make a plug 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.700
 this is the jelly consistency 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.269
 of the gelatin after the soak of at least 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.690
 ten minutes slabs we are good for and 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:31.500
 now we pour it directly into the 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:35.080
 we mix it with centella 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.880
 perfect if you left them to soak 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.890
 for the right time 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.010
 you will see that it immediately dissolves a 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.840
 contact with hot liquid 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.900
 at this point we can add to the 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.910
 in here also all the juice of 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:56.320
 blueberry so perfect 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:04:00.070
 we always mix now we can go 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.560
 to pour all over a container of 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:07.140
 silicone of this size then the 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.170
 capacity is about 250 milliliters 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.340
 clearly yo yo given the doses for two 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.470
 for two molds 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:20.070
 so now we put a part of it 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:23.010
 about half directly here perfect 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.910
 and we fill it for its three quarters 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:29.190
 we also add some blueberries 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:34.860
 directly so many injectives will go to 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:38.430
 then very well with blueberries 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.650
 we will remain going to make the other layer 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.800
 of dessert 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.660
 now this must be left clearly 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.060
 rest in the refrigerator for about 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.950
 an hour until it becomes beautiful 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.050
 hard 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.720
 after about an hour of rest in 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.340
 refrigerator you see that ours 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.870
 gelatin has thickened very well then 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.200
 we can faces of some in second 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.330
 layer and we will prepare it with yogurt 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.000
 we will reach it then the jelly 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.460
 also in this case we put in 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.730
 soak the gelatin in cold water 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.950
 we stress and we are going to pay it 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:18.240
 directly in a small bowl 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:20.910
 pot where we poured milk 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.920
 we heat it up we also increase 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.950
 the flame and you will see that the jelly is 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.200
 dissolves something that I didn't tell you before 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:30.690
 important I added some juice 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.930
 lemon in our centella infusion 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.930
 Asian lemon clearly a good one 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.600
 antioxidant and vitamin C also goes to 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.110
 strengthen to protect the walls of the 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.670
 blood capillaries therefore also the 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.860
 lemon in a sense is important 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.810
 because it goes to improve the action 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.220
 therapeutic given by centella asiatica 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:55.650
 and now we add to the blueberry 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:06:00.320
 a bit of blueberries directly in the 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:04.110
 our yogurt then we're going to start 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:09.000
 we can also add milk with 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:11.390
 the perfect jelly so and then we supply 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.390
 all of them 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:22.090
 and now what we do simply 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:26.229
 we are going to pour our yogurt 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.819
 inside the pie so and we do 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:30.669
 the same thing for the other 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:32.349
 later we will let it rest in 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:34.259
 fridge for about an hour and a half two 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:37.330
 until it is well solidified 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:39.009
 then we're going to turn it upside down 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.840
 a serving dish 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:43.389
 first, however, to overturn it clearly 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.460
 we will have to heat our bowls in the 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:47.710
 our mold with boiling water in 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:51.310
 this way the detachment from the mold will be 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:53.289
 very easy and now we can also 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.590
 grant this wonderful dessert 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:57.430
 lovable light fresh and in my opinion 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.229
 particularly suitable also from 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.740
 taste as a snack in the hot weather 

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:01.740
 summer days
