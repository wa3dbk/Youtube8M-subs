if I were able to achieve something that
was<00:01:07.560> truly<00:01:07.799> valuable<00:01:08.280> some<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.820> evocation<00:01:09.240> of

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750

connection between people perhaps use

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.270 
connection between people perhaps use
this<00:01:16.049> energy<00:01:16.229> for<00:01:16.560> something<00:01:16.770> better<00:01:17.040> than

very interesting what it's about it's

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.650 
very interesting what it's about it's
it's<00:04:46.720> in<00:04:46.870> this<00:04:47.050> kind<00:04:47.260> of<00:04:47.320> terrain<00:04:47.710> between<00:04:48.660> the

it's in this kind of terrain between the

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.360 
it's in this kind of terrain between the

issue of our time I think yes you're
right<00:04:55.840> I<00:04:56.050> think<00:04:56.470> it<00:04:56.560> is<00:04:56.650> perhaps<00:04:57.640> an

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
right I think it is perhaps an

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.740 
right I think it is perhaps an
investigation<00:04:58.390> of<00:04:58.480> that<00:04:58.600> and<00:04:58.690> the

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
investigation of that and the

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.390 
investigation of that and the
elimination<00:04:58.960> of<00:04:59.230> that<00:04:59.380> can<00:04:59.560> be<00:04:59.590> something<00:05:00.340> I

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
elimination of that can be something I

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.920 
elimination of that can be something I
can<00:05:00.550> contribute<00:05:00.850> along<00:05:01.630> with<00:05:01.780> this

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930
