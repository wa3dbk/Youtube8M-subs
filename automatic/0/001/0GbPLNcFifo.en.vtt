00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.040 
offer a recommendation on that but
there's<00:05:49.440> a<00:05:49.970> I'd<00:05:50.970> say<00:05:51.210> overall<00:05:51.450> cyber<00:05:51.840> monday

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
there's a I'd say overall cyber monday

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.170 
there's a I'd say overall cyber monday
is<00:05:52.229> a<00:05:52.620> little<00:05:52.950> underwhelming<00:05:53.700> for<00:05:53.760> sales

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
is a little underwhelming for sales

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.610 
is a little underwhelming for sales
actually<00:05:54.720> I<00:05:54.750> was<00:05:54.870> expecting<00:05:54.960> maybe<00:05:55.380> a<00:05:55.470> little

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
actually I was expecting maybe a little

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.740 
actually I was expecting maybe a little
bit<00:05:55.800> more<00:05:55.950> especially<00:05:56.729> on<00:05:56.970> the<00:05:57.060> steam<00:05:57.300> side<00:05:57.599> of

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
bit more especially on the steam side of

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.000 
bit more especially on the steam side of
things<00:05:57.960> I<00:05:58.080> think<00:05:58.139> the<00:05:58.320> steam<00:05:58.500> sales<00:05:58.830> are

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
things I think the steam sales are

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.279 
things I think the steam sales are
pretty<00:05:59.490> disappointing<00:06:00.210> today<00:06:00.570> and<00:06:00.900> yesterday

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
pretty disappointing today and yesterday

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:07.010 
pretty disappointing today and yesterday
actually<00:06:01.949> but<00:06:04.310> that's<00:06:05.310> just<00:06:05.430> because<00:06:06.020> other
