started<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.150> stone<00:02:45.540> movement<00:02:45.959> monitoring

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
started a stone movement monitoring

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.150 
started a stone movement monitoring
program<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.129> they<00:02:47.489> named<00:02:47.700> all<00:02:47.879> the<00:02:48.030> stones<00:02:48.330> I

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
program and they named all the stones I

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.440 
program and they named all the stones I
found<00:02:50.160> Karen<00:02:50.840> 700<00:02:51.840> pound<00:02:52.050> block<00:02:52.349> of<00:02:52.500> dolemite

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
found Karen 700 pound block of dolemite

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.550 
found Karen 700 pound block of dolemite
I'm<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.540> little<00:02:54.750> frightened<00:02:55.080> though<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.349> think

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
I'm a little frightened though to think

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.809 
I'm a little frightened though to think
that's<00:02:55.680> such<00:02:55.860> a<00:02:55.890> hefty<00:02:56.250> rock<00:02:56.459> could<00:02:56.640> move

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
that's such a hefty rock could move

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.430 
that's such a hefty rock could move
itself<00:02:58.310> but<00:02:59.310> fortunately<00:02:59.970> not<00:03:00.840> surprisingly

such little creatures and dig up so much
dirt<00:04:43.740> I<00:04:44.659> decided<00:04:45.659> it<00:04:45.810> was<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:45.960> good<00:04:45.990> idea<00:04:46.379> to<00:04:46.500> get

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
dirt I decided it was a good idea to get

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.850 
dirt I decided it was a good idea to get
down<00:04:46.830> in<00:04:47.009> the<00:04:47.069> dirt<00:04:47.219> and<00:04:47.310> watching<00:04:47.669> myself<00:04:48.860> too

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
down in the dirt and watching myself too

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.850 
down in the dirt and watching myself too
bad<00:04:50.009> they<00:04:50.159> don't<00:04:50.280> arise<00:04:50.599> if<00:04:51.599> they<00:04:51.780> did<00:04:52.020> you

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
bad they don't arise if they did you

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.379 
bad they don't arise if they did you
could<00:04:53.009> see<00:04:53.189> that<00:04:53.340> their<00:04:53.490> accumulated<00:04:53.819> efforts

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
could see that their accumulated efforts

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:55.939 
could see that their accumulated efforts
are<00:04:54.870> you<00:04:54.990> equivalent<00:04:55.379> of<00:04:55.439> tiny<00:04:55.710> mountain

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
are you equivalent of tiny mountain

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.460 
are you equivalent of tiny mountain
ranges
