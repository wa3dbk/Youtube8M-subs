00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.430
 welcome credit to another floor more than 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.440
 world clash of limbs' let's continue 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.230
 with the series things wishes good we're going to 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.570
 this attack this attack is pretty weird 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.130
 but on the one hand funny too 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.779
 because they realize good spear 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.700
 quite a few minions practically all 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.010
 the minions to break a town hall 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.270
 good already broke the city council are the 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.950
 central of the town hall but be 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.340
 mind that you have enough resources and that 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.140
 can steal and for good he decides to do his 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.150
 attack already strong this time it washes 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.949
 pretty balloons good all your balloons 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.530
 spells of rage spells of 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.989
 freeze or rejection rage and good ya 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.500
 we go to the center to try to get rid of 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.690
 all those defenses and be able to do 50 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.760
 percent and apart from stealing us all 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.860
 the resources that is not account that travel 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.380
 at this point he's not going to steal those 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.930
 resources below because he has left 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.730
 good crossbow the wizard towers is 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.879
 a little bit complicated then too 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.560
 do not want to lose glasses good to get to 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.960
 a star but wants to win more drinks 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.890
 of its installation is at the sides 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.020
 to treat from the 50% that happens that no 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.909
 always the things that come out like you like 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.280
 you want and good at this point of that 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.110
 mind that it's going to be over thrown 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.270
 the heroes and he will not achieve 50 by 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.190
 something that sometimes happens and is 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.650
 quite frustrating, annoying 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.630
 when you propose to do at the end of 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.610
 accounts neither one nor the other nor be good 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.320
 resources nor bait the second star is 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.899
 He brought a star that could have 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.369
 done very well with about two minions or 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.990
 if he did not want to spend troops or good with 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.360
 the queen that was the strips to a corner 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.009
 the skill and back do not break anything 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.990
 from the town hall things that sometimes 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:50.210
 it happens not to all of that yes but good to 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.170
 Sometimes it happens 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.960
 and if you play good guy you 're going to leave here 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.620
 then the next repetition 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.860
 in which as I always touches me 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.350
 you leave I do not even know how they come out but 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.509
 good 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.380
 more or less I was like in the three 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.090
 thousand 180 glasses out there when he touched me 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.730
 buy a shield for problems 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.069
 familiar and well then I left the 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.530
 I play there for a week or so 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.780
 without touching it and well now that 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.450
 touched to attack again to return 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.700
 champion and you do not need like 10 glasses 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.790
 about 10 15 cups to make 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.200
 change and I get this village then I do not 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.480
 I explain how it is that they come to me 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.370
 this kind of pretty pretty villages 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.620
 good that yes sometimes it touched me it is necessary 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.720
 Search a lot because as I go with everything 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.459
 archers in this case a dragon I do not know 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.459
 why do I forgive a dragon 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.140
 I really do not know what to do 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.350
 I think I was donating and it escaped me and 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.330
 I did not manage to donate and it went away but good 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.730
 I came out to the pretty curious leave 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.110
 that he would give me 50% more 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.900
 town hall 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.070
 well, I was not going to be silly 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.630
 squander it and leave those little glasses king 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.460
 that really came pretty well 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.680
 because with this I returned to champion 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.120
 really this scene I hope you have them 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.920
 liked these two repetitions but they 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.420
 he liked the videos and I hope he is 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.010
 really liking this series I 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.960
 he's very excited he's pretty good 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.600
 and I hope on Friday that he's going to 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.370
 leave a video in which I will give 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.660
 certain opportunities or certain option 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.220
 so that you can send me your 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.930
 repetitions then nobody is ever 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.170
 that the video has liked this 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.550
 video 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.550
 until the next ciao
