engine exhaust and this is for the
cooling<00:02:00.870> water<00:02:01.020> there's<00:02:01.770> also<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.100> telltale

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
cooling water there's also a telltale

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.010 
cooling water there's also a telltale
stream<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.240> will<00:02:03.360> come<00:02:03.510> out<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:03.869> that

stream that will come out of this that

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.870 
stream that will come out of this that
you<00:02:04.140> can<00:02:04.170> direct<00:02:04.650> in<00:02:04.799> any<00:02:05.010> direction<00:02:05.400> you<00:02:05.549> want

you can direct in any direction you want

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.740 
you can direct in any direction you want
and<00:02:07.099> by<00:02:08.099> removing<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.269> can<00:02:09.390> connect<00:02:09.690> a

to the electronic fuel injectors here's

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.610 
to the electronic fuel injectors here's
an<00:03:11.579> injector<00:03:12.150> in<00:03:12.269> my<00:03:12.389> hand<00:03:12.629> right<00:03:12.870> here<00:03:13.260> you

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
an injector in my hand right here you

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.110 
an injector in my hand right here you
can<00:03:13.769> see<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.069> wires<00:03:14.250> connected<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.970> the

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
can see the wires connected to the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.030 
can see the wires connected to the
injector<00:03:15.599> in<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.840> injector<00:03:16.200> acts<00:03:16.409> like<00:03:17.010> a

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
injector in the injector acts like a

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.490 
injector in the injector acts like a
speaker<00:03:17.579> injecting<00:03:18.480> precise<00:03:19.019> amounts<00:03:19.379> of

fuel into each cylinder

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.240 
fuel into each cylinder
now<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.840> emm<00:03:22.319> acts<00:03:22.500> like<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.709> computer<00:03:23.099> it

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
now the emm acts like a computer it

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.069 
now the emm acts like a computer it
generates<00:03:23.849> heat<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.359> it<00:03:24.480> needs<00:03:24.659> to<00:03:24.810> be<00:03:24.900> cooled

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
generates heat and it needs to be cooled

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.110 
generates heat and it needs to be cooled
we<00:03:25.530> can't<00:03:25.739> put<00:03:25.859> a<00:03:25.889> fan<00:03:26.159> back<00:03:26.400> here<00:03:26.639> so<00:03:26.909> the<00:03:27.030> way

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
we can't put a fan back here so the way

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.030 
we can't put a fan back here so the way

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
Evinrude does the cooling is with water

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.770 
Evinrude does the cooling is with water
there's<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.370> heat<00:03:29.609> sink<00:03:29.849> inside<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.510> they

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
there's a heat sink inside and they

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.509 
there's a heat sink inside and they
simply<00:03:31.079> run<00:03:31.230> cooling<00:03:31.620> water<00:03:31.799> right<00:03:32.040> through

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
simply run cooling water right through
