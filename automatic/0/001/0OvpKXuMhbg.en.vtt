00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.200
 with a teacher who leads the track 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.200

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.350

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.430
 world of 300 by boat and I will be 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.590
 watching the 80 intercontinental crossing 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.840
 this time we are going to minister a 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.060
 very representative country of culture 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.309
 leave rallies from the great 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.040
 immigration that was several years ago 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.800
 where my name comes out surely the one from 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.320
 barium to you where they come out better better 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.989
 best world anthem the part of 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.000
 geniuses of pizza and pasta in the 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.980
 today we are going to pay tribute to all the 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.809
 Italian community of the world we are going to 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.820
 make some pizzas from scratch trying 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.550
 be the most traditional possible but 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.379
 with a fruit that crazy and as always 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.360
 grill whoever and who already 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.000
 we pulled out the ingredients for the dough 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.890
 of the pizza are one kilo of flour 30 30 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.200
 grams of fresh yeast a cup with 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.780
 warm water 500 cubic centimeters of 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.150
 water sugar fine salt 20 grams 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.540
 approximately and olive oil 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.880
 the sauce with its salt oregano paprika chili 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.799
 ground tomato sauce and garlic 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.140
 finally to fill in we need 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.630
 purple and white onion mozzarella cheese 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.119
 and black olives the description are 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.909
 all detailed the first step is 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.640
 prepare the yeast in a cup we put 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.619
 Granada's yeast after him 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.689
 we put a spoonful of sugar 10 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.950
 grams approximately 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.780
 and finally warm water to this mixture the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.630
 let's cover it with a rag and leave it 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.520
 that reacts more or less between 15 to 20 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.380
 minutes with almost the whole kilo of flour 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.759
 Hennes a little so after 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.759
 knead let's make a crown 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.910
 in the center of the crown we add the 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.720
 yeast mixture and above the 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:08.690
 flour we add fine salt and oil 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.700
 olive plus or minus 2 teaspoon of salt and 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.860
 2 teaspoons of olive oil 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.390
 olive it is important that salt does not enter 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.870
 in contact directly with the yeast 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.390
 because if it does not cut its aspect of elevated 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.430
 now we start adding water and 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.500
 Wick all the ingredients the sive 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.020
 we mix mixed until a bowl 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.210
 we have the little bag ready now what 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.360
 we will have to do is knead for 10 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:35.540
 minutes or 15 is the secret of a good 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.420
 mass when it's ready we put it in a 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.470
 We let you carry it by 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.230
 about an hour to an hour and 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.230
 mean we do not see a floor time 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.460
 listening to hypocrisy without ironically 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.850
 while we wait for the dough to be 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.380
 let's make our sauce you 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.170
 They have the option as we did 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.030
 to make a homemade tomato sauce but 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.260
 if not to make it easier they can 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.060
 buy tomato puree that 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.060
 get anywhere the secret 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.460
 is in mixing that tomato puree with 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.710
 onion and garlic that we chop and sauté in 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:23.150
 a pan and then seasoning it well 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:26.600
 we put salt paprika sweet ground chili 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.069
 and oregano we mix it we leave it 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.379
 cooking for 7 minutes a delight 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.740
 it's been an hour and a half since we have the 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.600
 more german 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.610
 first of all I'm going to present you 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.420
 teacher to the master pizza maker who already 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:46.060
 they saw before which he müller the best 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.060
 track is the best 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.260
 flour 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.050
 until frames what we are going to do is 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.640
 press the action so it was for 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.730
 up and down 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.860
 good hands then I come back doing for 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.640
 below and with the one above 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.800
 we are inviting so that after 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.940
 the 15 minutes I bring back that 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.260
 is the second 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.540
 and so in this way it will stay 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.650
 flexible and much easier to knead 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.420
 let's start studying a little bit 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.490
 the bun throwing a little bit of flour 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.350
 so that it does not stick and I in this case 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.910
 I'll make it rectangular are 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.500
 round but right now it's attractive 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.950
 more to work on the grill occupies 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.950
 less place 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.300
 look, look what madness I like 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.940
 left 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.190
 excellent the direct well-stretched dough 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.030
 to put on the grill he recommended me 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.030
 that he prunes with his hand 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.340
 the cia a little bit 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:59.040
 we are adding the beautiful salsita 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.040
 that we have I like to put a lot 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.910
 and once we have all the pizzas 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.910
 we put the 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.759
 now we close it to generate an effect 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.449
 oven and that melted he wanted and he 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:13.449
 cook the dough 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:23.870
 Look, look what madness you send me to pizza 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.410
 and now the table that we are going to take 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.800
 let's give the last touches of crazy 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:33.860
 now yes gentlemen we are going to put 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.560
 cebollita purple and white onions that 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.060
 We made the fats 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.639
 ah 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.639
 quite pretty from our tower 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.880
 to this we add strength a 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.880
 little bit of salt 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.700
 a little trickle 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.890
 live 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.750
 a little oregano that I recommend 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.850
 they put it at the end but if they put it 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.240
 in the cooking is going to burn a lot 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:06.410
 bitter and close with olives but 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.410
 this time black olives 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.600
 maybe we are going to eat 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.280
 I think I think it 's crispy 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.000
 to the first one I 'm going to reproach him for being 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.400
 master pizza maker 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.050
 well now what do you think 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.050
 in the fight this has a look 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.360
 you know 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.760
 what I like more than everything in this 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.830
 we did pizza on the grill that is 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:41.009
