00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:10.990
 that exploded over russia 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.330
 presented by NASA science when it came out 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.299
 the sun on the ural mountains in russia 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.460
 on Friday , February 15 many 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.289
 residents of the nearby would be vince that 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.689
 they already knew that a rock was coming 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.420
 space during that day an asteroid 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.359
 called 2012 from to 14 would go through the 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.849
 land at only 17 thousand 200 miles per 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.610
 over indonesia the nasa assured the 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.350
 public that there was no danger of collision 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.839
 maybe that's why when the morning sky 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.729
 lit up with a second sun and a wave 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:41.589
 expansive shattered the windows of 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:43.750
 hundreds of buildings around 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.330
 chelyabinsk only a few people 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.460
 they imagined the real cause is not 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.159
 He was a crashing airplane or 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.890
 a missile attack was a meteor 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.839
 the most powerful since the event of 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.299
 tunguska of 1908 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.549
 says bill cooke from the middle office 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.949
 Nasa meteoroid environment in 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:04.869
 a coincidence of one in a million that 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.180
 still shakes the experts of the 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.270
 nasa a small asteroid completely 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.680
 alien to 2012 from to 14 hit the earth 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.350
 only hours before the announced 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.840
 these are rare events and it's amazing 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.670
 see that happen the same day says Paul 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.460
 chodas of the program of the 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.590
 objects near the earth in the jp l 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.510
 the researchers have reconstructed what 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.580
 what happened the most information 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.920
 developer came from a network of sensors 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.270
 of infrasound operated by the 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.540
 Organization of the prohibition treaty 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.490
 complete of the nuclear tests 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.640
 its purpose is to monitor explosions 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.640
 nuclear 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.170
 the infra sounds are a kind of waves 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.970
 sound very low frequency that only 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.860
 the elephants can hear the pigeons 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.860
 messengers and some more animals 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.850
 it turns out that the meteors that enter 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.619
 the terrestrial atmosphere cause waves of 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.430
 infrasound that spread through the air 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.430
 of our planet 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.650
 by analyzing the records of 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.150
 infrasound it is possible to learn how much 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.340
 a meteor has been in the air 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.020
 in what direction did he move and the 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.440
 amount of energy that was unleashed in the 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.440
 event 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.290
 the infrasound signal of the Russian meteor 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.900
 It was detected by several stations 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.100
 including one in alaska to more than 6,500 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.110
 kilometers of chelyabinsk peter brown 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.750
 professor of physics from Ontario has 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.850
 analyzed this data the asteroid had 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.440
 about 17 meters in diameter and weighed 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.770
 approximately 10 thousand tons 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.620
 metrics says hit the atmosphere 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.209
 Earth at 40,000 miles per hour and 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.060
 broke at a height of 12 to 15 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.380
 kilometers above the earth's surface 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.980
 the energy of the resulting explosion 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.930
 exceeded 470 kilotons of TNT 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.570
 in comparison the first pumps 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.270
 atomic produced only 15 to 20 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.980
 kilotons based on the trajectory of 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.920
 fireball analysts also 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.130
 have traced their orbit is originally from 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.720
 Asteroid belt around 2.5 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.970
 times farther from the sun than Earth 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.500
 says that it has been compared to the orbit of 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.500
 Russian meteorite with asteroid 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.090
 2012 to 14 lance analysts have 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.550
 demonstrated that there is no connection between 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.440
 both are both independent objects 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.940
 of cqc and the fact that they arrived at the 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.800
 land on the same day alone 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.900
 a little later one or the other seems 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.640
 a complete match records 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.930
 Unique extras confirm that the meteorite 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.720
 entered the atmosphere with an angle 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.280
 small about 20 degrees and 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.040
 that stayed more than 30 seconds before 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.330
 of exploiting the loud detonation that 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.130
 he listened and he felt hundreds of 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.200
 kilometers marked the beginning of a 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.880
 scientific treasure hunt thousands of 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.560
 fragments of the meteorite are scattered 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.030
 for the urals region and a 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.890
 small fraction of them has already been 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.840
 found the preliminary reports 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.730
 primarily linked by 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.260
 the media suggest that 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.390
 the asteroid was made mainly 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.640
 of stone with a little iron in other 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.800
 words a typical asteroid from beyond 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.810
 of the orbit of Mars says cook there 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.610
 millions more like him and that's what 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.620
 think while continuing to clean 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.030

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.250
