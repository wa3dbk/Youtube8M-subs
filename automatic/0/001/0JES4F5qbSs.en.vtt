00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.490
 produce and at the same time preserve is a challenge that many farmers 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.990
 They are facing Brazil. 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.850
 in the northeast, and there are also examples of this kind of effort, the third part of 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.560
 our report on the caatinga you will know a great farm of the 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:17.169
 Paraíba 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:21.309
 for years working in the backlands respecting the plants were more active 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:30.999
 bush 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:36.499
 this beautiful stone gives name to the farm that is at her feet the hand of art 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.350
 are almost 13 thousand hectares in the municipality of santa terezinha and have 30 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.230
 years this place conquered the Swiss pr landout that adopted sertão paraibano 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.049
 as a second home I have recognized because the whole brazil and that 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:54.810
 it was even marked 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.070
 this fantastic region 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.330
 How fantastic and what had this cotton 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.440
 at the time that is the famous goal has not occurred or will not occur 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.840
 with work and pain always with cattle lit the fabulous staff 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.869
 learn too 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.030
 to live together 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.320
 not only with ct, but also with one of the biggest problems 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.150
 with pressure and repression 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.570
 fantastic and very rich family 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.620
 want the caatinga 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.200
 from the beginning of Tupi and decided to work in harmony with the 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.310
 environment 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.960
 practically two-thirds of the farm is still covered by the caatinga 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.580
 the rest is used in the production of my manga and in the raising of cows 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.700
 dairy products that are supplied if dairy is installed on the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.890
 everything here is done in the organic system 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.640
 passwords in the industrialized abdomen or medicines 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.140
 allopathic and within play in madri when you recycle are you 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.970
 looking to optimize all are fresh products from the country 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.310
 defined bees by police did not give a chance 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.020
 and that kind of thing I think with the mission that goes exactly towards the 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.680
 preservation 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.250
 and the integration of all human activity into that amount spent 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.329
 here there are no huge folders Swiss-brown cattle spend the day in pickets 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.779
 surrounded by native vegetation 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:21.179
 they form corridors that interconnect the legal reserve 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.379
 and an MP has 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.319
 private natural heritage reserve 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.040
 in note to pf created here 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.079
 which shows a mixture of ruins the narratives of planted grasses 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.859
 the idea is 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:37.019
 do the part of rppn that is up there 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:43.489
 which represents more than 360 cars making a charge a continuity of mutts 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.389
 of entry and exit of killing ships to be able to carry the wild animals of the 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.479
 another world that is here in the front 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:53.440
 it's such a reservation 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.039
 another concern of the doctor sink 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:59.499
 well know the place where you decided to live until one day 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.199
 really a forgotten biome 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:04.779
 not very educated 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:09.099
 semiarid everybody thinks it is certainly not there we really have 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.879
 today 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.039
 Verification through surveys said 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:15.279
 disguised mammals of the sectors in the 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.019
 this way in the case 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.639
 that proves the lie is a very important region 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:25.039
 The farm has already served as a laboratory for 20 research 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:28.189
 universities of paraíba and pernambuco 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:34.279
 the well-studied preserved forest is today the place for reintroduction in 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:36.429
 animals seized by ibama 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:39.429
 it's all over 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.390
 not with crisis the goldfinch won the freedom 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.909
 this breed with nursery 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.739
 this work in the light of these areas of science protected in those 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.720
 no no no to but he has a time to recover and produce and he served 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.880
 as a place to go to spend many days and ahead 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.960
 doctorate professor of the Federal University of Campina Grande and 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.750
 leads to another research that on the farm he is studying plants such as 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.940
 faveleira and the black jurema and why you chose these plants 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.439
 then in common they have the intention to buy and sell 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:19.879
 we think not to remove the arboreal vegetation of the republic paulo 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:21.430
 doors released note 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.490
 and at the same time use 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.490
 these expenses as a producer 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.680
 the farmer has high protein content 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.789
 and not around 15% but their masters are full of thorns the research comes 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.310
 working in the production of leading plants of this inconvenience 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.310
 unfortunately 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.420
 without thorn 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.809
 produces slightly less 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:48.889
 than with 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.789
 we did this first stage of improvement 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:53.740
 that was to take the thorn out 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.930
 and now we're going to make the genetic improvement to 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.259
 forage production 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:03.819
 others believe that working with native forage plants that are 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:08.030
 suited to the climate of the semi-arid region - 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.759
 a wealth that unfortunately we do not 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.129
 do not enjoy 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:14.259
 and sometimes go hungry 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.169
 without murdering their dead cattle 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.349
 and you arrive in the high rainy season 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.530
 without even having the time when we do not have any 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.870
 ask you start 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.930
 to rebuild or increase your herd moment 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.960
 The paper is just one of many riches that the caatinga biome has 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.939
 to offer 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:38.909
 just learning to deal with it works in the semi-arid is one thing 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.960
 It's difficult for us to rain. 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.999
 The big problem is trying 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:46.639
 the 1st round constant 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.639
 arrives finds the products that are most appropriate to this type of climate 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.580
 more than 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.849
 betrayed food better 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:05.800
 behind the animals that has been working and living here in a very long life. 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.869
 best 

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:10.949
 and tragic people in a mass situation because what is happening today 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:11.979
 after 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:13.839
 33 years old 

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:19.459
 this snowball that is starting to catch is really something that gives me a 

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:19.589
 joy
