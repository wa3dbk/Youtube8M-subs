00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:41.530
 easy 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.530
 the idea is that they go into the kitchen with 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.830

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.620
 [Music] 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.950
 a teaspoon of vanilla extract 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.650
 vanilla and vanilla butter 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.890
 melted we are going to add are two 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.429
 spoonfuls now we mix it very well 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.690
 A) Yes 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.440
 and we are not clumps ok 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.100
 [Music] 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.290
 or that this is the secret of the crepes 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.470
 but if we do not have to let rest by 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.720
 about 30 minutes to an hour and we put it 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.850
 in the fridge nothing else we need a 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.760
 pan and has a surface as well 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.490
 it's not that you do not stick these are better if 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.170
 have it out we start with a pan to 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.600
 medium-high fire and we're going to 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.150
 add cutting sprint or butter or 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.920
 oil or depends on what you already have 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.560
 this is going to add our mix 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.750
 of crepes now the amount of mixture 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.580
 that you are going to put it really depends 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.890
 the size of your pan if you have a 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.170
 frying pan boy obviously you need a 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.480
 little bit less and we are going to spin 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.850
 A) Yes 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.910
 [Music] 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.600
 very easy now we let it cook 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.770
 for 45 seconds to a minute like that and then 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.040
 we flipped it 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.030
 and we wait another 15 seconds at 20 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.040
 seconds 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.420
