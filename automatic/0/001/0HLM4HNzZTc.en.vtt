respect for him but he's not somebody I
consider<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.690> major<00:00:49.260> influence<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:51.210> main

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
consider a major influence the main

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.930 
consider a major influence the main
considerations<00:00:52.379> for<00:00:52.649> me<00:00:52.739> was<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.250> tone<00:00:53.489> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
considerations for me was the tone and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.029 
considerations for me was the tone and
actually<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> light<00:00:55.170> weight<00:00:55.440> was<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> big

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
actually the light weight was a big

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.700 
actually the light weight was a big
factor<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.670> me<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.480> have<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> bad<00:00:58.199> back<00:00:58.440> from

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
factor for me I have a bad back from

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.560 
factor for me I have a bad back from
playing<00:00:58.920> heavy<00:00:59.460> guitars<00:00:59.850> for<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.149> lot<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.390> years

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
playing heavy guitars for a lot of years

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.650 
playing heavy guitars for a lot of years
and<00:01:00.949> this<00:01:01.949> guitar<00:01:02.129> comes<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.760> at<00:01:02.910> just<00:01:02.940> just

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
and this guitar comes in at just just

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.830 
and this guitar comes in at just just
over<00:01:03.930> 5<00:01:04.140> pounds<00:01:04.549> it's<00:01:05.549> got<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.850> extreme<00:01:06.600> cut

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
over 5 pounds it's got this extreme cut

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.230 
over 5 pounds it's got this extreme cut
out<00:01:06.960> here<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:08.130> overall<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> very<00:01:08.729> small

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
out here it's overall a very small

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.020 
out here it's overall a very small
guitar<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:10.409> lack<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.860> headstock<00:01:11.369> reduces

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
guitar the lack of a headstock reduces

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.350 
guitar the lack of a headstock reduces
weight<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.770> it's<00:01:13.770> chamber<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.790> all<00:01:15.210> those

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
weight and it's chamber so all those

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.780 
weight and it's chamber so all those
characteristics<00:01:16.070> make<00:01:17.070> for<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> very<00:01:17.369> light

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.080 
as far as the lack of a headstock it
does<00:03:06.130> take<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.340> little<00:03:06.610> bit<00:03:06.730> of<00:03:06.790> getting<00:03:07.000> used

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
does take a little bit of getting used
