Hey kids welcome to PDRsan's Rubbish Bin

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:03.343
Today 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.160
I'm going to take a look at Japanese Chocolate eggs and Kinder eggs

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.680
and see which is the superior

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:10.855
Dude

00:00:10.855 --> 00:00:13.775
We all know that the Japanese chocolate egg

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.660
First

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.620
The Japanese chocolate egg is wrapped in tin foil and in a little box

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.460
It says on the box what you can get in the egg

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.340
The kinder egg is just wrapped in tin foil

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.340
and it doesn't say what you can get in it

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.760
I believe this was a Avengers kinder egg

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.369
Next

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.560
First the Japanese chocolate egg

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.940
Tastes like cheap chocolate

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.466
Next the kinder egg

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.600
Tastes exactly the same as the Japanese one...

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.720
Last of the most important thing

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This is the Japanese chocolate egg toy

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.240
I'm guessing this is some bad guy from Mario

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.800
I think it's pretty well made considering the price

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.700
and this is the kinder egg toy (sorry it's out of focus d*)

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.700
this is more like you're getting what you paid for

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.360
The winner is the Japanese chocolate egg

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.280
Dude that's what I was trying to

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.980
!!!(^-^)

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.731
I just realized

00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:53.731
that on this in shows you that you can use this as a keychain

00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:54.831
but

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.440
it doesn't come with a chain...
