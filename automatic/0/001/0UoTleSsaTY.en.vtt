down on the tile let it sit 5 minutes
and<00:01:07.450> we'll<00:01:08.110> show<00:01:08.229> you<00:01:08.259> what<00:01:08.470> it<00:01:08.560> does<00:01:08.680> on<00:01:08.830> tile

and<00:01:09.250> grout

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.770 

we<00:01:17.310> want<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.610> make<00:01:17.729> sure<00:01:17.909> we<00:01:18.090> get<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.240> nice<00:01:18.450> layer

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
we want to make sure we get a nice layer

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.109 
we want to make sure we get a nice layer
over<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.229> graph<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:19.860> not<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.119> misty

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
over the graph that it's not just misty

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.870 
over the graph that it's not just misty
damp<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:21.780> actually<00:01:22.170> wet<00:01:22.729> so<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
damp that it's actually wet so the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.940 
damp that it's actually wet so the
chemical<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.540> soak<00:01:24.810> into<00:01:25.229> any<00:01:25.380> grease<00:01:25.710> or

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
chemical can soak into any grease or

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.920 
chemical can soak into any grease or
dirt<00:01:26.189> that's<00:01:26.399> in<00:01:26.610> there<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.000> penetrate<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.780> we

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
dirt that's in there and penetrate so we

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.670 
dirt that's in there and penetrate so we
can<00:01:29.000> have<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> nice<00:01:30.270> clean<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.840> save<00:01:31.200> time<00:01:31.470> and

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
can have a nice clean and save time and

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.889 
can have a nice clean and save time and
not<00:01:31.770> have<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.100> twice<00:01:32.360> we're<00:01:33.360> also<00:01:33.509> just

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
not have to do it twice we're also just

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.630 
not have to do it twice we're also just
for<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.289> sake<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.710> we're<00:01:34.890> gonna<00:01:35.009> we're

and we'll extract that also alright we
let<00:01:47.039> this<00:01:47.189> sit<00:01:47.490> for<00:01:47.520> about<00:01:47.759> six<00:01:48.240> minutes<00:01:48.479> I

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
let this sit for about six minutes I

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.990 
let this sit for about six minutes I
know<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:49.049> hard<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.350> hear<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.830> now<00:01:50.819> we're

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
know it's hard to hear and now we're

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.430 
know it's hard to hear and now we're
hitting<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.240> with<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> turbo<00:01:51.869> tool<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.229> about

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
hitting it with the turbo tool it about

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.490 
hitting it with the turbo tool it about
a<00:01:52.470> thousand<00:01:52.979> psi<00:01:53.899> hooked<00:01:54.899> up<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> truck

a thousand psi hooked up to a truck
mount<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.659> see<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.959> difference

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
mount and you can see the difference

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.740 
mount and you can see the difference
that<00:01:58.350> makes<00:01:58.470> after<00:01:59.039> just<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.340> few<00:01:59.369> minutes<00:02:02.750> this

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750

dining room we do every three months so
it's<00:02:06.869> not<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.700> huge<00:02:08.700> accumulation<00:02:09.739> but<00:02:10.739> it's

it's not a huge accumulation but it's

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.300 
it's not a huge accumulation but it's
dirty<00:02:11.130> enough<00:02:12.440> and<00:02:13.440> we<00:02:13.620> don't<00:02:13.830> need<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.010> mix

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
dirty enough and we don't need to mix

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.130

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.940 
any grill deep stains out of it but in
this<00:02:30.750> case<00:02:30.989> we're<00:02:31.230> not<00:02:31.260> going<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.560> need<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.829> do

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
this case we're not going to need to do

00:02:31.950 --> 00:03:32.750 
this case we're not going to need to do
that

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.490 

now<00:03:33.760> what<00:03:33.939> we'll<00:03:34.120> do<00:03:34.269> we'll<00:03:34.930> put<00:03:35.109> up<00:03:35.140> a<00:03:35.319> little

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
now what we'll do we'll put up a little

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.619 
now what we'll do we'll put up a little
fan<00:03:35.829> get<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:36.579> dry<00:03:36.879> and<00:03:37.150> show<00:03:37.329> you<00:03:37.420> what<00:03:37.569> it

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
looks like when it's finished right

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.360 
looks like when it's finished right
after<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.329> do<00:03:40.450> this<00:03:40.750> I'm<00:03:41.049> going<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.290> extract<00:03:42.040> a

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
after I do this I'm going to extract a

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.250 
after I do this I'm going to extract a
little<00:03:42.579> area<00:03:42.790> carpet<00:03:43.209> that<00:03:43.329> we<00:03:43.450> pre<00:03:43.900> treated

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
little area carpet that we pre treated

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.599

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
so as you can see this was real easy to

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.930 
so as you can see this was real easy to
do<00:04:07.530> if<00:04:07.800> you<00:04:07.980> didn't<00:04:08.190> have<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.430> truck<00:04:08.640> mount<00:04:08.880> in

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
the turbo tool you could have mixed this

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.650 
the turbo tool you could have mixed this

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
a little stronger deck brushed it and

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.059 
a little stronger deck brushed it and
wet<00:04:12.840> vacuumed<00:04:13.319> it<00:04:13.410> up<00:04:13.530> that<00:04:13.740> would<00:04:13.860> have<00:04:13.950> been

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
wet vacuumed it up that would have been

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.009 
wet vacuumed it up that would have been
