was<00:02:03.370> 25<00:02:03.760> years<00:02:03.820> ago<00:02:04.000> so<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:04.450> can<00:02:04.570> basically

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
was 25 years ago so you can basically

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.480 
was 25 years ago so you can basically

didn't<00:02:06.760> know<00:02:06.850> a<00:02:06.880> lot<00:02:07.210> of<00:02:07.240> that<00:02:07.420> railing<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:07.900> it

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
didn't know a lot of that railing and it

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.920 
didn't know a lot of that railing and it
was<00:02:08.110> it<00:02:08.500> was<00:02:08.740> a<00:02:08.890> hard<00:02:09.400> road<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:09.910> her<00:02:10.210> to<00:02:10.750> her<00:02:10.900> to

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
was it was a hard road to her to her to

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.110 
was it was a hard road to her to her to
move<00:02:11.320> through<00:02:11.560> that<00:02:11.770> and<00:02:11.950> I<00:02:12.400> think<00:02:12.610> the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
move through that and I think the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.060 
move through that and I think the
program<00:02:13.570> itself<00:02:13.750> this<00:02:14.140> board<00:02:14.410> rally<00:02:14.620> program

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
program itself this board rally program

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.010 
program itself this board rally program
probably<00:02:15.520> got<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.700> be<00:02:15.790> too<00:02:15.970> big<00:02:16.330> for<00:02:16.690> forward

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
probably got to be too big for forward

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.900 
probably got to be too big for forward
internally<00:02:17.560> as<00:02:17.710> far<00:02:17.920> as<00:02:18.070> they<00:02:18.250> didn't<00:02:18.790> have

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
internally as far as they didn't have

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.730 
internally as far as they didn't have
the<00:02:19.000> resources<00:02:19.120> internally<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.590> we

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
the resources internally and and we

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.880 
the resources internally and and we
needed<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.130> big<00:02:21.280> race<00:02:21.460> team<00:02:21.760> so<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.890> Jason

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
needed a big race team so and Jason
