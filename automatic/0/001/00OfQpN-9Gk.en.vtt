pretty<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.270> seems<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.690> they<00:00:51.840> cover<00:00:52.110> it

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170

got any missing ones but again it's for

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.410 
got any missing ones but again it's for
the<00:00:56.370> sake<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.550> not<00:00:56.789> having<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.030> figure<00:00:57.270> out

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
the sake of not having to figure out

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.119 
the sake of not having to figure out
what<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.780> emerging<00:00:58.410> means<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.859> device
