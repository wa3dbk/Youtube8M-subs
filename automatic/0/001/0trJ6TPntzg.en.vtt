00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:04.109
 I so closely said hardly tusk and 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:05.599
 today I want an indicator 

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:07.429
 stock value what when 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:10.109
 nepotism a little bit of personalities 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:12.219
 percentage of moment manipulation but in 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:14.439
 any redistribution we can still 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.589
 change and photos sometimes it is very 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:19.230
 good at 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.199
 it all depends of course on shooting 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.569
 the simplest basic things then naturally 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.129
 you can make your photos clearer 

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:28.839
 more contrast 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:30.349
 and 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.140
 m slightly increase the amount 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.940
 and where are the christi of each color 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.460
 the intensity of the color seems that someone that 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.120
 called 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.170
 all this can be done from the scenery and more 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.860
 cooler much cooler 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.430
 I really appreciate doing this with Photoshop 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.030
 even the most 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.520
 initial version of the seventh type photoshop 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.650
 in my opinion which can simultaneously 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.620
 almost no one uses 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.140
 m 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.290
 on this version you can do everything 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.750
 the same thing on the network function there 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.150
 human rights activist despite the fact that I have 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.820
 English new pricing for a different sector 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.990
 shop abb series 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.970
 Putin is a station called her 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.620
 not practically the same 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.570
 so after all for today's regional 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.250
 right 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.250
 photo of native but fast means thunder 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.370
 first I love terribly 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.090
 1 1 talent 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.420
 and in particular I chose one of the photographs about 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.120
 works 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.600
 who are not afraid to take with you 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.900
 teenagers 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.420
 but since 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.210
 goalkeeper photos we see that here 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.210
 great amount 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.590
 on the square let's say so busy 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.040
 close flowers pesticide 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.080
 pale enough and all smoke 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.980
 don't know gentle kremlin don't know 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.400
 Russia India and China Beijing recently announced 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.030
 then years and forage harvesting 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.880
 too contrast therefore 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.369
 for our advertising viewers 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.730
 products for purposes 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.310
 percentage of attention to this 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.720
 to society 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.340
 author and second 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.340
 and I'm also a priest of creativity 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.029
 to attract attention to creativity 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:14.089
 under specific 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:16.529
 The percentage of this kind of photo is not 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:17.579
 will go 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.049
 arch 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.419
 what can we do the base itself first 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:22.539
 first of all 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:24.980
 Now the medium in the menu item here 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.099
 there is meat at the very top of Photoshop 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.039
 butter 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:31.039
 so together and less 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.279
 in particular in English that is it 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:34.569
 third menu item 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.369
 percent 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:40.369
 private stand there 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.859
 change tone change 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.089
 shorter matter 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:48.069
 and I remove the butcher's chance then 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.629
 there is brightness and contrast 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:50.719
 push 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:51.639
 but 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.379
 3 2 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.379
 not so much because this is the third menu item 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.430
 in particular, this is the second item 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.999
 attacker submenu 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:04.019
 and 1 inter first bragin brightness and 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.929
 contrast this meeting 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:07.979
 mean what can we do to the light 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.439
 then they capital kitty activities 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.939
 this endure contract two 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.859
 small subjects 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.519
 both my husband and me 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.090
 let's set the results sand and goes there 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.519
 that is, we turn off the brightness at the station 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:21.389
 rationu 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.369
 evidence of that 

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.049
 little by little upstairs 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.499
 putting the right side of zero there 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:31.499
 In general, it turns out that why not 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:34.719
 you play with this 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:36.609
 and I let them choose 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.089
 arranging the basis dictate brightness 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:41.139
 because it was too bright yes you can 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:42.529
 remember comtrans 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:44.849
 contrast you can meet a number here 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:45.559
 what you 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.679
 look into the flask or 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:49.659
 imagine the project ironing look 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.889
 what exactly is changing because they will exclaim 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:53.299
 and her words 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.250
 that is, time 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.680
 preview preview 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.919
 responded here 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.059
 and you will immediately see what happens to people 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:02.109
 with sand with development 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.369
 how to change eruptions 

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:07.369
 percentage right to the right planted 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:09.759
 what will happen if you remove the contrasts remove 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:12.499
 Anthony's brightness is clear that 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:13.579
 it turns out 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.009
 we remove the brightness but for example played 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:17.829
 here 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.229
 with this 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.889
 rub here with this image what is it 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.449
 I added a lot of contrast 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:25.470
 so I don't have 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.470
 little forward 

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:31.889
 image in a landfill and let's say more 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.270
 became attractive and a little bit 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.210
 removed the brightness because everything was too 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.999
 white now I have it less 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:41.509
 but it turned out better we press ok when 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.610
 we agree 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.669
 next thing to do or not 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.569
 interest cases 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:53.539
 Filter menu item is two three four 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.870
 five six sixth 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.309
 I ask your opponent 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:01.180
 all this is a little bit there sharpness change 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.099
 they may already 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.710
 financially masks that is 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.360
 on the mask for 16 that is, we will now 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.479
 sample 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:09.770
 just like us 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.669
 you can change the rarity can 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.240
 change and sharpness to the specified 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.030
 the number of patients is platoons 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.719
 there is a patient here 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:20.860
 and here are such a low girl 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.330
 we can also here are four that is or 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.039
 small window 3d we can student 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.530
 what will happen or on the process of tely on 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.699
 amount 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.729
 the image can be a multiple of yes and 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.180
 In general, then change 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.449
 it means 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.449
 but naturally try skp growth 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.919
 sharpness 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.599
 and here especially sharpness changes 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:47.159
 because the image could 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:48.860
 Just a little bit of fishing line 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.960
 will increase 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.449
 but in order for a little bit 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:55.289
 but the point was this change leg sharper 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.509
 to change the sharpness we can read 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:01.509
 do so here is a radio 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.330
 here and here this 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.409
 radius of cycles if you will you sit that 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.930
 It turns out I will bring and David 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.950
 I have gone missing, but how am I then 74 thousand these words 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:16.819
 him right in black and white became 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:20.449
 treat in short here is 1.8 play 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:24.349
 increasing previously metropolitan 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:27.189
 at tons of game level 

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:29.629
 penetration point sharpness so 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:31.239
 find out why the president 

00:06:31.239 --> 00:06:34.239
 European integration 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.979
 it seems to me 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:40.569
 studio ceiling 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:43.119
 purchases of these four five pixels can 

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:44.599
 always stop 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:46.279
 and there is 

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:48.239
 can be cured like this 

00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:50.259
 more vietnam 

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:52.979
 the fact that idleness was clearly visible then 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:55.419
 please can do this 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:57.619
 stopped at one hundred percent that is it 

00:06:57.619 --> 00:06:59.649
 paparatsii aktivnichal 

00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:01.259
 and on 3 4 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:02.949
 and in progress in retail 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:06.309
 tons of famous course jump 

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:08.659
 this action itself is massive 

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:09.110
 to make
