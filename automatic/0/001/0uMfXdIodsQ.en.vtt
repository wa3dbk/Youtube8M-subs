miles per hour that is the only somewhat
good<00:00:23.279> thing<00:00:23.609> about<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.060> situation<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.689> storm

good thing about the situation the storm

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.529 
good thing about the situation the storm
is<00:00:25.289> at<00:00:25.500> least<00:00:25.769> moving<00:00:26.220> along<00:00:26.699> it's<00:00:26.970> not<00:00:27.180> going

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
is at least moving along it's not going

is at least moving along it's not going
to<00:00:27.689> linger<00:00:28.140> but<00:00:28.710> it's<00:00:29.220> going<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.519> cause

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
to linger but it's going to cause

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.299 
to linger but it's going to cause
terrible<00:00:30.420> devastation<00:00:30.779> as<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.980> moves<00:00:32.189> through

very well-defined

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.280 
very well-defined

eye and that eye wall is now coming

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.770 
eye and that eye wall is now coming
onshore<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.820> going<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.060> begin<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.540> wreak

onshore and it's going to begin to wreak

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.289 
onshore and it's going to begin to wreak
havoc<00:01:15.810> across<00:01:16.380> these<00:01:16.799> central<00:01:17.310> parts<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.759> the

havoc across these central parts of the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.820 
havoc across these central parts of the
Philippines<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:18.869> we've<00:01:19.110> been<00:01:19.259> getting<00:01:19.560> some

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
Philippines so we've been getting some

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.350 
Philippines so we've been getting some
wind<00:01:20.159> readings<00:01:20.490> we've<00:01:20.640> got<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> wind<00:01:21.090> reading

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
wind readings we've got a wind reading

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.780 
wind readings we've got a wind reading
from<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.659> beyond<00:01:22.500> right<00:01:22.830> here<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> sustained

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
from this beyond right here a sustained

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.950 
from this beyond right here a sustained
wind<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.650> 96<00:01:25.650> miles<00:01:25.950> per<00:01:26.280> hour<00:01:26.369> coming<00:01:26.759> out<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.749 
wind of 96 miles per hour coming out the
Northeast<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.650> no<00:01:28.890> doubt<00:01:29.159> gusting<00:01:29.610> much

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
Northeast so no doubt gusting much

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.179 
Northeast so no doubt gusting much
higher<00:01:30.000> than<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.869> winds<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.470> far<00:01:31.829> have

couple of days Jim Edd's is right here
tak<00:01:40.350> Lebon<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.460> looks<00:01:41.670> like<00:01:41.759> he's<00:01:42.000> going

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
tak Lebon and it looks like he's going

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.420 
tak Lebon and it looks like he's going
to<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.360> pretty<00:01:42.659> much<00:01:42.750> directly<00:01:43.439> hit<00:01:44.040> by<00:01:44.070> this

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430

finally by the middle of the day our

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.690 
finally by the middle of the day our
time<00:03:37.510> we'll<00:03:38.320> watch<00:03:38.500> that<00:03:38.739> storm<00:03:38.950> begin<00:03:39.400> to

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
time we'll watch that storm begin to

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.580 
time we'll watch that storm begin to
move<00:03:39.850> out<00:03:40.090> beyond<00:03:40.450> that<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:41.170> is<00:03:41.320> going<00:03:41.470> to

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
move out beyond that it is going to

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.530 
move out beyond that it is going to
continue<00:03:41.860> out<00:03:42.220> into<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.820> South<00:03:43.120> China<00:03:43.150> Sea

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
continue out into the South China Sea

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.020 
continue out into the South China Sea
and<00:03:43.959> will<00:03:44.500> make<00:03:44.680> its<00:03:44.830> way<00:03:44.890> towards<00:03:45.370> Vietnam

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
and will make its way towards Vietnam

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.400 
and will make its way towards Vietnam
most<00:03:46.600> likely<00:03:46.989> but<00:03:47.170> it<00:03:47.320> will<00:03:47.530> be<00:03:47.799> weakened

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
most likely but it will be weakened

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.220 
most likely but it will be weakened
as<00:03:48.590> it<00:03:48.830> nears<00:03:49.070> Vietnam<00:03:49.700> probably<00:03:50.600> a<00:03:50.630> category

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
as it nears Vietnam probably a category

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.320 
as it nears Vietnam probably a category
three<00:03:51.590> rapidly<00:03:52.430> on<00:03:52.580> its<00:03:52.730> way<00:03:52.880> down<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.300> a

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
three rapidly on its way down to a

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.780 
three rapidly on its way down to a
category<00:03:53.900> one<00:03:54.230> as<00:03:54.830> it<00:03:55.040> moves<00:03:55.220> into<00:03:55.370> central

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
category one as it moves into central

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.340 
category one as it moves into central
Vietnam<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.480> then<00:03:56.600> up<00:03:56.750> into<00:03:57.020> the<00:03:57.140> northern

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
Vietnam and then up into the northern

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.130 
Vietnam and then up into the northern
part<00:03:57.770> of<00:03:57.980> Vietnam<00:03:58.250> but<00:03:59.000> I<00:03:59.300> fear<00:03:59.660> that<00:03:59.690> this<00:03:59.990> is

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
part of Vietnam but I fear that this is

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.720 
part of Vietnam but I fear that this is
going<00:04:00.380> to<00:04:00.440> be<00:04:00.590> one<00:04:01.190> of<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.340> worst<00:04:01.520> disasters

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
going to be one of the worst disasters

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.550 
going to be one of the worst disasters
that<00:04:02.240> we've<00:04:02.390> heard<00:04:02.660> about<00:04:02.840> in<00:04:03.140> quite<00:04:03.350> some

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
that we've heard about in quite some

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.580
