00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.420
 hello people think our race today we will learn some strategy of 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.380
 record 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.379
 so when you're out of pain 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:13.739
 is a world columnist when he was not sure what to do 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:15.829
 I can not be here 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:20.019
 So when we were here, I love to see what it was, it was here. 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:24.539
 but I will be nothing from here and will have a year here 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.269
 early in the day 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.460
 this number of universities 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.199
 then you will go wrong 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.330
 in your day to day 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.550
 and here in town it says 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.240
 but attention you will need days the city does not show that the name of the 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.120
 City 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.810
 You're going to see who's going to see you soon. 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.450
 and here 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.420
 will appear in the case a world where it 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.420
 you are never under the control of tivit on which indicators 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.220
 and see the youngest of ideli convinced that the item expert is not more 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.819
 then it is to search who is here attacking the first 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:04.750
 promotions 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.070
 the success of the next thing 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.070
 she 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.300
 the operation should end 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.410
 after needing you will see who is attacking happens that you have 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.020
 condition of 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.469
 defend a vaccination card 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:22.490
 but 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.500
 I prefer the following 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.520
 I'd rather incriminate myself. 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.770
 first practiced here and there 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.100
 in the compromise protocol 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.350
 I leave avandia that is marked here today 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.390
 unchecked 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.130
 because in the case here with lengia 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.090
 abnormal variations are caused by a new case 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.080
 attack 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.970
 are you understanding 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.200
 so you will not miss anything petrova do not think we'll get back to the ball 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.940
 does not roll in case it is created by losing 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.220
 in the south 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.320
 also not you will not lose any game because what you see 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.460
 here in the bush 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.740
 and there you put it to sell how I'm going to run to sell fast 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.549
 navi 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.819
 so in the case here the children 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.749
 contrary 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.699
 I came here today and made up 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.290
 We must find here and this 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.319
 That's why I want you here and see 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.420
 a few hours later the red wine 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.549
 maximize 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.759
 and here today I confirm 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:26.709
 ready 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.709
 What's going on is confirmed there. 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:33.210
 I'll be with my product to sell. 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.870
 more so after the same impact you come here while following 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.639
 and you think if I will be the case 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:41.960
 to anpc 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.880
 already understood 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.710
 so this my life 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.920
 is the advice going to allow the country 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.920
 and you will not lose either 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.429
 then this is the case and the spout to use that can not start 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:58.690
 so will you do the same thing? 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.140
 first you will need your attacker 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.850
 so what you'll see 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.880
 you will make the decision in the 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.249
 if you think in case if the attacker is very strong comes from unix 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:16.589
 in transport the review all of the west officials were seen leaving 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.950
 in the game 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.409
 so you never south 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.150
 let him start 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.199
 why do not they feel that they stop colonizing 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.949
 because 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:30.260
 and it is also something else I do not know that I left here is that the protocol of 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:32.399
 commitment of some students 

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:34.659
 here you have to leave kings marques 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:35.980
 every brother of gilmar 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.129
 cadu 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.520
 Why will not you have to prove that it is not 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.490
 then you will let him colonize and I saw what will happen next here 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.729
 find here 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:49.779
 will appear here 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:52.779
 in marcelÃ¢ndia 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.919
 war against independence 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.009
 You're never going to make my stay ready. 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.979
 and do not talk if they are in school 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:04.619
 so you in the case 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:09.359
 I will not show that you do not have another branch I have nothing and do not run 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.419
 exactly in the petrÃ³polis neighborhood 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:15.379
 and the guy he can not save then 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.900
 This is a pleasure and doubt. 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.340
 we were shocked or only at one of them if you see it's worth it 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.880
 sometimes we'll do anesthesia thinking that the guy is weak 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.840
 but there the guy in no case of the disease in hospitals very strong friends and leaves 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.090
 So 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.120
 care 15 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.520
 if the very 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.629
 The way I told you, you're not going to miss a thing. 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:41.439
 and then you only have to win 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:42.639
 thank you 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:43.169
 bye
