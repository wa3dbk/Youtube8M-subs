your survival system there should not be
the<00:00:35.010> linchpin<00:00:35.250> part<00:00:35.820> as<00:00:36.090> far<00:00:36.300> as<00:00:36.450> we're

survival situation when that survival
kit<00:02:03.689> whoever<00:02:03.930> becomes<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.409> single<00:02:05.119> crux<00:02:06.119> item

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509

in<00:02:06.659> your<00:02:06.930> survival<00:02:07.259> system<00:02:07.710> may<00:02:07.799> be<00:02:07.979> said<00:02:08.220> it

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
in your survival system may be said it

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.400 
in your survival system may be said it
becomes<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.179> single<00:02:09.360> point<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.660> failure<00:02:09.720> and

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
becomes a single point of failure and

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.390 
becomes a single point of failure and
that's<00:02:10.800> where<00:02:11.069> we<00:02:11.400> had<00:02:11.520> concerns

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
that's where we had concerns

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.960 
that's where we had concerns
now<00:02:13.560> there's<00:02:14.560> no<00:02:14.680> right<00:02:14.950> or<00:02:14.980> wrong<00:02:15.129> with<00:02:15.640> any

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
now there's no right or wrong with any

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.160 
now there's no right or wrong with any
of<00:02:16.090> this<00:02:17.250> method<00:02:18.360> within<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.510> survival<00:02:19.959> we've

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
of this method within the survival we've

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.770 
of this method within the survival we've
sort<00:02:20.470> of<00:02:20.500> seen<00:02:21.030> all<00:02:22.030> we<00:02:22.209> want<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.450> really<00:02:22.599> do

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
sort of seen all we want to really do

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.720 
sort of seen all we want to really do
here<00:02:23.019> in<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.500> point<00:02:23.709> of<00:02:23.799> this<00:02:23.890> short<00:02:24.400> video<00:02:24.549> is

here in the point of this short video is

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.640 
here in the point of this short video is
to<00:02:24.879> really<00:02:25.150> highlight<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.629> fact<00:02:25.870> that<00:02:26.110> you

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
to really highlight the fact that you

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.680 
to really highlight the fact that you
need<00:02:26.799> to<00:02:27.040> think<00:02:27.310> out<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.940> box<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.420> need<00:02:28.569> to

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
need to think out of the box you need to

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.660 
need to think out of the box you need to
think<00:02:28.959> literally<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:30.069> a<00:02:30.190> survival<00:02:30.519> kit

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
think literally in a survival kit

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.280 
think literally in a survival kit
situation<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.299> need<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.480> think<00:02:31.690> outside<00:02:31.930> of

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
situation you need to think outside of

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.580 
situation you need to think outside of
that<00:02:32.379> box<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:33.489> need<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.970> think<00:02:34.269> of<00:02:34.470> having<00:02:35.470> a

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
that box you need to think of having a

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.130 
that box you need to think of having a
system<00:02:35.980> rather<00:02:36.459> than<00:02:36.610> a<00:02:36.940> kit<00:02:37.269> having

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
system rather than a kit having

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.729 
system rather than a kit having
knowledge<00:02:38.680> as<00:02:39.310> opposed<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.879> a<00:02:40.150> kit<00:02:40.739> okay

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
knowledge as opposed to a kit okay

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.100 
knowledge as opposed to a kit okay
because<00:02:41.890> those<00:02:42.129> items<00:02:42.519> in<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:42.849> kit<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.510> always

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
because those items in that kit I always

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.110 
because those items in that kit I always
subject<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.560> being<00:02:44.769> a<00:02:45.040> used-up<00:02:45.730> be

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
unavailable when you really need them I

of<00:03:12.609> the<00:03:12.670> big<00:03:12.760> problems<00:03:12.970> with<00:03:13.180> survival<00:03:14.079> kits

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
of the big problems with survival kits

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.539 
of the big problems with survival kits
is<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.650> lot<00:03:14.859> of<00:03:14.950> them<00:03:15.040> are<00:03:15.159> commercially

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
is a lot of them are commercially

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.940 
is a lot of them are commercially
produced<00:03:15.879> they're<00:03:16.450> a<00:03:16.480> one-size-fits-all<00:03:17.470> kit

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
produced they're a one-size-fits-all kit

and<00:03:18.160> as<00:03:18.760> people<00:03:19.510> are<00:03:20.049> probably<00:03:20.349> well<00:03:20.590> aware

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
and as people are probably well aware

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.319 
and as people are probably well aware
when<00:03:21.549> you<00:03:21.639> have<00:03:21.730> anything<00:03:22.180> as

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
when you have anything as

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:23.220 
when you have anything as
one-size-fits-all

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
one-size-fits-all

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.650 
one-size-fits-all
but<00:03:23.859> generally<00:03:24.130> if<00:03:24.190> it's<00:03:24.310> no<00:03:24.519> one<00:03:24.730> person<00:03:25.180> and

but generally if it's no one person and
that's<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:25.989> bad<00:03:26.139> thing<00:03:26.519> all<00:03:27.519> right<00:03:27.669> so<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:28.329> need

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
that's a bad thing all right so you need

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.640 
that's a bad thing all right so you need
to<00:03:28.690> think<00:03:29.349> about<00:03:29.440> making<00:03:30.040> your<00:03:30.250> kit<00:03:30.700> suit<00:03:31.359> you

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
to think about making your kit suit you

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.140 
to think about making your kit suit you
and<00:03:32.650> we<00:03:32.769> recommend<00:03:33.040> people<00:03:33.579> when<00:03:33.910> they<00:03:34.030> come
