00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.320
 hello today we are going to make another short this 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.400
 it's very easy it's a little thicker 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.400
 and it's made with soy 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.180
 and with a 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.820
 [Music] 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.250
 and that is already a chain and those that already 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.850
 They know about crochet they are just doing 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.019
 three chains 1 2 and 3 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.270
 we return to the chain of the middle 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.340
 the second house 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.920
 through it we passed the needle and 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.490
 we bring a loop since we have two 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.120
 rings on the needle and return to the 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.600
 first and we bring another loop and we are 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.430
 with three rings on the needle 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.860
 we paired and now a lot of care of 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.360
 this step you have to be very careful 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.090
 let's take out the needle of the two 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.570
 first rings and we are only 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.600
 with the first ring mounts 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.250
 we go through the loop and we take it out 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.940
 ring 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.130
 and there if we go back again 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.860
 to the next ring the same 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.830
 operation we go through the loop we take it out 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.010
 by the ring and our last ring 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.930
 and the same here we already have 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.160
 again the three rings as to 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:39.250
 principle I will repeat we take out the 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.010
 the first two rings the needle 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.730
 we're left with the last one there and we start 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.630
 there we cross the thread from behind 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.630
 and we bring it 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.520
 now we go for the second ring 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.150
 and the last one 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.140
 I'm going to do it again to be able 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.140
 show them a little how the cord is 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.510
 here the only difficulty 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.450
 sustaining it is a difficulty is the 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.520
 let's say the secret so that it does not work 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.780
 the trees if you're here so you do not 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.670
 hide us 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.340
 although there is the only problem would be 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.810
 return us a return either 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.190
 to serious 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.190
 two rings and we have them 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.979
 [Music] 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.650
 we always meet again with the 30 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.400
 rings and the cord is a cord network 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.400
 a little thicker 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.250
 we could say that which 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.049
 to complement 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.299
 other cords with the other cords a 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.689
 beautiful embroidery on the road on a 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.689
 handbag
