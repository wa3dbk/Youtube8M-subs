00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.820
 hello friends today I'm going to do this 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:13.190
 super fast easy video is for 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.350
 teach them how to treat chiles 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.800
 poblano peppers if they want to make the 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:22.279
 stuffed some cream in rajas and then 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.939
 well it 's very easy let's have it here 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:29.650
 chillies here and have a comal 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.650
 hot and let's put it 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:38.890
 to start burning that this topic 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.410
 that starts to be common 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.670
 love to burn a little skin but 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:48.520
 that not only is the skin not the what 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.520
 other than chili yes yes let's leave 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.190
 here that starts to burn on the one hand 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.100
 we are going to be spinning 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.040
 constantly to burn 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.620
 mushroom fear from all sides look here 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.620
 is sounding this is what is happening 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.520
 and this skin rises 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.270
 and good and on the other hand we have here 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.100
 so much salt and a bag to put it and 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.980
 when the chiles are inside 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.960
 let's put so much salt so that 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.540
 help access is easier to pledge the 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.520
 skin and we're going to need the jet of 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:32.370
 water for this remove their skin too 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:35.400
 I already made several turns and look how are you 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.590
 now when we want it to be about 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.260
 all this or to say with new the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.450
 chiles are a little curved what 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.150
 we can do is also put them in the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.670
 flame 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.190
 here it is and I'll put it on the side 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.640
 where this topic is not more so that it is 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:56.330
 I do not care here in the parties or in 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.270
 this part of the movie we are going to 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.380
 put them as well as means paradito to 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.380
 start topics 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.099
 but here you have to be very careful 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.520
 so that they will not burn each other if 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.290
 you have to be constantly turning 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.220
 Well, the chiles are here 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.080
 from here where it was curved how it was 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.650
 now let's throw them warm to 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.650
 the bag 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.370
 A) Yes 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.489
 and we are going to wrap them here in the bag 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.489
 roll up 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.069
 so that it begins to form a begin to 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.260
 sweat and like that I'm going to be able to clean them 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.470
 our chiles have already sweated after 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.849
 about 10-15 minutes now we're going to 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.849
 start cleaning 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.760
 let's get it out and let's start 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.410
 Remove the skin as you see it is very easy to 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.560
 remove it 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.989
 the least is more 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.970
 If you do not want to know your hands what 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.760
 What we can do is put some 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.739
 gloves if you have in the network 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.840
 a second glove so that at the moment 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.140
 to change your diaper and tone go to 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.140
 insular 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.180
 let's do is pass them by a jet 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:34.200
 of water for this to take all the 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.200
 Excess of appointment skin is in black 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.410
 and that's how the chiles are now 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.600
 we're going to unveil it and take the 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.290
 seed is not like that is how are the 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.660
 chiles since this without skin the truth is 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.800
 very easy I hope you serve this guy 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:01.400
