toronto<00:00:09.750> FC<00:00:09.960> there<00:00:10.500> were<00:00:10.620> some<00:00:10.800> good

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
toronto FC there were some good

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:20.820 
toronto FC there were some good
performances<00:00:11.160> from<00:00:11.910> some<00:00:12.120> new<00:00:12.269> faces

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.030 

I<00:00:21.150> think<00:00:22.150> for<00:00:22.330> about<00:00:22.480> 20<00:00:22.869> minutes<00:00:23.050> or<00:00:23.290> so<00:00:23.530> maybe

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.040 
I think for about 20 minutes or so maybe

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.320 
I think for about 20 minutes or so maybe
25<00:00:24.700> minutes<00:00:25.170> there<00:00:26.170> were<00:00:26.260> some<00:00:26.470> good<00:00:26.619> stuff<00:00:26.920> a

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
25 minutes there were some good stuff a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.230 
25 minutes there were some good stuff a
couple<00:00:28.330> chances<00:00:28.660> couple<00:00:29.200> good<00:00:29.349> counters<00:00:30.240> but

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
couple chances couple good counters but

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.780 
couple chances couple good counters but
then<00:00:31.390> I<00:00:31.420> think<00:00:31.689> our<00:00:31.810> legs<00:00:32.020> went<00:00:32.259> I've<00:00:33.190> pushed

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
then I think our legs went I've pushed

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.970 
then I think our legs went I've pushed
them<00:00:33.970> pretty<00:00:34.150> hard<00:00:34.270> and<00:00:34.600> you<00:00:35.500> know<00:00:35.590> we<00:00:35.739> knew

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
them pretty hard and you know we knew

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.189 
them pretty hard and you know we knew
they<00:00:36.489> would<00:00:36.670> start<00:00:36.910> to<00:00:37.059> fade<00:00:37.300> and<00:00:37.540> this<00:00:38.020> is

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
they would start to fade and this is

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.369 
they would start to fade and this is
part<00:00:38.470> of<00:00:38.530> our<00:00:38.650> our<00:00:39.010> preseason<00:00:39.460> process<00:00:40.379> they

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
part of our our preseason process they

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:42.810 
part of our our preseason process they
just<00:00:41.559> looked<00:00:41.769> a<00:00:41.860> little<00:00:41.980> bit<00:00:42.129> more<00:00:42.280> lively<00:00:42.489> or

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
just looked a little bit more lively or

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.810 
just looked a little bit more lively or
from<00:00:43.300> then<00:00:43.480> on<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:45.070> to<00:00:45.220> our<00:00:45.340> credit<00:00:45.730> in<00:00:45.790> the

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
from then on but to our credit in the

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.630 
from then on but to our credit in the
first<00:00:46.059> half<00:00:46.239> we<00:00:46.690> held<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.290> fort<00:00:47.500> and<00:00:47.860> got<00:00:48.280> 20

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
first half we held the fort and got 20

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.700 
first half we held the fort and got 20
so<00:00:48.910> that<00:00:49.090> that's<00:00:49.660> that's<00:00:50.230> part<00:00:50.530> of<00:00:50.590> this

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
so that that's that's part of this

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.840 
so that that's that's part of this
league<00:00:50.920> in<00:00:51.160> getting<00:00:51.879> results<00:00:52.300> and<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.890> in<00:00:54.729> that

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
league in getting results and so in that

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.369 
league in getting results and so in that
sense<00:00:55.059> it<00:00:55.239> was<00:00:55.330> it<00:00:55.510> was<00:00:55.720> a<00:00:55.780> good<00:00:55.930> half<00:00:56.140> I<00:00:56.229> think

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
sense it was it was a good half I think

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.740 
sense it was it was a good half I think
we<00:00:56.470> got<00:00:56.620> a<00:00:56.650> lot<00:00:56.799> out<00:00:56.830> of<00:00:57.010> it<00:00:57.449> second<00:00:58.449> half<00:00:58.570> was

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
we got a lot out of it second half was

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.740 
we got a lot out of it second half was
actually<00:00:59.710> I<00:00:59.890> thought<00:01:00.129> the<00:01:00.250> balance<00:01:00.699> the<00:01:01.600> way

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
actually I thought the balance the way

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.570 
actually I thought the balance the way
the<00:01:01.900> team<00:01:02.260> played<00:01:02.589> in<00:01:02.769> the<00:01:02.860> second<00:01:03.250> half<00:01:03.370> was

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
the team played in the second half was

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.640 
the team played in the second half was
it<00:01:04.089> was<00:01:04.330> very<00:01:04.629> good<00:01:04.839> better<00:01:05.110> than<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.409> first

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
it was very good better than the first

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.980 
it was very good better than the first
the<00:01:06.400> first<00:01:06.610> half<00:01:06.820> so<00:01:07.060> credit<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.750> some<00:01:07.900> of

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
the first half so credit to some of

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.719 
the first half so credit to some of
those<00:01:08.049> young<00:01:08.320> guys<00:01:08.470> are<00:01:09.070> they<00:01:09.670> were

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
those young guys are they were

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.330 
those young guys are they were
composed<00:01:10.180> on<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.570> ball<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:11.680> rhythm<00:01:12.190> was

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
composed on the ball the rhythm was

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.980 
composed on the ball the rhythm was
better<00:01:12.580> a<00:01:12.970> little<00:01:13.270> offensive<00:01:13.690> standpoint

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
better a little offensive standpoint

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.950 
better a little offensive standpoint
