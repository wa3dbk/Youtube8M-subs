medium<00:00:19.130> to<00:00:19.279> dark<00:00:19.490> I<00:00:19.609> believe<00:00:19.970> they<00:00:20.150> only<00:00:20.270> have

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
medium to dark I believe they only have

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.190 
medium to dark I believe they only have
two<00:00:20.660> shades<00:00:21.050> I<00:00:21.410> hope<00:00:22.190> they<00:00:22.490> they<00:00:23.090> don't<00:00:23.330> just

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
two shades I hope they they don't just

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.220 
two shades I hope they they don't just
have<00:00:24.320> to<00:00:24.560> but<00:00:25.550> I'm<00:00:26.030> using<00:00:26.449> the<00:00:26.660> medium<00:00:26.900> to<00:00:27.020> dark

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
have to but I'm using the medium to dark

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.200 
have to but I'm using the medium to dark
one<00:00:27.470> and<00:00:27.800> the<00:00:28.400> other<00:00:28.430> one<00:00:28.580> is<00:00:28.699> light<00:00:28.910> to<00:00:29.090> medium

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
one and the other one is light to medium

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.369 
one and the other one is light to medium
so<00:00:29.890> it<00:00:30.890> sucks<00:00:31.340> but<00:00:31.820> that's<00:00:32.539> okay<00:00:32.930> goes<00:00:33.170> on

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379
