00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
inspired this entire project you can see

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.489 
inspired this entire project you can see
the<00:00:34.980> dirt<00:00:35.280> grime<00:00:35.699> and<00:00:35.760> wax<00:00:36.239> buildup<00:00:36.870> before<00:00:37.319> we

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:37.499 
the dirt grime and wax buildup before we

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:41.149 
the dirt grime and wax buildup before we
start<00:00:38.480> the<00:00:39.480> first<00:00:39.749> step<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.319> this<00:00:40.469> project<00:00:40.739> is

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:41.159 
start the first step in this project is

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:43.549 
start the first step in this project is
to<00:00:41.339> resurface<00:00:41.819> the<00:00:42.089> countertop<00:00:42.870> pieces<00:00:43.350> by

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
to resurface the countertop pieces by

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.889 
to resurface the countertop pieces by
planing<00:00:44.129> them<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.850> trick<00:00:45.149> here<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.569> keep

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
planing them the trick here is to keep

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.930 
planing them the trick here is to keep
the<00:00:46.109> countertop<00:00:46.649> pieces<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.280> exactly<00:00:47.729> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
the countertop pieces of exactly the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.540 
the countertop pieces of exactly the
same<00:00:48.179> thickness<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.039> alternate<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.159> boards

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
same thickness so alternate the boards

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.369 
same thickness so alternate the boards
through<00:00:50.819> the<00:00:50.969> planer<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.929> way<00:00:52.050> they'll<00:00:52.199> end

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
through the planer that way they'll end

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.110 
through the planer that way they'll end
up<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.649> exact<00:00:53.069> same<00:00:53.339> side

up the exact same side

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.169 
up the exact same side
I<00:00:54.319> also<00:00:55.319> alternate<00:00:56.069> how<00:00:56.249> I<00:00:56.280> feed<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.819> boards

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:57.179 
I also alternate how I feed the boards

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:00.649 
I also alternate how I feed the boards
through<00:00:57.539> face<00:00:58.499> up<00:00:58.769> and<00:00:58.979> face<00:00:59.069> down<00:00:59.760> this<00:01:00.420> way

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
through face up and face down this way

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.070 
through face up and face down this way
both<00:01:01.079> sides<00:01:01.499> get<00:01:01.829> evenly<00:01:02.249> surfaced<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.179> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
both sides get evenly surfaced and the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.140 
both sides get evenly surfaced and the
boards<00:01:04.409> will<00:01:04.589> remain<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.129> same<00:01:05.370> thickness<00:01:05.729> I

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
boards will remain the same thickness I

resurfaced it's time to move over to the
jointer<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.960> resurface<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.890> square<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
jointer to resurface and square the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.910 
jointer to resurface and square the
edges<00:01:20.880> first<00:01:21.600> make<00:01:21.899> sure<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.289> jointer<00:01:22.560> fence

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
edges first make sure the jointer fence

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.490 
edges first make sure the jointer fence
is<00:01:23.130> square<00:01:23.490> make<00:01:23.820> all<00:01:24.060> adjustments<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.020> then

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
is square make all adjustments and then

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.849 
is square make all adjustments and then
get<00:01:25.680> ready<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.979> run<00:01:26.280> your<00:01:26.310> lumber<00:01:26.789> through

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
get ready to run your lumber through

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:30.289 
get ready to run your lumber through
getting<00:01:28.859> these<00:01:28.979> edges<00:01:29.460> square<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.149> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
getting these edges square on the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.539 
getting these edges square on the
jointer<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.869> crucial<00:01:31.469> because<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.369> will

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
jointer is crucial because this will

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.010 
jointer is crucial because this will
become<00:01:32.700> where<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.149> will<00:01:33.270> join<00:01:33.539> the<00:01:33.840> two

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
become where you will join the two

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.469 
become where you will join the two
pieces<00:01:34.469> of<00:01:34.500> wood<00:01:34.799> together<00:01:35.039> and<00:01:35.549> square<00:01:36.270> edges

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
pieces of wood together and square edges

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.800 
pieces of wood together and square edges
mean<00:01:36.929> a<00:01:36.960> seamless<00:01:37.560> joint<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:39.210> join<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.659> two

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
mean a seamless joint to join the two

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.139 
mean a seamless joint to join the two
pieces<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.229> countertop<00:01:40.920> together<00:01:41.189> we<00:01:41.850> will<00:01:42.000> be

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
pieces of countertop together we will be

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.419 
pieces of countertop together we will be
using<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.630> biscuit<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.170> kit<00:01:43.469> as<00:01:43.920> well<00:01:43.979> as<00:01:44.399> a

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
center finding ruler as you will see

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.739 
center finding ruler as you will see
using<00:01:49.890> biscuits<00:01:50.609> is<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.789> great<00:01:51.179> way<00:01:51.359> to<00:01:51.390> join

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:51.749 
using biscuits is a great way to join

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:53.810 
using biscuits is a great way to join
these<00:01:51.990> two<00:01:52.229> pieces<00:01:52.499> of<00:01:52.710> wood<00:01:52.890> because<00:01:53.579> when

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
these two pieces of wood because when

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.489 
these two pieces of wood because when
done<00:01:54.060> correctly<00:01:54.240> not<00:01:54.749> only<00:01:55.049> will<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.229> add<00:01:55.469> a

done correctly not only will it add a

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:57.679 
done correctly not only will it add a
lot<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.829> strength<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.429> the<00:01:56.700> joint<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.509> will
