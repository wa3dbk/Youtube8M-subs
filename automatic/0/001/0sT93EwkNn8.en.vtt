00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.490
 yes 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.380
 you have to re friends like this in health 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.119
 of trout this time I bring you a 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.860
 totally different video is about 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.170
 a new series that I'm about to do and 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.380
 this is going to be the first chapter and they're going to 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.580
 be tips and tactics tricks 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.910
 specials that you can 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.119
 implement in their matched games 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.550
 private or competitive etcetera and good 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.470
 here in the curiosities very very very very 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.940
 rare here in hotel and the first one 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.980
 let's see the explosive arc as 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.290
 can see here is in the 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.450
 partner that is saints and you are 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.399
 putting there as a dicoy or what comes 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.469
 being there you can dummy test for 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.940
 that they see a trick that there is with the bow 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.219
 practically you what they have to 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.070
 do is throw the arrow below the 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.379
 truck that is in the response and see 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.140
 as automatically as we eliminate it 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.730
 the player in fact here moving around 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.160
 so that they see then their 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.170
 bits and now they will see what 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.390
 has been a bone perspective of 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.940
 practically how is it that the enemy in 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.100
 this case, now I can not give ourselves 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.080
 because we can be launching everything 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.340
 and we are not going to wait for an arrow of 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.440
 something that is not loved in this way 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.020
 as you can see there is 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.490
 well, it's about passing it through 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.140
 under the pickup truck 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.320
 now in the other disposes 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.330
 it's practically the same, nothing else 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.580
 it's a bit more complicated but 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.010
 it's a matter of practice and you can go out to 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.810
 the first one here we see that equal the 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.570
 arrow is heard as it hits the floor 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.470
 below the ridge of the cart and go 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.080
 to see here are his pieces of the chaco 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.030
 and that's how you have to launch the 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.640
 arrow can already go practicing is not 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.380
 nothing is not difficult and good here in 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.120
 the perspective of both me now and 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.790
 I would be an enemy and see how I do not expect 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.190
 me out there the arrow and in second it 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.590
 detonates and then that makes me die 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.880
 is very good with the bow well now 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.250
 that mind that a technique with the 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.520
 incendiary grenades that is very good and 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.960
 in fact it is practically impossible that 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.650
 you can do something even before this 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.030
 reaction because when you throw the pomegranate 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.160
 ignite here in what has been 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.400
 this monkey of the h in this in this 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.020
 ledge the grenade is spread too 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.350
 In fact you can see here how it is 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.910
 expands or expands forgiveness and now they go 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.709
 to see here the perspective to create that 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.990
 I do not lie to you the balance of the same here 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.120
 in the buddy in here at the desk 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.350
 well here in the part of the hache and 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.209
 see how everything is expanded 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.959
 practically does not give me time to move 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.520
 for nothing or this is is I do not know is it 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.170
 very much power with the grenade teach you 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.310
 you can scare them not just one 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.260
 but to several players that 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.720
 find out there but well those are 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.140
 the desire we are going to see a here that 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.960
 call 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.190
 I tell him the ghost bullet because they see 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.780
 as here I practically am 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.120
 pointing I give it because viper collides with 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.430
 the sacks but if I do pop shorts 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.120
 and shot him at the same time see as if 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.020
 low well here I will repeat the example 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.940
 see how right now I'm going to start 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.280
 shoot aiming and I will not give 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.230
 no bullet will not hurt you but if 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.180
 I do pop sets see how fast I 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.340
 I can go down through the bullets without 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.110
 even move from the position I'm 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.300
 he can not see it and I can see him 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.770
 nick with this technique see how it 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.870
 I had sent because ghost school 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.100
 because it's practically not firing 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.739
 and it is not pointing at the same 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.450
 position but he can not give me but 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.070
 if he does the pop shot trick and 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.130
 shooting in the same time that comes 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.709
 being squeezing and releasing the dt and the 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.140
 same at the same time firing then it 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.730
 does what is the pop shot and that 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.310
 way or here it can be too 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.540
 the lancer and see how the bullets 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.030
 where they hurt unless you do the 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.739
 pop trick set the ghost bullet and 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.200
 he manages to lower me and I practically 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.660
 I do not have a division rank to be able to 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.400
 give him no and well here I will do what 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.230
 I'm practically going to stick here 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.629
 and see how I shot 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.069
 and I can hardly do anything 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.290
 they do not do it good because 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.000
 they will cost but bishop see crowded 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.840
 how is it going through and the truth is 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.989
 something of a lot of very many help 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.000
 but because the enemy does not wait for it 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.560
 no and above all because it does not leave you or if you 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.860
 go then do not think you're going to 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.209
 hurt but we do the trick and see 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.180
 how in a matter of seconds with this 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.859
 We can only pop can not abate 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.020
 we give him the ghost bullet but hey 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.820
 you put him as you want now 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.820
 I'm going to share here a technique that is 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.250
 with the boom shot where I was there 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.199
 paste the little corner of the truck and what 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.460
 they will fly by even if there is a 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.470
 little bit away or not totally 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.570
 recharged believe me the explosion is going 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.280
 to do a lot of damage and this is very 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.020
 good to use it when they are 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.729
 playing competitive in a ranked is 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.889
 can you throw some kids over here 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.919
 and for being able to surprise him with the 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.539
 boom in this way and even this one 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.550
 pointed to my partner where you have to 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.039
 shoot the one that is in that corner that is 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.410
 go there as if it were in formation in 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.639
 the seat and there the highchair then they 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.919
 is going to give there 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.930
 the range of explosion to the enemy and by 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.060
 they're going to end up killing you and good of this 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.650
 side can be seen more or less 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.810
 right now this way they're going to you 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.330
 know that it is practically the same 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.099
 obviously nothing else from another side here 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.460
 it's been that you go for the little corner 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:17.139
 of the seat you already have in the door 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.840
 let's say what equipment do I teach 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.340
 as if I as if nothing and suddenly of 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.330
 kills something museums from where who knows 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.610
 but the most important thing in not 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.039
 you do nothing of the year nothing more to the 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.139
 otherwise obviously good here a trick 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:36.009
 which is also how lava is the bullet 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.449
 ghost then but here we see that it 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.479
 you can expand on this part in hotel 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.979
 as they saw there I can not see it from 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.810
 fact is totally hidden but its 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.490
 bullets pierce and then you can grab me 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.490
 a water surprise tea any player 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:52.190
 that is not the zepa and is unexpectedly 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.380
 you there applying this trick see 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.569
 as it practically passes the bullet and what 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.099
 same happens the other response there is nothing 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:59.900
 more as you can see I'm not giving 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:02.930
 because because to do this trick 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.759
 we need to be stuck here to the wall and 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.979
 now if we can point in this way 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.660
 and see how the bullet goes through then he 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:09.919
 can not see us does not have range of 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.289
 vision but we can 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:15.169
 surprise as if nothing and then this is 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:16.490
 sure death or at least it's a great 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.889
 harm they can do to you and how can they 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.840
 present here where you do not see you do not see 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.270
 the player of forms that I want 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:26.270
 guess I read something because I have no trace 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.370
 of him and I can come running and I 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.860
 they apply it and see how practically or 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.229
 we do not have division range and he has 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.289
 the whole range in favor what it implies 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:38.180
 well that is practically certain death 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:40.460
 I 'm not good that was all I hope that you 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.319
 I liked it and if you liked the video 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.810
 well do not forget to share it like 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:48.080
 subscribe she would be bringing more 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:50.240
 tips on other maps other tactics and 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.729
 half secret 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.919
 hidden as those who have called and good 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:58.389
