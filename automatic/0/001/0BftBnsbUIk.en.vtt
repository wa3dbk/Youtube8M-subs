00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.859
 four hours and 50 minutes of flight for 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.670
 to link has created in Tunis the capital 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.500
 Tunisian 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.650
 plus the driving time to reach 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.179
 bizerte 65 km from the capital la 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.769
 fatigue is present in the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.289
 calves crows but these have had 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.300
 time to settle in the hotel 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.070
 abuses training at 48 hours 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.289
 duel against the ca bizertin 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.420
 no question of missing a single session 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.210
 training for patrice carteron who 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.980
 are well know his opponent 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.929
 bizerte could have won on the outside 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.219
 will refuse down and would have really deserved 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.110
 very logically to defeat set on on 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.379
 the Tunisian land but we found 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.670
 a very nice team with a lot of 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.100
 technicality a very midfielder 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.410
 good players of laurent percussion 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.590
 the speed of solid players behind 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.850
 so bizerte today is not the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.680
 club the best known of each 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.000
 competition no longer as to the time when 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.370
 I speak it's the team that seems to me the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.800
 more dangerous because the respect of 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.340
 this one and denise mazembe days at this 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.199
 confrontation with his means 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.820
 I am not I have enough respect 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.080
 for our opponents for not calculated 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.400
 like that you know we try each 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.710
 match to give the best of us 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.630
 same we came back with a point of 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.330
 seventy we made a very good match against 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.369
 the flap fuse now you know it 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.810
 trips are matches return legs 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.360
 and still a lot of matches in this 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.930
 competition it would be again 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.610
 too pretentious of 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.300
 park to say we come here to win 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.580
 to qualify we have a lot of our 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.620
 incumbent players who plays at the time 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.600
 I speak and that will certainly be 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.580
 not operational in 48 hours so 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.960
 it is also an opportunity to discover 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.210
 definitely and get started 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.380
 other players but again we 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.440
 is expecting a real cutting match very 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.140
 difficult dream katumbi Moses team 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.850
 to be the African version blues to 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.670
 like a club like chelsea in 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.350
 europe last year that was 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.000
 given as a goal to go far in 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.770
 champion's league and who was eliminated 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.090
 who finally went to the end in 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.530
 europa league 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.390
 I think we have to take inspiration from that 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.640
 tp mazembe never won the new 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.570
 federation cup formula that's 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.490
 must be a goal 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.530
 it's a competition that I followed 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.759
 since the mali with the djoliba including 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.590
 who was she in the final two years ago 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.220
 and it's a very nice competition with 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.420
 opponents of very high level so 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.770
 I want to say that the champion's 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.780
 league it's a thing now we have 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.910
 was this cup we will seems 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.739
 really very interesting to play and 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.270
 that's why we put so much 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.280
 investments that we seek to 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.290
 prepare as best as possible to do the 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.110
 best course possible in case of 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.670
 victory over the bizertin athletic club 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.470
 the crows would be more or less 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.600
 in the shelter especially that they will remain 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.910
 a meeting delivered outside 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.180
 and during the 6th day against fausto 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.180
 Rabat
