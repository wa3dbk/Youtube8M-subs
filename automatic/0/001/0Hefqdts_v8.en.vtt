output<00:03:05.569> now<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:05.930> think<00:03:06.140> these<00:03:06.530> make<00:03:06.799> great

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
output now I think these make great

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.860 
output now I think these make great
computer<00:03:07.670> speakers<00:03:08.120> but<00:03:08.360> just<00:03:08.569> keep<00:03:08.720> in<00:03:08.840> mind

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
computer speakers but just keep in mind

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.800 
computer speakers but just keep in mind
that<00:03:09.440> they're<00:03:09.830> not<00:03:10.010> completely<00:03:10.849> wireless<00:03:11.510> but

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
that they're not completely wireless but

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.809 
that they're not completely wireless but
they<00:03:11.900> do<00:03:11.959> produce<00:03:12.260> some<00:03:12.739> really<00:03:13.010> good<00:03:13.130> sound<00:03:13.400> I

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
they do produce some really good sound I

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.559 
they do produce some really good sound I
also<00:03:14.180> think<00:03:14.720> that<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:16.130> design<00:03:16.549> are<00:03:16.849> really

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
also think that the design are really

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.839 
also think that the design are really
nice<00:03:17.750> in<00:03:18.200> these<00:03:18.860> set<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.160> speakers<00:03:19.580> and

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
nice in these set of speakers and

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.180 
nice in these set of speakers and
they're<00:03:20.840> definitely<00:03:21.080> gonna<00:03:21.349> stand<00:03:21.620> out<00:03:21.830> in

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190
