 FIFA 16 innovates all over the field and offers realism 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.480
 and an intensity that allows everyone to play as they please. 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.380
 Result of 25 improvements, Defensive Agility rebalances the 1-against-1. 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.800
 Freedom of movement is greater to mark 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.680
 fast and talented attackers. 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.100
 The art of defense is more varied with new gestures like 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.640
 tack fights, aerial duels and new fast tackles 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.500
 it is possible to interrupt in case of excessive commitment. 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.780
 You can count on your teammates to cover the spaces and defend en bloc. 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.080
 Everyone becomes aware of the danger zones on the ground. 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.920
 If your opponent escapes, you can count on the last defense of your defense 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.120
 because we have greatly improved the behavior of the guards. 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.780
 You will have total confidence in your back lines. 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.480
 Construction is vital in FIFA 16 and you can control the environment. 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.840
 Thanks to the intelligence of the interception, your partners will cut the lines of passes and 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.440
 the fight in the midfield will be all the more dense. 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.140
 The intelligent pass game revolutionizes balloon circulation. 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.700
 Adopt a precise and incisive pass game to alert your teammates in the right tempo. 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.500
 The midfield game is more balanced and the ball is more rewarding. 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.320
 In attack, you can create Magic Moments. 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.260
 With the Dynamic Centers, you can alert your teammates in the back of the defense 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.410
 and we improved the sighting system for your attackers. 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.310
 You will need to create space and you will be able to make curved ball calls 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.280
 for even more specific goal opportunities. 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.330
 We collaborated with Lionel Messi to create the contactless Dribbles. 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.290
 You can decide how, but also when to touch the ball. 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.710
 And in front of the goal, thanks to the Surgical Finishing, you will be able to conclude 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.730
 more realistically and your goals will be more rewarding. 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.360

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.400
