00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.339 
worked and that didn't realize how good
they<00:02:23.340> really<00:02:23.370> sounded<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.480> figured<00:02:25.230> I'd

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
they really sounded so I figured I'd

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.080 
they really sounded so I figured I'd
hook<00:02:25.709> them<00:02:25.830> up<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.099> let<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.430> guys<00:02:26.610> hear<00:02:26.940> them

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
hook them up and let you guys hear them

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.910 
hook them up and let you guys hear them
and<00:02:27.620> if<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:29.370> like<00:02:29.549> the<00:02:29.730> sound<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.150> horn<00:02:30.330> I

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
and if you like the sound of the horn I

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.559 
and if you like the sound of the horn I
really<00:02:31.920> have<00:02:32.099> no<00:02:32.280> idea<00:02:33.319> where<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.620> would<00:02:34.769> be<00:02:35.220> on

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
really have no idea where it would be on

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.289 
really have no idea where it would be on
what<00:02:36.569> model<00:02:36.959> these<00:02:37.170> horns<00:02:37.620> are<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:38.209> don't<00:02:39.209> know

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
what model these horns are I don't know

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:40.820 
what model these horns are I don't know
who<00:02:39.450> makes<00:02:39.690> them<00:02:39.989> I<00:02:40.200> figured<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.709> would<00:02:40.799> be

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
who makes them I figured it would be

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.920 
who makes them I figured it would be
right<00:02:41.099> there<00:02:41.340> but<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:42.209> just<00:02:42.480> kind<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.690> getting

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
right there but to just kind of getting

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.410 
right there but to just kind of getting
beaten<00:02:43.140> up<00:02:43.349> and<00:02:43.620> things<00:02:44.459> of<00:02:44.610> that<00:02:44.700> nature<00:02:44.760> so

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
beaten up and things of that nature so

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.650 
beaten up and things of that nature so
they<00:02:46.079> don't<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:46.880> don't<00:02:47.880> think<00:02:48.090> they<00:02:48.209> have<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.569> on

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
they don't I don't think they have it on

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.650 
they don't I don't think they have it on
here<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.280> this<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.459> just<00:02:52.010> plastic<00:02:53.010> this<00:02:53.220> is

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
here and this is just plastic this is

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.979 
here and this is just plastic this is
but<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:55.290> screws<00:02:55.829> metal<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.430> these<00:02:57.390> trumpets

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
but that screws metal and these trumpets

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.860 
but that screws metal and these trumpets
here<00:02:58.170> or<00:02:58.440> Chrome<00:02:59.209> but<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.390> feedings<00:03:00.720> are

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
here or Chrome but the feedings are

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.270 
here or Chrome but the feedings are
plastic<00:03:01.379> and<00:03:01.709> everything<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.549> I<00:03:02.819> mean<00:03:03.299> the

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
plastic and everything and I mean the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.670 
plastic and everything and I mean the
compressor<00:03:05.280> solid<00:03:05.700> but<00:03:06.329> other<00:03:07.079> than<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.530> I

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
compressor solid but other than that I

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.020 
compressor solid but other than that I
don't<00:03:07.950> think<00:03:08.160> there's<00:03:08.310> much<00:03:08.459> place<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.849> put

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
don't think there's much place to put

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.780 
don't think there's much place to put
any<00:03:09.269> model<00:03:10.110> number<00:03:10.440> or<00:03:10.680> make<00:03:10.950> or<00:03:11.280> whoever

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
any model number or make or whoever

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.089 
any model number or make or whoever
something<00:03:12.360> but<00:03:13.290> anyway<00:03:13.379> I<00:03:13.590> just<00:03:13.709> figured

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
something but anyway I just figured

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.520 
something but anyway I just figured
you'd<00:03:14.190> like<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.459> hear<00:03:14.579> so<00:03:15.200> we'll<00:03:16.200> do<00:03:16.349> it<00:03:16.379> one

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
you'd like to hear so we'll do it one

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.140 
you'd like to hear so we'll do it one
more<00:03:16.709> time<00:03:16.920> just<00:03:17.160> cut<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.639> left<00:03:17.819> eyelid<00:03:19.130> one

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
more time just cut the left eyelid one

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:27.520 
more time just cut the left eyelid one
two<00:03:21.260> three
