00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
on what you like and with easier for you

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.330 
on what you like and with easier for you
it's<00:00:39.329> for<00:00:39.629> me<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.020> think<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.649> gel<00:00:40.980> liner<00:00:41.190> is

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
it's for me I think that gel liner is

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.090 
it's for me I think that gel liner is
the<00:00:41.520> easiest<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.719> dip<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.290> your<00:00:43.320> brush<00:00:43.829> I'm

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
the easiest you dip in your brush I'm

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.270 
the easiest you dip in your brush I'm
using<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.850> Maybelline<00:00:45.120> gel<00:00:45.390> liner<00:00:46.100> take<00:00:47.100> your

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
using a Maybelline gel liner take your

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.790 
using a Maybelline gel liner take your
brush<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.879> apply<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.539> gel<00:00:48.870> liner<00:00:49.050> at<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.620> end

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
brush and apply the gel liner at the end

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.310 
brush and apply the gel liner at the end
of<00:00:50.039> your<00:00:50.190> eye<00:00:50.250> near<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.329> outer<00:00:51.570> corner<00:00:52.170> and

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
of your eye near that outer corner and

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.549 
of your eye near that outer corner and
then<00:00:53.219> draw<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> line<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.570> end<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.020> your<00:00:55.110> eye<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
then draw a line of end of your eye and

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.889 
then draw a line of end of your eye and
then<00:00:56.190> go<00:00:56.550> back<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> brush<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.390> pull<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.780> in

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
then go back with a brush and pull it in

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.360 
then go back with a brush and pull it in
just<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.289> I'm<00:00:58.530> doing<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> video

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
just like I'm doing in the video

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.880 
just like I'm doing in the video
this<00:00:59.969> might<00:01:00.180> seem<00:01:00.390> really<00:01:00.719> hard<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.590> if<00:01:01.739> you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
this might seem really hard but if you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.170 
this might seem really hard but if you
practice<00:01:02.129> I'll<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.760> easier<00:01:03.239> for<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.690> do<00:01:03.870> it

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.490 

this<00:01:10.180> is<00:01:10.360> an<00:01:10.450> important<00:01:10.930> point<00:01:11.140> make<00:01:11.470> sure

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
this is an important point make sure
