all<00:00:23.770> right<00:00:23.890> so<00:00:24.160> what<00:00:24.280> we<00:00:24.400> have<00:00:24.610> here<00:00:24.640> is<00:00:25.060> a

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:25.280 
all right so what we have here is a

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.490 
all right so what we have here is a
wild<00:00:25.550> edible<00:00:25.970> plant<00:00:26.300> it's<00:00:26.810> very<00:00:27.050> high<00:00:27.290> in

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
wild edible plant it's very high in

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.320 
wild edible plant it's very high in
starches<00:00:28.190> and<00:00:28.220> they're<00:00:28.460> extremely<00:00:28.820> abundant

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
starches and they're extremely abundant

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.360 
starches and they're extremely abundant
so<00:00:29.750> you<00:00:29.840> could<00:00:29.990> use<00:00:30.470> them<00:00:30.650> for<00:00:30.860> quite<00:00:31.040> some

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:31.370 
so you could use them for quite some

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.900 
so you could use them for quite some
time<00:00:32.710> there's<00:00:33.710> not<00:00:33.920> really<00:00:34.130> a<00:00:34.250> whole<00:00:34.430> lot<00:00:34.490> of

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
time there's not really a whole lot of

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.870 
time there's not really a whole lot of
poisonous<00:00:35.810> look-alikes<00:00:36.320> beside<00:00:36.880> daffodils

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
poisonous look-alikes beside daffodils

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.870 
poisonous look-alikes beside daffodils
and<00:00:38.060> irises<00:00:38.600> but<00:00:38.960> if<00:00:39.470> you<00:00:39.650> pick<00:00:39.890> these<00:00:40.130> then

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
and irises but if you pick these then

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.990 
and irises but if you pick these then
you'll<00:00:41.480> know<00:00:41.630> immediately<00:00:41.750> from<00:00:42.559> the<00:00:42.739> root

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
you'll know immediately from the root

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.910 
you'll know immediately from the root
that<00:00:44.000> it's<00:00:44.720> a<00:00:44.840> cattail<00:00:45.460> it<00:00:47.559> so<00:00:48.559> this<00:00:48.650> is<00:00:48.710> the

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
that it's a cattail it so this is the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.180 
that it's a cattail it so this is the
root<00:00:49.250> it's<00:00:49.489> squared<00:00:49.880> off<00:00:50.150> with<00:00:50.180> some<00:00:50.630> small

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
root it's squared off with some small

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.770 
root it's squared off with some small
kind<00:00:52.190> of<00:00:52.250> feathery<00:00:52.610> type<00:00:52.910> roots<00:00:53.210> coming<00:00:53.540> out

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
kind of feathery type roots coming out

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
kind of feathery type roots coming out
and<00:00:54.400> these<00:00:55.400> right<00:00:55.879> now<00:00:56.120> are<00:00:56.420> too<00:00:57.140> matured<00:00:57.589> to

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
and these right now are too matured to

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.490 
and these right now are too matured to
be<00:00:57.949> edible<00:00:58.570> although<00:00:59.570> you<00:00:59.870> probably<00:01:00.230> could<00:01:00.470> if

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
be edible although you probably could if

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.770 
be edible although you probably could if
you<00:01:00.739> absolutely<00:01:00.890> had<00:01:01.489> to<00:01:01.519> you<00:01:01.879> want<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.300> young

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.450 
you absolutely had to you want the young
young<00:01:03.080> ones<00:01:03.379> that<00:01:03.620> are<00:01:03.710> about<00:01:03.920> a<00:01:03.980> foot<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:04.430> a

and you want to cut off the green part

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.290 
and you want to cut off the green part
is<00:01:14.180> they're<00:01:15.170> quite<00:01:15.680> tough<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.220> you<00:01:17.030> can<00:01:17.180> eat

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
is they're quite tough and you can eat

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.330 
is they're quite tough and you can eat
these<00:01:17.479> raw<00:01:17.810> or<00:01:18.110> boil<00:01:18.500> them<00:01:18.680> or<00:01:18.800> steam<00:01:19.070> them

these raw or boil them or steam them

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.120 
these raw or boil them or steam them
usually<00:01:20.150> Raw's<00:01:20.690> ideal<00:01:21.290> but<00:01:21.590> you<00:01:21.620> want<00:01:21.920> to<00:01:21.979> pick

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
usually Raw's ideal but you want to pick

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.100 
usually Raw's ideal but you want to pick
a<00:01:22.190> clean<00:01:22.520> spot<00:01:22.940> not<00:01:23.270> on<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.540> side<00:01:23.750> of<00:01:23.870> the<00:01:23.930> road

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
a clean spot not on the side of the road

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.630 
a clean spot not on the side of the road
where<00:01:24.350> there's<00:01:24.500> runoff<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.190> stuff<00:01:25.460> and

where there's runoff and stuff and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.190 
where there's runoff and stuff and
contaminants<00:01:26.240> because<00:01:26.510> plants<00:01:26.780> tend<00:01:27.020> to

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
contaminants because plants tend to

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.789 
contaminants because plants tend to
absorb<00:01:27.320> where<00:01:27.860> they<00:01:28.040> grow<00:01:28.299> so<00:01:29.560> again<00:01:30.560> these

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
absorb where they grow so again these

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.920 
absorb where they grow so again these
are<00:01:30.860> one<00:01:31.759> of<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:31.909> most<00:01:32.090> abundant<00:01:32.420> wild

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
are one of the most abundant wild

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.929 
are one of the most abundant wild
edibles<00:01:33.350> around<00:01:33.710> and<00:01:33.979> they're<00:01:34.100> extremely

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
edibles around and they're extremely

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:36.190 
edibles around and they're extremely
healthy<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:35.689> they're<00:01:35.780> full<00:01:35.960> of<00:01:35.990> energy

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
healthy and they're full of energy

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.130 
healthy and they're full of energy
starches<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.100> sugars<00:01:37.509> this<00:01:38.509> part<00:01:38.840> here<00:01:39.110> is

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
starches and sugars this part here is

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.959 
starches and sugars this part here is
useful<00:01:39.799> for<00:01:40.009> a<00:01:40.040> lot<00:01:40.100> of<00:01:40.369> things<00:01:40.579> that<00:01:40.789> can

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969 
useful for a lot of things that can

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:43.990 
useful for a lot of things that can
replace<00:01:41.920> padding<00:01:42.920> or<00:01:43.070> cotton<00:01:43.520> or<00:01:43.640> some<00:01:43.850> other

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
replace padding or cotton or some other

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.560 
replace padding or cotton or some other
things<00:01:46.299> so<00:01:47.299> it<00:01:47.479> has<00:01:47.659> a<00:01:47.689> use<00:01:47.930> all<00:01:48.200> around<00:01:49.570> again

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
things so it has a use all around again

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.569 
things so it has a use all around again
the<00:01:50.930> only<00:01:51.170> poison<00:01:51.680> look-alikes<00:01:52.189> would<00:01:52.430> be

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
the only poison look-alikes would be

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.039 
the only poison look-alikes would be
irises<00:01:53.149> and<00:01:53.329> daffodils

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
irises and daffodils

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.789 
irises and daffodils
they<00:01:54.619> have<00:01:54.829> bulbs<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:55.549> they<00:01:56.000> have<00:01:56.180> flat<00:01:56.869> wide

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
they have bulbs and they have flat wide

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.050 
they have bulbs and they have flat wide
grass<00:01:58.280> almost<00:01:58.729> blade<00:01:59.270> type<00:02:00.039> leaves<00:02:01.039> and<00:02:01.430> they

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
grass almost blade type leaves and they

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.630 
grass almost blade type leaves and they
grow<00:02:02.270> together<00:02:02.479> kind<00:02:03.229> of<00:02:03.289> flat<00:02:03.530> so<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.369> mean

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
grow together kind of flat so I mean

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.310 
grow together kind of flat so I mean
you'll<00:02:04.850> be<00:02:04.909> able<00:02:05.119> to<00:02:05.299> tell<00:02:05.509> when<00:02:05.719> apart<00:02:06.049> from<00:02:06.200> a

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
you'll be able to tell when apart from a

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.560 
you'll be able to tell when apart from a
cattail<00:02:06.560> quite<00:02:07.100> easily<00:02:07.310> this<00:02:08.060> isn't<00:02:08.360> going<00:02:08.479> to

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
cattail quite easily this isn't going to

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.999 
cattail quite easily this isn't going to
have<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.750> ball<00:02:08.990> that<00:02:09.050> looks<00:02:09.410> just<00:02:09.560> like<00:02:09.679> this

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
have a ball that looks just like this

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.180 
have a ball that looks just like this
and<00:02:11.320> one<00:02:12.320> of<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.530> things<00:02:12.800> I<00:02:13.010> mentioned

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
and one of the things I mentioned

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.820 
and one of the things I mentioned
previously<00:02:13.550> is<00:02:14.240> if<00:02:14.780> you're<00:02:14.930> unsure<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:15.620> can

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
previously is if you're unsure you can

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.800 
previously is if you're unsure you can
always<00:02:16.160> reference<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:16.970> dead<00:02:17.300> standing

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
always reference the dead standing

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.860 
always reference the dead standing
plants<00:02:18.320> growing<00:02:19.100> next<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.730> it<00:02:19.880> and<00:02:20.030> that'll<00:02:20.300> be

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
plants growing next to it and that'll be

medicinal properties of it and it

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.470 
medicinal properties of it and it
doesn't<00:02:51.050> seem<00:02:51.350> to<00:02:51.500> be<00:02:51.650> very<00:02:51.830> common<00:02:52.280> but<00:02:53.120> where

doesn't seem to be very common but where
it<00:02:53.600> does<00:02:53.840> grow<00:02:54.140> it's<00:02:54.740> quite<00:02:55.400> abundant<00:02:55.700> as<00:02:56.000> you

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
it does grow it's quite abundant as you

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.600 
it does grow it's quite abundant as you
can<00:02:56.510> see<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.870> white<00:02:57.410> flower<00:02:57.980> heads<00:02:58.370> they're

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
can see the white flower heads they're

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.780 
can see the white flower heads they're
quite<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:58.880> bundle<00:02:59.810> here<00:03:00.200> in<00:03:00.320> this<00:03:00.500> one<00:03:00.740> area<00:03:01.010> but

quite a bundle here in this one area but

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.740 
quite a bundle here in this one area but
you<00:03:01.910> could<00:03:02.950> go<00:03:03.950> a<00:03:03.980> long<00:03:04.250> time<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:04.940> not<00:03:05.060> see<00:03:05.300> one

you could go a long time and not see one

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.340 
you could go a long time and not see one
so<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:06.670> anyways<00:03:10.750> so<00:03:11.750> one<00:03:11.930> good<00:03:12.110> thing<00:03:12.140> about

so I anyways so one good thing about

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.460 
so I anyways so one good thing about
valerian<00:03:13.250> is<00:03:13.400> it<00:03:13.550> doesn't<00:03:13.760> look<00:03:13.970> like<00:03:14.240> the

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
valerian is it doesn't look like the

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.290 
valerian is it doesn't look like the
poisonous<00:03:15.470> saw<00:03:15.680> plants<00:03:16.190> in<00:03:16.310> this<00:03:16.460> family<00:03:17.030> um

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
poisonous saw plants in this family um

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.140 
poisonous saw plants in this family um
the<00:03:18.200> signs<00:03:18.500> that<00:03:18.830> you<00:03:19.100> can<00:03:19.370> tell<00:03:19.580> this<00:03:19.760> plant

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
the signs that you can tell this plant

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.960 
the signs that you can tell this plant
is<00:03:20.390> it's<00:03:20.720> got<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:20.960> hairless<00:03:21.620> barrel<00:03:22.520> Street

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
is it's got a hairless barrel Street

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.320 
is it's got a hairless barrel Street
stem<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:24.710> flower<00:03:24.980> umbels<00:03:25.550> they<00:03:26.090> grow

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
stem and the flower umbels they grow

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.960 
stem and the flower umbels they grow
have<00:03:26.930> a<00:03:26.960> tendency<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:27.530> grow<00:03:27.830> opposite<00:03:28.700> of<00:03:28.820> each

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
have a tendency to grow opposite of each

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.430 
have a tendency to grow opposite of each
other<00:03:29.120> stepped<00:03:29.660> out<00:03:29.870> like<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:31.550> see<00:03:31.880> here<00:03:32.210> and

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
other stepped out like and see here and

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.460 
other stepped out like and see here and
then<00:03:33.460> like<00:03:34.460> that<00:03:34.700> so<00:03:35.690> if<00:03:35.810> we<00:03:35.900> go<00:03:36.110> up<00:03:36.140> to<00:03:36.350> the

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
then like that so if we go up to the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.820 
then like that so if we go up to the
next<00:03:36.680> set<00:03:36.950> of<00:03:36.980> flower<00:03:37.310> heads<00:03:37.670> same<00:03:38.570> thing<00:03:38.900> they

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
next set of flower heads same thing they

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.470 
next set of flower heads same thing they
grow<00:03:40.010> out<00:03:40.070> like<00:03:40.340> that<00:03:40.580> from<00:03:40.880> each<00:03:41.000> other<00:03:41.240> and

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
grow out like that from each other and

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.840 
grow out like that from each other and
they<00:03:42.200> have<00:03:42.380> a<00:03:42.410> brilliant<00:03:42.800> brilliant<00:03:43.370> white

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
they have a brilliant brilliant white

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.680 
they have a brilliant brilliant white
flower<00:03:44.240> they<00:03:44.780> stand<00:03:45.440> out<00:03:45.620> quite<00:03:45.920> a<00:03:46.040> lot<00:03:46.340> and

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
flower they stand out quite a lot and

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.940 
flower they stand out quite a lot and
depending<00:03:47.690> on<00:03:47.810> where<00:03:47.990> they're<00:03:48.140> growing<00:03:48.350> they

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
depending on where they're growing they

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.660 
depending on where they're growing they
can<00:03:49.130> take<00:03:49.340> on<00:03:49.520> a<00:03:49.550> pink<00:03:49.880> color<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:52.100> leaves<00:03:52.280> are

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
can take on a pink color the leaves are

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.760 
can take on a pink color the leaves are
the<00:03:52.820> biggest<00:03:53.000> giveaway<00:03:53.390> of<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:54.200> identity<00:03:54.740> of

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
the biggest giveaway of the identity of

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.400 
the biggest giveaway of the identity of
this<00:03:55.040> plant<00:03:55.600> so<00:03:56.600> here's<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:56.990> leaf<00:03:57.170> of<00:03:57.380> the

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
this plant so here's the leaf of the

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.890 
this plant so here's the leaf of the
valerian<00:03:57.950> plant<00:03:58.280> they're<00:03:58.940> growing<00:03:59.300> compound

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
valerian plant they're growing compound

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.670 
valerian plant they're growing compound
which<00:04:00.290> means<00:04:00.590> they're<00:04:00.830> opposing<00:04:01.160> each<00:04:01.550> other

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
which means they're opposing each other

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.920 
which means they're opposing each other
all<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.740> way<00:04:04.070> out<00:04:04.250> like<00:04:04.280> a<00:04:04.520> ladder<00:04:04.940> and<00:04:05.270> then

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
all the way out like a ladder and then

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.170 
all the way out like a ladder and then
the<00:04:06.170> tip<00:04:06.770> they've<00:04:07.040> got<00:04:07.250> one<00:04:07.490> single<00:04:08.030> leaf

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
the tip they've got one single leaf

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.410 
the tip they've got one single leaf
sticking<00:04:08.660> straight<00:04:08.930> out<00:04:09.250> and<00:04:10.250> you<00:04:11.030> can<00:04:11.209> see

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
sticking straight out and you can see

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.890 
sticking straight out and you can see
the<00:04:11.660> very<00:04:12.620> sharp<00:04:13.010> abundant<00:04:13.730> teeth<00:04:14.209> off<00:04:14.540> the

first-year<00:06:20.250> plants<00:06:20.700> this<00:06:21.120> plant<00:06:21.450> is<00:06:21.630> a

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
first-year plants this plant is a

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.750 
first-year plants this plant is a
biennial<00:06:21.960> which<00:06:22.860> means<00:06:23.160> that<00:06:23.340> when<00:06:23.460> it<00:06:23.490> grows

until the second year the first-year
plants<00:06:28.560> are<00:06:28.650> going<00:06:28.800> to<00:06:28.860> be<00:06:28.920> smaller<00:06:29.430> and

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
plants are going to be smaller and

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.240 
plants are going to be smaller and
they're<00:06:31.320> going<00:06:31.440> to<00:06:31.530> have<00:06:31.740> your<00:06:31.980> medicinal

they're going to have your medicinal

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.400 
they're going to have your medicinal
values<00:06:32.970> more<00:06:33.300> so<00:06:33.510> than<00:06:33.780> the<00:06:33.870> taller<00:06:34.110> much

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.410 
values more so than the taller much

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.620 
values more so than the taller much
eared<00:06:34.620> plants<00:06:35.040> of<00:06:35.160> flower<00:06:35.370> heads<00:06:35.700> because

eared plants of flower heads because

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.930 
eared plants of flower heads because
much<00:06:36.840> of<00:06:36.870> the<00:06:37.140> energy<00:06:37.590> stored<00:06:38.490> within<00:06:38.580> the

much of the energy stored within the

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.510 
much of the energy stored within the
root<00:06:39.180> that<00:06:39.420> you're<00:06:39.570> after<00:06:39.720> is<00:06:40.190> wasted<00:06:41.190> on<00:06:41.370> the

root that you're after is wasted on the

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.750 
root that you're after is wasted on the
flowers<00:06:42.030> so<00:06:42.900> plants<00:06:43.830> of<00:06:43.950> flowers<00:06:44.370> aren't<00:06:44.610> as

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.760 
flowers so plants of flowers aren't as

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.240 
flowers so plants of flowers aren't as
ideal<00:06:45.120> as<00:06:45.210> first<00:06:45.630> year<00:06:45.750> plants<00:06:46.350> secondly

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
ideal as first year plants secondly

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.770 
ideal as first year plants secondly
first-year<00:06:47.700> plants<00:06:48.120> are<00:06:48.240> going<00:06:48.330> to<00:06:48.390> have<00:06:48.570> more

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
first-year plants are going to have more

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.350 
first-year plants are going to have more
tender<00:06:49.170> usable<00:06:49.650> roots<00:06:49.890> than<00:06:50.490> the<00:06:50.730> hard<00:06:51.090> woody

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
tender usable roots than the hard woody

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.350 
tender usable roots than the hard woody
roots<00:06:51.690> of<00:06:51.990> the<00:06:52.200> matured<00:06:52.560> flowers<00:06:53.130> so<00:06:54.060> this<00:06:54.210> is

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
roots of the matured flowers so this is

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.110 
roots of the matured flowers so this is
a<00:06:54.390> first-year<00:06:54.840> valerian<00:06:55.620> here<00:06:55.920> going<00:06:56.910> right

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
a first-year valerian here going right

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.280 
a first-year valerian here going right
next<00:06:57.390> to<00:06:57.780> a<00:06:58.640> matured<00:06:59.640> biennial<00:07:00.450> later<00:07:00.960> year

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.290 
next to a matured biennial later year

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:07.280 
next to a matured biennial later year
valerian<00:07:05.300> it's<00:07:06.300> got<00:07:06.450> those<00:07:06.630> leaves<00:07:06.990> that<00:07:07.170> you

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.290 
valerian it's got those leaves that you

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.520 
valerian it's got those leaves that you
can<00:07:07.530> use<00:07:07.740> to<00:07:07.890> identify<00:07:08.460> it
