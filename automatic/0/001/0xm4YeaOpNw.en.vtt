00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.840
 Hello everyone today I want to show protection 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.300
 rear bumper or so-called 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.900
 rear bumper power on mitsubishi l 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.769
 200 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:16.240
 after 2006 release this protection 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.240
 China production 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.590
 positioned as a power bumper 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.349
 but really put and pour on 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.500
 the car exactly as the rear bumper is made 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:32.329
 black metal covered with black 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.579
 paint here we have a magnet sticky visible 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.280
 that it is made of metal it is often 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.129
 stand it we have aluminum naturally 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.180
 does not stick here 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:49.930
 let's see what is the diameter here 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:53.920
 pipes used and so pipe here 62 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.019
 let's see how the thickness of the metal 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:05.780
 metal 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:10.549
 five so here we also have five 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.850
 and boil pretty good of course 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.770
 swarovski could add 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:20.110
 Well, I think to keep and it will be very 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.329
 even good pipes are well cooked 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:27.500
 the same act as brackets on 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:31.250
 which fasten go with places under 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.170
 bolts in places made decoded 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.860
 so that there are oval holes that can 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:41.149
 was cover up down left right 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:45.270
 here and here on 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:47.340
 bumper and there is a place under the hitch so 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.619
 called American that is here goes 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:55.560
 us inset and bottom here here here 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.439
 this hole is inserted by the finger and 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:07.020
 fights bolts 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:14.040
 brackets here he is this finger lies here 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:17.190
 so here she is now show about desire 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.340
 It becomes such a hitch if you 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.660
 complete square 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.840
 inserted into the hole above us 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:31.430
 vernel and so here we have in the set 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.430
 Goes ball Kelly chrome 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:40.470
 here we have it we have attacked the ball we 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:45.000
 also probably sticks chrome then 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:47.329
 there is covered at the end add a couple of pictures 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.100
 how does he look at the car 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:53.160
 but let's say immediately run into him I think 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.459
 you can pretty reliable weighty he 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.620
 It looks like that in the hands I feel it will be credited 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:04.620
 one kilogram must be heavy to the touch 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.370
 pounds so 30 pulls like that he 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.370
 made from below 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.849
 I hope everything is clear, see the new video
