there and as you'll notice there is a
single<00:01:28.530> 564<00:01:29.530> allen<00:01:30.040> there<00:01:30.250> that<00:01:31.020> tightens<00:01:32.020> up

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
single 564 allen there that tightens up

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.670 
single 564 allen there that tightens up
to<00:01:32.729> adjust<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:33.850> angle<00:01:34.000> and<00:01:34.540> there's<00:01:35.229> a<00:01:35.320> small

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
to adjust the angle and there's a small

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.649 
to adjust the angle and there's a small
set<00:01:35.920> screw<00:01:36.250> here<00:01:36.490> as<00:01:36.670> well<00:01:37.030> that<00:01:37.060> once<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:37.510> get

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
set screw here as well that once you get

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.030 
set screw here as well that once you get
to<00:01:37.750> angle<00:01:38.020> you<00:01:38.110> like<00:01:38.290> you<00:01:38.500> just<00:01:38.680> tighten<00:01:39.010> that

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
to angle you like you just tighten that

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.370 
to angle you like you just tighten that
up<00:01:39.130> and<00:01:39.400> it's<00:01:39.580> it's<00:01:40.540> there<00:01:40.840> it's<00:01:41.020> not<00:01:41.170> moving

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
up and it's it's there it's not moving

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.399 
up and it's it's there it's not moving
so<00:01:42.090> from<00:01:43.090> that<00:01:43.210> point<00:01:43.450> on<00:01:43.630> you<00:01:43.659> just<00:01:44.020> use<00:01:44.260> the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
so from that point on you just use the

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.170 
so from that point on you just use the
quick-release<00:01:44.619> to<00:01:45.100> pull<00:01:45.460> it<00:01:45.549> on<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:45.670> off<00:01:45.909> and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
quick-release to pull it on and off and

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.880 
quick-release to pull it on and off and
I'm<00:01:46.960> going<00:01:47.110> to<00:01:47.170> show<00:01:47.350> you<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.530> mountain<00:01:47.799> now

what you can see here is just very

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.910 
what you can see here is just very
simple<00:02:06.640> no<00:02:07.119> tools<00:02:07.420> involved<00:02:09.299> I've<00:02:10.299> added<00:02:10.569> this

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
simple no tools involved I've added this

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.910 
simple no tools involved I've added this
spring<00:02:11.920> rubber<00:02:12.130> spacer<00:02:12.940> here<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:14.650> allow<00:02:14.860> you

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
spring rubber spacer here to allow you

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
spring rubber spacer here to allow you
to<00:02:15.099> mount<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.459> your<00:02:15.670> down<00:02:15.849> tube

body itself which you can see has the
mating<00:02:55.460> clip<00:02:55.700> here<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:57.530> we<00:02:57.740> just<00:02:57.920> slide<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.310> in

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
mating clip here and we just slide it in

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.970 
mating clip here and we just slide it in
place<00:02:59.770> there's<00:03:00.770> a<00:03:00.860> positive<00:03:01.100> click<00:03:01.670> there

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
place there's a positive click there

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.320 
place there's a positive click there
it's<00:03:03.980> not<00:03:04.190> coming<00:03:04.490> off<00:03:04.640> if<00:03:05.000> there's<00:03:05.240> a

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
it's not coming off if there's a

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.130 
it's not coming off if there's a
spring-loaded<00:03:05.810> mechanism<00:03:07.060> here<00:03:08.060> if<00:03:08.930> you<00:03:09.020> can

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
spring-loaded mechanism here if you can

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.570 
spring-loaded mechanism here if you can
see<00:03:09.320> there's<00:03:09.500> a<00:03:09.560> nut<00:03:09.710> but<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.160> have<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.400> press

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
see there's a nut but you have to press

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.820 
see there's a nut but you have to press
this<00:03:10.760> down<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:12.200> get<00:03:12.350> it<00:03:12.440> off

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
this down to get it off

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.510 
this down to get it off
so<00:03:14.080> once<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.200> cam<00:03:15.410> lock<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:15.830> in<00:03:16.010> place<00:03:16.250> right

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
so once the cam lock is in place right

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.710 
so once the cam lock is in place right
here<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.900> you<00:03:18.020> click<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.410> light<00:03:18.590> in<00:03:18.710> place

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
here and you click the light in place

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.660 
here and you click the light in place
you<00:03:20.720> can't<00:03:20.959> even<00:03:21.110> open<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.560> cam<00:03:21.740> lock<00:03:21.950> so

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
you can't even open the cam lock so

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.310 
you can't even open the cam lock so
there's<00:03:22.940> no<00:03:23.120> way<00:03:23.300> that<00:03:23.540> this<00:03:23.720> light<00:03:23.990> is<00:03:24.110> coming

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
there's no way that this light is coming

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.520 
there's no way that this light is coming
off<00:03:24.560> with<00:03:25.250> vibration<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:26.660> nice<00:03:26.810> thing<00:03:27.080> is<00:03:27.290> is

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
off with vibration the nice thing is is

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.830 
off with vibration the nice thing is is
that<00:03:27.860> rubber<00:03:28.220> gives<00:03:28.970> you<00:03:29.180> a<00:03:29.240> little<00:03:29.480> bit<00:03:29.690> of

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
that rubber gives you a little bit of

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.040 
that rubber gives you a little bit of
compliance<00:03:30.290> there<00:03:30.940> so<00:03:31.940> it's<00:03:32.180> it's<00:03:32.480> not<00:03:32.660> going

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
compliance there so it's it's not going

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.680 
compliance there so it's it's not going
to<00:03:33.230> get<00:03:33.680> hit<00:03:33.890> and<00:03:33.920> break<00:03:34.340> if<00:03:35.030> you<00:03:35.330> hit<00:03:35.480> it<00:03:35.600> and

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
to get hit and break if you hit it and

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.330 
to get hit and break if you hit it and
it<00:03:35.780> kind<00:03:35.990> of<00:03:36.020> flexes<00:03:36.470> just<00:03:36.709> a<00:03:36.800> little<00:03:37.040> bit<00:03:37.160> but

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
it kind of flexes just a little bit but

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.300 
it kind of flexes just a little bit but
it's<00:03:37.520> very<00:03:37.790> solid<00:03:38.060> you<00:03:38.270> can<00:03:38.480> see<00:03:39.070> not<00:03:40.070> going

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
it's very solid you can see not going

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.500 
it's very solid you can see not going
anywhere<00:03:41.050> so<00:03:42.050> once<00:03:42.260> you're<00:03:42.410> mounted<00:03:43.360> get<00:03:44.360> your
