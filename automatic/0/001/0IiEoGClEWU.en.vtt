00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.650
 in the jungle the struggle for 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:44.800
 survival is constant the animals 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:46.629
 have evolved to survive the 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.120
 Similarly football players 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.890
 train constantly to adapt to 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.350
 the conditions of a sport that is 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.170
 every day more demanding 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.910
 and where their physical abilities are each 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.910
 more important times 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.020
 the muscles of the legs of an ostrich 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.850
 they are 33 percent of their total weight 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.789
 while the leg muscles 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.869
 of a football player represent 20 per 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.869
 hundred of its weight 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.340
 a goalkeeper like ians the sister with 87 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:26.050
 kilos of weight manages to launch with great 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.050
 agility to cover a goal 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.440
 a tiger can start up to 260 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.980
 kilograms and achieves 4 meter jumps 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.980
 height 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.210
 diego armando maradona managed to free 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.210
 to his ten teammates 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.640
 the wolf can direct herds of more than 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.860
 20 of its kind in hunts and 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.860
 migrations of thousands of kilometers 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.080
 when force 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:12.190
 Agility and leadership will be mixed 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.190
 the 10 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.290
 the 10 are represented 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.860
 the star player the 10 is the one that soul 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.390
 is the creative is the one that deals now 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.390
 yes the one who deals the play 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.400
 in the World Cup in Brazil 1950 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.079
 implemented to put numbers to the 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.790
 T-shirts to differentiate the 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.730
 players 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.959
 lavelli is especially important 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.959
 with the figure of pele 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.379
 the movie for you 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:55.000
 then pp reads the 10 became 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:59.099
 synonymous with pure genius of those 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.099
 called geniuses is for 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.720
 the generalities for genius is 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.300
 bad where maradona like messi and 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.920
 to fight and that some others are 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:14.490
 players who were born with an angel 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.580
 had a single left foot for 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.770
 also kicking free throws was also 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.160
 only also not this time I think that 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:26.010
 had like that magic intact always the 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.010
 left-handed has another or another dimension other 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.110
 Mystic is as if he were dancing 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.880
 ballet dancer the ball has the 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.150
 competition in the blood is carried 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.150
 blood 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.540
 diego armando maradona with a meter 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:47.310
