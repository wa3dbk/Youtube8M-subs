most like afford to get afraid in the
corner<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.000> I<00:00:57.000> mean<00:00:57.390> Russia<00:00:57.719> seems<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.199> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
corner and I mean Russia seems like a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.660 
corner and I mean Russia seems like a
lot<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.410> fun<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.890> obviously<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.340> paintball

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
lot of fun it's obviously the paintball

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.180 
lot of fun it's obviously the paintball
map<00:00:59.850> we<00:01:00.660> play<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.020> papal<00:01:01.260> court<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.920> just

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
map we play in a papal court and I just

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.380 
map we play in a papal court and I just
haven't<00:01:02.309> had<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.520> opportunity<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.030> play<00:01:03.180> it

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
haven't had the opportunity and play it

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.119 
haven't had the opportunity and play it
and<00:01:03.570> that's<00:01:03.750> really<00:01:04.110> sad<00:01:04.290> because<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.799> was<00:01:04.949> I

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
and that's really sad because that was I

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.620 
and that's really sad because that was I
was<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.580> excited<00:01:05.760> for<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.090> obviously<00:01:06.360> I

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
was really excited for that obviously I

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.030 
was really excited for that obviously I
think<00:01:06.900> most<00:01:07.140> people<00:01:07.380> were<00:01:07.500> excited<00:01:07.650> for<00:01:07.890> rush

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
think most people were excited for rush

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.640 
think most people were excited for rush
more<00:01:08.250> than<00:01:08.369> anything<00:01:08.900> the<00:01:09.900> other<00:01:09.930> two<00:01:10.200> maps<00:01:10.409> I

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
more than anything the other two maps I

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.020 
more than anything the other two maps I
think<00:01:10.860> all<00:01:11.040> three<00:01:11.310> maps<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:11.670> played<00:01:11.880> so

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
think all three maps that have played so

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.210 
think all three maps that have played so
far<00:01:12.060> play<00:01:12.450> Search<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.990> Destroy<00:01:13.020> really<00:01:14.010> well

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220

above<00:01:59.850> ground<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.360> then<00:02:00.509> rush<00:02:00.719> right<00:02:01.020> through

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
above ground and then rush right through

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.020 
above ground and then rush right through
the<00:02:01.290> middle<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.710> then<00:02:02.009> kind<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:02.640> behind

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
the middle and then kind of like behind

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.780 
the middle and then kind of like behind
them<00:02:03.299> either<00:02:03.810> left<00:02:04.799> or<00:02:04.950> right<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.520> you

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
them either left or right you can you

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.999 
them either left or right you can you
can<00:02:05.880> go<00:02:05.969> down<00:02:06.149> underneath<00:02:06.719> two<00:02:07.439> ways<00:02:07.649> left<00:02:07.920> to

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
can go down underneath two ways left to

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.979 
can go down underneath two ways left to
right<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.399> usually<00:02:08.520> go<00:02:08.849> right<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.390> try<00:02:09.929> and

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
right and I usually go right and try and

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.390 
right and I usually go right and try and
flank<00:02:10.229> them<00:02:10.379> over<00:02:10.619> at<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.770> bee<00:02:10.890> balm<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.190> think

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
flank them over at the bee balm I think

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.140 
flank them over at the bee balm I think
it<00:02:11.459> is

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
it is

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.539 
it is
another<00:02:13.049> thing<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.319> I<00:02:13.560> wanted<00:02:14.129> to<00:02:14.220> say<00:02:14.400> about

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
another thing that I wanted to say about

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.050 
another thing that I wanted to say about
the<00:02:14.819> other<00:02:15.030> map<00:02:15.450> which<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.590> Cove<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.340> it's<00:02:17.909> a

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
the other map which is Cove is it's a

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.699 
the other map which is Cove is it's a
very<00:02:18.299> interesting<00:02:18.930> map<00:02:19.079> to<00:02:19.230> play<00:02:19.379> search<00:02:19.590> in

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
very interesting map to play search in

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.380 
very interesting map to play search in
short<00:02:19.980> because<00:02:20.340> it's<00:02:20.549> it's<00:02:20.760> kind<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.209> small

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
short because it's it's kind of small

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.770 
short because it's it's kind of small
and<00:02:21.840> it's<00:02:22.909> it's<00:02:23.909> a<00:02:24.030> lot<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.239> close<00:02:24.420> quarters

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
and it's it's a lot of close quarters

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.539 
and it's it's a lot of close quarters
combat<00:02:24.810> there's<00:02:25.260> not<00:02:25.409> a<00:02:25.439> long<00:02:25.650> lot<00:02:26.159> of<00:02:26.310> long

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
combat there's not a long lot of long

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.849 
combat there's not a long lot of long
distance<00:02:26.819> sight<00:02:27.269> lines<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.170> haven't<00:02:28.769> really

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
distance sight lines so I haven't really

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.199 
distance sight lines so I haven't really
figured<00:02:29.189> out<00:02:29.340> how<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.489> play<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.760> yet<00:02:29.970> i've<00:02:30.090> only

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
figured out how to play it yet i've only

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.490 
figured out how to play it yet i've only
played<00:02:30.329> it<00:02:30.569> once<00:02:30.659> or<00:02:30.870> twice<00:02:30.959> in<00:02:31.079> Search<00:02:31.379> and

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
played it once or twice in Search and

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.140 
played it once or twice in Search and
Destroy<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.040> didn't<00:02:32.280> do<00:02:32.340> all<00:02:32.609> that<00:02:32.640> great<00:02:33.120> I

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
Destroy and I didn't do all that great I

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.380 
Destroy and I didn't do all that great I
think<00:02:33.359> I<00:02:33.599> you<00:02:34.200> know<00:02:34.290> seven<00:02:34.950> eight<00:02:35.189> kills<00:02:35.489> but

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
think I you know seven eight kills but

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.509 
think I you know seven eight kills but
it<00:02:36.840> definitely<00:02:37.349> seems<00:02:37.739> like<00:02:37.829> a<00:02:37.920> fun<00:02:38.189> map<00:02:38.370> to

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
it definitely seems like a fun map to

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.830 
it definitely seems like a fun map to
play<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:38.819> think<00:02:39.060> it's<00:02:39.180> going<00:02:39.299> to<00:02:39.359> be<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> lot

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
play and I think it's going to be a lot

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.020 
play and I think it's going to be a lot
of<00:02:39.870> fun<00:02:40.109> if<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.379> play<00:02:40.590> with<00:02:40.709> some<00:02:41.069> friends<00:02:41.459> and

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
of fun if you play with some friends and

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.699 
of fun if you play with some friends and
I<00:02:42.150> think<00:02:42.420> Cove<00:02:42.629> will<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> really<00:02:43.379> good<00:02:43.500> map

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
I think Cove will be a really good map

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.099 
I think Cove will be a really good map
to<00:02:44.010> kind<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:44.970> take<00:02:45.120> control<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.750> game<00:02:45.900> on

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
to kind of take control of the game on

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.589 
to kind of take control of the game on
that's<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.769> kind<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.280> my<00:02:47.400> opinion<00:02:47.760> on<00:02:47.849> it<00:02:48.000> rush

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
that's the kind of my opinion on it rush

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.240 
that's the kind of my opinion on it rush
obviously<00:02:49.049> I'm<00:02:49.109> had<00:02:49.290> played<00:02:49.560> yet<00:02:49.799> but<00:02:50.040> the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
obviously I'm had played yet but the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.819 
obviously I'm had played yet but the
entire<00:02:50.730> DLC<00:02:51.420> looks<00:02:51.959> really<00:02:52.200> promising<00:02:52.409> and

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
entire DLC looks really promising and

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:53.690 
entire DLC looks really promising and
I'm<00:02:52.889> really<00:02:53.010> looking<00:02:53.280> forward<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.579> getting

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
I'm really looking forward to getting

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.030 
I'm really looking forward to getting

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.399 
and honestly I will say this about DLCs

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
though because I remember the moment
