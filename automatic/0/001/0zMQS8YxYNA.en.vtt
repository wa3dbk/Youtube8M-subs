groove<00:02:01.400> and<00:02:01.670> atmosphere<00:02:02.479> rather<00:02:02.720> than<00:02:03.049> making

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
groove and atmosphere rather than making

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.530 
groove and atmosphere rather than making
sure<00:02:03.439> you<00:02:03.740> hear<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.130> hook<00:02:04.340> right<00:02:04.909> off<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.329> bat

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
sure you hear the hook right off the bat

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.660 
sure you hear the hook right off the bat
the<00:02:05.930> attitude<00:02:06.409> of<00:02:06.560> brothers<00:02:06.979> is<00:02:07.220> something<00:02:07.579> to

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
the attitude of brothers is something to

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.210 
the attitude of brothers is something to
make<00:02:07.820> note<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.090> -<00:02:08.509> maybe<00:02:09.170> it<00:02:09.289> took<00:02:09.439> this<00:02:09.619> new<00:02:09.829> LP

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
make note of - maybe it took this new LP

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.640 
make note of - maybe it took this new LP
to<00:02:10.369> see<00:02:10.610> it<00:02:10.700> but<00:02:10.939> the<00:02:11.360> passion<00:02:11.900> on<00:02:12.019> brothers

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
to see it but the passion on brothers

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.420 
to see it but the passion on brothers
makes<00:02:13.099> attack<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.819> release

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
makes attack and release

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.069 
makes attack and release
look<00:02:14.730> as<00:02:14.879> if<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.150> Black<00:02:15.390> Keys<00:02:15.629> are<00:02:15.870> playing

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
look as if the Black Keys are playing

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.979 
look as if the Black Keys are playing
karaoke<00:02:16.859> over<00:02:17.430> their<00:02:17.549> own<00:02:17.730> songs<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.480> find<00:02:18.870> the

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
karaoke over their own songs I find the

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.099 
karaoke over their own songs I find the
emotion<00:02:19.439> on<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:19.709> new<00:02:19.890> LP<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.400> be<00:02:20.519> really<00:02:20.819> open

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109 
emotion on this new LP to be really open

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.959 
emotion on this new LP to be really open
authentic<00:02:22.109> and<00:02:22.349> relatable<00:02:23.250> maybe<00:02:23.430> overall

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:23.969 
authentic and relatable maybe overall

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.059 
authentic and relatable maybe overall
it's<00:02:24.209> not<00:02:24.269> as<00:02:24.629> immediate<00:02:25.109> as<00:02:25.530> attack<00:02:25.859> and

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
it's not as immediate as attack and

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.459 
it's not as immediate as attack and
release<00:02:26.159> but<00:02:26.670> still<00:02:26.969> the<00:02:27.480> dirty<00:02:27.780> blues<00:02:28.170> based

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:28.469 
release but still the dirty blues based

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.709 
release but still the dirty blues based
rock<00:02:28.769> that<00:02:29.040> made<00:02:29.189> this<00:02:29.340> band<00:02:29.579> popular<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.269> back

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:30.719 
rock that made this band popular is back

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.020 
rock that made this band popular is back
with<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.319> few<00:02:31.650> occasional<00:02:32.189> John's<00:02:32.519> into<00:02:32.909> the

world of soul music though I do commend

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.679 
world of soul music though I do commend
the<00:02:35.129> Black<00:02:35.340> Keys<00:02:35.609> for<00:02:36.000> doing<00:02:36.359> what<00:02:36.510> they've

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
the Black Keys for doing what they've

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.629 
the Black Keys for doing what they've
always<00:02:36.840> done<00:02:37.109> better<00:02:38.069> than<00:02:38.340> ever

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:38.639 
always done better than ever

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.429 
always done better than ever
arguably<00:02:39.389> there's<00:02:39.989> still<00:02:40.260> not<00:02:40.379> enough

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
arguably there's still not enough

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.099 
arguably there's still not enough
stylistic<00:02:41.370> separation<00:02:41.909> between<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:42.450> LP<00:02:42.900> and

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
stylistic separation between this LP and

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.199 
stylistic separation between this LP and
their<00:02:43.620> earlier<00:02:43.980> work<00:02:44.069> for<00:02:44.579> me<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.819> say<00:02:45.000> that

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
their earlier work for me to say that

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.360 
their earlier work for me to say that
this<00:02:45.359> is<00:02:45.659> the<00:02:45.930> greatest<00:02:46.170> album<00:02:46.709> in<00:02:46.859> the<00:02:47.159> world

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
this is the greatest album in the world

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.699 
this is the greatest album in the world
plus<00:02:47.939> I<00:02:48.180> think<00:02:48.419> the<00:02:48.510> largest<00:02:48.840> disappointment

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
plus I think the largest disappointment

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.530 
plus I think the largest disappointment
on<00:02:49.829> this<00:02:50.010> entire<00:02:50.340> album<00:02:50.909> which<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.209> always<00:02:51.389> a

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
on this entire album which is always a

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.170 
on this entire album which is always a
downer<00:02:51.930> for<00:02:52.139> me<00:02:52.500> personally<00:02:52.919> is<00:02:53.430> when<00:02:54.000> you

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
downer for me personally is when you

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.599 
downer for me personally is when you
have<00:02:54.389> a<00:02:54.419> cover<00:02:54.900> on<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.620> album<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.159> the<00:02:56.400> cover

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
have a cover on the album and the cover

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.179 
have a cover on the album and the cover
on<00:02:56.819> brothers<00:02:57.180> being<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.689> Jerry<00:02:58.379> Butler<00:02:58.769> song

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
on brothers being the Jerry Butler song

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:01.399 
on brothers being the Jerry Butler song
never<00:02:59.760> going<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.060> give<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.359> up<00:03:00.419> you<00:03:01.260> have<00:03:01.379> a

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
never going to give you up you have a

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.369 
never going to give you up you have a
cover<00:03:01.739> on<00:03:01.980> brothers<00:03:02.400> which<00:03:02.669> is<00:03:03.000> better<00:03:03.689> than

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
cover on brothers which is better than

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.830 
cover on brothers which is better than
every<00:03:04.829> other<00:03:04.859> original<00:03:05.730> song<00:03:05.969> on<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.810> album

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
every other original song on the album

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.500 
every other original song on the album
years<00:03:07.560> from<00:03:07.889> now<00:03:08.069> will<00:03:08.310> we<00:03:08.459> look<00:03:08.639> to<00:03:08.939> brothers

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
factory and say to ourselves yeah that's

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.789 
factory and say to ourselves yeah that's
the<00:03:15.060> Black<00:03:15.239> Keys<00:03:15.510> best<00:03:15.840> album<00:03:16.349> or<00:03:16.590> do<00:03:16.709> you

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
the Black Keys best album or do you

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.199 
the Black Keys best album or do you
think<00:03:16.829> it'll<00:03:17.129> be<00:03:17.340> something<00:03:17.609> that<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:18.030> band

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
think it'll be something that the band

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.659 
think it'll be something that the band
will<00:03:18.329> release<00:03:18.659> after<00:03:19.470> this<00:03:19.650> LP<00:03:20.069> so<00:03:20.459> what<00:03:20.639> I

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
will release after this LP so what I

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.670 
will release after this LP so what I
guess<00:03:20.909> I'm<00:03:21.090> getting<00:03:21.359> at<00:03:21.510> is<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.810> I<00:03:22.019> like<00:03:22.500> this

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
guess I'm getting at is that I like this

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.589 
guess I'm getting at is that I like this
LP<00:03:23.159> I<00:03:23.370> like<00:03:23.669> it<00:03:23.819> more<00:03:23.940> than<00:03:24.000> attack<00:03:24.419> and

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
LP I like it more than attack and

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.569 
LP I like it more than attack and
release<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:25.169> I<00:03:25.440> like<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.829> more<00:03:26.010> than<00:03:26.190> magic

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
release and I like it more than magic

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.759 
release and I like it more than magic
potion<00:03:27.000> too<00:03:27.269> but<00:03:27.599> I<00:03:27.629> still<00:03:27.930> think<00:03:28.199> LPS<00:03:28.590> like

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
potion too but I still think LPS like

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.159 
potion too but I still think LPS like
rubber<00:03:29.040> factory<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.699> thickfreakness<00:03:30.169> take

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
rubber factory and thickfreakness take

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.619 
rubber factory and thickfreakness take
the<00:03:31.349> cake<00:03:31.560> I'm<00:03:32.099> feeling<00:03:32.669> a<00:03:32.729> strong<00:03:33.060> 6<00:03:33.419> to<00:03:33.599> a

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
the cake I'm feeling a strong 6 to a

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.050 
the cake I'm feeling a strong 6 to a
light<00:03:33.900> 7<00:03:34.319> on<00:03:34.439> this<00:03:34.650> most<00:03:35.069> likely<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.459> light<00:03:35.669> 7

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
light 7 on this most likely a light 7

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.610 
light 7 on this most likely a light 7
