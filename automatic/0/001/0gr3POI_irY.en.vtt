you'll<00:00:32.850> see<00:00:33.030> me<00:00:33.149> playing<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.590> D<00:00:35.039> and

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
you'll see me playing it in a and D and

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.260 
you'll see me playing it in a and D and
E<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.570> open<00:00:36.809> E<00:00:36.960> string<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.470> in<00:00:38.160> concert<00:00:38.970> pitch

E the open E string and in concert pitch
everything<00:00:40.140> sounds<00:00:40.380> half<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.520> tonne<00:00:41.790> below<00:00:42.180> so

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
everything sounds half a tonne below so

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.900 
everything sounds half a tonne below so
it's<00:00:43.110> actually<00:00:43.230> an<00:00:43.500> A<00:00:43.649> flat<00:00:43.829> D<00:00:44.250> flat<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.700> E

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
it's actually an A flat D flat and E

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.299 
it's actually an A flat D flat and E
flat<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.780> play<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.290> your<00:00:46.410> base<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
flat so to play it on your base in the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.369 
flat so to play it on your base in the
locations<00:00:47.879> i'm<00:00:48.030> showing<00:00:48.540> and<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.899> locations

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
locations i'm showing and the locations

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.990 
locations i'm showing and the locations
i<00:00:49.500> think<00:00:49.710> Tommy<00:00:49.920> played<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.730> need<00:00:50.910> to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
i think Tommy played it you need to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.030 
i think Tommy played it you need to
detune<00:00:51.480> your<00:00:51.690> base<00:00:51.870> by<00:00:52.290> a<00:00:52.320> half<00:00:52.590> step<00:00:52.620> so

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
detune your base by a half step so

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.760 
detune your base by a half step so
everything<00:00:53.760> string<00:00:54.510> needs<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.110> detuned<00:00:55.620> by

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
everything string needs to be detuned by

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.279 
everything string needs to be detuned by
half<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.100> step<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.520> you'll<00:00:56.670> be<00:00:56.760> G<00:00:57.000> flat<00:00:57.239> D<00:00:57.840> flat<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
half a step so you'll be G flat D flat a

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.709 
half a step so you'll be G flat D flat a
flat<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.980> E<00:00:59.100> flat<00:00:59.489> fairly<00:01:00.149> straightforward

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
flat and E flat fairly straightforward

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.170 
flat and E flat fairly straightforward

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
to do d tune your base like that and but

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.609 
to do d tune your base like that and but
you<00:01:03.239> need<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.510> do<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:04.019> get<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.170> most<00:01:04.409> out

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
you need to do that to get the most out

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.469 
you need to do that to get the most out
of<00:01:04.649> this<00:01:04.799> lesson<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.880> play<00:01:06.060> along<00:01:06.299> with<00:01:06.450> it
