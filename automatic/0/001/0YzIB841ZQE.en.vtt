 Infinity! Pelican 9-6, We found it. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Do you mind if I accompany you? 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Of course not, Lord! 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Easy, Chief. It sounds pretty weird that you call me "Sir" 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.500
 It's beautiful, right? I can almost never see it 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:15.200
 I grew up in New Harmony. I went to the military academy in Corbulo. I never saw the earth in person until I became an adult but ... I still consider it my home. 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.500
 You do not talk much. True? 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.000
 Chief, I'm not going to pretend I know how you feel. 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.500
 I have lost loved ones, but ... never anything like what you are going through. 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 The duty of a soldier is to protect humanity. At all costs. 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:02.200
 You say it as if the soldiers and humanity were different. We soldiers are not machines, we are people. 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.500
 You can tell by yourself. 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.500
 She told me that once. 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.000
 What to be a machine.
