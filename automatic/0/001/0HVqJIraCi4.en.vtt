00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.789 
good a lot of people use it but again I
don't<00:01:36.869> think<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.079> helps<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.350> win<00:01:37.530> gunfights

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
don't think it helps you win gunfights

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.499 
don't think it helps you win gunfights
that<00:01:38.250> much<00:01:38.430> you've<00:01:38.640> got<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.850> motion<00:01:39.030> sensor

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
that much you've got the motion sensor

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.899 
that much you've got the motion sensor
which<00:01:39.600> helps<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.900> with<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.170> hologram<00:01:41.009> not

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
which helps you with that hologram not

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.859 
which helps you with that hologram not
many<00:01:42.030> people<00:01:42.329> fall<00:01:42.540> for<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:43.009> jetpack<00:01:44.040> sorry<00:01:44.670> I

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
many people fall for it jetpack sorry I

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.730 
many people fall for it jetpack sorry I
talked<00:01:45.869> about<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.110> thruster<00:01:46.439> point<00:01:46.619> when<00:01:46.710> I

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
talked about the thruster point when I

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.889 
talked about the thruster point when I
meant<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.100> jetpack<00:01:47.759> jet<00:01:48.240> plate<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.689> say

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
meant the jetpack jet plate like I say

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.120 
meant the jetpack jet plate like I say
makes<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.200> varmint<00:01:49.439> put<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> thruster<00:01:49.950> pack

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
makes you varmint put a thruster pack

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.060 
makes you varmint put a thruster pack

have<00:02:07.320> these<00:02:07.439> mods<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.860> mean<00:02:08.009> mobility<00:02:08.459> kind<00:02:09.149> of

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
have these mods I mean mobility kind of

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.669 
have these mods I mean mobility kind of
useful<00:02:09.479> but<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.050> sprint<00:02:10.349> jump<00:02:10.560> you've

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
useful but if you sprint jump you've

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.280 
useful but if you sprint jump you've
practically<00:02:11.039> got<00:02:11.190> unlimited<00:02:11.370> spear

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
practically got unlimited spear

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.020 
practically got unlimited spear
resupply<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:13.560> actually<00:02:14.190> quite<00:02:14.430> useful<00:02:14.460> but

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
resupply is actually quite useful but

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.030 
resupply is actually quite useful but
again<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.540> didn't<00:02:15.960> think<00:02:16.050> it's<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.410> know<00:02:16.530> that

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
again I didn't think it's you know that

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.500 
again I didn't think it's you know that
useful<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.580> winning<00:02:17.760> gunfight

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
useful and winning gunfight

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.160 
useful and winning gunfight
hey<00:02:18.990> efficiency<00:02:20.510> again<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.540> guess<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.990> could<00:02:22.140> be

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
hey efficiency again I guess it could be

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.400 
hey efficiency again I guess it could be
useful<00:02:22.440> but<00:02:22.950> nothing<00:02:23.700> too<00:02:23.880> amazing<00:02:24.410> grenadier

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
useful but nothing too amazing grenadier

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.750 
useful but nothing too amazing grenadier
fair<00:02:26.130> enough<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.760> firepower<00:02:27.980> well<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.580> know

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
fair enough and firepower well you know

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.490 
fair enough and firepower well you know
I<00:02:30.060> think<00:02:30.300> you'd<00:02:30.540> only<00:02:30.660> be<00:02:30.810> using<00:02:30.960> one<00:02:31.200> primary

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
I think you'd only be using one primary

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.600 
I think you'd only be using one primary
weapon<00:02:31.740> at<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.890> time<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.220> they're<00:02:32.310> all<00:02:32.340> quite

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
weapon at a time and they're all quite

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.420 
weapon at a time and they're all quite
balanced<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.360> no<00:02:34.110> really<00:02:34.470> advantage<00:02:35.100> over

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
balanced so no really advantage over

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.190 
balanced so no really advantage over
their<00:02:35.790> advantage<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.630> coming<00:02:37.020> up<00:02:37.110> my

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
their advantage to that coming up my

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.070 
their advantage to that coming up my
words<00:02:37.410> out<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.830> dexterity<00:02:38.790> again<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:40.020> know

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
words out and dexterity again you know

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.570 
words out and dexterity again you know
there's<00:02:40.290> quick<00:02:40.470> reloads<00:02:40.860> just<00:02:41.040> helping<00:02:41.370> win

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
there's quick reloads just helping win

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.790 
there's quick reloads just helping win
gunfights<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.240> all<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.960> that<00:02:42.990> in<00:02:43.230> combination

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
gunfights and all of that in combination

gunfights and all of that in combination
you<00:02:43.890> know<00:02:43.920> means<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.430> win<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.700> lot<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.000> gun<00:02:45.270> fights

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
you know means I win a lot of gun fights

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.570 
you know means I win a lot of gun fights
unless<00:02:45.750> people<00:02:45.930> are<00:02:46.080> using<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.980> setup<00:02:47.310> and

unless people are using this setup and

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.890 
unless people are using this setup and
that<00:02:47.670> means<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:47.940> can<00:02:48.000> get<00:02:48.240> my<00:02:48.360> ordnance<00:02:48.750> and

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
that means I can get my ordnance and

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.960 
that means I can get my ordnance and
everything<00:02:49.260> ammo<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.070> always<00:02:50.430> pick<00:02:50.610> up<00:02:50.760> other

everything ammo I always pick up other

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.180 
everything ammo I always pick up other
people's<00:02:51.270> weapons<00:02:51.690> sensor<00:02:52.140> useful<00:02:52.950> but<00:02:53.100> it's

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
people's weapons sensor useful but it's

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.650 
people's weapons sensor useful but it's
not<00:02:53.340> really<00:02:53.640> gonna<00:02:53.760> help<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:54.000> win<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.150> gunfight

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660

awareness<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.950> same<00:02:56.840> explosives<00:02:57.840> now<00:02:57.959> I

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
awareness is the same explosives now I

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.420 
awareness is the same explosives now I

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
think this is a bit pointless it does

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.430 
think this is a bit pointless it does
increase<00:02:59.790> their<00:03:00.120> grenade<00:03:00.750> blast<00:03:01.020> radius<00:03:01.200> but

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
increase their grenade blast radius but

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.720 
increase their grenade blast radius but
it<00:03:01.560> decreases<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.950> damage<00:03:02.340> -<00:03:02.459> it's<00:03:02.580> kind<00:03:02.700> of

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
it decreases the damage - it's kind of

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.070 
it decreases the damage - it's kind of
like<00:03:02.910> what<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.209> point<00:03:03.420> what's<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:03.990> point

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
like what the point what's the point

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.280 
like what the point what's the point
it's<00:03:04.530> supposed<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.040> be<00:03:05.130> an<00:03:05.190> upgrade<00:03:05.310> but<00:03:06.290> you

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
it's supposed to be an upgrade but you

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.810 
it's supposed to be an upgrade but you

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
know spring aid damage seems a bit

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.490 
know spring aid damage seems a bit
pointless<00:03:09.000> ordnance<00:03:09.870> priority<00:03:10.230> could<00:03:10.410> be

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500
