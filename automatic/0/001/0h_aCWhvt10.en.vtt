00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 Let's learn how to make tapioca, which is 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:11.809
 I need only sweet eggs and water. 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:15.360
 warm can not be who is warm 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:19.980
 but the ball just welcome screen 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:25.160
 Thick to go after is to make is a phase 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.160
 to classify the floquinhos there are some 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:34.649
 slow because it gets excited is very thin 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:38.250
 then everything will fly there after you put the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:43.070
 powder is adding a little bit to the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.070
 few are not lukewarm water 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:52.440
 There I massaged slowly not to fly 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:01:06.840
 everything can make a mess by putting 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:08.850
 water can not be stuck there 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.549
 After you add water, it's like this. 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:17.670
 if an agent makes a cookie like this 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:20.670
 You play if it melts, it 's because you did not stay. 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:27.390
 buffet put more wine in stay 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:37.670
 so I think it will pass in the sieve and 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:37.670
 chive pass through the sieve 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.509
 if you want to put a little coconut 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.149
 grated can also be 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:07.859
 I miss a pinch of salt, I prefer not to 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:14.090
 put to the filling in a frying pan 

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:23.510
 laying a preheated nonstick 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:23.510
 Now then Spain had 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:11.859
 warm it up so well to be able to turn 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:11.859
 by the light do not turn hero 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.140
 can not get too white she goes 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.350
 to be half yellow, which means 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.110
 raw 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:35.400
 Then just put the filling preferably 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:38.220
 preferably light saw nothing heavy 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.790
 put the filling mass and bending until 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.790
 is ready
