00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:12.709
 I'll tell you friends story and question from 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:18.070
 girls who have this story me 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:22.100
 told the essence of it now she is 19 years old and 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.150
 she is from somewhere in Ukraine apparently from not 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.390
 very big city 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.390
 but went to school with math there 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.460
 slope and and weighed math by 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.989
 full 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.539
 so it didn't seem like much to her 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.960
 liked and she loved math and she 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:41.690
 entered somewhere on the application 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:46.069
 mathematics to university but already in 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:49.909
 big city I don't know what she lives in 

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:52.039
 there in the dorm and study and at first she 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:55.670
 it seemed here of course I think that she has 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.739
 there were high expectations from the university 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.149
 where does she study 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.739
 she thought you were going to university 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.479
 you will study there as a programmer and there 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.590
 such a fan such a buzz then finally 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:09.800
 and there is a dry theory lesson there on the board 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.600
 not so much in chalk 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.720
 practical classes she is a second year student 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.500
 Now we all understand that those who 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.080
 studied in universities we all understand that the first 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.510
 a couple of years it goes no specialty like 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.750
 who are these more general disciplines 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.740
 there both math and physics i'm like i am now 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.260
 I did not think that is very different now 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:37.280
 fundamental to its core and here it is 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:41.060
 walks on these couples and sneaks and it is a ramp 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.650
 because it's hard to understand dry material 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.050
 because the girl seems to be 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.810
 academic given mathematician should have been 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:54.080
 would seize well not somehow boring 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.640
 Many people also do not understand go to 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.770
 additional classes some not 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.240
 go to any classes and she's his 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.100
 the spirit of charity and there all the same profession 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.159
 two older girls video they 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.200
 finish and she no I don't want to become 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.530
 like they they are right there all day they 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:14.000
 but for these do not go at all they look 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:17.590
 TV shows and eat here 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.370
 Actually there is no such nudity 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.620
 well i understand her well i think that 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.000
 each of us understands want 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.730
 to somehow bright everything was beautiful and here 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.780
 some kind of dry and all this and all on you 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.840
 give a damn and of course i will say that i'm i 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.150
 another time he studied at the institute but we 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.950
 there were also some items not all but 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.010
 there were some items that were read 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.670
 people totally incapable of 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.890
 teaching was somewhere dry then 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.420
 it was very common here standing there 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.510
 muzhchinka and slander notes simply 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.720
 dictates here you sit two hours yes and hand 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.310
 It has 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.890
 maybe it was written in pens there 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.570
 balls and 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.340
 there was no money for a good pen 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.100
 I do not mind because your hand is not copper 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.410
 and there it is a chinese golden pen then 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.020
 you carry a pen it was such 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.090
 tool and here you write-write 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.370
 if you don’t write what you don’t know 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.760
 these notes were copied before 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.220
 exam writes writes writes well 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.440
 of course no joy there I am not for you 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.840
 more to say let's say we have a 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.600
 the stream where I studied you stand communication there 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.520
 there were about 120 people 4 groups 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.430
 lecture audience for 120 people not 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:47.070
 so big and so there are such tables 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:49.740
 cost 1 liter of a row well 20 people 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.840
 they so actively mean sit doing 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.030
 questions are asked as much as this life 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.030
 every time a session goes 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.800
 ends new semester begins 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.270
 there is a struggle for the first row there for the first 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.920
 the desk then passes week already 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:07.230
 all this struggle ends i'm on 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.850
 first row here and that means a back 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.720
 But after the third row, but maybe 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.830
 still row 3 and not just somehow listen a 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.269
 further people sit and get ready for 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.370
 laboratory work they are so 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.010
 frantically and rewrite there such 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.100
 manuals were labs Vatan 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.260
 Well, there is the peak of the graphics build there 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.120
 something is done just well, just 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.640
 When is it clear that he has already 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.140
 it was ready and so on there labs 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.660
 let's say there are three four items there 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.330
 such technical and engineering and necessary 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.790
 him take the lab seven or eight 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.980
 laboratory they need to pass each need 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.200
 to protect 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.060
 that's why this is something you can do with it 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.250
 for example there not to allow there for the exam 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.230
 there was a little more so it was important 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:53.450
 here they sit he rewrote everything you 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:55.250
 corresponded in vain passed and the flood did not 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.590
 everyone knows that there might be some kind of 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.200
 Social life was the students and is 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.510
 no one was moonlighting 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:06.800
 just went to study yourself or beer there 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.840
 girls boys don't know there so here 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.460
 such was I can not say that 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.950
 I somehow distressed at the student press 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.020
 board we are generally very 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.870
 cheerfully it was massively 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.870
 cheerful but to say 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.390
 study is never 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.580
 one hundred percent holiday this name day 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.700
 hearts always have such an element of routine 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:33.980
 there are always some people with whom 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:35.710
 you do not develop relationships and I think 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.020
 what is this girl that I advised 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.460
 she is somehow unsure what she wants 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.980
 finish it all to her mom 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.870
 speaks with diplomas where she learns not 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.840
 she knows why she is lost 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.430
 landmarks mean landmarks mom's 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.920
 I understand well that is when a girl 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.720
 there is a diploma then he already has and if she 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.490
 there just grow up without a diploma she 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.680
 children will never marry 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.840
 cum will not and so on so mom 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.600
 how would it look like a girl can 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.040
 say you set a goal tell me 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.110
 imagine what you want that's why you 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.820
 I want to study mathematics there 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:11.480
 programming so that for example 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.490
 say i want to graduate and 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.410
 go to a feast for an internship in 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.910
 United States 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.190
 so i study english i drink 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.380
 programming and me absolutely without 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.440
 differences are well taught or bad for you 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:27.650
 I study myself I study myself I go to 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.440
 lesson I'm apart from being in class 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:34.370
 I'm still not there for 5-6 hours a day 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.080
 she practically read books and there 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.910
 on maybe hang out somewhere there 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.480
 a lot of forums for the programmer hanging out 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:43.400
 you just need to find yours and 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.850
 actually everything will light up the bulb 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:51.020
 will appear in the target and eyes will flash 19 years 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:53.930
 not mine is just that and glow 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.870
 this you need a little bit then you need 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.759
 just see where you are going and even 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.530
 when you have nothing but a path, then you 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:02.690
 I say this way is not good at 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.030
 you have no goal here we have a goal 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.710
 no therefore as soon as the target appears you 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.240
 stop looking at this path at all 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.220
 you will not be interested in will 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.740
 interesting to see the goal and you will 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.210
 dream you will do something for 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.430
 realize this dream so tell 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.900
 imagine what goal and immediately everything will be on 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.940
 place you have everything just yes how 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.000
 turn it over and and it turns out that 

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.409
 everything is actually very cool though 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.479
 here maybe nothing has changed except 

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:29.919
 the fact that you started to understand why 

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:29.919
 and everyone is happy
