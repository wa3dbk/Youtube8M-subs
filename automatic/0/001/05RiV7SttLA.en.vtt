00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.899
 after all, everyone decided to warm the ceiling with 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:13.320
 side loft extruded 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:17.750
 styrofoam like this 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:24.350
 process so don't you lie flat see 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:31.550
 such drops crazy crazy 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:38.219
 align further you can see how I leveled 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:41.780
 a solution of 1 to 5 sand with cement and on 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:46.159
 it later went extruded 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.159
 polystyrene foam 5 centimeters thick 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:54.229
 this is the amount of work already done 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:09.770
 ns the slabs are glued to the floor and help foam 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.770
 assembly immediately want to say 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:20.060
 kick and there is not very good so 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.060
 because in comparison with this foam on 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:33.180
 I pasted this foam 17 pancake plates at the ball 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.460
 she is titan only 10 difference 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:44.270
 worth 5 Transnistrian rubles 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:52.950
 between them if translated into dollars 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:58.850
 it costs 5 8 dollars and that is 5 44 cents 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:08.880
 the difference but the volume of work performed 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:11.070
 tangible foam cast using foam 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.110
 stick so tear them off 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.670
 impossible to foam them not 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:27.420
 raised during freezing 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:30.170
 for curing I will attach them with a load of about 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.170
 so here it is 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:50.680
 all pester where junction side 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:55.450
 between the plates of the slots here too 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:03:02.760
 I spray with water before splashing 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:05.709
 what to glue and pressing 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.959
 the next slab is obtained approximately here 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:13.180
 so here are the upper ledges all these 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:19.980
 will not be cut off as the top yet 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:22.840
 an expanded clay screed will be made 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.950
 from the old insulation there is such 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.840
 there are heaps of expanded clay everywhere 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:33.060
 not things go bad on Haystacks 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.060
 5-6 centimeters are planned 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:48.800
 Well, in general, and all will be given, and so 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.800
 and wanted to show and tell
