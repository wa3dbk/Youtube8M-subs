00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.730
 com pay them 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.730
 so I finished my favorite like that 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:11.949
 one is borrowed to lead us 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.549
 much higher 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.859
 first four years ago 4 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.249
 first impression 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:20.289
 however, they are 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.699
 see how I pass all these cases not this one 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.160
 it's my third must here it's not moved so here my first footprint 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.539
 suddenly more down 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:29.769
 third 15 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.470
 fourth corner 2nd north 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.900
 third rope first round 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.900
 second corner 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.700
 and first class 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
 so already to get to do that we feel the third must 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.320
 so that can be learned and imprints 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.470
 it's a kind of lighthouse 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.190
 we will not repeat 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.630
 the second plot a kind of misery 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.480
 om did not calculate 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.440
 then regains strength ap I'm still there 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.050
 the second iran we will meet again we knew the best time 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.000
 1 to 0 but he did not move 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.670
 camille second

 vad third in three years it's like in africa 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.360

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.500
 2nd third 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
 third string and my third time 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.620
 third body second quarter 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.470

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.860
 but where is the third major element which is the third the 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.870
 second 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.340

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.070

 second break that comes fifth body 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:24.899
 after correcting that 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:27.899
 drillers prentice 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:31.079
 I felt recourse 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.899
 on 1 2 3 

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:35.489
 20 hours games I'm leaving Morocco 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.749
 my role of troy 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:40.749
 a third request 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.259
 seeing the diviners 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:46.659

 and I play of course 2nd 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:52.130
 the third corner come with a major axis of my post he will play 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.789
 the fourth 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:55.929
 at the end of the fifth 

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:57.529
 while the crowd hits the fort 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:00.509
 seized by force 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:03.939
 the rolling mill 2 times more 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:07.099
 the rhythm of fair 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.279
 we need to control the fifth place he also plays 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:11.180
 12:50 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.569
 witnesses who would have seen the bodies 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.569
 once again 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:20.089
 rolling 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.629
 bellerive the basilica 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:30.059
 this is here 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.870
 the Cordeliers 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.210
 second and third league 1 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.299
 Nothing is less sure 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.810
 this is the third package on the third quarter here it's perfect I 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:39.809
 will do three times like his wife 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.209
 christian always friday 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:50.689
 and after the refusal of the action in front of the press 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.689
 which sits that suits me 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.979
 Abelard 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:59.979
 the csa 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.139
 I'm addressing you 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.489
 three rows 12th body which is so-called body 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.089
 third round 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:13.829
 on the first question first 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.419
 and on the a13 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.519
 that's not a 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.840
 three men 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.430
 more than two months on the second 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.220
 but I attack 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.129
 each time the third string and the second 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:26.279
 the second 

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:29.279
 the body was exaggerated 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:32.460
 he surprises 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.330
 on this nickname its value 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.599
 but that it is a kind of G major 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.419
 This agreement 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.029
 secondly 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:44.029
 third Age 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.960
 but the trumpeter minimum 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.779
 but the third part of our series will stop 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:53.779
 no I believe 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.860
 43 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.860
 so if we recapitulate women twice 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.430
 medvedev 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.319
 lookingo the jealous 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:17.460
 we are there the soil 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.460
 from the 3rd 3rd class ball of sixth 

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:28.589
 the second time 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.020
 that on the drilling site is also the third place 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.619
 I play the press again 

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:57.059
 sixth body 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:58.759
 without releasing 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:01.759
 montredon 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:15.449
 coupled couplets 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:18.449
 it is an honor 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:22.059
 mouline 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:28.659
 for 100% of high mike does not come 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.229
 about 

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:37.589
 a shame 

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:39.349
 even 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:42.349
 what the 4th of the euro 

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:46.490
 the metronome 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.490
 of course we're talking about this control and then your 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:52.509
 I link b cup 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:54.099
 love 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:56.360
 one hour drive 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.479
 Mullings 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:00.479
 the label of our means said well in section 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.960
 count them 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.960
 eventually these basics worship the kif 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:17.050
 for now people started really well in the communes 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.610
 however at weather france 

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:25.149
 Libyans 

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:25.939
 should I say
