Photoshop to create an animation and
this<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.719> called<00:00:12.929> rotoscoping<00:00:13.769> where<00:00:14.040> we<00:00:14.370> draw

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
this is called rotoscoping where we draw

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.570 
this is called rotoscoping where we draw
on<00:00:15.179> each<00:00:15.389> frame<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.109> video<00:00:16.260> draw<00:00:16.890> paint<00:00:17.310> on

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
each frame of the video so I already

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.410 
each frame of the video so I already
have<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.980> video<00:00:22.980> prepared<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:23.880> thinking<00:00:24.269> on

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420

my<00:00:24.539> desktop

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
my desktop

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:34.520 
my desktop
it's<00:00:25.619> an<00:00:25.769> MPV<00:00:32.390> silly<00:00:33.390> but<00:00:33.690> rather<00:00:34.020> awesome

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
it's an MPV silly but rather awesome

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.860 
it's an MPV silly but rather awesome
example<00:00:35.040> I've<00:00:35.250> chosen<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.880> mainly<00:00:36.390> because<00:00:36.570> it

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
example I've chosen it mainly because it

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.889 
example I've chosen it mainly because it
has<00:00:37.020> lots<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.380> motion<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:38.969> trace<00:00:39.719> over

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
has lots of motion and we can trace over

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.350 
has lots of motion and we can trace over
the<00:00:40.079> frames<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.700> maybe<00:00:41.700> create<00:00:41.940> something

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
the frames and maybe create something

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.670 
the frames and maybe create something
interesting<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.899> but<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.469> an

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
layer one is a video layer because the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.820 
layer one is a video layer because the
thumbnail<00:02:23.680> has<00:02:24.070> this<00:02:24.310> little<00:02:24.580> filmstrip<00:02:25.300> icon

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
thumbnail has this little filmstrip icon

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.800 
thumbnail has this little filmstrip icon
here<00:02:27.960> now<00:02:28.960> I<00:02:28.990> could<00:02:29.410> go<00:02:29.590> ahead<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.880> start

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
here now I could go ahead and start

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.140 
here now I could go ahead and start
painting<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.470> drawing<00:02:32.709> on<00:02:33.220> this<00:02:33.550> layer<00:02:33.790> one

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
painting and drawing on this layer one

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.500 
painting and drawing on this layer one
here<00:02:34.590> but<00:02:35.590> what<00:02:36.340> I'm<00:02:36.430> actually<00:02:36.550> gonna<00:02:36.760> do<00:02:37.030> is

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
here but what I'm actually gonna do is

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.230 
here but what I'm actually gonna do is
create<00:02:38.050> a<00:02:38.200> new<00:02:38.470> video<00:02:38.709> layer<00:02:39.100> to<00:02:39.490> draw<00:02:39.730> on<00:02:39.940> and

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
create a new video layer to draw on and

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.480 
create a new video layer to draw on and
that'll<00:02:40.540> make<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:41.200> little<00:02:41.860> easier<00:02:42.280> for

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
that'll make it a little easier for

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.940 
that'll make it a little easier for
myself<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:43.090> keep<00:02:43.270> my<00:02:43.480> drawing<00:02:43.990> separate<00:02:44.650> from

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
myself to keep my drawing separate from

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.140 
myself to keep my drawing separate from
the<00:02:45.630> tracing<00:02:46.630> video<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:48.640> I'm<00:02:48.700> gonna<00:02:48.790> create<00:02:49.060> a

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
the tracing video so I'm gonna create a

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.050 
the tracing video so I'm gonna create a
new<00:02:49.240> video<00:02:49.660> layer<00:02:50.250> by<00:02:51.250> going<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.820> layer

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
new video layer by going to the layer

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.050 
new video layer by going to the layer
menu<00:02:52.800> video<00:02:53.800> layers<00:02:54.130> new<00:02:55.060> blank<00:02:55.390> video<00:02:55.870> layer

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
menu video layers new blank video layer

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.430 
menu video layers new blank video layer
and<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:58.150> can<00:02:58.180> see<00:02:58.510> I<00:02:58.540> have<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.870> new<00:02:59.110> layer<00:02:59.290> here

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
and you can see I have a new layer here

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.680 
and you can see I have a new layer here
the<00:02:59.950> palette<00:03:00.310> layers<00:03:00.880> palette<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:01.390> that's

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
the palette layers palette and that's

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.140 
the palette layers palette and that's
also<00:03:02.080> reflected<00:03:02.310> with<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.400> new<00:03:03.550> layer<00:03:03.760> here<00:03:04.060> in

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
also reflected with a new layer here in

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.380 
also reflected with a new layer here in
the<00:03:04.269> animation<00:03:04.750> timeline<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:09.459> what<00:03:09.700> I'm<00:03:09.790> gonna

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
the animation timeline so what I'm gonna

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.009 
the animation timeline so what I'm gonna
do<00:03:10.630> now<00:03:11.260> is<00:03:11.290> let's<00:03:12.250> layer<00:03:12.550> one<00:03:12.880> layer<00:03:13.390> with<00:03:13.780> the

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
do now is let's layer one layer with the

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.470 
do now is let's layer one layer with the
video<00:03:14.519> on<00:03:15.519> it<00:03:15.580> and<00:03:15.760> I'm<00:03:16.030> gonna<00:03:16.150> lock<00:03:16.420> that

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
video on it and I'm gonna lock that

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.680 
video on it and I'm gonna lock that
layer<00:03:16.780> using<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.530> padlock<00:03:18.459> symbol<00:03:18.489> here<00:03:19.120> in

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
layer using the padlock symbol here in

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.780 
layer using the padlock symbol here in
the<00:03:19.900> layers<00:03:20.110> palette<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:21.340> just<00:03:21.519> means<00:03:21.700> I

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
the layers palette that just means I

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.870 
the layers palette that just means I
can't<00:03:22.030> accidentally<00:03:22.750> draw<00:03:23.170> on<00:03:23.530> that<00:03:24.519> video

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
can't accidentally draw on that video

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.180 
can't accidentally draw on that video
layer<00:03:25.680> so<00:03:26.680> you<00:03:26.739> know<00:03:26.890> every<00:03:27.070> select<00:03:27.430> layer<00:03:27.730> too

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
layer so you know every select layer too

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.289 
layer so you know every select layer too
and<00:03:30.190> I'm<00:03:30.519> just<00:03:31.330> about<00:03:31.570> ready<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:31.900> go<00:03:32.910> now<00:03:33.910> I<00:03:33.970> can

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
and I'm just about ready to go now I can

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:41.120 
and I'm just about ready to go now I can
begin<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.900> draw<00:03:35.350> anywhere<00:03:35.769> I<00:03:35.830> like<00:03:36.190> here<00:03:37.590> and

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.259 

that's<00:03:42.130> useful<00:03:42.370> because<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:42.820> don't<00:03:43.030> really

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
that's useful because I don't really

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.210 
that's useful because I don't really
want<00:03:43.420> to<00:03:43.510> have<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.870> start<00:03:44.650> at<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.799> start<00:03:45.040> and

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
want to have to start at the start and

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.270 
want to have to start at the start and
draw<00:03:45.370> over<00:03:45.400> all<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:45.940> this<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:47.650> other<00:03:47.769> thing<00:03:48.070> to

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
draw over all of this the other thing to

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.220 
draw over all of this the other thing to
note<00:03:48.489> here<00:03:48.790> is<00:03:48.850> in<00:03:49.060> our<00:03:49.239> animation<00:03:49.600> timeline

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
note here is in our animation timeline

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.960 
note here is in our animation timeline
we've<00:03:50.380> got<00:03:50.530> some<00:03:50.709> controls<00:03:51.220> at<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.519> bottom<00:03:51.610> of

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
we've got some controls at the bottom of

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.130 
we've got some controls at the bottom of
the<00:03:52.090> screen<00:03:52.330> ok<00:03:53.200> we<00:03:53.650> have<00:03:54.390> next<00:03:55.390> frame<00:03:55.660> control

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
the screen ok we have next frame control

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.979 
the screen ok we have next frame control
ok<00:03:56.950> which<00:03:57.220> just<00:03:57.549> we<00:03:57.910> click<00:03:58.209> to<00:03:58.450> move<00:03:58.660> the

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
ok which just we click to move the

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.110 
ok which just we click to move the
playhead<00:03:59.410> to<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.860> next<00:04:00.130> frame<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:00.760> we<00:04:00.880> need

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
playhead to the next frame and we need

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.490 
playhead to the next frame and we need
that<00:04:01.330> when<00:04:01.510> we're<00:04:01.690> drawing<00:04:01.959> frame<00:04:02.440> by<00:04:02.620> frame

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
that when we're drawing frame by frame

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.090 
that when we're drawing frame by frame
ok<00:04:05.500> so<00:04:05.560> I'm<00:04:05.890> just<00:04:06.040> gonna<00:04:06.540> find<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.950> start<00:04:08.950> of

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
ok so I'm just gonna find the start of

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.869 
ok so I'm just gonna find the start of
this<00:04:09.220> animation

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
this animation

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.119 
this animation
start<00:04:11.239> of<00:04:11.359> the<00:04:11.480> video<00:04:11.959> where<00:04:12.409> it<00:04:12.499> gets

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
start of the video where it gets

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.910 
start of the video where it gets
interesting<00:04:14.349> now<00:04:15.349> I'm<00:04:15.439> not<00:04:15.590> going<00:04:15.709> to<00:04:15.799> do<00:04:15.889> a

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
interesting now I'm not going to do a

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.460 
interesting now I'm not going to do a
full<00:04:16.100> animation<00:04:16.489> in<00:04:16.820> this<00:04:16.940> tutorial

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
full animation in this tutorial

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.840 
full animation in this tutorial
basically<00:04:18.470> just<00:04:18.680> going<00:04:18.889> to<00:04:19.009> do<00:04:19.340> some<00:04:19.519> really

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
basically just going to do some really

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.830 
basically just going to do some really
quick<00:04:20.030> drawing<00:04:20.359> here<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:23.120> give<00:04:23.419> you<00:04:23.630> the

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
quick drawing here and to give you the

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.370 
quick drawing here and to give you the
idea<00:04:24.620> of<00:04:24.680> what<00:04:25.310> you<00:04:25.340> might<00:04:25.430> be<00:04:25.729> able<00:04:26.000> to<00:04:26.090> do<00:04:26.380> so

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
idea of what you might be able to do so

it<00:05:20.860> it<00:05:21.860> goes<00:05:22.070> a<00:05:22.099> bit<00:05:22.430> darker<00:05:22.940> but<00:05:23.120> what<00:05:23.900> you<00:05:23.990> can

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
it it goes a bit darker but what you can

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.490 
it it goes a bit darker but what you can
see<00:05:24.440> now<00:05:24.680> is<00:05:24.919> a<00:05:24.949> faint<00:05:25.310> outline<00:05:25.909> of<00:05:25.940> the<00:05:26.500> lines

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
see now is a faint outline of the lines

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.029 
see now is a faint outline of the lines
that<00:05:27.800> I<00:05:27.860> drew<00:05:27.889> on<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:28.430> frame<00:05:28.820> before<00:05:29.889> this<00:05:30.889> can

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
that I drew on the frame before this can

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.110 
that I drew on the frame before this can
be<00:05:31.130> quite<00:05:31.220> useful<00:05:31.370> when<00:05:31.729> you're<00:05:31.880> animating

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
be quite useful when you're animating

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.909 
be quite useful when you're animating
when<00:05:32.599> you're<00:05:32.690> trying<00:05:32.840> to<00:05:32.930> make<00:05:33.139> something

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
when you're trying to make something

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.830 
when you're trying to make something
move<00:05:34.099> smoothly<00:05:34.669> you<00:05:35.090> need<00:05:35.240> to<00:05:35.330> be<00:05:35.419> able<00:05:35.479> to<00:05:35.599> see

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
move smoothly you need to be able to see

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.189 
move smoothly you need to be able to see
what<00:05:36.259> you<00:05:36.349> drew<00:05:36.590> on<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:36.830> frame<00:05:37.070> before<00:05:38.020> so<00:05:39.020> now

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 
what you drew on the frame before so now

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:44.920 
what you drew on the frame before so now
I<00:05:39.229> can<00:05:39.500> just<00:05:43.120> drawing<00:05:44.120> very<00:05:44.330> badly<00:05:44.630> with<00:05:44.900> the

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
I can just drawing very badly with the

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:54.909 
I can just drawing very badly with the
mouse<00:05:51.430> so<00:05:52.810> again<00:05:53.810> skinning<00:05:54.110> also<00:05:54.380> lets<00:05:54.620> you

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
mouse so again skinning also lets you

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.459 
mouse so again skinning also lets you
see<00:05:55.460> what<00:05:55.669> detail<00:05:56.180> you<00:05:56.389> included<00:05:57.050> so<00:05:57.229> that<00:05:57.259> you

00:05:57.459 --> 00:05:57.469 
see what detail you included so that you

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:03.249 
see what detail you included so that you
can<00:05:57.650> also<00:05:57.830> include<00:05:58.460> that<00:05:58.699> detail<00:05:59.300> and<00:06:02.259> brain

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:03.259 
can also include that detail and brain

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:06.249 
can also include that detail and brain
that<00:06:03.409> you're<00:06:03.530> currently<00:06:03.889> drawing<00:06:05.259> let's

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:06.259 
that you're currently drawing let's

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:11.959 
that you're currently drawing let's
again<00:06:06.789> skip<00:06:07.789> to<00:06:07.909> the<00:06:08.000> next<00:06:08.240> frame

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:23.149 

and<00:06:12.969> so<00:06:13.419> on<00:06:20.610> okay

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:23.159 
and so on okay

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:25.559 
and so on okay
three<00:06:24.159> very<00:06:24.460> professional<00:06:25.120> frames<00:06:25.360> of

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:25.569 
three very professional frames of

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:29.909 
three very professional frames of
animation<00:06:27.360> now<00:06:28.360> let's<00:06:29.259> just<00:06:29.409> imagine<00:06:29.529> I've

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 
animation now let's just imagine I've

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.730 
animation now let's just imagine I've
done<00:06:30.069> a<00:06:30.099> lot<00:06:30.870> and<00:06:31.870> I<00:06:31.960> want<00:06:32.139> to<00:06:32.199> preview<00:06:32.560> my

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
done a lot and I want to preview my

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.429 
done a lot and I want to preview my
animation<00:06:33.310> well<00:06:33.699> I<00:06:33.909> can<00:06:34.210> again<00:06:34.900> drag<00:06:35.229> my

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:35.439 
animation well I can again drag my

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:39.450 
animation well I can again drag my
playhead<00:06:35.469> back<00:06:36.430> and<00:06:36.610> forth<00:06:36.849> like<00:06:37.090> this<00:06:37.150> I<00:06:38.460> can

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
playhead back and forth like this I can

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.939 
playhead back and forth like this I can
also<00:06:39.610> go<00:06:40.419> across<00:06:40.719> here<00:06:40.840> to<00:06:41.110> my<00:06:41.199> layers<00:06:41.439> palette

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:41.949 
also go across here to my layers palette

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:44.670 
also go across here to my layers palette
and<00:06:42.069> toggle<00:06:42.520> the<00:06:42.729> visibility<00:06:43.180> of<00:06:43.930> the<00:06:44.349> bottom

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
and toggle the visibility of the bottom

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.800 
and toggle the visibility of the bottom
layer<00:06:44.889> and<00:06:45.550> that<00:06:46.060> lets<00:06:46.270> me<00:06:46.389> see<00:06:47.849> my<00:06:48.849> frames

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:49.810 
layer and that lets me see my frames

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.689 
layer and that lets me see my frames
that<00:06:50.020> I've<00:06:50.139> drawn<00:06:50.469> I<00:06:50.740> can<00:06:51.099> turn<00:06:51.310> onion

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:51.699 
that I've drawn I can turn onion

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:55.079 
that I've drawn I can turn onion
skinning<00:06:52.029> off<00:06:52.270> I<00:06:52.889> can<00:06:53.889> see<00:06:54.339> my<00:06:54.490> animation

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:55.089 
skinning off I can see my animation

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:58.920 
skinning off I can see my animation
beginning<00:06:55.449> to<00:06:55.569> form<00:06:55.870> here<00:06:57.180> so<00:06:58.180> we<00:06:58.300> got<00:06:58.479> back<00:06:58.659> on

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
beginning to form here so we got back on

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.719 
beginning to form here so we got back on
turn<00:06:59.860> onion<00:07:00.279> skinning<00:07:00.520> back<00:07:00.759> on<00:07:00.969> and<00:07:01.599> continue

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:02.729 
turn onion skinning back on and continue

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:05.010 
turn onion skinning back on and continue
so<00:07:03.729> that's<00:07:03.909> the<00:07:03.999> basics<00:07:04.419> it<00:07:04.629> up<00:07:04.779> for

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.020 
so that's the basics it up for

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.260 
so that's the basics it up for
rotoscoping<00:07:05.650> in<00:07:05.800> Photoshop<00:07:06.370> and<00:07:06.669> really<00:07:07.120> it's

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.270 
rotoscoping in Photoshop and really it's

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.779 
rotoscoping in Photoshop and really it's
just<00:07:07.360> down<00:07:07.689> to<00:07:07.839> your<00:07:07.930> imagination<00:07:08.499> and<00:07:09.249> skill

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:09.789 
just down to your imagination and skill

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:12.149 
just down to your imagination and skill
with<00:07:09.999> the<00:07:10.029> tools<00:07:10.409> but<00:07:11.409> you'll<00:07:11.529> find<00:07:11.830> that<00:07:12.009> even

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:12.159 
with the tools but you'll find that even

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:13.890 
with the tools but you'll find that even
loose<00:07:12.550> drawing<00:07:13.120> can<00:07:13.330> create<00:07:13.659> quite

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:13.900 
loose drawing can create quite

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.860 
loose drawing can create quite
interesting<00:07:14.439> and<00:07:14.560> fun<00:07:14.800> animations<00:07:15.839> you<00:07:16.839> can

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:16.870 
interesting and fun animations you can

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.040 
interesting and fun animations you can
create<00:07:17.319> more<00:07:17.500> than<00:07:17.560> one<00:07:17.860> video<00:07:18.099> layer<00:07:18.899> you<00:07:19.899> can

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.050 
create more than one video layer you can

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.050 
create more than one video layer you can
create<00:07:20.289> non<00:07:20.649> video<00:07:20.979> layers<00:07:21.310> if<00:07:21.610> you<00:07:21.759> want<00:07:21.939> to

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.060 
create non video layers if you want to

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.839 
create non video layers if you want to
have<00:07:22.240> static<00:07:22.689> elements<00:07:23.050> in<00:07:23.529> the<00:07:23.620> background

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:23.849 
have static elements in the background

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:27.689 
have static elements in the background
and<00:07:25.169> really<00:07:26.169> it's<00:07:26.439> up<00:07:26.589> to<00:07:26.710> you<00:07:26.860> how<00:07:27.310> far<00:07:27.550> you

00:07:27.689 --> 00:07:27.699 
and really it's up to you how far you

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:30.990 
and really it's up to you how far you
take<00:07:27.909> it<00:07:28.500> so<00:07:29.500> that's<00:07:29.649> that<00:07:29.860> rotoscoping<00:07:30.849> with

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.000 
take it so that's that rotoscoping with

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.960 
take it so that's that rotoscoping with
a<00:07:31.029> video<00:07:31.300> in<00:07:31.479> Photoshop
