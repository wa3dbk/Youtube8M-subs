00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.160 
answer is no but not a complete no and
the<00:00:51.090> reason<00:00:51.300> why<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.390> say<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.660> not<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.780> complete

the reason why I say it's not a complete

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.709 
the reason why I say it's not a complete
no<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.469> because<00:00:52.800> both<00:00:53.520> Sony<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.210> Microsoft

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
no is because both Sony and Microsoft

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.479 
no is because both Sony and Microsoft
have<00:00:54.870> stated<00:00:55.170> at<00:00:55.379> one<00:00:55.530> point<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.250> they<00:00:56.370> will

try<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.730> release<00:00:57.059> digital<00:00:57.660> versions<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.170> lot

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
try to release digital versions of a lot

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.099 
try to release digital versions of a lot
of<00:00:58.559> Xbox<00:00:58.920> 360<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.609> ps3<00:00:59.910> games<00:01:00.420> over<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
of Xbox 360 and ps3 games over the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:01.790

course<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.379> time

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
course of time

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.950 
course of time
