00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:12.280
 and this is like a videotutorial of 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.760
 like other 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.500
 it would still be 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.280
 in showing the location and it hurts 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.280
 demonstrate and we start 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.530
 two 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.100
 I am no longer a title 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.020
 but good 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:35.400
 every time they appear 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.400
 the day is disappearing 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.090
 so in a certain time appeared two 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.970
 books in the places that are intended 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.900

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.570
 free the mother's schools was more 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.640
 close then 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.610
 we arrived here again they have closed 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.610
 click on and 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.610
 d 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.890
 solar clicks I had 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.890
 one 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.170
 and there is another 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.260
 it's the hand game room 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.340
 an exposed hand game comes out 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.340
 and showing where there is more 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.640
 here in front of here there is also another 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.880
 from another book 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.259
 To who 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.259
 of the violet of two minutes 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.330
 where I'm down in the moments of 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:52.250
 books and he uses that he voted 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.250
 the yin downloads 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.470
 we should 4 and you have to read 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.520
 so what 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.980
 I have already shown you 4 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.990
 the other is in the lots of destiny 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.990
 up here 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.700
 let's say this is the arcane mark 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.700
 Decanting is there and they can 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.060
 then here is a moment 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.880
 have we are going to look for the other what 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.770
 be there in the reach machines I think 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.190
 that as another principle is changed to 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.140
 cabal and him 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.450
 after the restart 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.220
 and all appear but only great 23 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.930
 minutes later after having been 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.690
 slow 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:06.380
 between 5 and 8 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:07.640
 healing we will be able to find up 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.600
 what 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.600
 the place is hot 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.709
 but I'm a little crazy because I'm 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.709
 downloading the live 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.510
 and the last one is here 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.590
 you have to be better than telling him where 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.590
 I am 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.370
 the cure is in visitors center 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.790
 of valera there they sit you can 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.790
 find 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.170
 at a table about the state 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.700
 the violet cane to find here 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.440
 after you have read them all 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.440
 a message will arrive 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.050
 ok it's good to practice a message 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:37.870
 and unprotected I did not remember the 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.870
 cannabis magic schools 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.860
 here we have to talk with a gps 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:51.249
 need help 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.620
 and agreements that do not know this what 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.930
 they prepare 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.440
 give us a relative of the fifth who 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.440
 it's like 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.690
 what is common 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.849
 an adversary but 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.199
 as memorable 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:17.199
 what yes 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.820
 and this seems to be for 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:32.790
 the good mate that was all I hope 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.790
 what you liked and understood 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.750
