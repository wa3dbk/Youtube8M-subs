00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
all the way back that's what we're going

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.820 
all the way back that's what we're going
to<00:01:29.790> be<00:01:29.850> doing<00:01:30.060> with<00:01:30.420> all<00:01:30.570> these<00:01:30.960> sections<00:01:31.470> all

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
to be doing with all these sections all

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.580 
to be doing with all these sections all
throughout<00:01:32.670> her<00:01:32.850> hair<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:34.080> there's<00:01:34.259> going<00:01:34.470> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
throughout her hair so there's going to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.880 
throughout her hair so there's going to
be<00:01:34.650> four<00:01:34.950> total<00:01:35.460> sections<00:01:35.940> of<00:01:36.350> these<00:01:37.350> twists

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
be four total sections of these twists

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.550 
be four total sections of these twists
and<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.280> usually<00:01:38.820> twist<00:01:39.149> a<00:01:39.390> ways<00:01:39.690> back<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.409> I

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
and I usually twist a ways back like I

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.040 
and I usually twist a ways back like I
am<00:01:40.950> right<00:01:41.070> there<00:01:41.399> before<00:01:42.330> I<00:01:42.540> put<00:01:42.690> the<00:01:42.810> elastic

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
am right there before I put the elastic

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.960 
am right there before I put the elastic
and<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:43.740> helps<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> keep<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.369> secure<00:01:44.729> so

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
and it just helps to keep it secure so

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.410 
and it just helps to keep it secure so
there's<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.240> first<00:01:45.570> twist<00:01:45.960> then<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.210> put<00:01:48.210> that

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
there's a first twist then I put that

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.539 
there's a first twist then I put that
extra<00:01:48.750> hair<00:01:49.290> over<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> top<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.190> it's<00:01:50.310> not<00:01:50.430> in

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
extra hair over the top so it's not in

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.999 
extra hair over the top so it's not in
the<00:01:50.640> way<00:01:50.759> then<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.750> just<00:01:52.080> section<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.710> part

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
the way then I just section this part

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.590 
the way then I just section this part
off<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.399> had<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> little<00:01:53.820> trouble<00:01:54.000> sectioning

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
off I had a little trouble sectioning

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.910 
off I had a little trouble sectioning
enough<00:01:54.869> because<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:55.410> right<00:01:55.530> there<00:01:55.710> above

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
enough because it's right there above

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.350 
enough because it's right there above
her<00:01:56.039> ear<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.550> I<00:01:56.580> had<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.789> do<00:01:56.970> it<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.090> couple<00:01:57.179> times

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
her ear so I had to do it a couple times

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.020 
her ear so I had to do it a couple times
with<00:01:57.720> it<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.110> section<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.100> bottom<00:01:59.399> part<00:01:59.610> that

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
with it I section the bottom part that

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.200 
with it I section the bottom part that
I'm<00:02:00.270> not<00:02:00.479> going<00:02:00.690> to<00:02:00.780> be<00:02:00.869> twisting<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.440> and<00:02:02.210> give

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
I'm not going to be twisting in and give

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.300 
I'm not going to be twisting in and give
that<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.570> her<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:04.020> hold<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.590> then<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.860> go<00:02:05.159> ahead

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
that to her to hold and then I go ahead

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.020 
that to her to hold and then I go ahead
and<00:02:05.490> twist<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:06.030> center<00:02:06.390> piece<00:02:06.539> back

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
and twist that center piece back

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.740 
and twist that center piece back
that's<00:02:09.020> my<00:02:09.259> pig<00:02:09.530> in<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.740> background<00:02:10.750> snorting

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
that's my pig in the background snorting

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.930 
that's my pig in the background snorting
if<00:02:11.990> you<00:02:12.140> can<00:02:12.319> hear<00:02:12.500> her

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.330 

definitely<00:02:17.900> helps<00:02:18.380> if<00:02:18.650> you<00:02:19.010> have<00:02:19.070> a<00:02:19.130> kid

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
definitely helps if you have a kid

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.770 
definitely helps if you have a kid
that's<00:02:19.520> used<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.760> getting<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.150> hair<00:02:20.360> done<00:02:20.570> if

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
that's used to getting the hair done if

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.840 
that's used to getting the hair done if
not<00:02:21.140> then<00:02:21.560> it's<00:02:21.770> probably<00:02:22.040> isn't<00:02:22.790> the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
not then it's probably isn't the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.640 
not then it's probably isn't the
hairstyle<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.540> do<00:02:23.720> one<00:02:23.990> like<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.350> kid<00:02:24.620> who

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
and then I go ahead and tie it secure so

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.820 
and then I go ahead and tie it secure so
then<00:02:41.210> there's<00:02:41.420> those<00:02:41.630> twists<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.380> I<00:02:42.530> pulled

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
then there's those twists and I pulled

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.020 
then there's those twists and I pulled
all<00:02:42.950> this<00:02:43.160> hair<00:02:44.860> back<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:46.220> was<00:02:46.430> figuring<00:02:46.880> out

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
all this hair back I was figuring out

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.330 
all this hair back I was figuring out
what<00:02:47.300> I<00:02:47.330> was<00:02:47.570> gonna<00:02:47.720> do<00:02:48.050> and<00:02:48.200> I<00:02:48.320> decided<00:02:48.740> I<00:02:49.100> was

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
what I was gonna do and I decided I was

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.790 
what I was gonna do and I decided I was
going<00:02:49.520> to<00:02:49.640> do<00:02:49.850> it<00:02:50.060> offset<00:02:50.990> like<00:02:51.320> I<00:02:51.470> was<00:02:51.680> gonna

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
going to do it offset like I was gonna

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.410 
going to do it offset like I was gonna
do<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.280> side<00:02:52.550> instead<00:02:52.850> of<00:02:53.210> going

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
do it to the side instead of going

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.980 
do it to the side instead of going
straight<00:02:53.480> back<00:02:54.170> so<00:02:54.800> it<00:02:55.250> just<00:02:55.610> is<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.570> different

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
straight back so it just is a different

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.760 
straight back so it just is a different
style<00:02:57.170> adds<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:58.300> unique<00:02:59.300> look<00:02:59.690> so<00:03:00.050> I<00:03:00.080> sectioned

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
style adds a unique look so I sectioned

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.580 
style adds a unique look so I sectioned
the<00:03:01.070> front<00:03:01.730> part<00:03:01.940> off<00:03:02.200> put<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.320> rest<00:03:03.470> back

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
the front part off put the rest back

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.710 
the front part off put the rest back
