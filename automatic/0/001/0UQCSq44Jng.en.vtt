hey guys how's it going just creating a
very<00:00:03.179> very<00:00:03.510> quick<00:00:03.870> video<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:04.740> after<00:00:05.430> seeing

very very quick video and after seeing

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.849 
very very quick video and after seeing

seed<00:00:08.750> farming<00:00:09.750> video<00:00:11.269> essentially<00:00:12.269> I've<00:00:12.480> just

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
seed farming video essentially I've just

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.539 
seed farming video essentially I've just
got<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.780> small<00:00:13.349> improvements<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.099> this<00:00:14.309> does

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
got to small improvements and this does

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.160 
got to small improvements and this does
assume<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.150> have<00:00:15.240> seen<00:00:15.480> his<00:00:15.690> video<00:00:15.960> so

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
assume that you have seen his video so

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.570 
assume that you have seen his video so
please<00:00:16.350> go<00:00:16.590> watch<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.980> first<00:00:17.160> I'll<00:00:17.430> leave<00:00:17.550> a

that<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.150> have<00:00:21.180> applied<00:00:21.720> energetic<00:00:22.289> switch

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
that you have applied energetic switch

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.340 
that you have applied energetic switch
generic<00:00:23.400> be<00:00:23.580> has<00:00:23.910> started<00:00:24.480> but<00:00:24.689> has<00:00:24.930> not<00:00:25.140> quite

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
generic be has started but has not quite

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.120 
generic be has started but has not quite
got<00:00:25.560> up<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.800> yet<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.630> so<00:00:27.630> yeah<00:00:28.130> essentially

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
got up to yet and so yeah essentially

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.070 
got up to yet and so yeah essentially
number<00:00:29.820> one<00:00:30.029> before<00:00:30.359> we<00:00:30.449> get<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.810> applied

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
number one before we get to the applied

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.200 
number one before we get to the applied
in<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.529> six<00:00:31.650> parts<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.219> just<00:00:32.669> suggest<00:00:32.969> adding

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
in just six parts I just suggest adding

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.030 
in just six parts I just suggest adding
a<00:00:33.420> redstone<00:00:33.719> receiver<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.440> like<00:00:34.649> being<00:00:34.860> able<00:00:34.950> to

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
a redstone receiver I like being able to

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.930 
a redstone receiver I like being able to
turn<00:00:35.219> my<00:00:35.370> farms<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.480> off<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.670> can

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
turn my farms on and off and and you can

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.760 
turn my farms on and off and and you can
do<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.450> very<00:00:39.480> very<00:00:39.930> easily<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.710> by

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
do that very very easily just by

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.170 
do that very very easily just by
changing<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.600> redstone<00:00:42.600> controlled

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
changing this to redstone controlled

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.700 
changing this to redstone controlled
select<00:00:45.180> your<00:00:45.329> redstone<00:00:45.690> receiver<00:00:46.170> remember

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
select your redstone receiver remember

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.840 
select your redstone receiver remember
that<00:00:46.829> you've<00:00:46.950> got<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.190> connect<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.640> one<00:00:47.820> of

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
that you've got to connect it to one of

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.069 
that you've got to connect it to one of
your<00:00:48.059> inventory<00:00:48.690> cables<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:50.670> then<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.960> know

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
your inventory cables and then you know

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.380 
your inventory cables and then you know
keep<00:00:52.289> your<00:00:52.410> interval<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.039> three<00:00:53.280> seconds<00:00:53.910> any

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
keep your interval of three seconds any

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.590 
keep your interval of three seconds any
side<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.899> fine<00:00:55.399> any<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.879> fine<00:00:57.149> you

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
side is fine any of that is fine you

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.200 
side is fine any of that is fine you
know<00:00:57.690> all<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.590> have<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.800> do<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.340> just<00:00:59.399> add<00:01:00.149> it

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
know all you have to do is just add it

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.049 
know all you have to do is just add it
as<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.140> redstone<00:01:01.739> receiver<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.760> that's<00:01:03.000> just

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
as a redstone receiver so that's just

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.469 
as a redstone receiver so that's just
very<00:01:03.239> very<00:01:03.930> easy<00:01:04.350> way<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.909> you<00:01:05.909> know<00:01:06.000> seeing

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
very very easy way of you know seeing

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.920 
very very easy way of you know seeing

got into an applied energetics but this

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.969 
got into an applied energetics but this
is<00:01:56.219> how<00:01:56.399> you'll<00:01:56.700> want<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.000> set<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.329> up<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.860> left

is how you'll want to set it up the left
side<00:01:59.280> means<00:01:59.640> keep<00:02:00.390> these<00:02:00.659> items<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.409> my

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
side means keep these items in my

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.609 
side means keep these items in my
inventory<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.780> not<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.110> inventory

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
inventory so this is not the inventory

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.440 
inventory so this is not the inventory
on<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.950> site<00:02:05.130> here<00:02:05.159> over<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.000> right<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
on the site here over on the right the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.440 
on the site here over on the right the
exported<00:02:07.140> items<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.970> where<00:02:08.970> its<00:02:09.119> inventory

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
exported items is where its inventory

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.410 
exported items is where its inventory
it's<00:02:09.780> only<00:02:09.989> got<00:02:10.110> eight<00:02:10.289> slots<00:02:10.619> not<00:02:11.420> assuming

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
it's only got eight slots not assuming

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.850 
it's only got eight slots not assuming
the<00:02:12.629> processing<00:02:13.349> area

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
the processing area

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.690 
the processing area
yeah<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.570> but<00:02:15.570> I<00:02:15.600> want<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:15.990> keep<00:02:16.230> 64<00:02:16.890> squid

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
yeah and but I want to keep 64 squid

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.150 
yeah and but I want to keep 64 squid
plant<00:02:17.940> seeds<00:02:18.210> here<00:02:18.450> as<00:02:18.720> well<00:02:18.900> as<00:02:19.080> 64<00:02:19.680> bone<00:02:19.920> meal

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
plant seeds here as well as 64 bone meal

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.620 
plant seeds here as well as 64 bone meal
and<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:21.060> if<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.360> take<00:02:21.600> these<00:02:21.840> away<00:02:23.300> it<00:02:24.300> will

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
and so if I take these away it will

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.410 
and so if I take these away it will
continue<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:26.010> try<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.370> replace<00:02:26.610> things<00:02:26.910> until

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
continue to try and replace things until

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.940 
continue to try and replace things until
it<00:02:27.570> doesn't<00:02:27.720> have<00:02:27.900> any<00:02:28.050> more<00:02:28.170> about<00:02:28.530> tons<00:02:28.830> of

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
it doesn't have any more about tons of

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.380 
it doesn't have any more about tons of
bone<00:02:29.130> meal<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.520> it's<00:02:29.670> never<00:02:29.880> going<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.090> run<00:02:30.360> out

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
bone meal so it's never going to run out

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.110 
bone meal so it's never going to run out
of<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.750> stuff<00:02:31.220> but<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.310> see<00:02:32.490> I<00:02:32.520> got<00:02:32.880> right

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
of that stuff but you see I got right

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.080 
of that stuff but you see I got right
down<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.360> 49<00:02:33.990> so<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.800> replaces<00:02:35.310> as<00:02:35.460> much<00:02:35.790> as<00:02:35.970> it

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
down to 49 so it replaces as much as it

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.870 
down to 49 so it replaces as much as it
can<00:02:36.300> until<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.900> reaches<00:02:37.170> 64<00:02:37.710> and<00:02:37.980> then<00:02:38.010> the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
can until it reaches 64 and then the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.970 
can until it reaches 64 and then the
rest<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.270> just<00:02:39.480> goes<00:02:39.660> straight<00:02:39.810> into<00:02:40.230> here

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
rest of it just goes straight into here

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.390 
rest of it just goes straight into here
and<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:42.360> as<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.930> can<00:02:43.080> see<00:02:43.110> I've<00:02:43.290> got<00:02:43.370> 177<00:02:44.370> I
