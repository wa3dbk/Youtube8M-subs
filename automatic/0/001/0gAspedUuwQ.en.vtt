00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
them I got a couple different zoanthids

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.470 
them I got a couple different zoanthids

fried done a couple different rocks so

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.900 
fried done a couple different rocks so
they<00:00:21.510> can<00:00:21.720> spread<00:00:21.960> out<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.609> lot<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.699> people

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
they can spread out a lot of people

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.060 
they can spread out a lot of people
wonder<00:00:24.119> what<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.359> feed<00:00:24.539> these<00:00:24.689> guys<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.439> lot<00:00:25.920> of

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
wonder what to feed these guys a lot of

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.640 
wonder what to feed these guys a lot of
times<00:00:26.310> if<00:00:26.880> you're<00:00:27.119> not<00:00:27.330> looking<00:00:27.660> for<00:00:27.689> optimum

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
times if you're not looking for optimum

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.429 
times if you're not looking for optimum
growth<00:00:29.010> which<00:00:29.910> pretty<00:00:30.300> much<00:00:30.390> everybody<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.109> if

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
growth which pretty much everybody is if

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.479 
growth which pretty much everybody is if
you're<00:00:31.590> just<00:00:31.710> looking<00:00:31.830> for<00:00:31.980> something<00:00:32.219> easy

to take care of these guys are great
they<00:00:35.280> really<00:00:35.430> don't<00:00:35.610> require<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:36.030> whole<00:00:36.270> lot<00:00:36.420> of

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
they really don't require a whole lot of

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.979 
they really don't require a whole lot of
care

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
care

care
I<00:00:37.610> pretty<00:00:38.610> much<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.270> know<00:00:39.360> provides<00:00:39.840> some

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
I pretty much you know provides some

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.900 
I pretty much you know provides some
good<00:00:40.200> lighting<00:00:40.410> some<00:00:40.860> good<00:00:41.010> filtration<00:00:41.190> and

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
good lighting some good filtration and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.760 
good lighting some good filtration and
you<00:00:42.570> don't<00:00:42.719> pretty<00:00:42.870> much<00:00:43.079> get<00:00:43.290> some<00:00:43.410> healthy

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
you don't pretty much get some healthy

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.190 
you don't pretty much get some healthy
as<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.950> was<00:00:44.360> but<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.390> these<00:00:45.629> guys<00:00:45.899> there's<00:00:46.140> a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
as it was but for these guys there's a

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.740 
as it was but for these guys there's a
couple<00:00:46.379> different<00:00:46.680> ways<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:47.010> feed<00:00:47.219> them<00:00:47.750> I

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
couple different ways to feed them I

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.439 
couple different ways to feed them I
have<00:00:49.289> heard<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.800> couple<00:00:50.039> different<00:00:50.340> methods

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
have heard of a couple different methods

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.459 
have heard of a couple different methods
including<00:00:51.500> using<00:00:52.500> pellets<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.969> marine

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
including using pellets like a marine

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.799 
including using pellets like a marine
pellet<00:00:55.610> any<00:00:56.610> kind<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.820> saltwater<00:00:57.180> pellet<00:00:57.629> and

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
pellet any kind of saltwater pellet and

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.310 
pellet any kind of saltwater pellet and
you<00:00:58.079> basically<00:00:58.530> place<00:00:58.770> them<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.160> top<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:01.260> you

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
you basically place them on top so you

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.619 
you basically place them on top so you
play<00:01:01.590> some<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:01.980> right<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.579> middle<00:01:03.570> of

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
play some like right in the middle of

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.780 
play some like right in the middle of
the<00:01:03.719> cluster<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.500> they'll<00:01:05.010> actually<00:01:05.189> eat<00:01:05.580> off

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
the cluster and they'll actually eat off

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.679 
the cluster and they'll actually eat off
of<00:01:05.820> it

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
of it

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.530 
of it
I<00:01:06.750> don't<00:01:07.290> do<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.619> myself<00:01:08.340> me<00:01:08.880> personally<00:01:09.150> I

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
I don't do this myself me personally I

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.890 
I don't do this myself me personally I
take<00:01:10.110> frozen<00:01:10.710> food<00:01:11.330> put<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> container

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
take frozen food put it in a container

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.499 
take frozen food put it in a container
takes<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.500> syringe<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.700> actually<00:01:15.060> squirt<00:01:15.420> it

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
takes a syringe and actually squirt it

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.039 
takes a syringe and actually squirt it
into<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.619> cluster<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.130> themselves<00:01:17.990> this<00:01:18.990> way

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
into the cluster of themselves this way

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.260 
into the cluster of themselves this way
they<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.560> optimum<00:01:20.100> amount<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.880> food<00:01:21.090> that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
they get the optimum amount of food that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.390 
they get the optimum amount of food that
they<00:01:21.360> need<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.900> require<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.100> don't<00:01:23.280> have

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
they need and require and I don't have

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.090 
they need and require and I don't have
to<00:01:23.520> worry<00:01:23.670> about<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.970> pellet<00:01:24.270> dissolving<00:01:25.100> and

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
to worry about the pellet dissolving and

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.219 
to worry about the pellet dissolving and
polluting<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> tank<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.210> raising<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
polluting the tank up raising the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.880 
polluting the tank up raising the
nitrates<00:01:28.770> nitrites<00:01:29.009> all<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:30.119> fun<00:01:30.390> stuff

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
nitrates nitrites all that fun stuff

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.590 
nitrates nitrites all that fun stuff
another<00:01:31.890> thing<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.400> if<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.670> do<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> pellets<00:01:33.299> a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
another thing is if you do the pellets a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.390 
another thing is if you do the pellets a
lot<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.110> times<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.500> fish<00:01:34.740> will<00:01:34.979> realize<00:01:35.369> that

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
lot of times the fish will realize that

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.819 
lot of times the fish will realize that
they<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.820> get<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> free<00:01:36.840> meal<00:01:37.020> or<00:01:37.259> an<00:01:37.350> easy<00:01:37.560> meal

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
they can get a free meal or an easy meal

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.530 
they can get a free meal or an easy meal
right<00:01:38.100> off<00:01:38.220> those<00:01:38.430> owe<00:01:38.579> anthems<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.299> they'll

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
right off those owe anthems and they'll

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.140 
right off those owe anthems and they'll
actually<00:01:39.810> pick<00:01:40.049> at<00:01:40.229> them<00:01:40.409> until<00:01:40.850> they<00:01:41.850> close

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
actually pick at them until they close

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.480 
actually pick at them until they close
up<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.689> that's<00:01:43.110> not<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.680> pleasing<00:01:43.979> looking<00:01:44.399> at

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
up and that's not to pleasing looking at

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.249 
up and that's not to pleasing looking at
an<00:01:44.579> aquarium<00:01:45.060> when<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.450> bunch<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.720> cloves<00:01:46.049> that

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
an aquarium when a bunch of cloves that

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.719 
an aquarium when a bunch of cloves that
was<00:01:46.820> another<00:01:47.820> method<00:01:48.799> that<00:01:49.799> people<00:01:49.920> do<00:01:50.340> are

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
was another method that people do are

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.429 
was another method that people do are
the<00:01:51.860> cyclop<00:01:52.860> Easy's<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.970> call<00:01:54.509> them<00:01:54.750> people

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
the cyclop Easy's I call them people

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.980 
the cyclop Easy's I call them people
call<00:01:55.680> them<00:01:55.770> different<00:01:55.799> things<00:01:56.990> basically

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
call them different things basically

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.319 
call them different things basically
it's<00:01:58.500> there's<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.310> couple<00:01:59.490> different<00:01:59.790> ways<00:01:59.820> but

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
it's there's a couple different ways but

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.690 
it's there's a couple different ways but
what<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.509> get<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.110> wafer<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:02.070> goes<00:02:02.280> into<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
what I get is a wafer that goes into the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.139 
what I get is a wafer that goes into the
water<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.390> stir<00:02:03.750> up<00:02:04.549> and<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.969> basically

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
water that you stir up and you basically

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.869 
water that you stir up and you basically
take<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.540> syringe<00:02:07.310> suck<00:02:08.310> out<00:02:08.489> some<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
take a syringe suck out some of the

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.520 
take a syringe suck out some of the
water<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.209> then<00:02:09.479> squirt<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.959> directly<00:02:10.289> into

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
water and then squirt it directly into

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.380 
water and then squirt it directly into
it<00:02:10.860> I'll<00:02:11.039> have<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.280> video<00:02:11.459> coming<00:02:11.879> up

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
it I'll have a video coming up

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.170 
it I'll have a video coming up
once<00:02:12.960> I<00:02:13.080> get<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.319> food<00:02:13.500> prepared<00:02:13.950> on<00:02:14.250> exactly

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
once I get the food prepared on exactly

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.630 
once I get the food prepared on exactly
how<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.420> feed<00:02:15.720> these<00:02:16.100> with<00:02:17.100> what<00:02:17.310> they<00:02:17.400> call<00:02:17.610> a

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
how to feed these with what they call a

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.760 
how to feed these with what they call a
target<00:02:18.060> feeding<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:19.200> like<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.410> said<00:02:19.590> that's

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
target feeding and like I said that's

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.380 
target feeding and like I said that's
when<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:19.980> take<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.280> syringe<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.880> put<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.240> in

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
when you take the syringe and put it in

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.630 
when you take the syringe and put it in
right<00:02:22.380> next<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.770> them<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.040> kind<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.370> squirt

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
right next to them and kind of squirt

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.910 
right next to them and kind of squirt
them<00:02:23.850> with<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.060> food<00:02:24.530> like<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.590> said<00:02:25.770> these

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
them with the food like I said these

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.490 
them with the food like I said these
guys<00:02:26.100> really<00:02:26.430> don't<00:02:26.730> require<00:02:26.850> any<00:02:27.630> specialty

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
guys really don't require any specialty

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.710 
guys really don't require any specialty
lighting<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:29.220> have<00:02:29.790> mine<00:02:30.030> on<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.209> complex

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
lighting I have mine on a complex

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.970 
lighting I have mine on a complex
compact<00:02:31.590> fluorescents<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.630> have<00:02:33.630> 20<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.530> 25

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
compact fluorescents I have 20 to 25

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.330 
compact fluorescents I have 20 to 25
watts<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.430> think<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.850> on<00:02:36.060> this<00:02:36.209> seven<00:02:36.540> gallon

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
watts I think it is on this seven gallon

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.060 
watts I think it is on this seven gallon
but<00:02:38.340> with<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:39.180> seven<00:02:39.570> gallon<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:40.170> roughly<00:02:40.860> have

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
but with the seven gallon I roughly have

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.460 
but with the seven gallon I roughly have
15<00:02:41.610> pounds<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.090> live<00:02:42.300> rock<00:02:42.569> in<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.959> so<00:02:43.319> the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
15 pounds of live rock in it so the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.780 
15 pounds of live rock in it so the
water<00:02:43.680> levels<00:02:44.069> going<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.280> be<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.370> lot<00:02:44.580> lower

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
water levels going to be a lot lower

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.820 
water levels going to be a lot lower
plus<00:02:45.270> them<00:02:45.690> being<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:46.020> lot<00:02:46.170> closer<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.800> the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
plus them being a lot closer to the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.000 
plus them being a lot closer to the
surface<00:02:48.020> they<00:02:49.020> definitely<00:02:49.320> get<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.680> required

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
surface they definitely get the required

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.410 
surface they definitely get the required
sun<00:02:50.540> light<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.810> also<00:02:52.170> have<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:52.860> blue<00:02:53.130> light

sun light I also have this blue light
mainly<00:02:54.420> just<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.720> show<00:02:54.900> off<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.260> colors<00:02:55.640> if

mainly just to show off the colors if
you<00:02:56.820> turn<00:02:57.239> on<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.480> regular<00:02:57.810> light<00:02:58.769> there<00:02:59.040> we

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
you turn on the regular light there we

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.190 
you turn on the regular light there we
go<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.280> comp<00:02:59.519> contact<00:03:00.450> fluorescent<00:03:01.019> they're

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
go the comp contact fluorescent they're
