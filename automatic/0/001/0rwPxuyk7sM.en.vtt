00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
and if I've simplified the chords they

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.499 
and if I've simplified the chords they
actually<00:00:14.190> play<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.519> out<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.759> they<00:00:15.210> have<00:00:15.299> A's

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
chords and stuff so I've simplified it

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.679

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
there so bear with me but it should

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.660 
there so bear with me but it should

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
pretty easy pretty easy too in the way

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.220 
pretty easy pretty easy too in the way
I've<00:00:26.820> simplified<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.510> there<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.750> follow<00:00:27.960> along

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
I've simplified it there to follow along

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.279 
I've simplified it there to follow along
too<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:28.710> hopefully<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.490> guys<00:00:29.640> will<00:00:29.699> enjoy

one<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.669> e<00:00:34.940> and<00:00:35.940> then<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.149> goes<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.480> G<00:00:37.550> you<00:00:38.550> can

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
one is e and then it goes to a G you can

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.250 
one is e and then it goes to a G you can
play<00:00:38.910> G<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> couple<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.570> different<00:00:39.870> ways<00:00:39.960> if<00:00:40.200> you

different<00:00:43.370> ways<00:00:43.520> and<00:00:43.820> then<00:00:44.570> it<00:00:44.690> goes<00:00:44.870> to<00:00:44.899> a

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.390
