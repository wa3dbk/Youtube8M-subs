like want to fly up the timer drop like

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.920 
like want to fly up the timer drop like
two<00:00:39.230> integers<00:00:40.160> out<00:00:40.340> of<00:00:40.460> it<00:00:40.579> so<00:00:40.879> the<00:00:41.690> more<00:00:41.899> you

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
two integers out of it so the more you

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.160 
two integers out of it so the more you
press<00:00:42.320> up<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:42.890> shorter<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.699> flight<00:00:43.910> will<00:00:44.090> be

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
press up the shorter the flight will be

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.360 
press up the shorter the flight will be
or<00:00:45.500> if<00:00:45.589> you<00:00:45.710> want<00:00:45.920> to<00:00:46.010> prolong<00:00:46.250> it<00:00:46.699> you<00:00:47.690> can<00:00:47.870> uh

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
or if you want to prolong it you can uh

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.880 
or if you want to prolong it you can uh
hang<00:00:50.090> on<00:00:50.239> like<00:00:50.510> that<00:00:51.250> so

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.850 

let's<00:00:55.340> test<00:00:55.760> him

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
let's test him

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:05.340 
let's test him
are<00:00:57.460> we<00:00:57.580> going<00:00:57.730> here<00:00:57.940> first

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.450 

before<00:01:06.350> i<00:01:06.380> go<00:01:06.440> into<00:01:06.590> stage<00:01:06.920> was<00:01:07.130> gonna<00:01:07.340> get<00:01:07.430> a

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
before i go into stage was gonna get a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.010 
before i go into stage was gonna get a
shield

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:18.040 

until<00:01:11.829> still<00:01:12.640> have<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:14.219> Spin<00:01:15.219> Dash<00:01:15.479> skill

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
until still have the Spin Dash skill

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.200 
until still have the Spin Dash skill
it's<00:01:18.650> still<00:01:18.890> blue<00:01:19.100> I<00:01:19.160> having<00:01:19.520> made<00:01:20.030> of

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
it's still blue I having made of

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.190 
it's still blue I having made of
colorful<00:01:20.450> tales<00:01:20.750> yet<00:01:21.020> so

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
colorful tales yet so

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.359 
colorful tales yet so
that's<00:01:24.200> why<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:24.380> spin<00:01:24.680> dash<00:01:24.830> effect<00:01:25.220> will

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
that's why the spin dash effect will

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.010 
that's why the spin dash effect will
probably<00:01:25.670> look<00:01:25.729> like<00:01:25.790> that<00:01:26.090> so<00:01:26.540> let's<00:01:26.720> go<00:01:26.840> onto

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
probably look like that so let's go onto

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.749 
probably look like that so let's go onto
the<00:01:27.110> stage<00:01:29.979> you<00:01:30.979> can<00:01:31.130> see<00:01:31.310> what<00:01:31.430> it<00:01:31.520> looks<00:01:31.549> like

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
the stage you can see what it looks like

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.319 
the stage you can see what it looks like
in<00:01:31.940> game

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:43.550 

all<00:01:37.329> right<00:01:37.719> you're<00:01:38.530> in<00:01:38.619> level<00:01:39.039> now

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.010 

so<00:01:44.399> if<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.729> want<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.970> cancel<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.540> fly<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.810> can

as<00:02:03.250> far<00:02:03.460> as<00:02:03.490> a<00:02:03.790> stage<00:02:04.600> design<00:02:05.020> I<00:02:05.520> probably<00:02:06.520> have

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
as far as a stage design I probably have

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.690 
as far as a stage design I probably have
certain<00:02:07.270> places<00:02:07.540> where<00:02:07.869> tails<00:02:08.200> can<00:02:08.530> fly<00:02:09.250> up

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.940 

try<00:02:12.300> not<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.569> use<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.810> springs<00:02:13.110> right<00:02:13.739> there

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:24.770 

that's<00:02:17.489> right

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.449

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.370 
to use the home and attack power up I
can't<00:02:38.840> use<00:02:38.989> my<00:02:39.020> fly<00:02:39.489> skill<00:02:40.489> no<00:02:40.640> more<00:02:40.880> so<00:02:41.810> the

can't use my fly skill no more so the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.750 
can't use my fly skill no more so the
player<00:02:42.590> have<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:42.890> choose<00:02:43.130> if<00:02:43.370> they<00:02:43.400> want<00:02:43.520> to

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.050 

but<00:03:54.680> I'm<00:03:55.010> pretty<00:03:55.190> sure<00:03:55.310> I'm<00:03:55.490> or<00:03:55.580> keeping<00:03:55.910> the

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060
