00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.060 
to do something for a project and i was
just<00:01:30.030> looking<00:01:30.360> up<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.750> nba.com<00:01:31.200> because<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.979> in

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
just looking up on nba.com because it in

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.880 
just looking up on nba.com because it in
block<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> website<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:33.650> Brandon<00:01:34.650> Jennings

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
block a website and Brandon Jennings

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.770 
block a website and Brandon Jennings
went<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:37.460> Pistons<00:01:38.460> which<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.180> really<00:01:39.450> sick

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
went to the Pistons which is really sick

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.319 
went to the Pistons which is really sick
so<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.439> think<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.549> gonna<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:44.000> tough<00:01:45.000> team<00:01:45.299> to

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
so I think it's gonna be a tough team to

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.280 
so I think it's gonna be a tough team to
be<00:01:46.070> because<00:01:47.329> Brandon<00:01:48.329> Jennings<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.960> really

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
be because Brandon Jennings is really

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.330 
be because Brandon Jennings is really
good<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:50.899> think<00:01:51.899> hold<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.890> think<00:01:53.009> that's

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
good and I think hold on I think that's

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.749 
good and I think hold on I think that's
enough<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.909> think<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.780> Pistons<00:01:55.619> will<00:01:55.799> be<00:01:56.640> in

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
enough I think the Pistons will be in

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.389 
enough I think the Pistons will be in
the<00:01:56.880> playoffs<00:01:57.180> for<00:01:58.170> sure<00:01:59.630> let<00:02:00.630> me<00:02:01.189> let<00:02:02.189> me<00:02:02.250> see
