00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
thinking maybe more like a slim down or

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.069 
thinking maybe more like a slim down or
maybe<00:04:08.129> a<00:04:08.250> comic<00:04:08.699> book<00:04:08.909> they<00:04:09.359> said<00:04:09.599> the<00:04:09.720> suit<00:04:09.930> is

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
maybe a comic book they said the suit is

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.839 
maybe a comic book they said the suit is
going<00:04:10.199> to<00:04:10.260> be<00:04:10.379> more<00:04:10.560> traditional<00:04:11.159> and<00:04:11.310> that's

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
going to be more traditional and that's

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.699 
going to be more traditional and that's
something<00:04:12.329> that<00:04:12.479> I<00:04:12.629> don't<00:04:12.720> get<00:04:13.169> into<00:04:13.409> on<00:04:13.530> this

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
something that I don't get into on this

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.860 
something that I don't get into on this
video<00:04:14.010> but<00:04:14.639> they're<00:04:15.000> changing<00:04:15.359> the<00:04:15.479> suit<00:04:15.720> so

video but they're changing the suit so

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.569 
video but they're changing the suit so

had had to he changed the suit and that

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.830 
had had to he changed the suit and that
takes<00:04:19.799> time<00:04:19.889> that<00:04:20.430> I<00:04:20.579> mean<00:04:20.760> it<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.180> if<00:04:21.659> his

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
takes time that I mean it and if his

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.320 
takes time that I mean it and if his
vitamin<00:04:22.260> it<00:04:22.380> did<00:04:22.560> was<00:04:22.740> it<00:04:22.770> was<00:04:23.039> like<00:04:23.310> not<00:04:23.970> suit

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
vitamin it did was it was like not suit

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.909 
vitamin it did was it was like not suit
you<00:04:24.630> know<00:04:24.750> but<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.110> did<00:04:25.289> show<00:04:25.560> him<00:04:25.710> you<00:04:25.830> know

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
you know but it did show him you know

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.399 
you know but it did show him you know
making<00:04:26.190> it<00:04:26.460> getting<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.479> sunglasses<00:04:28.080> right

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:28.409 
making it getting the sunglasses right

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.460 
making it getting the sunglasses right
to<00:04:28.530> show<00:04:28.740> that<00:04:28.979> so<00:04:29.520> um<00:04:29.880> I<00:04:30.360> think<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:31.440> that

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
to show that so um I think that that

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.950 
to show that so um I think that that
good<00:04:31.860> askim<00:04:32.190> plays<00:04:32.340> into<00:04:32.639> it<00:04:32.669> to<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.360> more<00:04:33.659> like

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
good askim plays into it to it more like

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.310 
good askim plays into it to it more like
