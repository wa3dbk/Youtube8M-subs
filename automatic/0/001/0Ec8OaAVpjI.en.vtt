just these shelves up and down if you
ever<00:00:34.829> get<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> different<00:00:35.460> system<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.260> here<00:00:37.260> we

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
ever get a different system and here we

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.680 
ever get a different system and here we
have<00:00:37.680> wire<00:00:38.250> management<00:00:38.790> through<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.000> back<00:00:39.210> so

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
have wire management through the back so

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.660 
have wire management through the back so
you<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.840> run<00:00:40.110> your<00:00:40.200> wires<00:00:40.379> cleanly<00:00:43.280> so<00:00:44.280> we

you can run your wires cleanly so we

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.850 
you can run your wires cleanly so we

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
own images I'm not wondering why we are

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.250 
own images I'm not wondering why we are
using<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.120> I'm<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> piece<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.930> fine

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
using here I'm just on a piece of fine

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.010 
using here I'm just on a piece of fine
furniture<00:00:58.530> well<00:00:59.489> there's<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.420> rationale<00:01:00.960> for

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
furniture well there's a rationale for

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.460 
furniture well there's a rationale for
this<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.329> hinges<00:01:03.329> are<00:01:03.510> allowed<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
this and that hinges are allowed the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.219 
this and that hinges are allowed the
door<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.949> easily<00:01:05.339> removed<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:06.780> case<00:01:06.840> we

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
door to be easily removed in case we

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.539 
door to be easily removed in case we
ever<00:01:07.320> need<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.650> adjust<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:09.030> shelf<00:01:09.299> here<00:01:10.549> and

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
ever need to adjust the shelf here and

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.160 
ever need to adjust the shelf here and
you<00:01:11.670> can't<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.150> with<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> normal<00:01:12.540> pot<00:01:12.930> cage

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
you can't do that with a normal pot cage

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:24.060 
you can't do that with a normal pot cage
unless<00:01:13.740> you're<00:01:13.920> screw<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> door

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.120 

and<00:01:25.070> it<00:01:25.340> goes<00:01:25.460> back<00:01:25.730> very<00:01:26.060> easily<00:01:26.950> so<00:01:27.950> I<00:01:27.980> think

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
and it goes back very easily so I think

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.360 
and it goes back very easily so I think
the<00:01:29.470> functionality<00:01:30.470> of<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.680> yeren<00:01:30.950> just<00:01:31.160> far

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
the functionality of the yeren just far

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.370 
the functionality of the yeren just far
outweighs<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.270> aesthetic<00:01:32.720> or<00:01:32.840> traditional

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
outweighs the aesthetic or traditional

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.200 
outweighs the aesthetic or traditional
benefits<00:01:33.560> from<00:01:33.980> our<00:01:34.100> mortise<00:01:34.460> hinge<00:01:34.700> plus
