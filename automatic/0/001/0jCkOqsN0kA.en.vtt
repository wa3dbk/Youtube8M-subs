ever thought about being human once I

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.949 
ever thought about being human once I
was<00:03:37.730> on<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.330> track<00:03:38.600> in<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.410> Andes<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:41.780> a

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
was on the track in the Andes and a

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.430 
was on the track in the Andes and a
hummingbird<00:03:42.340> flew<00:03:43.340> up<00:03:43.490> to<00:03:43.670> me<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:45.260> just

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
hummingbird flew up to me and just

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.620 
hummingbird flew up to me and just
hovered<00:03:45.770> there<00:03:45.800> staring<00:03:46.400> at<00:03:46.520> me<00:03:46.670> it's<00:03:47.150> tiny

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
harmless pattering like machine gun and

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.130 
harmless pattering like machine gun and
I<00:03:53.300> thought<00:03:53.600> what<00:03:53.870> a<00:03:53.900> thing<00:03:55.600> you<00:03:56.600> know<00:03:56.630> to<00:03:56.840> have

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
I thought what a thing you know to have

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.710 
I thought what a thing you know to have
to<00:03:57.200> work<00:03:57.650> that<00:03:57.920> hard<00:03:58.190> every<00:03:58.700> day<00:03:58.880> just<00:03:59.480> to<00:03:59.600> stay

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
to work that hard every day just to stay

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.470 
to work that hard every day just to stay
alive<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:01.310> be<00:04:01.430> constantly<00:04:01.910> on<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.150> verge<00:04:02.180> of

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
alive to be constantly on the verge of

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.180 
alive to be constantly on the verge of
death<00:04:04.540> and<00:04:05.540> how<00:04:05.720> satisfying<00:04:06.410> every<00:04:06.769> day<00:04:06.920> must

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
death and how satisfying every day must

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.380 
death and how satisfying every day must
be<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:07.580> it's<00:04:07.730> rived

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.450 

and<00:04:11.870> that<00:04:12.170> was<00:04:12.320> the<00:04:12.440> only<00:04:12.560> time<00:04:12.890> I<00:04:13.100> thought

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
and that was the only time I thought

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.390 
and that was the only time I thought
about<00:04:13.670> being<00:04:13.880> human
