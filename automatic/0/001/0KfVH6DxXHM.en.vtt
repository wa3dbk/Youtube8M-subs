00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.299
 hi all friends today with you again 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.920
 I am Vladimir and today is special 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.020
 video release for the group in the source and 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.670
 swimming pool and especially for new 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.490
 device users do not seem to be 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.840
 young but new subscribers 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.730
 who on the page of our group ask 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.830
 the same questions therefore gathered in 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.720
 a bunch divided this video issue into three 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.700
 parts and let's consider the most 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.930
 popular and most annoying questions 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.149
 who constantly litter our 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.370
 settembre so the most important if 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.440
 update under android 4 0 no she 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.370
 missing as well as no update 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.809
 on android 2 3 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.129
 the only thing you can do is 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.280
 update on the official 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.719
 firmware from and sonic on android version 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.700
 2.2.2 because in Russia as before 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.320
 there are put with version 2 2 i 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.890
 for example, was the owner of just such 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.780
 tablet 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.399
 if your aboard is updated 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.570
 android i can congratulate you 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.219
 tablet from new revision 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.770
 how are things with custom firmware 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.780
 under our tablet is a separate topic she 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.810
 very big and we basically in 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.590
 the group in the discussions a lot of advice 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.200
 video instructions just text 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.619
 instructions because you can flash our 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.810
 the tablet 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.750
 what firmware can we flash 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.670
 stock version android and in principle 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.950
 you need all the software and links into it 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.290
 Also included in the description of each topic. 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.780
 so in fact, as already understood 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.880
 things are very good if you want 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.770
 get android 4 0 and for example keep 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.180
 someone will be the best option 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.170
 update on custom firmware 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.430
 climbers 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.860
 of the features worth noting 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.420
 porting 4 android applications such 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.340
 like new google music gallery 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.320
 and updated youtube client new 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.180
 boot screen and style locks 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.530
 ice cream sandwich also ported 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.420
 graphical shell i.e. menu 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.670
 appearance and stuff very much 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.140
 trying to be like 4 android my 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.630
 Firmware view solid four 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.760
 especially considering the fact that there is 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.040
 desire to switch to 4 android nude 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.570
 the testicles do well by no means from 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.160
 cons desirable to put the firmware on 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.570
 clean tablet after recovery 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
 factory settings because it is very 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.950
 a lot of memory will occupy embedded 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.420
 fallen applications further if required 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.170
 just stable good quality 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.640
 firmware then your obvious choice is you 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.590
 wbr is the best filing for ours 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.420
 tablet at the moment of the benefits 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.310
 attention is support beats audio 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.900
 high speed all system 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.970
 apps from google updated to 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.040
 latest version and many other buns 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.040
 I'd note that this is my favorite 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.390
 firmware i put a solid top five for 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.670
 those who want to leave their native firmware 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.990
 but at the same time wants to get the most from 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.590
 your tablet is best suited 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.830
 filing 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.570
 Now attention is the name of this and you under 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.420
 7 as it is based on stock 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.400
 firmware version 2.2.2 of course, of course 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.870
 last season except high 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.640
 performance and stability 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.470
 she's nothing new tablet system 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.660
 throw my score 4 minus 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.459
 and the last is flint fire and wedge 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.680
 viewpad 7 1 like 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.600
 I will kill for 7 trying to make a tablet 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.580
 more stable but innovation is extremely 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.890
 little so triple but last 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.350
 represents the usual pigeons under 7 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.510
 absolutely nothing is cut out without anything 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.530
 need software from developer updated 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.510
 google program 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.590
 keyboard other replaced by version 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.239
 android 2 3 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.190
 that is, if you want the area android 2 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.410
 3 then this is your clear choice therefore everything 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.540
 it works very fast smart but it 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.220
 solid minus five for many 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.650
 users will be what the last 2 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.630
 St Russian language not familiar but this 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.440
 is solved with the help of the application more 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.660
 locale 2 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.100
 I set myself custom firmware on 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.910
 the sensor on the screen reacts to my 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.370
 touches 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.110
 what I did wrong is the fact that 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.060
 There are two versions of the tablet or sonic 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.030
 and on 7 and they differ just 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.480
 touch screen one of them is 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.970
 other something older without this one 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.860
 here is the function that is without this 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.239
 screen so here's the main problem 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.390
 is that the driver for 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.220
 touch screens for both versions are different 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.590
 previously there was no opportunity to update 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.390
 second firmware revision for Tablet 7 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.890
 it took some time in the network appeared 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.180
 custom firmware adapted for 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.640
 updated touch screen 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.650
 so before changing the firmware and these and 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.150
 version of the tablet can be on this I 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.980
 three firmware available with support 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.840
 second version of the tablet from apple new age 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.220
 and viewpad 7 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.319
 can support appeared on others 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.430
 firmware but no matter what 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.170
 For forms and groups 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.060
 since the firmware is still being updated 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.150
 and still being refined though passed 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.169
 have there been flash support for three years 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.120
 on in our tablet 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.530
 before you can start flash for this 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.360
 need to install a while file 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.940
 engine ported gifts tiu.ru 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.110
 armv6 download link you can 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.300
 find on the page of our group 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.669
 VKontakte or flash on custom 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.919
 firmware and already flash in principle there in 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.139
 build a system why the camera does not work 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.970
 in skype it should not work because 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.520
 that the tablet processor does not support 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.810
 skype technology for video calling 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.610
 simply not enough power resources 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.979
 to run the relevant services in 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.110
 system then the question is why 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.430
 then as a front camera or 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.229
 strange for video calls 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.400
 just using other apps 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.280
 such as 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.180
 canine video connect and worth noting 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.039
 what is this application from the developers 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.050
 skype and made specifically for 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.850
 devices which usually 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.130
 which usually skype yourself on the tablet 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.680
 phones do not pull so yes you can 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.000
 make calls to skype users 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.500
 so this is the most obvious solution to the problem 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.479
 with non-working skype cameras on our 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.100
 the tablet why spontaneously 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.389
 touch keys work and 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.280
 keyboard opens 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.620
 as already mentioned in the first versions 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.450
 tablet had such a problem then 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.220
 viewsonic began to produce 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.990
 tablets with an updated touch screen 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.190
 and these 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.200
 so someone came across this 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.270
 the problem of someone avoiding with 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.710
 factory marriage and recognize when his sonic 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.539
 You can exchange your tablet 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.260
 then the seller’s store or contact 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.479
 service center 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.950
 but actually the problem is solved more 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.320
 In addition, if your city is missing 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.669
 official service center of the company or 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.380
 did you run out of warranty 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.930
 the store you can live problem 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.710
 there are two possible solutions 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.570
 first easiest 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.490
 this calibrate the tablet sensor and 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.260
 unplug it from figs but in that case 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.419
 problems sooner or later will give about 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.510
 know yourself or decide the system by 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.500
 editing the qwerty file . cale for 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.820
 this will require rights 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.039
 root user 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.630
 but after the problems disappear once and for all 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.090
 detailed instructions also on the pages 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.099
 our group and in principle this is the first 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.039
 half the most popular questions 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.900
 who have already got one and all separate 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:15.330
 thanks to maxim for compiling 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.950
 it's so easy for me 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.070
 need to read all these 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.350
 questions answers 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.570
 and further in the next issue will be such 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.390
 Answers to questions like why fill in with 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.860
 text memory message actually 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.870
 also everything is solved very easily 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.400
 how to connect the keyboard to our 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.000
 tablet and in general what can be to him 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.010
 to plug 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.330
 what movies you can watch on our 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.520
 tablet how to get right 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.200
 superuser and so on and so 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.330
 like, thank you for listening to my 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.100
 nasty voice i changed the microphone 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.450
 I hope this fixed the sound quality 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.810
 now i have a stand all like u 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.370
