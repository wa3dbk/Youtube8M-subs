to the metal sandblasted surface there

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.250 
to the metal sandblasted surface there
is<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> lot<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.210> friction<00:00:48.480> which<00:00:48.809> takes<00:00:49.110> away

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
is a lot of friction which takes away

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.380 
is a lot of friction which takes away
the<00:00:49.440> speed<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.890> precision<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.180> show<00:00:51.329> you

how much friction this has we will see a

the friction this is how the normal
mouse<00:01:03.960> pad<00:01:04.260> does<00:01:05.360> it's<00:01:06.470> pretty<00:01:07.470> smooth<00:01:07.830> but

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
mouse pad does it's pretty smooth but

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.520 
mouse pad does it's pretty smooth but
when<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:09.720> see<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.140> mini<00:01:10.409> metal<00:01:10.680> mousepad<00:01:11.280> it's

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
when we see the mini metal mousepad it's

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.800 
when we see the mini metal mousepad it's
completely<00:01:13.530> not<00:01:14.159> up<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> mark<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.390> just

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
completely not up to the mark it's just

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.620 
completely not up to the mark it's just
has<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.350> much<00:01:16.530> friction<00:01:16.890> about<00:01:17.880> three<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.330> five

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
has so much friction about three to five

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.160 
has so much friction about three to five
times<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:19.200> normal<00:01:20.189> mouse<00:01:20.369> pad<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.049> kind<00:01:22.049> of

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
times a normal mouse pad and kind of

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.530 
times a normal mouse pad and kind of
annoying<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.009> want<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.310> use<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:23.939> also

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
annoying if you want to use it and also

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.710 
annoying if you want to use it and also
has<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> hissing<00:01:25.229> sound<00:01:26.090> due<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> friction

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
has a hissing sound due to the friction

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.770 
has a hissing sound due to the friction
it<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.770> suggested<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.310> use<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.850> only<00:01:30.420> if<00:01:30.630> you

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780

in<00:01:49.259> my<00:01:49.680> case<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.159> could<00:01:50.369> not<00:01:50.490> use<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.880> mouse

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
in my case I could not use this mouse

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.420 
in my case I could not use this mouse
pad<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.079> checked<00:01:52.470> whether<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.770> could<00:01:52.920> get<00:01:53.250> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
pad so I checked whether I could get the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.670 
pad so I checked whether I could get the
me<00:01:53.610> extended<00:01:54.390> mouse<00:01:54.570> pad<00:01:54.840> instead<00:01:55.290> which<00:01:55.649> is

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
me extended mouse pad instead which is

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.069 
me extended mouse pad instead which is
made<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.130> rubber<00:01:56.399> but<00:01:57.240> was<00:01:57.450> not<00:01:57.630> able<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.899> get
