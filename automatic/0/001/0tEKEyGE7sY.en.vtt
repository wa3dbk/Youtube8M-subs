00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:10.179
 4 You know, this is the Galaxy S6 Gold Platinum. 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:16.100
 I bought it myself 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:18.160
 It's the first smartphone to have a review. 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.160
 l 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:29.950
 As you know, in the case of gold platinum, 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.950
 I would have seen you do that while I was in a lot of color . 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.500
 When I was preparing the opening video 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:49.199
 The industry has fallen out of the component. 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.370
 The team that was able to take the wisdom slot out of here was always in that doctor. 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.440
 That part is 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.440
 I hope you'll do it. 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:12.610
 Now go out with Galaxy s cho and get the initial setup 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:17.229
 That's how it looks. 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:21.940
 All the others are crossed , and now the fingerprint is narrowed once. 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:27.670
 Bwatneundeyo dealt with in detail you see the word of shares 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:31.990
 It 's not like the chef that was on the Galaxy S wash, 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:36.280
 If jigiman area has done the same way Burdock's 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:41.380
 Raise awareness and raise it until the end 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:46.740
 Signs I 'd like to be able to recognize that way today . And likewise. 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.740
 I need to process the fingertip immediately. 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.510
 And lastly, I did not know that I was supposed to have a secondary and a password. 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:59.130
 When you are done, open the lock with the fingerprint 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:02.060
 You've seen the option to swing, and you've seen the question open at once. 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.620
 Let's see it again. 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.830
 Yes, just let it go and you'll hear your smartphone lock open. 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.830
 Have been 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:18.180
 Yes , you can register up to 4 questions. 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:20.160
 And now the screen you see is one of those ways of using the edge screen. 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.080
 People is in lg mode 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:30.060
 Dragging that part in the middle of the center will not work 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:34.170
 Drag to the upper right corner to enter the PRESET mode 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.040
 I tried opening the hastily prepared images see you again find the next piece off here. 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.040
 Thank you.
