create<00:00:30.820> talk<00:00:31.810> to<00:00:31.990> me<00:00:32.110> about<00:00:32.230> the<00:00:32.560> units<00:00:32.980> and<00:00:33.160> I

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
create talk to me about the units and I

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.160 
create talk to me about the units and I
also<00:00:33.460> have<00:00:33.670> been<00:00:33.760> checking<00:00:34.030> some<00:00:34.480> internet

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
also have been checking some internet

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.080 
also have been checking some internet
sites<00:00:35.500> and<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.930> new<00:00:38.260> device<00:00:38.680> is<00:00:39.340> basically

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
sites and this new device is basically

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.360 
sites and this new device is basically
an<00:00:40.480> upgrade<00:00:40.930> we're<00:00:41.920> on<00:00:42.400> the<00:00:42.610> trova<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:45.040> whole

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
an upgrade we're on the trova this whole

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.350 
an upgrade we're on the trova this whole
top<00:00:45.880> unit<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:47.680> replaced<00:00:48.190> with<00:00:48.550> the<00:00:48.700> AI<00:00:48.730> pilot

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
top unit you replaced with the AI pilot

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.190 
top unit you replaced with the AI pilot
so<00:00:49.629> if<00:00:50.440> you<00:00:50.710> have<00:00:50.920> an<00:00:51.100> older<00:00:51.400> kirova<00:00:52.300> or<00:00:52.720> I

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
so if you have an older kirova or I

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.690 
so if you have an older kirova or I
believe<00:00:53.379> there's<00:00:53.680> another<00:00:53.800> MinnKota<00:00:54.370> that

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
believe there's another MinnKota that

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.380 
believe there's another MinnKota that
you<00:00:54.820> can<00:00:55.030> upgrade<00:00:55.989> also<00:00:56.500> you<00:00:57.460> basically<00:00:58.030> take

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
you can upgrade also you basically take

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.250 
you can upgrade also you basically take
this<00:00:58.690> cover<00:00:59.110> off<00:00:59.500> of<00:01:00.220> your<00:01:00.430> unit<00:01:00.879> pull<00:01:01.840> out<00:01:02.050> the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
this cover off of your unit pull out the

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.430 
this cover off of your unit pull out the
auto<00:01:02.409> pilot<00:01:02.739> part<00:01:03.460> of<00:01:03.640> it<00:01:03.760> and<00:01:04.000> then<00:01:04.120> just

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
auto pilot part of it and then just

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.740 
auto pilot part of it and then just
unplug<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.620> power<00:01:05.860> and<00:01:06.250> put<00:01:07.060> this<00:01:07.210> new<00:01:07.450> cover

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
unplug the power and put this new cover

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.370 
unplug the power and put this new cover
on<00:01:07.990> after<00:01:08.530> powering<00:01:08.980> up<00:01:09.220> and<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.900> controller

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
on after powering up and the controller

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.710 
on after powering up and the controller
is<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:13.000> new<00:01:13.510> small<00:01:14.370> controlling<00:01:15.720> device

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
is this new small controlling device

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.090 
is this new small controlling device
that<00:01:17.200> controls<00:01:18.120> speed<00:01:19.120> and<00:01:19.860> hopefully<00:01:20.860> in<00:01:20.979> a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
that controls speed and hopefully in a

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.040 
that controls speed and hopefully in a
in<00:01:21.610> another<00:01:21.909> video<00:01:22.240> we<00:01:22.420> can<00:01:22.570> talk<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:22.810> little

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
in another video we can talk a little

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.770 
in another video we can talk a little
bit<00:01:23.260> more<00:01:23.470> about<00:01:23.800> it<00:01:24.010> but<00:01:24.220> it<00:01:25.030> controls<00:01:25.510> the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
bit more about it but it controls the

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.340 
bit more about it but it controls the
speed<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:27.340> your<00:01:27.400> unit<00:01:28.000> but<00:01:28.210> also<00:01:28.240> it<00:01:29.049> has<00:01:29.320> a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
speed of your unit but also it has a

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.850 
speed of your unit but also it has a
built<00:01:29.710> in<00:01:29.920> GPS<00:01:30.250> and<00:01:31.240> so<00:01:32.229> what<00:01:32.380> that'll<00:01:32.710> will

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
built in GPS and so what that'll will

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.420 
built in GPS and so what that'll will
allow<00:01:33.100> you<00:01:33.159> to<00:01:33.460> do<00:01:33.610> is<00:01:33.790> to<00:01:33.970> set<00:01:34.180> a<00:01:34.210> course<00:01:34.630> and

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
allow you to do is to set a course and

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.110 
allow you to do is to set a course and
the<00:01:36.430> AI<00:01:37.140> pilot<00:01:38.140> will<00:01:38.620> follow<00:01:39.160> that<00:01:39.490> course<00:01:39.820> for

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
the AI pilot will follow that course for

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.880 
the AI pilot will follow that course for
you<00:01:40.300> and<00:01:40.390> they<00:01:40.450> will<00:01:40.510> correct<00:01:40.750> for<00:01:41.230> wind<00:01:41.500> and

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
you and they will correct for wind and

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.210 
you and they will correct for wind and
ways<00:01:42.660> and<00:01:43.660> I<00:01:43.810> also<00:01:43.990> understand<00:01:44.740> that<00:01:45.010> you<00:01:45.310> can

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
ways and I also understand that you can

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
saved in this unit you can now save up

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.390 
saved in this unit you can now save up
to<00:01:51.090> three<00:01:51.509> tracks<00:01:52.009> so<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.130> if<00:01:53.250> you're
