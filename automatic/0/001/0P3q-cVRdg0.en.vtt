beer so I wonder if that has to do with

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.549 
beer so I wonder if that has to do with
the<00:00:52.649> east<00:00:52.920> which<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.430> 37<00:00:54.239> 87<00:00:55.140> why<00:00:55.289> East

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the east which is 37 87 why East

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.110 
the east which is 37 87 why East
trapezoid<00:00:56.129> gravity<00:00:57.680> I<00:00:58.680> think<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.850> get<00:01:00.090> a

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
trapezoid gravity I think I do get a

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.770 
trapezoid gravity I think I do get a
little<00:01:00.270> bit<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:01.820> indescribable<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.210> Belgian

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
little bit of a indescribable a Belgian

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.620 
little bit of a indescribable a Belgian

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
character off the nose it's kind of a

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.010 
character off the nose it's kind of a
sweetness

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
and when I had this beer the other night

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.240 
and when I had this beer the other night
I<00:01:15.829> realized<00:01:16.829> it<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.549> clean<00:01:17.820> beer<00:01:19.250> well

I did them years ago and then I don't

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:36.830 
I did them years ago and then I don't
know<00:01:34.740> if<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.039> saw<00:01:35.310> benefited<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.659> kind

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
know if I saw benefited so I just kind

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.429 
know if I saw benefited so I just kind
of<00:01:36.899> stopped<00:01:37.320> doing<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.850> beer<00:01:39.119> has<00:01:39.439> ten

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
of stopped doing a but this beer has ten

oz<00:01:47.840> ten<00:01:48.840> minutes<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.440> think<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.860> says<00:01:50.810> gravity

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
oz ten minutes I think it says gravity

oz ten minutes I think it says gravity
was<00:01:51.990> 10:57<00:01:52.950> down<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.250> 1010<00:01:53.700> he<00:01:53.909> says<00:01:54.149> it's<00:01:54.330> like

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
was 10:57 down to 1010 he says it's like

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.660 
was 10:57 down to 1010 he says it's like
six<00:01:54.860> percent<00:01:55.860> alcohol<00:01:57.350> I<00:01:58.399> think<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.490> might

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
six percent alcohol I think you might

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.219 
six percent alcohol I think you might
have<00:01:59.700> had<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.090> fermentation<00:02:00.450> temperature<00:02:00.840> in

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
have had the fermentation temperature in

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.889 
have had the fermentation temperature in
here<00:02:01.350> I'm<00:02:01.440> not<00:02:01.970> seeing<00:02:02.970> it<00:02:03.119> right<00:02:03.270> now<00:02:03.420> but<00:02:03.659> I

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
here I'm not seeing it right now but I

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.370 
here I'm not seeing it right now but I
think<00:02:04.020> he<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.890> think<00:02:05.100> we<00:02:05.509> ambient<00:02:06.509> temp<00:02:06.720> sixty

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
think he I think we ambient temp sixty

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.009 
think he I think we ambient temp sixty
that<00:02:07.860> was<00:02:08.039> actually<00:02:08.580> start<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.819> starter<00:02:09.209> any

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
that was actually start the starter any

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.199 
that was actually start the starter any
right<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:11.039> if<00:02:11.370> you've<00:02:11.519> made<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.760> Potter's

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
right it's if you've made a Potter's

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.360 
right it's if you've made a Potter's
beer<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.840> made<00:02:13.049> this<00:02:13.290> type<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.560> recipe<00:02:14.160> I

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
beer and you made this type of recipe I

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.710 
beer and you made this type of recipe I
know<00:02:14.519> it's<00:02:14.790> typically<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.239> little<00:02:15.360> bit<00:02:15.569> lower

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
know it's typically a little bit lower

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.180 
know it's typically a little bit lower
in<00:02:15.810> gravity<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.290> started<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.709> make<00:02:16.890> mine<00:02:17.160> a

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
in gravity I started to make mine a

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.860 
in gravity I started to make mine a
little<00:02:17.579> bit<00:02:17.730> more<00:02:17.880> like<00:02:18.060> ten<00:02:18.239> fifty<00:02:18.600> instead

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
little bit more like ten fifty instead

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.620 
little bit more like ten fifty instead
of<00:02:18.989> like<00:02:19.140> ten<00:02:19.320> forty<00:02:19.709> what<00:02:20.609> you<00:02:20.760> can<00:02:21.000> make<00:02:21.480> it

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
of like ten forty what you can make it

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.270 
of like ten forty what you can make it
and<00:02:21.780> then<00:02:21.840> just<00:02:22.049> have<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.230> be<00:02:22.440> for<00:02:22.799> four<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.250> a

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
and then just have it be for four and a

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.750 
and then just have it be for four and a
half<00:02:23.310> percent<00:02:23.549> or<00:02:23.940> something<00:02:24.090> like<00:02:24.239> that

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.050 

it's<00:02:30.420> just<00:02:30.840> um<00:02:31.340> was<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.370> tiny<00:02:32.640> bit<00:02:32.849> of<00:02:32.970> hot

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
it's just um was a tiny bit of hot

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.429 
it's just um was a tiny bit of hot
bitterness<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.840> get<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:33.989> little<00:02:34.230> bit<00:02:34.290> of

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
bitterness you get a little bit of

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.550 
bitterness you get a little bit of
bitterness<00:02:34.650> from<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.040> yeast<00:02:35.870> not<00:02:36.870> excessive

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
bitterness from the yeast not excessive

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.890 
bitterness from the yeast not excessive
of<00:02:37.650> course<00:02:37.920> but<00:02:38.159> up<00:02:38.370> otherwise<00:02:39.269> it's<00:02:39.420> just

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
of course but up otherwise it's just

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.229 
of course but up otherwise it's just
sort<00:02:40.049> of<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.200> clean<00:02:40.819> Belgian<00:02:41.819> pilsner<00:02:42.180> malt

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
sort of a clean Belgian pilsner malt

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.750 
sort of a clean Belgian pilsner malt
it's<00:02:42.629> actually<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.959> little<00:02:43.140> bit<00:02:43.439> dry<00:02:44.129> I<00:02:44.159> wonder

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
it's actually a little bit dry I wonder

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.680 
it's actually a little bit dry I wonder
if<00:02:44.909> using<00:02:45.299> I<00:02:45.540> might<00:02:46.319> have<00:02:46.530> sometimes<00:02:47.010> used

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
if using I might have sometimes used

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.850 
if using I might have sometimes used
domestic<00:02:48.690> pilsner<00:02:49.079> malt<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.470> wonder<00:02:49.769> if

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
domestic pilsner malt I wonder if

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.710 
domestic pilsner malt I wonder if
there's<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.129> difference<00:02:50.519> when<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.239> use<00:02:51.269> like

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
there's the difference when you use like

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.539 
there's the difference when you use like
the<00:02:51.900> Dingmans<00:02:52.319> if<00:02:52.950> that's<00:02:53.159> what<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.340> use<00:02:53.519> for

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
the Dingmans if that's what you use for

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.699 
the Dingmans if that's what you use for
Belgian<00:02:54.120> pills<00:02:54.360> if<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.989> gets<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.230> little<00:02:55.470> drier

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
Belgian pills if it gets a little drier

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.280 
Belgian pills if it gets a little drier
somehow<00:02:56.159> in<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.459> US<00:02:56.790> maybe<00:02:57.090> there's<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:58.019> little

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
somehow in the US maybe there's a little

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.110 
somehow in the US maybe there's a little
sweeter<00:03:01.159> could<00:03:02.159> also<00:03:02.280> have<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.579> do<00:03:02.700> with<00:03:02.879> them

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
sweeter could also have to do with them

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
up made it more amenable but as I told

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.160 
up made it more amenable but as I told
him<00:03:13.139> in<00:03:13.230> an<00:03:13.319> email<00:03:13.470> this<00:03:13.769> is<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:13.950> very<00:03:14.190> nice<00:03:14.370> beer

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
him in an email this is a very nice beer

him in an email this is a very nice beer
very<00:03:16.170> clear<00:03:16.530> he<00:03:17.069> bottle<00:03:17.819> conditioned<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.299> so<00:03:18.420> I

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
very clear he bottle conditioned it so I

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.119 
very clear he bottle conditioned it so I
left<00:03:18.980> some<00:03:19.980> of<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.159> in<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.870> bottle<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.349> great

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
left some of it in the bottle so great

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.940 
left some of it in the bottle so great
job<00:03:23.370> on<00:03:23.609> that<00:03:23.639> one<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:25.260> tastes<00:03:25.560> just<00:03:25.620> like<00:03:25.829> a

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
job on that one it tastes just like a

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.490

be<00:03:42.870> told<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:43.470> sounds<00:03:43.949> like<00:03:44.480> it<00:03:45.480> would<00:03:45.720> probably

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
be told it sounds like it would probably

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.150 
be told it sounds like it would probably
benefit<00:03:46.500> from<00:03:46.799> some<00:03:47.160> aging<00:03:47.879> but<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:50.040> know

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
benefit from some aging but you know

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.220 
benefit from some aging but you know
just<00:03:50.459> because<00:03:50.730> I<00:03:50.790> have<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.359> one<00:03:51.510> bottle<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.169> I

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
just because I have the one bottle and I

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.869 
just because I have the one bottle and I
have<00:03:52.379> this<00:03:52.500> crappy<00:03:53.430> corkscrew<00:03:55.669> I'll<00:03:56.669> edit

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
have this crappy corkscrew I'll edit

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:02.260 
have this crappy corkscrew I'll edit
this<00:03:57.150> back<00:03:57.510> in<00:03:57.720> when<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:57.900> get<00:03:58.109> it<00:03:58.199> open

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.030 

whoo<00:04:02.930> I<00:04:04.570> almost<00:04:05.570> did<00:04:05.900> not<00:04:06.050> get<00:04:06.290> that<00:04:06.470> this<00:04:06.890> is<00:04:07.010> a

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
whoo I almost did not get that this is a

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.690 
whoo I almost did not get that this is a
crappy<00:04:07.540> it's<00:04:08.540> bent<00:04:08.840> it<00:04:09.680> does<00:04:10.190> not<00:04:10.340> help<00:04:10.550> me

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
crappy it's bent it does not help me

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.750 
crappy it's bent it does not help me
anyway<00:04:11.410> sounded<00:04:12.410> like<00:04:12.560> it<00:04:12.980> may<00:04:13.250> be<00:04:13.280> even

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
anyway sounded like it may be even

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.800 
anyway sounded like it may be even
better<00:04:14.120> to<00:04:14.390> gauge<00:04:14.810> this<00:04:15.110> longer<00:04:15.530> but<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.970> just

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
better to gauge this longer but I just

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.750 
better to gauge this longer but I just
have<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.110> one<00:04:18.560> bottle<00:04:18.920> and<00:04:19.160> I<00:04:19.340> just<00:04:19.610> thought<00:04:19.700> I

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
have the one bottle and I just thought I

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.580 
have the one bottle and I just thought I
would<00:04:20.030> do<00:04:20.180> my<00:04:20.330> initial<00:04:20.660> comments<00:04:21.050> now<00:04:21.200> if<00:04:21.440> I

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
would do my initial comments now if I

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.280 
would do my initial comments now if I
meet<00:04:22.580> up<00:04:22.610> with<00:04:22.880> them<00:04:23.030> in<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.210> year<00:04:23.480> and<00:04:23.660> he<00:04:23.780> has

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
meet up with them in a year and he has

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.290 
meet up with them in a year and he has
some<00:04:24.530> more<00:04:24.740> maybe<00:04:25.370> I'll<00:04:25.580> get<00:04:25.730> another<00:04:25.790> sample

getting hit with that a lot right now it
is<00:05:29.990> kind<00:05:30.230> of<00:05:30.320> just<00:05:30.590> out<00:05:31.100> of<00:05:31.130> the<00:05:31.340> fridge

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.500 

my<00:05:36.410> personal<00:05:37.010> opinion<00:05:37.430> is<00:05:37.580> I<00:05:37.730> like<00:05:38.120> my<00:05:38.330> meat

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.140 
my personal opinion is I like my meat
somewhat<00:05:39.350> sweet<00:05:39.530> a<00:05:39.950> little<00:05:40.610> bit<00:05:40.730> sweeter

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
somewhat sweet a little bit sweeter

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.000 
somewhat sweet a little bit sweeter
maybe<00:05:41.870> then<00:05:42.140> um<00:05:42.380> some<00:05:43.280> people<00:05:43.600> so<00:05:44.600> I<00:05:45.010> would

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
maybe then um some people so I would

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.100 
maybe then um some people so I would
like<00:05:46.160> this<00:05:46.370> to<00:05:46.520> be<00:05:46.550> a<00:05:46.640> tiny<00:05:47.000> bit<00:05:47.150> sweeter<00:05:47.540> but

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
like this to be a tiny bit sweeter but

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.600 
like this to be a tiny bit sweeter but
that<00:05:48.470> could<00:05:48.740> just<00:05:48.980> be<00:05:49.040> a<00:05:49.130> preference

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
that could just be a preference

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.190 
that could just be a preference
otherwise<00:05:50.090> I<00:05:50.150> really<00:05:50.570> like<00:05:50.870> the<00:05:50.990> fruit

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
otherwise I really like the fruit

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.100 
otherwise I really like the fruit
character<00:05:51.410> 12<00:05:51.860> pounds<00:05:52.310> I<00:05:52.460> assume<00:05:53.360> that<00:05:53.390> was<00:05:53.600> 5

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
character 12 pounds I assume that was 5

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.180 
character 12 pounds I assume that was 5
gallons<00:05:54.680> so<00:05:55.160> 12<00:05:55.490> pounds<00:05:55.940> is<00:05:56.440> is<00:05:57.440> alright<00:05:57.980> I

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
gallons so 12 pounds is is alright I

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.640 
gallons so 12 pounds is is alright I
guess<00:05:58.430> that's<00:05:58.670> you<00:05:59.540> know<00:05:59.660> about<00:05:59.900> round<00:06:00.260> 2

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
guess that's you know about round 2

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.390 
guess that's you know about round 2
pounds<00:06:01.040> per<00:06:01.240> gallon<00:06:02.240> which<00:06:02.450> is<00:06:02.620> a<00:06:03.620> pretty<00:06:04.250> good

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
pounds per gallon which is a pretty good

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.560 
pounds per gallon which is a pretty good
ratio<00:06:04.580> I<00:06:05.060> know<00:06:05.180> you<00:06:05.420> can<00:06:05.690> use<00:06:05.840> more<00:06:06.140> coarse

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
ratio I know you can use more coarse

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.159 
ratio I know you can use more coarse
like<00:06:08.570> the<00:06:08.840> if<00:06:09.590> you're<00:06:09.800> gonna<00:06:09.920> be<00:06:10.160> a

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.800

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:39.229 
you get the tart cherry on the nose and

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:40.060 
you get the tart cherry on the nose and
in<00:06:39.380> the<00:06:39.470> flavor

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
in the flavor

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.060 
in the flavor
my<00:06:40.880> only<00:06:41.090> thing<00:06:41.300> is<00:06:41.360> this<00:06:42.080> is<00:06:42.139> my<00:06:42.380> own<00:06:42.590> meat<00:06:42.830> and

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.070 
my only thing is this is my own meat and

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.980 
my only thing is this is my own meat and

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
I was tasting it before packaging I

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.749 
I was tasting it before packaging I
would<00:06:45.110> probably<00:06:45.440> back<00:06:46.039> sweeten<00:06:46.460> it<00:06:46.490> a<00:06:46.580> little

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 
would probably back sweeten it a little

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:48.580 
would probably back sweeten it a little
bit<00:06:46.880> more<00:06:47.060> at<00:06:48.020> this<00:06:48.169> point<00:06:48.410> you've<00:06:48.560> probably

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
bit more at this point you've probably

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.129 
bit more at this point you've probably
maxed<00:06:49.220> out<00:06:49.340> the<00:06:49.610> alcohol<00:06:50.330> tolerance<00:06:50.690> of<00:06:51.050> the

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:51.139 
maxed out the alcohol tolerance of the

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:53.740 
maxed out the alcohol tolerance of the
yeast<00:06:51.380> which<00:06:51.800> this<00:06:52.009> strain<00:06:52.669> is<00:06:52.880> like<00:06:53.000> 14<00:06:53.539> to<00:06:53.630> 15

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
yeast which this strain is like 14 to 15

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.920 
yeast which this strain is like 14 to 15
percent<00:06:54.289> so<00:06:54.919> it<00:06:55.639> shouldn't<00:06:55.970> ferment<00:06:56.449> any<00:06:56.720> more

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
percent so it shouldn't ferment any more

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.360 
percent so it shouldn't ferment any more
honey<00:06:57.139> and<00:06:57.380> that's<00:06:57.500> kind<00:06:57.710> of<00:06:57.770> how<00:06:57.889> I<00:06:57.919> make<00:06:58.250> them

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
honey and that's kind of how I make them

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.390 
honey and that's kind of how I make them
so<00:06:58.580> I<00:06:58.610> kind<00:06:59.000> of<00:06:59.060> max<00:06:59.300> out<00:06:59.479> the<00:06:59.660> yeast<00:07:00.400> tolerance

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 
so I kind of max out the yeast tolerance

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.890 
so I kind of max out the yeast tolerance
alcohol<00:07:02.090> tolerance<00:07:02.270> and<00:07:02.570> then<00:07:02.660> just<00:07:02.810> keep

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900 
alcohol tolerance and then just keep

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.629 
alcohol tolerance and then just keep
sweetening<00:07:03.380> it<00:07:03.470> I<00:07:03.710> like<00:07:04.009> the<00:07:04.039> taste<00:07:04.340> of<00:07:04.520> it<00:07:04.610> and

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 
sweetening it I like the taste of it and

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:06.610 
sweetening it I like the taste of it and
then<00:07:04.880> I<00:07:05.030> bottle<00:07:05.449> it<00:07:05.660> and<00:07:05.870> I<00:07:05.990> bought<00:07:06.169> what<00:07:06.380> still

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620 
then I bottle it and I bought what still

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.909 
then I bottle it and I bought what still
also<00:07:07.250> like<00:07:07.699> this<00:07:07.940> so<00:07:08.720> I<00:07:09.050> will<00:07:09.169> have<00:07:09.530> maybe<00:07:09.800> a

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 
also like this so I will have maybe a

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:10.870 
also like this so I will have maybe a
little<00:07:10.130> bit<00:07:10.220> more<00:07:10.370> of<00:07:10.460> this<00:07:10.550> and<00:07:10.789> then

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 
little bit more of this and then

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.279 
little bit more of this and then
probably<00:07:11.060> put<00:07:11.300> the<00:07:11.389> cork<00:07:11.630> in<00:07:11.750> and<00:07:11.930> put<00:07:12.080> it<00:07:12.169> back

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:12.289 
probably put the cork in and put it back

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:14.320 
probably put the cork in and put it back
in<00:07:12.440> the<00:07:12.530> fridge<00:07:12.710> and<00:07:12.949> have<00:07:13.070> it<00:07:13.250> another<00:07:14.060> time

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.330 
in the fridge and have it another time

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.290 
in the fridge and have it another time
and<00:07:14.630> finish<00:07:14.990> this<00:07:15.169> beer<00:07:15.530> but<00:07:16.220> excellent<00:07:16.970> work

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.300 
and finish this beer but excellent work

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.260 
and finish this beer but excellent work
