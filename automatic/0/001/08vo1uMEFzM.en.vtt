differences between these two helmets
and<00:00:16.199> tell<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.560> specs<00:00:17.280> on<00:00:17.490> them<00:00:17.690> I'm<00:00:18.690> going

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
and tell you the specs on them I'm going

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.120 
and tell you the specs on them I'm going
to<00:00:18.900> start<00:00:19.080> off<00:00:19.199> with<00:00:19.230> with<00:00:19.650> what<00:00:19.830> these<00:00:19.949> two

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
to start off with with what these two

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.860 
to start off with with what these two
helmets<00:00:20.340> have<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:20.700> common<00:00:21.060> which<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.330> almost

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:21.870 
helmets have in common which is almost

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.920 
helmets have in common which is almost
everything<00:00:22.730> they<00:00:23.730> both<00:00:23.940> have<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.600> bolt

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
everything they both have the in bolt

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.650 
everything they both have the in bolt
design<00:00:25.290> which<00:00:25.620> means<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:27.030> foam<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.600> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
design which means that the foam and the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.480 
design which means that the foam and the
outer<00:00:27.810> shell<00:00:27.900> are<00:00:28.350> one-piece<00:00:28.830> they're<00:00:29.190> molded

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
outer shell are one-piece they're molded

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.940 
outer shell are one-piece they're molded
together<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:30.960> that's<00:00:31.200> designed<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.680> keep<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
together and that's designed to keep the

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.310 
together and that's designed to keep the
weight<00:00:32.099> down<00:00:32.279> on<00:00:32.340> these<00:00:32.579> helmets<00:00:33.140> both<00:00:34.140> these

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
weight down on these helmets both these

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.290 
weight down on these helmets both these
helmets<00:00:34.620> weigh<00:00:34.770> 13<00:00:35.160> ounces<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:36.030> there's<00:00:36.180> no

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
helmets weigh 13 ounces so there's no

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.529 
helmets weigh 13 ounces so there's no
difference<00:00:36.449> in<00:00:36.809> weight<00:00:37.019> in<00:00:37.289> these<00:00:37.589> two<00:00:38.539> they

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:39.539 
difference in weight in these two they

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.569 
difference in weight in these two they
both<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:40.460> 16<00:00:41.460> ventilation<00:00:41.999> holes<00:00:42.179> on<00:00:42.390> them

so<00:01:10.290> if<00:01:10.350> you're<00:01:10.380> riding<00:01:10.650> your<00:01:10.740> bike<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.100> want

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
so if you're riding your bike you want

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.070 
so if you're riding your bike you want
to<00:01:11.340> loosen<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.610> or<00:01:11.730> tighten<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:12.090> super<00:01:13.050> easy

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
to loosen it or tighten it super easy

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.500 
to loosen it or tighten it super easy
really<00:01:13.650> comfortable<00:01:14.250> you'll<00:01:15.120> get<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> nice

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
really comfortable you'll get a nice

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.580 
really comfortable you'll get a nice
snug<00:01:15.750> fit<00:01:15.900> with<00:01:16.380> both<00:01:16.620> of<00:01:16.800> these<00:01:16.920> helmets<00:01:18.590> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
snug fit with both of these helmets the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.100 
snug fit with both of these helmets the
outer<00:01:19.770> shell<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.310> both<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.640> these<00:01:20.730> is<00:01:21.120> what

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
outer shell on both of these is what

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.350 
outer shell on both of these is what
they<00:01:22.230> call<00:01:22.470> their<00:01:22.680> aramid<00:01:23.280> filament<00:01:23.760> system

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
they call their aramid filament system

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.110 
they call their aramid filament system
it's<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.530> bunch<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.190> small<00:01:26.460> fibers<00:01:26.910> and

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
it's just a bunch of small fibers and

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.180 
it's just a bunch of small fibers and
that<00:01:28.050> comes<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.530> our<00:01:28.620> first<00:01:28.830> difference

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
that comes to our first difference

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.960 
that comes to our first difference
between<00:01:29.460> these<00:01:29.580> two<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.930> Trebek<00:01:31.230> race

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
between these two on the Trebek race

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.340 
between these two on the Trebek race
they've<00:01:32.970> added<00:01:33.360> some<00:01:34.050> extra<00:01:36.350> aramid

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
they've added some extra aramid

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.400 
they've added some extra aramid
reinforcements<00:01:38.010> on<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:39.140> as<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.320> see

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
reinforcements on it and as you can see

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.190 
reinforcements on it and as you can see
right<00:01:40.770> here<00:01:40.800> you'll<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.610> little<00:01:42.200> circle

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
right here you'll have a little circle

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.780 
right here you'll have a little circle
here<00:01:43.530> which<00:01:43.560> allows<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.010> to<00:01:44.100> see<00:01:44.280> those<00:01:44.460> those

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
here which allows you to see those those

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.330 
here which allows you to see those those
aramid<00:01:45.240> fibers<00:01:45.660> and<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.650> one<00:01:46.770> has<00:01:46.890> extra

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
aramid fibers and so that one has extra

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.130 
aramid fibers and so that one has extra
to<00:01:47.760> give<00:01:47.910> you<00:01:47.970> extra<00:01:48.240> protection<00:01:48.360> for<00:01:49.080> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
to give you extra protection for the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.200 
to give you extra protection for the
bigger<00:01:49.350> crashes<00:01:49.800> that<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.010> might<00:01:50.160> have<00:01:50.340> this

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
bigger crashes that you might have this

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.090 
bigger crashes that you might have this
one<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.510> doesn't<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.230> quite<00:01:52.410> as<00:01:52.530> much<00:01:52.950> of

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
one just doesn't have quite as much of

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.050 
one just doesn't have quite as much of
those<00:01:53.190> aramid<00:01:53.550> fibers<00:01:53.910> in<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:55.130> um<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.880> big

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
those aramid fibers in it um and the big

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.450 
those aramid fibers in it um and the big
difference<00:01:57.240> between<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.950> Trebek<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460
