00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:12.780
 Hi 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:20.570
 When you treat a person like this , 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:26.440
 As long as we get serious about this and want to get lots of thinking, so one company 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:31.450
 When I'm around, I have a part-time job . I have a cold. 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:36.550
 I just bought it for nothing . 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:41.470
 Well, the reaction around you was bad, so you're in a good mood. 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:47.379
 Only it's good if you're so anhaneun teeth because we need 5 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:51.220
 I was talking about it right so I can have someone with me, and what 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:56.100
 I think I might be able to do it too . 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:01:02.309
 I've been going around a lot like that for a while, for example. 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:05.670
 I am a weak woman. When I try to see a big water bottle like this 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.420
 I do not want to talk to for help are right that I do that first, 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.950
 I did it because I thought I would eat a man's bush . 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:19.830
 Low preface prefer to whom this city after rumors that 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.390
 I ve no interest in the former So So much angry bear 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.720
 I can not stand it 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:32.100
 That haeteotgo much anger and that I now once again a personality that 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.600
 When the big upset me was not good again, so the restoration of relations 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.369
 So far 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:42.360
 Eotneunde these things ambient common reaction whenever it is nice yigana 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:46.470
 You believe in people so well that you can not overflow people . 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:50.549
 South anneunya not Make as much as you tell that person that 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.149
 Then I do not see my prayer in my hand and I do not see it in my hands. 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:58.289
 I've talked a lot about this sort of thing, 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.740
 I do not know because at least I was not really treating people personally 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:07.409
 I have not been able to accept it until now. 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.820
 As you say, there are two eyes in the low position, and they have two eyes and the same 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.700
 He's a person. 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:16.109
 Those people who evaluate me differently 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:22.590
 I control the people so it should not have to, nor understand section keeps 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:25.680
 I think I have a lot of social life, and I'm a lot of people 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:31.380
 There seems to be a little bit of a hiccup. 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:36.100
 As the monk said, ceremonial ceremony may be, but in real life 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:39.640
 Because there are so many problems that can not be solved just by feeling Carma 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.060
 Oh, well, I'm frustrated and I need some advice. 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.060
 So 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:52.030
 Example of self-praise from others 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:57.069
 This is not a problem. 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:03.020
 It helped the woman to move the bucket to her side. 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:06.020
 So when people eat and eat, 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:12.020
 Why get moth-eaten pork that ah, I do not know. 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:17.480
 I'm doing a good thing to eat what what why such pottery that five people so 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:20.560
 Some like it dead in the dirt that did not understand me ah remaining hearts 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.560
 Interference . 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:29.340
 I rattling eat because meteors two buckets Ago 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:34.300
 I think it 's natural to help out sources beyond that. 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:39.880
 The inde beyond that he skipped two days you have to write you later aesthetics 9:00 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:45.040
 Our men to pocket exchanging and oysters you'll have no idea you were involved 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:49.120
 What's next, what he thinks he can do. 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.400
 But as to why those people are 12 of my actions, I the man 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.590
 Act 12 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:59.820
 He must see the light Why he looks so in November it is a year. 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.820
 You can see that. 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:06.750
 Some people do this Blondes 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:10.950
 I mean, he's a little different. 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.180
 Minor geolro cup in November Examples I also picked up the meat not coming to visit 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.330
 I eat a little 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:20.790
 This is how you take drugs on purpose . 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:25.590
 So more than be just what the tires are not so detached that's what Le 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:29.460
 If you do so because it is not the center to be ah and then there 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:35.340
 I do not like to eat. Try it. You can say this once. 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:39.600
 Oh, your body is not thin for now, but you're a little slim right now. 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.780
 I can think of myself as a man or something like that. 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.800
 Yes 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:50.710
 If you said that, you would say that to harm me. 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.280
 But I just said that because I thought about it. But how do I do it? 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.020
 Sagna 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:05:00.210
 Why do you think that you want me to do it? 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.210
 That's what he said. 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:10.100
 If you give an example, the first thing 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:14.960
 I took your relationship medicine . By your side, you are not your wife. 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:19.570
 If you do not have all of your sisters, the topic will be joined later 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:23.210
 I 'm sorry, I just wanted to put it in. I built it. 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:27.650
 I'm sorry, guys . 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:34.100
 But what did he say? He is not talking about his thoughts. 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:37.550
 But Wendy does not need to know 12 like this . 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.520
 Well , I'm not the same person. 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:44.570
 Also, does it mean going straight to 12 the man say 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:48.590
 Now people like that , so that 's the problem. 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:54.530
 I'm sorry about that. 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:06:01.670
 Just across the road is not what ah sprinkle another 9 Sorry this must by turmoil 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:03.919
 Was hoping it 's fresh water basin is a very good girl then stir something like that M 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:10.180
 It's not a bad thing. 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:10.180
 I hate it, but I like it a little . 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:17.380
 If you do not like it, it's not what you do. 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.380
 Maybe five . 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:25.870
 Walking're not gonna be just beyond sense without the need to know why no-invention it 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:31.180
 I do not think he was trying to hurt me . 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:33.490
 After talking to him he'll have his own thoughts that's what some now that 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:38.080
 It'll be done in a way Yano 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:42.759
 I 'm blaming people for words. If I'm 12, 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:44.800
 I do not want to tell you all the things I love. 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:49.660
 Why do not you give it to me 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:55.100
 I do not think so. 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:59.150
 I know that the thing that really gotta ttansaram is annoying not think so 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:05.330
 I think that you'll nadaero him that they 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:09.390
 There's nothing to lose here already. 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:13.340
 I do this in this case . 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:18.110
 I see people with disabilities. 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:21.980
 Well, she looks thinner than herself, so she's not there anymore. 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:25.850
 I forgot mean there said, I think the lift 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:33.190
 No matter what happened and did his post so then 

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:33.190
 It's not something that just isnt being was the year I would're short 

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:44.600
 They need to change their minds so they do not know who they are. 

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:48.050
 I gotta keep this as fertilizing our ears when we heard a few examples that 

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.629
 People do not do me 12 They just say everything they think 

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:54.009
 This is it. 

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:57.990
 No matter what we say, we just think of the people we talked to, 

00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:57.990
 I have spent just take it
