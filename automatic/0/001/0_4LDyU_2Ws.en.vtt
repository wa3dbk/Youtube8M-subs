00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
thinking what a golf course in Minecraft

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.430 
thinking what a golf course in Minecraft
but<00:00:10.830> yeah<00:00:11.160> it's<00:00:11.340> pretty<00:00:11.460> simple<00:00:12.120> let's<00:00:12.870> get<00:00:13.320> to

the tutorial now the only way I know how

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.609 
the tutorial now the only way I know how
to<00:00:17.160> get<00:00:17.550> ice<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:18.210> with<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.539> silt<00:00:18.810> silk<00:00:19.439> touch

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
to get ice is with the silt silk touch

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.250 
to get ice is with the silt silk touch
pickaxe<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.600> you're<00:00:21.600> gonna<00:00:21.720> have<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.930> be<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.140> a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
pickaxe and you're gonna have to be in a

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.750 
pickaxe and you're gonna have to be in a
snow<00:00:22.470> biome<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.220> ice<00:00:23.340> doesn't<00:00:23.640> melt

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
snow biome so that the ice doesn't melt

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.000 
snow biome so that the ice doesn't melt
but<00:00:24.240> since<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.689> am<00:00:24.840> on<00:00:25.050> creative<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.740> will<00:00:25.890> not

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
but since I am on creative it will not

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.519 
but since I am on creative it will not
melt<00:00:26.330> so<00:00:27.330> yeah<00:00:27.810> I'm<00:00:27.930> gonna<00:00:28.019> show<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.289> guys<00:00:28.439> how

and<00:00:33.000> chanted<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.960> diamond<00:00:34.410> pickaxe<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.219> got

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
and chanted a diamond pickaxe and got

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.119 
and chanted a diamond pickaxe and got
the<00:00:35.610> silk<00:00:35.910> touch<00:00:36.120> one<00:00:36.510> right<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.739> as<00:00:37.980> you

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
the silk touch one right here and as you

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.680 
the silk touch one right here and as you
can<00:00:38.219> see<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.670> go<00:00:38.820> ahead<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.090> mine<00:00:39.450> your

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
can see you can go ahead and mine your

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.880 
can see you can go ahead and mine your
ice<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.260> will<00:00:40.379> need<00:00:40.530> for<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.710> golf

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
ice the you will need for the golf

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.310 
ice the you will need for the golf
course<00:00:41.180> okay<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.450> first<00:00:42.660> step<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.230> go

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
course okay so the first step is to go

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.979 
course okay so the first step is to go
ahead<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.559> build<00:00:43.739> your<00:00:44.070> course<00:00:44.850> itself<00:00:45.390> now

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
ahead and build your course itself now

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.350 
ahead and build your course itself now
the<00:00:46.050> first<00:00:46.350> thing<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.829> go<00:00:47.129> ahead<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.640> build

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
the first thing is to go ahead and build

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.690 
the first thing is to go ahead and build
it<00:00:48.570> as<00:00:48.930> high<00:00:49.140> as<00:00:49.170> your<00:00:49.530> player<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.610> you

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
it as high as your player so that you

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.549 
it as high as your player so that you
can<00:00:50.879> throw<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.539> snowball<00:00:52.020> which<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.410> your

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
can throw the snowball which is your

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.470 
can throw the snowball which is your
golf<00:00:52.739> ball<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.250> will<00:00:53.340> go<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> hole<00:00:53.760> so

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
golf ball and it will go on the hole so

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.569 
golf ball and it will go on the hole so
a<00:00:54.510> very<00:00:54.870> basic<00:00:55.230> one<00:00:55.620> would<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.520> right

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
a very basic one would be this one right

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.520 
a very basic one would be this one right
here<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.660> go<00:00:57.930> ahead<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.140> put<00:00:58.260> glass

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
here and go ahead and put glass

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.709 
here and go ahead and put glass
everywhere<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.820> do<00:01:00.059> not<00:01:00.180> want<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> ball<00:01:00.690> to

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
everywhere you do not want the ball to

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.160 
everywhere you do not want the ball to
slide<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.230> way<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.500> easy<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.920> see<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:03.210> this

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
slide that way it's easy to see and this

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.050 
slide that way it's easy to see and this
one<00:01:04.409> can<00:01:04.619> be<00:01:04.650> hole<00:01:04.890> one<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:05.729> very<00:01:05.790> basic

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
one can be hole one so it's very basic

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.539 
one can be hole one so it's very basic
you<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.450> throw<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.770> if<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.070> makes<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.400> in

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
you just throw it and if it makes it in

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.810 
you just throw it and if it makes it in
you'd<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.180> point<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:10.350> now<00:01:10.380> also<00:01:11.130> another<00:01:11.490> way

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
you'd a point and now also another way

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.570 
you'd a point and now also another way
to<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:13.590> hook<00:01:13.830> up<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.189> wooden

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
to do this is to hook up a wooden

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.690 
to do this is to hook up a wooden
pressure<00:01:14.909> plate<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:19.220> my<00:01:20.220> bad<00:01:20.430> let<00:01:20.640> me

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
pressure plate like this my bad let me

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.090 
pressure plate like this my bad let me
find<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.970> pressure<00:01:21.180> plate<00:01:21.420> yeah<00:01:22.200> get<00:01:23.070> a

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
find the pressure plate yeah get a

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.910 
find the pressure plate yeah get a
pressure<00:01:23.430> plate<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.170> somehow<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.350> can<00:01:25.590> use<00:01:25.890> a

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
pressure plate and somehow you can use a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.179 
pressure plate and somehow you can use a
redstone<00:01:26.340> light<00:01:27.560> and<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.770> guys<00:01:28.920> could<00:01:29.070> get

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
redstone light and you guys could get

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.219 
redstone light and you guys could get
creative<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.939> basically<00:01:30.630> just<00:01:30.900> throw<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.140> in

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
creative and basically just throw it in

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.149 
creative and basically just throw it in
there<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.530> don't<00:01:31.619> think<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:31.950> gonna<00:01:32.070> work

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
there I don't think this is gonna work

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.450

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.580 

it'll<00:01:44.040> light<00:01:44.189> up<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.780> next<00:01:46.110> hole<00:01:46.409> we're

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
it'll light up so the next hole we're

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.590 
it'll light up so the next hole we're
gonna<00:01:46.680> make<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> more<00:01:47.640> advanced<00:01:48.149> one<00:01:48.329> with<00:01:48.570> a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
gonna make is a more advanced one with a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.929 
gonna make is a more advanced one with a
turn<00:01:49.049> no<00:01:49.530> keep<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.829> mind<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.100> practically<00:01:50.759> as

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
turn no keep in mind this practically as

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.149 
turn no keep in mind this practically as
mini-golf<00:01:51.390> it's<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:51.780> full-sized<00:01:52.229> golf<00:01:52.500> that

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
mini-golf it's not full-sized golf that

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.249 
mini-golf it's not full-sized golf that
would<00:01:53.310> be<00:01:53.460> kind<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.850> hard<00:01:54.060> although<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> mod

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
would be kind of hard although a mod

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.530 
would be kind of hard although a mod
could<00:01:55.500> add<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.820> next<00:01:57.060> one<00:01:57.210> has<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> little

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
could add that so next one has a little

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.539 
could add that so next one has a little
bit<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.899> turn<00:01:58.170> here<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.710> you're<00:01:59.280> gonna<00:01:59.369> go

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
bit of a turn here so you're gonna go

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.940 
bit of a turn here so you're gonna go
ahead<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.759> add<00:01:59.969> your<00:02:00.000> ice<00:02:00.530> some<00:02:01.530> more<00:02:01.680> glass

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
ahead and add your ice some more glass

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.359 
ahead and add your ice some more glass
that<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.490> ball<00:02:02.670> does<00:02:02.909> not<00:02:03.060> slip<00:02:03.719> out<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:07.380> yeah

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
that the ball does not slip out and yeah

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.609 
that the ball does not slip out and yeah
you<00:02:08.429> want<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.940> go<00:02:09.060> ahead<00:02:09.119> now<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:10.080> can<00:02:10.229> test<00:02:10.500> it

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
you want to go ahead now you can test it

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.720 
you want to go ahead now you can test it
out<00:02:10.800> if<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.160> can't<00:02:11.459> make<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.819> like<00:02:11.970> this

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
out if you can't make it like this

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.620 
out if you can't make it like this
see<00:02:14.730> right<00:02:14.910> here<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.090> don't<00:02:15.300> think<00:02:15.450> I'm<00:02:15.510> gonna

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
see right here I don't think I'm gonna

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.820 
see right here I don't think I'm gonna
be<00:02:15.720> well<00:02:16.020> did<00:02:16.320> I<00:02:16.380> make<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.590> no<00:02:16.920> they<00:02:17.310> combined

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
be well did I make it no they combined

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.860 
be well did I make it no they combined
so<00:02:19.940> sometimes<00:02:20.940> if<00:02:21.210> they<00:02:21.330> do<00:02:21.390> not<00:02:21.600> make<00:02:21.810> it

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
so sometimes if they do not make it

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.230 
so sometimes if they do not make it
which<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.560> one<00:02:22.770> is<00:02:22.950> not<00:02:23.070> possible<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:24.120> have

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
which this one is not possible you have

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.390 
which this one is not possible you have
to<00:02:24.330> move<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.630> ice<00:02:24.750> one<00:02:25.080> forward<00:02:25.590> break<00:02:26.250> off

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
to move the ice one forward break off

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.020 
to move the ice one forward break off
some<00:02:26.580> glass<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:26.850> now<00:02:27.270> it<00:02:27.450> should<00:02:27.750> be<00:02:27.900> possible

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
some glass and now it should be possible

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.580 
some glass and now it should be possible
hold<00:02:30.030> on<00:02:30.150> guys<00:02:32.870> but<00:02:33.870> yeah<00:02:34.050> if<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.200> just<00:02:34.290> keep

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
hold on guys but yeah if you just keep

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.870 
hold on guys but yeah if you just keep
messing<00:02:34.770> around<00:02:35.010> with<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.340> you'll<00:02:35.520> get<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.790> in

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
messing around with it you'll get it in

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.070 
messing around with it you'll get it in
there<00:02:36.000> eventually<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.450> keeps<00:02:36.630> getting<00:02:36.720> sucked

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
there eventually it keeps getting sucked

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.020 
there eventually it keeps getting sucked
up<00:02:37.290> into<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.680> what<00:02:37.860> Claude<00:02:38.100> I'm<00:02:38.700> gonna<00:02:38.850> make

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
up into that what Claude I'm gonna make

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.940 
up into that what Claude I'm gonna make
it<00:02:39.180> here<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.510> show<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.750> guys<00:02:39.810> okay<00:02:40.500> guys<00:02:40.530> so

here<00:03:34.650> now<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.640> thing<00:03:35.850> is<00:03:35.880> with<00:03:36.209> this<00:03:36.390> one<00:03:36.630> is

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
here now the thing is with this one is

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.380 
here now the thing is with this one is
that<00:03:36.989> if<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.290> do<00:03:37.530> make<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:37.770> over<00:03:38.610> there<00:03:38.820> which

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
that if you do make it over there which

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.240 
that if you do make it over there which
I<00:03:39.570> purposely<00:03:40.170> have<00:03:40.530> pretty<00:03:40.830> much<00:03:40.920> made

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
I purposely have pretty much made

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.430 
I purposely have pretty much made
impossible<00:03:41.520> you<00:03:42.060> cannot<00:03:42.420> throw<00:03:42.900> an<00:03:43.050> item<00:03:43.170> that

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
impossible you cannot throw an item that

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.780 
impossible you cannot throw an item that
far<00:03:43.650> unless<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:43.980> were<00:03:44.070> to<00:03:44.100> cheat<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.580> go<00:03:44.700> up

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
far unless you were to cheat and go up

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.070 
far unless you were to cheat and go up
here<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:46.070> yeah<00:03:47.070> you<00:03:47.190> would<00:03:47.459> make<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:48.080> so

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
here and yeah you would make it so

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.190 
here and yeah you would make it so
basically<00:03:49.650> for<00:03:50.130> this<00:03:50.310> one<00:03:50.660> each<00:03:51.660> player<00:03:52.019> would

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
basically for this one each player would

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.530 
basically for this one each player would
get<00:03:52.350> a<00:03:52.380> point<00:03:52.620> this<00:03:53.220> would<00:03:53.550> be<00:03:53.700> one<00:03:53.940> point<00:03:54.300> two

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
get a point this would be one point two

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.870 
get a point this would be one point two
point<00:03:54.870> three<00:03:55.080> point<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:55.739> then<00:03:56.340> four<00:03:56.640> point

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
point three point and then four point

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.640 
point three point and then four point
right<00:03:57.060> here<00:03:57.330> and<00:03:57.660> if<00:03:57.810> they<00:03:57.930> somehow<00:03:58.230> made<00:03:58.500> it

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
right here and if they somehow made it

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.850 
right here and if they somehow made it
in<00:03:58.739> here<00:03:58.920> six<00:03:59.190> point<00:03:59.459> which<00:03:59.670> I<00:04:00.000> don't<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.200> can't

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
in here six point which I don't I can't

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.140 
in here six point which I don't I can't
I<00:04:02.660> can't<00:04:03.660> even<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:04.050> I<00:04:04.170> don't<00:04:04.890> I<00:04:05.130> don't<00:04:05.700> think<00:04:06.030> it

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
I can't even I I don't I don't think it

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.750 
I can't even I I don't I don't think it
is<00:04:06.269> possible<00:04:06.840> but<00:04:07.100> you<00:04:08.100> guys<00:04:08.190> can<00:04:08.400> experiment

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
is possible but you guys can experiment

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.229 
is possible but you guys can experiment
maybe<00:04:09.690> one<00:04:09.930> of<00:04:10.050> you<00:04:10.140> will<00:04:10.230> do<00:04:10.380> it<00:04:10.730> all<00:04:11.730> right<00:04:11.850> so

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
maybe one of you will do it all right so

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.259 
maybe one of you will do it all right so
let's<00:04:13.140> get<00:04:13.290> on<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.680> next<00:04:13.709> golf<00:04:14.640> course

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
let's get on to the next golf course

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.300 
let's get on to the next golf course
thing<00:04:15.570> now<00:04:16.049> this<00:04:16.200> next<00:04:16.500> one<00:04:16.650> does<00:04:16.980> go<00:04:17.190> into

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
thing now this next one does go into

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.159 
thing now this next one does go into
ground<00:04:17.580> so<00:04:17.850> it's<00:04:18.000> really<00:04:18.269> cool<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.810> go<00:04:18.930> ahead

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
ground so it's really cool to go ahead

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.380 
ground so it's really cool to go ahead
and<00:04:19.700> build<00:04:20.700> a<00:04:21.000> thing<00:04:21.600> down<00:04:21.870> here<00:04:22.229> and<00:04:23.180> I'm<00:04:24.180> just

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
and build a thing down here and I'm just

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.969 
and build a thing down here and I'm just
gonna<00:04:24.510> put<00:04:24.750> red<00:04:24.930> wool<00:04:25.140> on<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.350> bottom<00:04:25.650> because

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
gonna put red wool on the bottom because

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:26.730 
gonna put red wool on the bottom because
that's<00:04:26.130> kind<00:04:26.400> of<00:04:26.460> cool

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
that's kind of cool

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.590 
that's kind of cool
so<00:04:27.729> go<00:04:28.030> ahead<00:04:28.120> take<00:04:28.479> out<00:04:28.840> a<00:04:29.169> decent<00:04:29.949> sized<00:04:30.160> area

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
so go ahead take out a decent sized area

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.600 
so go ahead take out a decent sized area
and<00:04:31.600> then<00:04:32.020> eventually<00:04:32.949> make<00:04:33.130> it<00:04:33.250> three<00:04:33.430> deep

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
and then eventually make it three deep

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.890 
and then eventually make it three deep
so<00:04:34.060> we<00:04:34.120> make<00:04:34.360> it<00:04:34.449> three<00:04:34.660> deep<00:04:34.810> right<00:04:34.990> here<00:04:36.900> this

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
so we make it three deep right here this

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.529 
so we make it three deep right here this
is<00:04:38.080> just<00:04:38.289> so<00:04:38.410> that<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:38.680> player<00:04:38.949> can<00:04:38.979> see<00:04:39.490> if<00:04:40.270> he

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
is just so that the player can see if he

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.230 
is just so that the player can see if he
or<00:04:40.569> she<00:04:40.660> has<00:04:41.050> made<00:04:41.410> it<00:04:41.849> gonna<00:04:42.849> cut<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.090> off<00:04:43.150> a

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
or she has made it gonna cut it off a

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.999 
or she has made it gonna cut it off a
little<00:04:43.389> bit<00:04:43.479> earlier<00:04:43.720> here<00:04:43.960> and<00:04:44.169> I<00:04:44.349> am<00:04:44.500> on<00:04:44.740> a

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
little bit earlier here and I am on a

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.730 
little bit earlier here and I am on a
flatland<00:04:45.639> world<00:04:45.940> so<00:04:46.270> yeah<00:04:47.020> I<00:04:47.229> cannot<00:04:47.500> dig<00:04:47.710> very

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
flatland world so yeah I cannot dig very

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.080 
flatland world so yeah I cannot dig very
deep<00:04:48.569> let's<00:04:49.569> go<00:04:49.690> ahead<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:49.900> add<00:04:49.990> this<00:04:50.229> and<00:04:51.090> so

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
deep let's go ahead and add this and so

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.689 
deep let's go ahead and add this and so
the<00:04:52.900> golf<00:04:53.110> course<00:04:53.380> only<00:04:53.919> be<00:04:53.979> one<00:04:54.160> wide<00:04:54.340> so<00:04:54.610> you

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
the golf course only be one wide so you

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.850 
the golf course only be one wide so you
want<00:04:54.819> to<00:04:54.910> make<00:04:55.000> it<00:04:55.120> right<00:04:55.240> here

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
want to make it right here

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.230 
want to make it right here
add<00:04:57.190> your<00:04:58.410> add<00:04:59.410> your<00:04:59.860> ice<00:05:00.099> first<00:05:00.520> and<00:05:00.849> go<00:05:01.120> ahead

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
and add a barrier around this and go

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.070 
and add a barrier around this and go
ahead<00:05:04.330> and<00:05:04.509> make<00:05:04.660> a<00:05:04.690> hole<00:05:05.680> like<00:05:05.710> this<00:05:05.949> and<00:05:07.080> add

ice right here and here and then we're

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.260 
ice right here and here and then we're
gonna<00:05:11.710> add<00:05:11.919> a<00:05:12.419> pressure<00:05:13.419> plate<00:05:13.830> redstone<00:05:14.830> lamp

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
gonna add a pressure plate redstone lamp

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.089 
gonna add a pressure plate redstone lamp
and<00:05:16.270> that's<00:05:16.389> pretty<00:05:16.570> much<00:05:16.690> it<00:05:16.840> now<00:05:17.259> you<00:05:17.860> want

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
and that's pretty much it now you want

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:19.950 
and that's pretty much it now you want
to<00:05:18.220> seal<00:05:18.460> off<00:05:18.669> everything<00:05:19.030> but<00:05:19.330> this<00:05:19.479> one<00:05:19.720> and

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
to seal off everything but this one and

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.659 
to seal off everything but this one and
let's<00:05:20.110> go<00:05:20.229> ahead<00:05:20.349> and<00:05:20.470> test<00:05:20.680> this<00:05:20.889> make<00:05:21.400> sure

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
let's go ahead and test this make sure

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.270 
let's go ahead and test this make sure
everything<00:05:22.630> runs<00:05:22.810> smoothly<00:05:23.229> don't<00:05:24.099> want<00:05:24.220> to

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
everything runs smoothly don't want to

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.520 
everything runs smoothly don't want to
do<00:05:24.370> that<00:05:25.050> make<00:05:26.050> sure<00:05:26.169> everything<00:05:26.409> runs

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
do that make sure everything runs

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.790 
do that make sure everything runs
smoothly<00:05:27.750> let's<00:05:28.750> make<00:05:28.930> sure<00:05:28.960> it<00:05:29.199> can<00:05:29.380> go<00:05:29.620> all

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
smoothly let's make sure it can go all

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.589 
smoothly let's make sure it can go all
the<00:05:29.889> way<00:05:29.949> down<00:05:30.159> there<00:05:33.030> has<00:05:34.030> it<00:05:34.210> gone<00:05:34.360> all<00:05:34.539> the

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
the way down there has it gone all the

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
the ice melted here because of the

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.210 
the ice melted here because of the
redstone

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
redstone

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.530 
redstone
well<00:06:41.220> I<00:06:41.370> don't<00:06:41.520> believe<00:06:41.759> it's<00:06:41.910> redstone<00:06:42.300> lamp

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.540 
well I don't believe it's redstone lamp

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.659 
well I don't believe it's redstone lamp
as<00:06:42.870> much<00:06:43.139> as<00:06:43.290> it's<00:06:43.470> the<00:06:45.949> if<00:06:46.949> it's<00:06:47.130> touching<00:06:47.430> the

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:47.669 
as much as it's the if it's touching the

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:49.100 
as much as it's the if it's touching the
redstone<00:06:48.000> lamp<00:06:48.240> I<00:06:48.330> believe<00:06:48.630> it<00:06:48.780> might<00:06:48.930> melt

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
redstone lamp I believe it might melt

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.420 
redstone lamp I believe it might melt
