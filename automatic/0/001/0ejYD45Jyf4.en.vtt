from walnut Hollow and we're talking
about<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.609> creative<00:00:05.970> versatile<00:00:07.550> last<00:00:08.550> time

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
about the creative versatile last time

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.120 
about the creative versatile last time
we<00:00:09.090> talked<00:00:09.420> about<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:10.230> instruction<00:00:11.099> sheet

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
we talked about the instruction sheet

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.209 
we talked about the instruction sheet
that<00:00:11.580> comes<00:00:11.880> inside<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:13.500> shows<00:00:13.799> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
that comes inside and it shows the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.510 
that comes inside and it shows the
different<00:00:14.670> versa<00:00:14.969> temp<00:00:15.360> zones<00:00:15.809> for<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
different versa temp zones for the

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.790 
different versa temp zones for the
temperature<00:00:17.520> control<00:00:18.020> you<00:00:19.020> have<00:00:19.320> that

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
temperature control you have that

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.790 
temperature control you have that
control<00:00:20.660> also<00:00:21.660> on<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.260> back<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.680> your

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
control also on the back of your

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.960 
control also on the back of your
packaging<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:24.350> are<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.670> information<00:00:26.670> about

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
packaging and are the information about

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.800 
packaging and are the information about
the<00:00:27.269> versa<00:00:27.570> temp<00:00:27.960> domes<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:29.150> the<00:00:30.150> important

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
the versa temp domes and the important

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.310 
the versa temp domes and the important
part<00:00:31.140> about<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.859> zones<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.780> set<00:00:34.110> it

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
part about the zones is that you set it

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.340 
part about the zones is that you set it
to<00:00:34.890> for<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.940> appropriate<00:00:36.630> surface<00:00:37.110> that

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
to for the appropriate surface that

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.860 
to for the appropriate surface that
you're<00:00:37.440> working<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.790> if<00:00:39.180> you're<00:00:39.390> working

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
you're working on so if you're working

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.610 
you're working on so if you're working
on<00:00:40.079> leather<00:00:40.640> you<00:00:41.640> will<00:00:41.670> turn<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.070> dial<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
on leather you will turn the dial to the

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.799 
on leather you will turn the dial to the
yellow<00:00:46.620> section<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.600> lower

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
yellow section and it's a lower

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.290 
yellow section and it's a lower
temperature<00:00:49.680> if<00:00:50.219> you're<00:00:51.210> working<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:52.250> cork

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
temperature if you're working on cork

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.360 
temperature if you're working on cork
because<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.449> can<00:00:54.690> actually<00:00:54.989> burn<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.680> cork<00:00:56.070> or

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
because you can actually burn on cork or

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.020 
because you can actually burn on cork or
if<00:00:56.879> you're<00:00:57.510> adding<00:00:58.050> iron<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.710> embellishments

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
if you're adding iron on embellishments

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.840 
if you're adding iron on embellishments
to<00:01:00.030> something<00:01:00.600> you'll<00:01:01.379> want<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:02.010> little<00:01:02.340> bit<00:01:02.579> of
