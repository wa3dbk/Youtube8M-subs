00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.880 
it's three lines here in two sides left
and<00:00:38.290> right<00:00:38.440> and<00:00:39.930> first<00:00:40.930> off<00:00:41.140> I'm<00:00:41.350> making<00:00:41.739> the

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
and right and first off I'm making the

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.829 
and right and first off I'm making the
picture<00:00:42.309> big<00:00:42.640> enough<00:00:42.850> for<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.360> biggest<00:00:43.659> line

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
picture big enough for the biggest line

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:46.320 
picture big enough for the biggest line
the<00:00:44.260> longest<00:00:44.739> line<00:00:44.920> so<00:00:45.549> I<00:00:45.580> know<00:00:45.699> it's<00:00:45.940> big

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
the longest line so I know it's big

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.350 
the longest line so I know it's big
enough<00:00:46.449> for<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.870> other<00:00:46.900> ones<00:00:47.260> as<00:00:47.470> well

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
so I turn down the opacity just to see

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.109 
so I turn down the opacity just to see
the<00:00:52.210> line<00:00:52.420> through<00:00:52.750> here<00:00:53.019> and<00:00:53.699> how<00:00:54.699> long<00:00:54.760> it's

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:55.119

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.250 
both both of the sides looks natural but
if<00:03:19.440> you<00:03:19.620> put<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.459> pasty<00:03:21.060> up<00:03:21.180> again<00:03:21.449> you<00:03:22.109> will

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
if you put the pasty up again you will

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.770 
if you put the pasty up again you will
see<00:03:22.500> that<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.889> edges<00:03:23.099> are<00:03:23.819> disappearing<00:03:24.449> so

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
see that the edges are disappearing so

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.520 
see that the edges are disappearing so
it<00:03:24.989> doesn't<00:03:25.500> seem<00:03:25.889> real<00:03:26.159> arrow<00:03:26.989> so<00:03:27.989> what<00:03:28.319> we're

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
it doesn't seem real arrow so what we're

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.429 
it doesn't seem real arrow so what we're
going<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.709> do<00:03:28.889> is<00:03:29.129> go<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.370> this<00:03:29.939> select<00:03:30.870> this

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:31.439 
going to do is go to this select this

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.159 
going to do is go to this select this

linear<00:03:34.590> burn<00:03:34.979> and<00:03:36.109> now<00:03:37.109> we<00:03:37.169> can<00:03:37.409> see<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.650> edges

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
linear burn and now we can see the edges

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.569 
linear burn and now we can see the edges
has<00:03:38.189> come<00:03:38.459> back<00:03:39.329> or<00:03:39.780> some<00:03:40.019> of<00:03:40.109> it<00:03:40.260> this<00:03:41.159> side<00:03:41.430> is

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
has come back or some of it this side is

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.939

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
this a little lighter like this maybe

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.520 
this a little lighter like this maybe
and<00:04:10.889> it's<00:04:11.549> pretty<00:04:12.180> good<00:04:12.419> good<00:04:13.109> enough<00:04:13.139> for

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
and it's pretty good good enough for

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.379 
and it's pretty good good enough for
this<00:04:13.709> tutorial<00:04:13.949> at<00:04:14.519> least<00:04:16.970> as<00:04:17.970> you<00:04:18.120> can<00:04:18.209> see

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
this tutorial at least as you can see

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.509 
this tutorial at least as you can see
here<00:04:18.750> we<00:04:19.289> still<00:04:19.500> have<00:04:19.560> this<00:04:19.919> white<00:04:20.220> line

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
here we still have this white line

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.659 
here we still have this white line
because<00:04:20.849> the<00:04:21.030> milk<00:04:21.239> carton<00:04:21.599> goes<00:04:21.750> down<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.079> bit

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
because the milk carton goes down a bit

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.990 
because the milk carton goes down a bit
so<00:04:23.669> what<00:04:23.760> we're<00:04:23.909> going<00:04:24.029> to<00:04:24.090> do<00:04:24.270> is

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
so what we're going to do is

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.390 
so what we're going to do is
take<00:04:27.000> on<00:04:27.509> because<00:04:28.020> we<00:04:28.319> have<00:04:28.350> liner<00:04:28.889> burn<00:04:29.250> on

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
take on because we have liner burn on

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.730 
take on because we have liner burn on
you<00:04:29.610> can't<00:04:29.940> just<00:04:30.060> select<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.870> color<00:04:31.139> and<00:04:31.259> oh

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740
