00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
first we are going to pin up this clean

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.619 
first we are going to pin up this clean
and<00:00:37.170> then<00:00:37.620> put<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> water<00:00:41.239> now<00:00:42.239> put<00:00:42.510> it

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
and then put it in the water now put it

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.650 
and then put it in the water now put it
into<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.140> water<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.860> avoid<00:00:44.280> escalation<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.360> am

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
into the water to avoid escalation I am

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.630 
into the water to avoid escalation I am
using<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.469> knife<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
using the knife and this is the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.150 
using the knife and this is the
conventional<00:00:48.390> way<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.469> use<00:00:49.710> greater

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
conventional way but you can use greater

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.549 
conventional way but you can use greater
more<00:00:50.610> food<00:00:50.940> processor<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.780> will<00:00:52.350> make

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
more food processor and that will make

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.369 
more food processor and that will make
easier<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.340> faster<00:00:53.730> okay<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:54.750> now<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.170> will

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
easier and faster okay so now I will

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.080 
easier and faster okay so now I will
take<00:00:55.800> one<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.460> cut<00:00:57.390> into<00:00:57.600> thin<00:00:57.809> round<00:00:58.350> slices

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.570 

so<00:01:03.090> like<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:06.500> already<00:01:07.500> cut<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.189> into<00:01:08.430> round

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
so like this I already cut it into round

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.800 
so like this I already cut it into round
thin<00:01:09.299> slices<00:01:10.049> see<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.250> now<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.119> will<00:01:12.360> take

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
thin slices see this now I will take

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.219 
thin slices see this now I will take
couple<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.320> them<00:01:13.790> cut<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.820> into<00:01:15.210> julienne<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
couple of them cut it into julienne and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.690 
couple of them cut it into julienne and
it<00:01:17.130> should<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.490> very<00:01:17.729> thin<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.360> even<00:01:18.900> slices

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
it should be very thin and even slices

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.270 
it should be very thin and even slices
this<00:01:20.700> will<00:01:20.970> quickly<00:01:21.270> get<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.869> coloured<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.890> I

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
this will quickly get is coloured so I
