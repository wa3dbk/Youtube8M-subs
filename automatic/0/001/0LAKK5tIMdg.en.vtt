think<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.210> interesting<00:00:30.840> because<00:00:30.990> if

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
think this is interesting because if

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.560 
think this is interesting because if
Spurs<00:00:32.009> are<00:00:32.279> really<00:00:33.000> pushing<00:00:33.210> for<00:00:33.510> a

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
Spurs are really pushing for a

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.389 
Spurs are really pushing for a
centerfold<00:00:34.079> which<00:00:34.290> they<00:00:34.469> appear<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.800> be<00:00:34.980> is

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
centerfold which they appear to be is

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.299 
centerfold which they appear to be is
that<00:00:36.090> because<00:00:36.239> hurricane<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.590> negotiation

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
that because hurricane is in negotiation

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.479 
that because hurricane is in negotiation
to<00:00:38.489> leave<00:00:38.989> hmm<00:00:40.100> obviously<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.219> don't<00:00:41.309> know

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
to leave hmm obviously we don't know

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.979 
to leave hmm obviously we don't know
we've<00:00:41.610> not<00:00:41.760> heard<00:00:41.850> anything<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.329> sort<00:00:42.899> of

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
we've not heard anything to that sort of

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.229 
we've not heard anything to that sort of
effect<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.559> that's<00:00:43.890> pure<00:00:44.280> speculation<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:45.030> my

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
effect so that's pure speculation on my

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.940 
effect so that's pure speculation on my
part<00:00:45.270> numbers<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.140> as<00:00:46.230> these<00:00:46.350> journalists

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
part numbers but as these journalists

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.220 
part numbers but as these journalists
next<00:00:47.610> up<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:47.820> got<00:00:47.850> Pedro<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.870> time<00:00:49.050> for

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
next up we got Pedro it's time for

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.729 
next up we got Pedro it's time for
Chelsea<00:00:49.680> virtually<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:51.289> there's<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.530> end<00:00:52.649> of

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
Chelsea virtually so there's the end of

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.279 
Chelsea virtually so there's the end of
that<00:00:52.829> one<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.309> think<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:53.969> massively<00:00:54.510> missed<00:00:55.110> out

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
that one I think we massively missed out

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.770 
that one I think we massively missed out
here<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:56.430> does<00:00:56.789> seem<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.239> one<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.629> we

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
here this does seem to be one that we

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.479 
here this does seem to be one that we
actually<00:00:58.050> missed<00:00:58.500> out<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.710> as<00:00:58.980> opposed<00:00:59.340> to

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
actually missed out on as opposed to

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.250 
actually missed out on as opposed to
those<00:00:59.609> where<00:00:59.879> people<00:01:00.539> think<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.870> missed<00:01:01.020> out

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
those where people think we missed out

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.050 
those where people think we missed out
on<00:01:01.289> such<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:02.270> benteke<00:01:03.270> or<00:01:04.129> for<00:01:05.129> menial<00:01:05.339> or

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
on such as benteke or for menial or

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
do think he's probably gonna go and do

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.359 
do think he's probably gonna go and do
quite<00:01:18.570> well<00:01:18.600> for<00:01:18.869> Chelsea<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:20.159> light<00:01:20.340> of

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
quite well for Chelsea and in light of

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.640 
quite well for Chelsea and in light of
that<00:01:20.549> he's<00:01:20.850> come<00:01:21.000> out<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.270> money

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
that he's come out that money

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.050 
that he's come out that money
Southampton<00:01:22.650> we've<00:01:23.130> inquired<00:01:23.670> about<00:01:23.880> him

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
Southampton we've inquired about him

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.230 
Southampton we've inquired about him
they've<00:01:24.930> rejected<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:26.189> bid<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.610> now<00:01:26.790> said<00:01:27.090> that

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
they've rejected a bid and now said that

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.090 
they've rejected a bid and now said that
they've<00:01:27.420> never<00:01:27.570> been<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.840> bit<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.380> there's

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
they've never been a bit so there's

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.460 
they've never been a bit so there's
obviously<00:01:29.220> some<00:01:29.759> sort<00:01:30.180> confusion<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.170> some

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
obviously some sort confusion on some

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.100 
obviously some sort confusion on some
sort<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.770> interest<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.479> why<00:01:33.479> we're<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.840> frame

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
sort of interest to why we're in frame

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.899 
sort of interest to why we're in frame
i'm<00:01:34.290> not<00:01:34.500> quite<00:01:34.770> sure<00:01:34.799> i<00:01:35.070> think<00:01:35.189> you'd<00:01:35.490> be<00:01:35.610> not

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
i'm not quite sure i think you'd be not

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.420 
i'm not quite sure i think you'd be not
much<00:01:36.390> more<00:01:36.659> than<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.960> decent<00:01:37.470> squad<00:01:37.740> player<00:01:38.130> for

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
much more than a decent squad player for

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.190 
much more than a decent squad player for
us<00:01:38.610> he's<00:01:38.759> not<00:01:38.939> going<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.150> come<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.990> come

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
us he's not going to come in and come

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.380 
us he's not going to come in and come
under<00:01:40.470> first-team<00:01:40.950> space<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.060> think<00:01:42.270> we've

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
under first-team space and I think we've

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.179 
under first-team space and I think we've
got<00:01:42.600> plenty<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.259> squad<00:01:43.649> players<00:01:43.920> especially

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
got plenty of squad players especially

hand if he doesn't sign a new contract
so<00:03:28.949> I<00:03:29.280> think<00:03:29.759> this<00:03:29.970> is<00:03:30.120> an<00:03:30.209> interesting<00:03:30.509> one

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
so I think this is an interesting one

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.080 
so I think this is an interesting one
and<00:03:31.109> I<00:03:31.229> think<00:03:31.530> there's<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.549> good<00:03:32.699> chance<00:03:32.909> we'll

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
and I think there's a good chance we'll

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.599 
and I think there's a good chance we'll
get<00:03:33.299> Thomas<00:03:33.629> Muller<00:03:33.840> at<00:03:34.319> some<00:03:34.590> stage<00:03:34.889> don't

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
get Thomas Muller at some stage don't

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.249 
get Thomas Muller at some stage don't
think<00:03:35.759> it<00:03:35.849> with<00:03:35.970> this<00:03:36.030> year<00:03:36.299> but<00:03:36.930> next<00:03:36.959> year

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:37.259 
think it with this year but next year

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.289 
think it with this year but next year
and<00:03:37.560> obviously<00:03:38.099> it<00:03:38.250> maybe<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.579> year<00:03:38.759> after<00:03:38.819> I

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
and obviously it maybe the year after I

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.119 
and obviously it maybe the year after I
think<00:03:39.720> we<00:03:39.780> might<00:03:39.900> have<00:03:40.049> something<00:03:40.409> there<00:03:40.439> so

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129
