00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.769
 hello dear experienced readers we like 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.990
 still a small impression in the app 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.520
 just release carey and me 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.840
 briefly show the whole works is 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.820
 it is relatively simple you have just in 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.769
 text probably already read and 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.179
 down here you can open the menu 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.949
 save and share once with open 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.960
 that speaks for itself 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.570
 Over opening we come our own 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.119
 open image from the photo library or 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.859
 also one with the camera snap over 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.780
 we can save currently edited 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.890
 save image and share it if you like 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.420
 Click on it then you get here 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.130
 the options for example by e-mail 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.030
 or also on twitter or facebook 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.100
 to share 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.240
 we thank you already opened a picture 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.680
 I think that's a coincidence 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.140
 picture and about the different ones 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.790
 Slider here we can then 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.470
 really the blur effect 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.020
 to adjust as you sometimes see 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.450
 set back completely, we have here so a 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.980
 colored picture with a few shoes and 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.060
 can now here for example this 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.770
 effect sit on it as washed out 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.579
 that should be the farther the sliding gate 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.170
 aim forward 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.180
 once we click on it then it will 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.230
 the whole reset we look 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.790
 Just push this one 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.080
 times around a bit then you can here 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.159
 still at the saturation at the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.470
 Brightness screws and can be the content 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.610
 to adjust so that you have to 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.340
 just try a little something 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.600
 one in the end like it then 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.860
 maybe a little bit lighter 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.510
 should or a little more 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.950
 the blue effect should be there 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.330
 or maybe one way 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.360
 maybe still recognize about 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.299
 I is here in the background 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.580
 Here is the red or the red color 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.409
 now not quite as nice to what fits 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.700
 is also possible if we then to 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.070
 Just try the iphone 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.979
 he shakes then he becomes simple 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.610
 a random or random setting 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.500
 met 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.290
 and you can not do that for example 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.510
 Take over for example say save 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.110
 there the display offers a short l the 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.030
 means that a screenshot made 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.729
 He has now in the photo 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.689
 library and you can find it now 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.570
 can choose 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.560
 and the whole as ios background for 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.610
 the spear or for the home screen 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.189
 can set 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.490
 The whole cost 89 cents is really 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:12.070
 as I said, super simple and 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.650
 Actually, you only know yourself 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.840
 which picture you have edited that is 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.170
 very nice and for 89 cents in any case 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.170
 Worth a look
