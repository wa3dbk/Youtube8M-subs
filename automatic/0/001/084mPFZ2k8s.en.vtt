00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the first product the the operating

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.849 
the first product the the operating
system<00:00:20.970> works<00:00:21.359> really<00:00:21.660> well<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:22.560> simple

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
system works really well it's simple

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.099 
system works really well it's simple
it's<00:00:23.310> easy<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:24.060> use<00:00:24.470> it's<00:00:25.470> intuitive<00:00:26.130> and

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
it's easy to use it's intuitive and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.679 
it's easy to use it's intuitive and
their<00:00:28.109> reception<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.859> Lumia<00:00:29.279> launch<00:00:29.689> has

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
their reception to the Lumia launch has

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.990 
their reception to the Lumia launch has
has<00:00:31.199> actually<00:00:31.679> exceeded<00:00:32.099> our<00:00:32.189> expectations

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
has actually exceeded our expectations

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.049 
has actually exceeded our expectations
and<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.960> we<00:00:34.469> think<00:00:34.500> there's<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.100> there's<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.880> very

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
and so we think there's a there's a very

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.360 
and so we think there's a there's a very
good<00:00:36.149> chance<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.780> Microsoft<00:00:37.350> will<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:37.739> a

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
good chance that Microsoft will have a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.510 
good chance that Microsoft will have a
very<00:00:39.030> good<00:00:39.360> OS<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.050> will<00:00:40.170> be<00:00:40.320> right<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.190> there

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
very good OS that will be right in there

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.279 
very good OS that will be right in there
with<00:00:42.050> iOS<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.410> Android<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.870> when<00:00:45.870> they<00:00:46.050> come

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
with iOS and Android and when they come

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.529 
with iOS and Android and when they come
out<00:00:46.469> with<00:00:46.500> windows<00:00:47.309> 8<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.789> fourth<00:00:48.300> quarter

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
out with windows 8 in the fourth quarter

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.380 
out with windows 8 in the fourth quarter
I<00:00:48.809> think<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.710> will<00:00:49.800> actually<00:00:49.980> add<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
I think it will actually add to the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.180 
I think it will actually add to the
value<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:52.230> OS<00:00:52.590> brings<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
value that that OS brings to the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.850 
value that that OS brings to the
marketplace<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.719> that'll<00:00:55.440> be<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> first

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
marketplace in that that'll be the first

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.040 
marketplace in that that'll be the first
time<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.460> truly<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.329> similar

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
time that you can truly have a similar

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.160 
time that you can truly have a similar
experience<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.949> your<00:00:58.980> PC<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.969> your<00:01:00.539> tablet<00:01:01.050> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
experience on your PC on your tablet and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.670 
experience on your PC on your tablet and
on<00:01:01.410> your<00:01:01.559> smartphone<00:01:01.920> from<00:01:02.520> Microsoft<00:01:03.270> and

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
on your smartphone from Microsoft and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.080 
on your smartphone from Microsoft and
from<00:01:04.680> what<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.129> seen<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.670> previews

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
from what I have seen and the previews

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.910 
from what I have seen and the previews
that<00:01:06.240> I've<00:01:06.360> been<00:01:06.540> given<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.049> think<00:01:07.710> it's<00:01:07.830> going

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
that I've been given I think it's going

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.890 
that I've been given I think it's going
to<00:01:07.979> be<00:01:08.070> exceptionally<00:01:08.729> good<00:01:08.909> I'm<00:01:09.119> very<00:01:09.330> very

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
to be exceptionally good I'm very very

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.960 
to be exceptionally good I'm very very
upbeat<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.439> what<00:01:10.860> what<00:01:11.400> they're<00:01:11.580> bringing<00:01:11.729> to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
upbeat and what what they're bringing to

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.950 
upbeat and what what they're bringing to
the<00:01:12.060> market<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.720> means<00:01:13.400> 34<00:01:14.960> viable

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
the market so that means 34 viable

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.020 
the market so that means 34 viable
operating<00:01:16.530> systems<00:01:16.920> will<00:01:17.070> exist<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.790> think

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
operating systems will exist and I think

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.640 
operating systems will exist and I think
that's<00:01:18.180> good<00:01:18.360> for<00:01:18.509> consumers<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.590> a

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
that's good for consumers to have a

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.620 
that's good for consumers to have a
choice<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.700> think<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.210> challenge<00:01:21.570> of

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
choice and I think that the challenge of

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.749 
choice and I think that the challenge of
most<00:01:21.810> investors<00:01:22.200> think<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:22.799> Microsoft<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.549> is

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
most investors think for Microsoft is is

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.910 
most investors think for Microsoft is is
how<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.090> get<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.689> into<00:01:24.990> consumers<00:01:25.470> hands<00:01:25.710> a

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
how you get that into consumers hands a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.440 
how you get that into consumers hands a
lot<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.250> people<00:01:26.460> like<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.729> iphone<00:01:27.060> it's<00:01:27.270> easy

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
lot of people like the iphone it's easy

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.539 
lot of people like the iphone it's easy
to<00:01:27.630> sell<00:01:28.040> Enterprise<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.310> may<00:01:29.460> be

getting out of the business of handing

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.910 
getting out of the business of handing
out<00:01:32.640> phones<00:01:33.030> how<00:01:33.960> do<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.140> anticipate<00:01:34.470> that

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
out phones how do you anticipate that

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.440 
out phones how do you anticipate that
that<00:01:35.159> sort<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.460> driving<00:01:35.850> into<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> consumer

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
that sort of driving into the consumer

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.080 
that sort of driving into the consumer
hand<00:01:36.659> when<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.200> when<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.100> see<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
hand when you when you see the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.359 
hand when you when you see the
opportunity<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.960> Microsoft<00:01:40.650> has<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.340> think

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
opportunity that Microsoft has I think

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.450 
opportunity that Microsoft has I think
it's<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.020> tremendous<00:01:43.500> opportunity<00:01:43.649> in

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
it's it's a tremendous opportunity in

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.070 
it's it's a tremendous opportunity in
that<00:01:44.759> if

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
that if

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.670 
that if
they<00:01:45.140> can<00:01:45.350> get<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:46.370> base<00:01:46.580> of<00:01:46.880> PCs<00:01:47.530> upgraded<00:01:48.530> to

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
they can get the base of PCs upgraded to

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.700 
they can get the base of PCs upgraded to
Windows<00:01:49.040> 8<00:01:49.280> or<00:01:49.430> a<00:01:49.520> new<00:01:50.330> wave<00:01:50.600> of<00:01:50.630> pcs<00:01:51.380> that<00:01:51.560> are

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
Windows 8 or a new wave of pcs that are

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.580 
Windows 8 or a new wave of pcs that are
bought<00:01:52.010> when<00:01:52.280> windows<00:01:52.640> 8<00:01:52.850> comes<00:01:53.120> out<00:01:53.410> if<00:01:54.410> you

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
bought when windows 8 comes out if you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.890 
bought when windows 8 comes out if you
can<00:01:54.770> get<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:55.130> embedded<00:01:55.520> base<00:01:55.850> then<00:01:56.360> if

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
can get that embedded base then if

trying to sell you a microsoft phone so
I<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:14.960> think<00:02:15.760> upgrading<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:17.000> debase<00:02:17.980> makes<00:02:18.980> a

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
I I think upgrading the debase makes a

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.640 
I I think upgrading the debase makes a
lot<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.310> sense<00:02:19.430> from<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.810> point<00:02:21.050> of<00:02:21.200> view<00:02:21.260> of

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
lot of sense from that point of view of

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.420 
lot of sense from that point of view of
having<00:02:22.490> a<00:02:22.670> viable<00:02:23.300> base<00:02:23.570> from<00:02:23.780> which<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.990> work

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
having a viable base from which to work

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.740 
having a viable base from which to work
that<00:02:25.430> quite<00:02:25.640> frankly<00:02:25.670> some<00:02:26.240> of<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.600> other

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
that quite frankly some of the other

that quite frankly some of the other
