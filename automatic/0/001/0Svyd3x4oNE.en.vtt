the character customization is pretty
solid<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:32.070> needs<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.340> little<00:02:32.460> bit<00:02:32.670> more<00:02:32.850> it's<00:02:33.120> a

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
solid it needs a little bit more it's a

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.700 
solid it needs a little bit more it's a
little<00:02:33.450> bit<00:02:33.540> more<00:02:33.690> they<00:02:33.900> can<00:02:33.960> stuff<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.590> little
