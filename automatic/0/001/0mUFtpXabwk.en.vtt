because<00:02:01.649> video<00:02:01.860> quality<00:02:02.219> does<00:02:02.640> make<00:02:02.880> a

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
because video quality does make a

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.910 
because video quality does make a
difference<00:02:03.229> sometimes<00:02:04.229> when<00:02:04.560> we<00:02:04.680> look<00:02:04.829> at

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
difference sometimes when we look at

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.490 
difference sometimes when we look at
videos<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.430> not<00:02:05.670> what<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.540> person<00:02:06.869> saying<00:02:07.170> per

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
videos is not what the person saying per

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.550 
videos is not what the person saying per
se<00:02:07.770> first<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:09.030> what<00:02:09.539> everything<00:02:10.229> looks

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
se first but what everything looks

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.150 
se first but what everything looks
like<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.920> background<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:13.680> those<00:02:13.920> things

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
like in the background so those things

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.600 
like in the background so those things
do<00:02:14.640> make<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> big<00:02:15.300> difference<00:02:15.709> I<00:02:16.709> can<00:02:17.250> also<00:02:17.370> say

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
do make a big difference I can also say

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.600 
do make a big difference I can also say
