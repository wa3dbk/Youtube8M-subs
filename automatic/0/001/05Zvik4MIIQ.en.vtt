00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
juice so the reason why I'm using

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.940 
juice so the reason why I'm using
bentonite<00:00:40.210> clay<00:00:40.270> with<00:00:40.750> my<00:00:40.990> rods<00:00:41.230> little<00:00:41.560> clay

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
bentonite clay with my rods little clay

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.950 
bentonite clay with my rods little clay
for<00:00:42.910> my<00:00:43.030> hair<00:00:43.330> this<00:00:43.600> time<00:00:43.780> is<00:00:43.930> because

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
for my hair this time is because

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.060 
for my hair this time is because
bentonite<00:00:44.710> clay<00:00:44.770> is<00:00:45.250> has<00:00:45.760> a<00:00:45.790> very<00:00:46.120> cleansing

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
bentonite clay is has a very cleansing

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.460 
bentonite clay is has a very cleansing
purifying<00:00:48.210> properties<00:00:49.210> so<00:00:50.079> I<00:00:50.140> thought<00:00:50.320> that

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
purifying properties so I thought that

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.319 
purifying properties so I thought that
would<00:00:50.560> be<00:00:50.680> excellent<00:00:51.040> way<00:00:51.340> to<00:00:51.400> cleanse<00:00:52.150> my

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
would be excellent way to cleanse my

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:53.700 
would be excellent way to cleanse my
hair<00:00:52.510> as<00:00:52.690> well<00:00:52.900> as<00:00:53.079> give<00:00:53.320> it<00:00:53.470> some

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
hair as well as give it some

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:24.480 
hair as well as give it some
conditioning<00:00:54.310> and<00:00:54.460> moisture

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.250 

this<00:01:25.490> mixture<00:01:25.850> was<00:01:26.030> a<00:01:26.060> little<00:01:26.390> bit<00:01:26.510> too<00:01:26.780> watery

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
this mixture was a little bit too watery

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.380 
this mixture was a little bit too watery
so<00:01:27.710> I<00:01:27.740> add<00:01:28.100> just<00:01:28.130> a<00:01:28.550> little<00:01:28.580> bit<00:01:28.850> more<00:01:29.150> of<00:01:29.300> the

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
so I add just a little bit more of the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.760 
so I add just a little bit more of the
bentonite<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.110> Russell<00:01:30.440> play<00:01:35.740> then<00:01:36.740> I

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
bentonite and the Russell play then I

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.740 
bentonite and the Russell play then I
just<00:01:37.040> mix<00:01:37.220> it<00:01:37.400> all<00:01:37.520> together<00:01:37.760> until<00:01:38.210> I<00:01:38.450> get<00:01:38.660> the

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
just mix it all together until I get the

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:47.800 
just mix it all together until I get the
consistency<00:01:39.290> that<00:01:39.590> I<00:01:39.620> like<00:01:46.300> okay<00:01:47.300> so<00:01:47.360> I'm<00:01:47.600> all

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
consistency that I like okay so I'm all

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.110 
consistency that I like okay so I'm all
done<00:01:48.050> mixing<00:01:48.350> this<00:01:49.070> is<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.400> consistency<00:01:49.940> I'm

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
done mixing this is the consistency I'm

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.730 
done mixing this is the consistency I'm
left<00:01:50.390> with<00:01:50.690> it's<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.170> little<00:01:51.500> bit<00:01:52.330> thick<00:01:53.740> smooth

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
left with it's a little bit thick smooth

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.080 
left with it's a little bit thick smooth
so<00:01:55.610> it<00:01:55.700> should<00:01:55.880> be<00:01:56.000> pretty<00:01:56.150> easy<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.630> apply

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
so it should be pretty easy to apply

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.420 
so it should be pretty easy to apply
