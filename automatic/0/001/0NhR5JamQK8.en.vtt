much<00:03:08.079> going<00:03:08.349> over<00:03:08.680> what<00:03:08.980> we<00:03:09.099> know<00:03:09.129> so<00:03:09.280> far

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
much going over what we know so far

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.460 
much going over what we know so far
along<00:03:10.209> with<00:03:10.389> some<00:03:10.629> speculation<00:03:11.319> and

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
along with some speculation and

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.110 
along with some speculation and
supporting<00:03:12.040> evidence<00:03:12.159> together<00:03:12.519> we<00:03:12.909> were

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
supporting evidence together we were

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.969 
supporting evidence together we were
able<00:03:13.269> to<00:03:13.419> conclude<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.200> we<00:03:14.379> could<00:03:14.620> be<00:03:14.739> seeing

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:14.979 
able to conclude that we could be seeing

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:17.129 
able to conclude that we could be seeing
an<00:03:15.220> Egypt<00:03:15.669> map<00:03:15.849> since<00:03:16.419> the<00:03:16.569> longitude<00:03:17.019> and

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
an Egypt map since the longitude and

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.990 
an Egypt map since the longitude and
latitude<00:03:17.229> on<00:03:17.859> one<00:03:18.129> of<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.310> trailers<00:03:18.639> was<00:03:18.849> in

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
latitude on one of the trailers was in

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.030 
latitude on one of the trailers was in
fact<00:03:19.209> correspondent<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.079> Cairo<00:03:20.440> Egypt<00:03:20.919> and

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
fact correspondent to Cairo Egypt and

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.009 
fact correspondent to Cairo Egypt and
then<00:03:21.220> once<00:03:21.459> again<00:03:21.699> we<00:03:21.849> saw<00:03:22.030> dates<00:03:22.389> on<00:03:22.659> an<00:03:22.810> image

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
then once again we saw dates on an image

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.869 
then once again we saw dates on an image

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
has quite a bit of evidence but once
