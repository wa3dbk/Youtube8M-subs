00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.210
 for this new episode dedicated to whom 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.889
 what knees a question 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.620
 very valid for all those who 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.540
 would like to have a more turned knee 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.869
 like those of roberta, do not vote 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.880
 more geniuses like that of Giuliano or even 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.199
 like the gilbert we are sportsmen 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.970
 then our gen or that because they are so 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:30.090
 beautiful because we use them and use them as 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.070
 in imbalance an imbalance that 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.320
 means imbalance means not 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.899
 always placed well on the ground and this 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.570
 forces us to activate more fibers 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.579
 muscle and more stabilizer 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.100
 stabilizers is what keeps us in 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.620
 feet and therefore we need 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.920
 more muscle flowers that train and 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.270
 they become ankles and knees 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.590
 now let's start immediately with our 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.910
 first movement sets the ball established 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.250
 just labor my knees and 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.590
 start doing a test ok a little 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.560
 twist raising my talons that up 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.350
 right now we are playing outside 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.590
 off-axis axis that we constrain 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:20.240
 our legs react as we build 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:24.800
 more muscle we continue 8 7 6 5 4 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.840
 3 2 and relax 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.990
 talented Now another small 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.600
 balance movement only by giving one 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.420
 leg is not very difficult but if 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.729
 look at our feet the sot you are e 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.530
 let's say working a lot you see those 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.810
 small adjustments of my ankles 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.990
 forces my stabilizer to 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.910
 activate as a result become stronger for 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.590
 make sure your ankles and knees do 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.500
 they streamline home a lot 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.360
 important that we have been racing we go 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.399
 that we have the leg and try to 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.539
 keep the balance clear in fiano 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.250
 equilibrium 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.640
 remember you dissect librium 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:10.729
 agrees that it will be a point only we finish 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:13.280
 still 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 and 1 very good 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.430
 now let's go down for a moment on the ground 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.220
 and we continue with our targeted exercises 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.490
 by the knees to see a knee 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.970
 slimmer is more beautiful 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.670
 laterally and pull up the inner thighs 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.400
 towards the ceiling I wanted you to remember 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.200
 the part of the south and the thigh that it is 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.850
 facing the ceiling those who are 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.010
 working and we want to go 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.640
 go here to work within the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.700
 knee 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:47.440
 ok small little circle circulating 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:50.130
 still supply 7 6 5 4 3 2 stop the other 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:58.160
 part 87 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:03:01.920
 6 5 4 3 2 1 now let's do a 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.710
 long and heel extension as if you are 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.320
 trying to send an energy film 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.590
 from the hip over the range and sending them to 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:18.450
 gila altavilla pago eder of the wall ok a 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:20.730
 long 2 3 4 5 6 7 and stop 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.740
 ok change side we turn find 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.260
 on the other side and consequently 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.510
 we have the range back to the 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:36.690
 our stupid and let's go for a 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:42.900
 small circle 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:45.570
 on the other side backwards 8 7 6 5 4 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.850
 3 2 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:54.450
 now read the hammer foot e 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:04:03.660
 let's go to extension 23 45 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:10.260
 6 7 8 9 10 still we do other 6 5 4 3 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:12.060
 2 and very good stops now we return e 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.640
 let's go on the back right on the 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.650
 back to go to work on 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.389
 that is, no, that I then lean on 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.130
 on the elbows 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.109
 I get on my feet just must 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.660
 grab the ball 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.120
 ok and I push and push together 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.760
 I push like I was trying this far 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.020
 burst the ball right between the feet 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.150

 it's sailing from here 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.260
 I pick up the ball through that at 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:56.620
 knees ok it's one at a time 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:04.380
 when the leg ok I stretch and go back that 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:09.490
 two around and three continuous 4 again 56

 the ball to fall jonas and on think 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:26.770
 always of this question of established 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:28.230
 no stability will have 4 3 out of two last or 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.460
 that bends the legs 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.300
 check that the ball is in good shape 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.650
