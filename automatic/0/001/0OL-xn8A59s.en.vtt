Septimus<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.360> big<00:00:12.540> part<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.960> my<00:00:13.139> program

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
Septimus a big part of my program

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.760 
Septimus a big part of my program
actually<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:14.130> would<00:00:14.400> say<00:00:14.520> the<00:00:14.820> biggest<00:00:15.150> part

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
actually I would say the biggest part

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.530 
actually I would say the biggest part
everybody<00:00:16.770> diets<00:00:17.400> everybody<00:00:17.940> eat<00:00:18.210> certain

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:18.540 
everybody diets everybody eat certain

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.330 
everybody diets everybody eat certain
foods<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.110> try<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.410> certain<00:00:19.830> way<00:00:19.980> but

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
foods and try a certain way but

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.550 
foods and try a certain way but
supplements<00:00:20.939> very<00:00:21.119> sad<00:00:21.360> I<00:00:21.660> want<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.259> explain

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
supplements very sad I want to explain

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.019 
supplements very sad I want to explain
the<00:00:22.740> difference<00:00:22.770> that<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.520> would<00:00:23.670> like<00:00:23.849> people

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
the difference that I would like people

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.730 
the difference that I would like people
to<00:00:24.240> really<00:00:24.480> pay<00:00:24.689> attention<00:00:24.720> about<00:00:25.290> I'm<00:00:25.470> going

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
to really pay attention about I'm going

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.040 
to really pay attention about I'm going
to<00:00:25.830> say<00:00:26.099> you're<00:00:27.060> taking<00:00:27.240> certain<00:00:27.660> kind<00:00:27.960> of

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
to say you're taking certain kind of

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.590 
to say you're taking certain kind of
proteins<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.190> have<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> way<00:00:29.699> isolate<00:00:29.939> and

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
proteins and you have a way isolate and

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.530 
proteins and you have a way isolate and
Kazim<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.320> slow<00:00:31.560> fast<00:00:32.010> intermediate<00:00:32.940> you

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
Kazim and slow fast intermediate you

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.880 
Kazim and slow fast intermediate you
take<00:00:33.720> all<00:00:33.870> kinds<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.170> protein<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.769> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
take all kinds of protein and the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.950 
take all kinds of protein and the
results<00:00:35.280> question<00:00:35.670> how<00:00:36.210> many<00:00:36.480> grams<00:00:36.809> of

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
results question how many grams of

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.600 
results question how many grams of
protein<00:00:37.019> per<00:00:37.590> pound<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.980> bodyweight<00:00:38.280> is

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
protein per pound of bodyweight is

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.210 
protein per pound of bodyweight is
necessary<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.960> bodybuilders<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
necessary for the bodybuilders for the

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.979 
necessary for the bodybuilders for the
endurance<00:00:41.580> athletes<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:42.239> average

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989

individual but nobody really recognized

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.810 
individual but nobody really recognized
why<00:00:46.230> do<00:00:46.290> you<00:00:46.410> need<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> protein<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.640> not

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
why do you need a protein it's not

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.930 
why do you need a protein it's not
protein<00:00:48.719> what<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.989> need<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
protein what you need is the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.040 
protein what you need is the
constituents<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.210> protein<00:00:51.629> which<00:00:51.809> are

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
constituents of a protein which are

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.700 
constituents of a protein which are
amino<00:00:52.500> acids<00:00:53.040> and<00:00:53.700> really<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.329> say<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.469> right

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
amino acids and really I say this right

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.209 
amino acids and really I say this right
now

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
now

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.400 
now
amino<00:00:56.850> acids<00:00:57.270> are<00:00:57.390> really<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> future<00:00:58.320> of

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
amino acids are really a future of

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.860 
amino acids are really a future of
supplementation<00:00:59.160> because<00:00:59.309> in<00:01:00.180> essence<00:01:00.719> if

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
supplementation because in essence if

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.479 
supplementation because in essence if
you<00:01:00.960> ask<00:01:01.110> yourself<00:01:01.469> why<00:01:01.680> affects<00:01:02.039> some<00:01:02.250> kind

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
you ask yourself why affects some kind

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.090 
you ask yourself why affects some kind
of<00:01:02.579> protein<00:01:02.820> or<00:01:03.320> poly<00:01:04.320> building<00:01:04.619> supplement

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
of protein or poly building supplement

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.969 
of protein or poly building supplement
is<00:01:05.550> to<00:01:05.759> get<00:01:05.940> the<00:01:06.090> high<00:01:06.360> valuable<00:01:07.200> accession

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
is to get the high valuable accession

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.380 
is to get the high valuable accession

eyes your body which means build the

eyes your body which means build the
tissue<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:18.780> not<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.960> protein<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.409> does

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
tissue so it's not a protein that does

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.920 
tissue so it's not a protein that does
it<00:01:19.890> really<00:01:20.100> it's<00:01:20.610> specific<00:01:21.210> amino<00:01:21.450> acids<00:01:21.869> from

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
it really it's specific amino acids from

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.810 
it really it's specific amino acids from
that<00:01:22.140> protein

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
that protein

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.609 
that protein
unfortunately<00:01:23.820> proteins<00:01:24.360> taken<00:01:24.960> would<00:01:25.439> give

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
unfortunately proteins taken would give

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.219 
unfortunately proteins taken would give
you<00:01:25.770> what<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.340> need<00:01:26.600> specific<00:01:27.600> amino<00:01:27.780> acids

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
you what you need specific amino acids

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.950 
you what you need specific amino acids
needed<00:01:28.500> but<00:01:29.130> also<00:01:29.159> other<00:01:30.030> amino<00:01:30.360> acids<00:01:30.720> if<00:01:30.840> you

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
needed but also other amino acids if you

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.230 
needed but also other amino acids if you
do<00:01:31.170> not<00:01:31.350> need<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.979> some<00:01:32.580> carbohydrates

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
do not need it and some carbohydrates

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.990 
do not need it and some carbohydrates
some<00:01:33.509> fat<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.049> unnecessary<00:01:34.830> nutrients<00:01:35.250> so

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
some fat and unnecessary nutrients so

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.450 
some fat and unnecessary nutrients so
you<00:01:36.720> take<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.020> protein<00:01:37.350> powder<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.979> get<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
you take the protein powder to get the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.850 
you take the protein powder to get the
menos<00:01:38.670> why<00:01:39.630> don't<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.900> take<00:01:40.079> exact<00:01:40.439> aminos

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
menos why don't you take exact aminos

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.920 
menos why don't you take exact aminos
that<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.100> need<00:01:41.310> for<00:01:41.729> whatever<00:01:42.150> job<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.750> need

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
that you need for whatever job you need

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.319 
that you need for whatever job you need
as<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.200> main<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.500> for<00:01:44.090> instead<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.150> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
as the main is for instead of the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.420 
as the main is for instead of the
protein<00:01:45.720> because<00:01:45.990> you're<00:01:46.170> gonna<00:01:46.290> get<00:01:46.500> exact

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
protein because you're gonna get exact

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.510 
protein because you're gonna get exact
formula<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.509> nutrient<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.110> want

formula of a nutrient that you want

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.740 
formula of a nutrient that you want
amino<00:01:50.520> acids<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.060> most<00:01:51.360> important

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
amino acids the most important

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.569 
amino acids the most important
nutritional<00:01:52.110> supplements<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.799> my<00:01:52.920> opinion<00:01:53.340> I

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
nutritional supplements in my opinion I

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.850 
nutritional supplements in my opinion I
was<00:01:54.329> really<00:01:54.630> through<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> years<00:01:55.229> huge<00:01:55.680> in

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
was really through the years huge in

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.340 
was really through the years huge in
protein<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.549> really<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.210> didn't<00:01:57.450> elaborate

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
protein but really I didn't elaborate

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.050 
protein but really I didn't elaborate
the<00:01:58.680> reason<00:01:58.979> why<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.100> was<00:01:59.340> recommending<00:01:59.939> that

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
the reason why I was recommending that

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.940 
the reason why I was recommending that
much<00:02:00.210> protein<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.750> you're<00:02:01.409> gonna<00:02:01.500> get

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
much protein is you're gonna get

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.460 
much protein is you're gonna get
amino<00:02:02.490> acids<00:02:02.880> from<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.210> protein<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:04.110> if<00:02:04.350> you

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
amino acids from that protein but if you

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.440 
amino acids from that protein but if you

do<00:02:08.369> not<00:02:08.519> need<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.479> now<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.750> mean<00:02:09.989> very

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
do not need and now I mean very

don't<00:02:13.049> take<00:02:13.320> just<00:02:13.560> any<00:02:13.829> protein<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.400> get<00:02:14.519> a

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
don't take just any protein to get a

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.130 
don't take just any protein to get a
little<00:02:14.820> bit<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.060> mineral<00:02:15.209> acids<00:02:15.660> for<00:02:15.840> what<00:02:15.989> you

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
little bit of mineral acids for what you

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.930 
little bit of mineral acids for what you
need<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.590> protein<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.519> going<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.730> give<00:02:17.850> you

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
need that protein is going to give you

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.500 
need that protein is going to give you
also<00:02:18.170> carbohydrates<00:02:19.170> non-essential<00:02:20.129> Nina

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
also carbohydrates non-essential Nina

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.509 
also carbohydrates non-essential Nina
since<00:02:20.689> they're<00:02:20.870> usually<00:02:21.140> black<00:02:21.980> eugenic

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
since they're usually black eugenic

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.190 
since they're usually black eugenic
which<00:02:22.670> means<00:02:22.909> amino<00:02:23.659> acids<00:02:23.959> can<00:02:24.080> be<00:02:24.110> converted

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
which means amino acids can be converted

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.589 
which means amino acids can be converted
into<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.829> glucose<00:02:25.189> so<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:25.819> get<00:02:26.209> all<00:02:26.420> this

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
into the glucose so you get all this

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.929 
into the glucose so you get all this
energy<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.349> you<00:02:27.470> don't<00:02:27.680> need<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.519> can<00:02:28.790> lose

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:28.939 
energy that you don't need you can lose

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:30.850 
energy that you don't need you can lose
body<00:02:29.180> fat<00:02:29.269> because<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:29.870> have<00:02:30.079> excess<00:02:30.709> you

body fat because you have excess you

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.800 
body fat because you have excess you
don't<00:02:31.040> need<00:02:31.159> it<00:02:31.310> so<00:02:31.489> if<00:02:32.239> you<00:02:32.329> understand<00:02:32.750> that

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
don't need it so if you understand that

don't need it so if you understand that
you're<00:02:33.049> taking<00:02:33.409> that<00:02:33.530> protein<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.099> get<00:02:34.250> the
