00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
giratina or this rakossa to come in more

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.520 
giratina or this rakossa to come in more

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
than likely the break woz was going to

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.230 
than likely the break woz was going to
come<00:01:50.710> in<00:01:50.860> because<00:01:51.070> he<00:01:51.640> has<00:01:51.820> that<00:01:52.030> magical

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
come in because he has that magical

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.810 
come in because he has that magical
airlock<00:01:52.900> ability<00:01:53.409> which<00:01:53.920> stop<00:01:54.190> which<00:01:54.580> would

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
airlock ability which stop which would

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.940 
airlock ability which stop which would
which<00:01:55.600> would<00:01:55.870> mean<00:01:56.020> that<00:01:56.080> you<00:01:56.320> will<00:01:56.440> out<00:01:56.620> speed

which would mean that you will out speed

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.940 
which would mean that you will out speed
be<00:01:57.280> on<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.550> next<00:01:57.729> turn<00:01:58.090> but<00:01:58.330> now<00:01:59.320> i'm<00:01:59.620> going<00:01:59.860> to
