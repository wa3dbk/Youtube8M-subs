00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.730
 Nice that you have turned on too 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.000
 this edition of let's play world of 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.810
 tanks and there I show you or drive 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.770
 we played with with the t 29 spits of 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.829
 brig 21 you can already see the map 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.140
 Kharkov and first floor animal and top 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:34.320
 animal is of course always very beautiful and 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.079
 always makes the most fun now always 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.719
 curious how fast and how 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.489
 Much mushrooms can be made from both 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.910
 it can be said properly 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.359
 the c29 is really made for 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.780
 this card is many many leaps 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.160
 Obstacles that change your life 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.140
 bad armored at the tank is 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.730
 really so obscured and that he then 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.699
 can work nicely with helm and then 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.539
 Does he really right he found looks 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.110
 you can use it in the game 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.720
 can 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.690
 so now we have the first one here 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:15.360
 heap of rubble he uses for himself as 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:17.850
 Of course the cover has a cover 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.410
 So little problem is so naive 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.010
 to get to the bishop of the art in 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.010
 of course, the case is so easy 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.580
 The next one will be presented again 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.580
 wave back 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.450
 harm currently 666 also made a 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.980
 bet number was at 6 out of here now 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.980
 they might not 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:48.830
 In any case, he has here now 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:51.080
 continue and now it comes out of it 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.260
 get here of course immediately 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.700
 welcome command from so from a 6 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.680
 not well done here so out at all 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.780
 it's clear that he's there 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:05.150
 he has to die and he does the cabbage too 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.620
 still personally in front 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.850
 is now the bishop partie will too 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.500
 ever made a point on him 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.480
 this is hopefully the revanche 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:18.350
 yes and nice one shot nice roll like that 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:22.760
 It should be short game for the bishop 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:25.040
 and the vk shot right on it 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.160
 in front of cassis ti 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.390
 Well, maybe you are not better off 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:38.810
 It would take another are 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:40.100
 maybe next time there's something 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.770
 since driving until his right yet 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.640
 something no there is nothing he is behind 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.269
 He has turned up the g1 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.750
 the wall thwarts the little one 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.890
 and there but now he's gone and 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.790
 Now we drove up a bit and 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.190
 Now he drives back the partie 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.630
 had shot at the 450 728 always 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:08.630
 just balanced from here 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:12.070
 but he still does not have enough here 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.070
 he wants to tear something else 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.400
 he definitely has enough opponents and 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.310
 just in at 8 of it can be quite 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:26.019
 methods opponents instead of 429 vk 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:30.690
 There is something for everyone there 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.690
 is the vkw gets only at 16 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.920
 the vk is not about experience 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.490
 you better think yourselves misty 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.010
 as a fight then I'm rather it 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.860
 alone is somewhere comfortable the a8 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.740
 But she will get it, too 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.330
 again a pure and he gets the 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.470
 step out he comes again plans 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.420
 then again no, unfortunately not 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.580
 then drive further ahead into the street 9 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.530
 to eleven of which he still very much 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:06.560
 there is the vk right there and there it is 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.120
 At the very top is exactly perfect 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.760
 that's why it did not work 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.110
 now comes the vk probably rom wants his 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.160
 draw a shot here 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.610
 place but will not create 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.810
 but managed to get the opponent 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.830
 shot and now he was saved that 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.040
 could actually be forward 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.710
 drive and easy again into the herb 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.390
 shoot 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.810
 pity actually would have change 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.990
 have to 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.990
 but he does not defend himself anymore 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.960
 long so who is dead 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.910
 what are we still ten and twenty 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.130
 stubborn e mail and the 59 16 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:50.540
 So there is a little bit of hp here 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:53.909
 for him still there is the 29 both bounce 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:58.150
 off and stable 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:59.650
 There he has him now comes on the need 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.539
 currently he has five tips 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.509
 his warrior will still be the enemy 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:13.259
 every case for less hours gets there 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:15.669
 he thinks the war is the kljb 29 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:19.199
 now what has come up at once 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.199
 once such a small one from behind 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:36.300
 59 of the now 29 comes naturally now 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:43.350
 he goes on the first time so that 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:44.850
 hit so now he has both here yes me 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.080
 say thank you for watching 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.000
 I hope you like it now 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.620
 In the last cool family also made 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.620
 until next time caramba
