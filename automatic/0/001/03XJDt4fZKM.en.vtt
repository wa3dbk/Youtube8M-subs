00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.030
 and then guys in this video bring a tip 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.450
 especially for you who like to 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.930
 Take the self portrait, that's good. 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.880
 next you can shoot photos 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.789
 using the volume button or the entire 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.550
 dossier that is good so we take it here 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.470
 in the galaxy and several other devices 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.119
 the button to take a photo will stay in 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.900
 show you 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.210
 let's accept the camera here the button to 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.400
 take a picture is here but when you have 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.140
 to strip 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.170
 When you have to take a self portrait. 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.239
 often you do not hit the spot 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.670
 right button and ends up losing 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.000
 Long time no longer able to take your picture. 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.920
 and if you really might have to take a 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.710
 A little work then for you who 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.710
 They like to take self-portraits. 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.739
 the application is the actor himself 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.289
 It's good for you guys, it's so visual. 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.090
 basically equal to our camera leaves 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:12.530
 I put a bottom line battery 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.530
 here we are good, so here it is 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.619
 it's the visual of our own actor 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.659
 I do not know that we are going here in the preferences 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.049
 for us to see some things that 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:36.640
 people have several options 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:38.960
 some work when you take the 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.850
 you tap anywhere in the 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.850
 screen that the back will be captured 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.020
 realizing then you will need more 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.799
 search for the button anywhere in the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:58.250

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:08.810
