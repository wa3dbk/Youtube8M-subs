00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:13.240
 very good i am the daniel shepherd and 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:17.660
 if here in brixen on the plose 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.490
 Beautifully beautiful panorama comes today 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.529
 it's all about curves wide curves 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.700
 with wide curves is often the problem 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.680
 that one is afraid to slip away 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.560
 By this fear one then gives way 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.269
 in the back the arms become long and 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.949
 through these long arms transfer 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:36.050
 all impulses from the ground back on the 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.000
 The heaviest body is ours 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.820
 constellation and then it will 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.080
 slipping even more encouraged 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.390
 I want to explain how to do it now 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.159
 better that one through the bend 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.900
 just more fun and above all 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.360
 security or security 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.970
 has more fun 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.979
 That's why we're trying first 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.809
 already this with the 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:59.000
 but to avoid stretched arms 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.830
 Stay relaxed here because only 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.070
 I already stand by this loose 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.890
 sovereign over in rat the wheel in the 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.750
 Turn curve and can thus here 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.000
 nice bumps of the ground 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.890
 compensate or maybe even 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.050
 if the wheel started to slip 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.650
 just by putting the poor and easy 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.770
 legs 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.380
 catching this slip mostly catches 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.620
 again after 10 cm 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:29.180
 then it goes in again what else 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:31.850
 important just for this majdic be 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.130
 stay up front is just the position on 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.110
 the wheel that I'm pretty brave that 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.290
 I'm both equally burdened 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.380
 in the curve and not everything on 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.350
 Rear wheel off because then call for 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.780
 Slightly slipped the next point is 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.550
 The curve line is the curve line 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.159
 actually like racing in a word 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.690
 nearly outside approach inwardly pure 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.880
 pull and out again 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.340
 let drift so that the radius of the 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.400
 curve brussels will continue and thus just 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.830
 Less centrifugal force occurs 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.790
 I mean the whole thing with my look 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.600
 I always have to stay one step ahead 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.209
 his 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.340
 I get to the bend as they first 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.019
 the point on the outside if I know 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.790
 that I will arrive safely 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.620
 look inside this is mine 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.720
 Next point where I then afterwards 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.160
 drive and if i know that i give them 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.480
 Arrive , the look goes back to 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.340
 outside to curve exit 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.590
 to search right now as well 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.459
 next, so always one step 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.190
 ahead 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.440
 especially with narrower ones 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.700
 It is always important to bend 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.560
 not only with your eyes so brussels 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.780
 above it but that one there 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.420
 in fact , this direction is also upside down 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.519
 curve turns because thus comparison on 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.049
 whole body as it were bussler dynamics 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.950
 with me in the curve purely 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.780
 can turn 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.180
 that you can then later just yet 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:55.470
 sporty an expansion on that is already 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:57.930
 times, the first approach is always very fond of 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.940
 that speed is also important 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.099
 plays role because if I like the 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.840
 full throttle into the bend 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.640
 drive and then I realize that way 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.109
 fast or the curve is too tight 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.400
 then I have only a small one 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.660
 Time window where I change my speed 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.549
 can adapt 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.010
 that is usually the pants and me 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.720
 must then either out again peter lee 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.940
 or I do not grab the curve 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.599
 of course here with this abyss so 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.549
 That's why I always recommend 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.870
 very slowly into the curve and if 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.459
 He then realizes in the middle is here 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.049
 everything could still brake the brakes 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.919
 open and then you will automatically 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.130
 more quickly 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:34.410
 that is beginning at maybe once 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.060
 also have to step backwards but there 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.040
 you can then safely increase 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.049
 a feeling for the underground and for 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.609
 get the wheel and thus continue 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.269
 opposite 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.269
 besides, it does so 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.740
 so as a small additional tip is still if 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.630
 I can turn my wheel in the curve purely 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.240
 I have my saddle here on the thigh 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.990
 create because so the wheel is here 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.600
 stable in it and does not dangle 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.470
 between the thighs back and forth 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.770
 what then back to the 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:18.430
 Steering would affect 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.920
 if I already here investor so am 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.230
 inside the thigh is beautiful 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.990
 stable 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.600
 Also still in demand 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.660
 is the ball position normally 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.000
 A horizontal position is just enough 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.300
 more aggressive around the bend drives all the more 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.860
 athletic now first makes the 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.780
 sometimes to put balls vertically 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.760
 because then I just stand with mine 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.970
 lower on more pressure on the 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.970
 can mature 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.160
 the vertical position I back there 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.440
 up to 17 centimeters deep are the 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.120
 Of course this means that it supports them again 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.580
 long arms and the rear classic 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.530
 so never forget when he's behind 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.440
 vertical time in front also go deeper 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.940
 so that he clean the wheel clean that lies 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.240
 it was already from the curves front 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.540
 I wish you good luck and much 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.540
 fun
