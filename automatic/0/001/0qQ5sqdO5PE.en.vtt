 in 1979 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.869

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.269
 understanding san pietro 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.039
 where he thrilled if he said that in fact 2 times a week in Krakow 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.650

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:53.109
 unfortunately he says I can't ride Rome with this one 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.800
 I would like to take care of it 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.120

 sporting that the ata carpet also this water concept 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.580
 here we have this seal that the estate 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.970
 the like humoron plan with us 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.110
 I don't know many we have the pirate 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.690
 and this, instead, that really operated Castel Gandolfo to walk 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.700
 a thing is not a normal thing 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.390
 one thing to what happens sometimes in life is like a bit of self this 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.990
 great luck 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.870

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.810
 luck 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.329
 as it is text love trying to make a new bike with a new material 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.450
 I thought 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.040
 to carbon 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.640
 Kylion 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.250
 has a factory 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.340
 of formula 1 the best is the Ferrari 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.290
 uto body of anxiety assisi 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.650
 hallo then I say engineer from Ferrara in the company 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.480
 n86 we started making this plant as it was called concert 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.910
 pounded the first bicycle I made in carbon even with the 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.550
 carbon conjunctions 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.360
 more 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.320
 hydraulic brakes 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.050
 cont an extendable attack 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.520
 painting and with a special lunch 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.220

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.059
 nice company 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:12.079
 this was the first study as did paola ferrari 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.389
 after that 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:19.169
 the wheels and the great enzo ferrari is marked, I made a drawing of it 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:20.739
 a man love 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.659
 good morning his study 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.959
 all this coloration data. their currency if 87 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.779
 then we did 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:32.669
 2 years later he made me the c 35 that you can't get a picture on the road in 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:33.799
 carbon 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.419
 monos little by completing our polidori 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:39.849
 have begun to compete to win 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.809
 with that it was ferrari after we started 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:44.579
 to do 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.349
 fish f1 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.209
 we made 500 pieces 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.609
 ac s 2 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.459
 3 cf4 recipes until this year 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.729
 what I did on cs 7 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:03:00.060
 the stars with enrico the toy car all the time made 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.169
 it also shows 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:06.599
 also the tenology to one year in year as an advanced water the handlebar 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.379
 all 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.829
 here is the party doing 250 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.559
 it wasn't all numbered 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:17.029
 in the tat bike in the future after after about ten years 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:20.539
 but ming we did this dc4 dynamic though 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.609
 the Serbian carbon existed does not exist or he or care to do this report 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.419
 we did everything 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:32.590
 in light alloy but it is in steel for the kept perocco number one special 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:34.520
 because in fact it was us 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.359
 the first to invent 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.409
 larry dynamism of the montebelluno handlebar of the many European way it is 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:41.129
 gone 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.129
 at 55 250 on average 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.929
 I'll start after 2 months 

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:50.749
 I wanted to increase the record again to 55 go 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:53.819
 still 50 seo 57 then 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.019
 in collaboration with Ferrari 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.440
 we made the bike say so extremely advanced 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:05.159
 conduct and proci dings in carbon molds someone needs one thing 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.509
 awesome 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:08.459
 so exceptional 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.799
 the wheels are like one sees that they are drawing like a ball from times 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.119
 penetration 

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:15.400
 the first of July 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.439
 angel of name with carbon 

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:19.680
 all that carbon sees 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.109
 I see a crank talk 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.360
 tiempo in a few words was so urodynamic acts 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.289
 the international cycling federation 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.380
 abbott chateau because he said it was 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.789
 tylenol today too advanced 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:39.759
 sorry this because the whole world the technology advances in the motorcycles in the 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.540
 smooth machines 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.270
 while for the bike it has become normal 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.150
 this is giuseppe saronni's bike 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.059
 who won the capiate in the world 82 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:51.699
 he won 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.559
 the tour of Italy 83 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:56.620
 whoever also won my let's get out of '82 so he won 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.900
 world sanremo 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.289
 with this he says not wanted to change here 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.159
 these of saronno now ride 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:03.789
 and the steel fairy 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.960
 then it all begins to pity that the world of fraele 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.300
 more tv 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.669
 of camillo slips that of badminton 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.889
 I didn't even stock up on titanium flywheel 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.309
 get yourself back into titanium piero bit ita convinced the mount won the world championship 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:21.589
 a nolan wind 

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:24.330
 ina s concert 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.409
 Moreover 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.960
 it proves to prove that indeed 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.270
 with carbon 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.770
 and it's not true that then carbon and napoli are, however, dangerous 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:33.860
 and demonstrates 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.539
 with the hook ok 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:39.330
 that we have won five races the most difficult race in the game world 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.589
 wound 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:41.979
 then this is the flai 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.229
 adult says he made you as a column was as many bikes 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.729
 stopwatch were specialized 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.889
 this last creature that we present this year 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:52.809
 to taipei 

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:54.699
 and then 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.690
 the fair at the fair of rimini nicolaferrini happy next door 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:01.969
 the milan fair the senna star 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:03.309
 it's a masterpiece 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:05.210
 really studied 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.599
 for the dynamicity 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:10.099
 I was running with this 104 now 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.339
 as he sees it, everything has been put into new place because my brother 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.270
 autosystem had new 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.759
 but then 1150 about 59 years ago 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.330
 i fuck d ranvo 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.630
 and I won some amateur courses 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.809
 with this bike 

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:28.369
 put it as a museum to see the heat like 

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:30.909
 coral on only three reports 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.309
 it's one in front of the social 11 

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:34.580
 the two in front 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.159
 chernobyl weight 22 

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:41.909
 122 first reports there was no mercy and unfortunately such an example 58 58 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:43.509
 Years ago 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:47.279
 however, he will dedicate the bicycle and lead to remain so close to his heart 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.629
 the mass here
