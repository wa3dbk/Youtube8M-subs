 j 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.239
 number of nights was teacher researcher in applied mathematics 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.469
 how I got there it turns out that year wiesen% 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.710
 he was expected to our with the vod on the issue happened to them in bordeaux 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.290
 john's second factor 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.320
 but there was no for the network did not show up 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.740
 and so I'm backing away from mathematical studies 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.950
 % and I registered in the licenses did not cheat that Greek 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.329
 and for 100 es of the place 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.740
 so look for their conference room 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.740
 we are all researchers at the wheel or with friends 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.050
 and for that I do applied mathematics 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.820
 and she's a day without and 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.350
 and I wanted to take a step of synthesis between the two trades and 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.660
 so piano tuner 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.700
 and percent 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.530
 and researchers in applied mathematics 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.900
 it turns out that it was at this time the processors started 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.560
 become them too the fast way to do 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.210
 gift simulation 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.850
 I met jaw-dropping julien fournier 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.640
 and with whom I talked about my project 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.740
 p the member for paris so grosso our laboratory 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.740
 of the simulation protection project 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.630
 by computer 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.340
 she 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.070
