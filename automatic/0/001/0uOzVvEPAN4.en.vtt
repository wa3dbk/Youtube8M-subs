 theoretically it has nothing but dips 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.100
 it should be feasible 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.140
 I can do 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.620

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:16.850
 rat tata level 13 it may not be 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.590
 necessarily a good idea this is the 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.820

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.820

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:53.280
 ok so we can make him crash 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:57.570
 quietly ok we still scratch 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.570

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:09.910

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:13.070
 that only ok okay 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.810
 yeah that's not necessarily ideal for that 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.810
 you are doing without tropical 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.770
 as we are good samaritans 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.650
 we will make a real entrance to the center 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:33.040
 pokemon it's a pity they have this 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:34.190
 little what bug in quotation marks at the 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.790
 shit 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.159

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.159
 I am bad I am 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.840
 to which target 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.640
 ivey john stop people who will say 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:05.070

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:10.760
 recover 2b thanks people you is 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.760
 crappy 1 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.800
 2 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:21.049
 3 and we can recover hockey is the 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.820
 we will soon be doing our first 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.490
 pokemon then on the other hand I miss a 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.910
 element nato volodia a moment that 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:34.340
 element since I have a look at but 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:36.190
 if we do that and that then I know more 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.669
 what it is is it a button 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:44.810
 where is it I do not know too much 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:46.699
 listened we'll see I'll cook 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.250
 4 I do not know if it's a button 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:52.639
 is necessary or if it's a stone 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.139
 lily in any case it's one of two so 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.210
 listen we'll start with a stone 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.190
 lily we will see 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.580
 1800 that just put them ko this 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.440
 a choice is in this sense I pass 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.660
 on the road it is in this sense 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.180
 good anyway neither of the two approaches 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.750
 so it's going to be a button to make a 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.850
 button 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:17.040
 I know buttons it's just a trick 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.310
 bartering is very good but finally we have 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:26.490
 made an hour too good then the button 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:31.410
 who olio crowd from down and and I listened 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:33.450
 beautiful their race behind the scenes and balla on 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.710
 manage one manages finally one has a pokÃ©ball 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.420
 what did you also say that the 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.820
 starters was more complicated to capture 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.010
 and that was why I had 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.380
 a lot of trouble capturing the group 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:48.450
 kwik did besides I did not miss nor 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:52.530

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:11.439

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:15.490

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:21.430

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:23.649
