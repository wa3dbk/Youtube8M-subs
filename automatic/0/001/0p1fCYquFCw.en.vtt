00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
also when you're ahead you never want to

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:17.529

ended<00:01:54.950> up<00:01:55.070> breaking<00:01:55.340> him<00:01:55.610> so<00:01:55.970> it<00:01:56.030> was<00:01:56.120> for<00:01:56.360> free

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
ended up breaking him so it was for free

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.460 
ended up breaking him so it was for free
then<00:01:58.070> I<00:01:58.100> came<00:01:58.340> back<00:01:58.400> to<00:01:58.610> 40<00:01:59.000> and<00:01:59.360> I<00:02:00.020> think<00:02:00.320> he

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
then I came back to 40 and I think he

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.430 
then I came back to 40 and I think he
held<00:02:00.710> so<00:02:00.950> I<00:02:00.980> think<00:02:01.280> he<00:02:01.370> was<00:02:01.520> 54<00:02:01.970> up<00:02:02.150> and<00:02:02.330> then<00:02:03.320> I

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
held so I think he was 54 up and then I

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.970 
held so I think he was 54 up and then I
think<00:02:03.740> after<00:02:04.640> their<00:02:05.210> I<00:02:05.240> wonder<00:02:05.840> set<00:02:06.080> 7-5<00:02:06.500> I

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
think after their I wonder set 7-5 I

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.400 
think after their I wonder set 7-5 I
believe<00:02:07.430> it<00:02:08.090> was<00:02:08.270> a<00:02:08.330> close<00:02:08.629> second<00:02:09.020> set<00:02:09.200> but

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
believe it was a close second set but

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.190 
believe it was a close second set but
from<00:02:09.830> full<00:02:10.280> one<00:02:10.489> down<00:02:10.700> basically<00:02:11.150> almost<00:02:11.569> five

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
from full one down basically almost five

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.740 
from full one down basically almost five
one<00:02:12.500> down<00:02:12.709> to<00:02:13.280> win<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.579> set<00:02:13.790> 7-5<00:02:14.120> was<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.510> big

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
one down to win the set 7-5 was a big

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.790 
one down to win the set 7-5 was a big
effort

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
effort

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.370 
effort
and<00:02:15.890> in<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.400> third<00:02:16.430> set<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:17.150> did<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.930> same<00:02:18.170> I

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
and in the third set I did the same I

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.010 
and in the third set I did the same I
just<00:02:18.800> kept<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.190> ball<00:02:19.370> in<00:02:19.810> consistent<00:02:20.810> tennis

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
just kept the ball in consistent tennis

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.100 
just kept the ball in consistent tennis
not<00:02:21.650> going<00:02:21.890> for<00:02:22.070> too<00:02:22.220> much<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:23.750> started<00:02:24.080> to

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
not going for too much and it started to

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.380 
not going for too much and it started to
really<00:02:24.350> affect<00:02:24.740> him<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.430> think<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:26.150> want<00:02:26.360> to

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
really affect him and I think I want to

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.290 
really affect him and I think I want to
set<00:02:26.630> 6-3<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:29.120> from<00:02:29.650> 6141<00:02:30.650> down<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.460> managed<00:02:32.270> to

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
set 6-3 so from 6141 down I managed to

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.660 
set 6-3 so from 6141 down I managed to
turn<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.780> match<00:02:32.960> around<00:02:33.290> just<00:02:34.100> by<00:02:34.280> actually

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
turn the match around just by actually

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.340 
turn the match around just by actually
not<00:02:34.880> going<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.240> too<00:02:35.420> much<00:02:35.600> just<00:02:35.930> by<00:02:36.110> saying

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
not going to too much just by saying

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.590 
not going to too much just by saying
okay<00:02:36.740> if<00:02:36.980> this<00:02:37.370> guy's<00:02:37.610> going<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:37.880> win<00:02:38.090> it's
