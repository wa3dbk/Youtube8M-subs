00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.940 

all<00:02:33.989> right<00:02:34.140> now<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.409> we<00:02:34.470> have<00:02:34.560> most<00:02:34.709> of<00:02:34.859> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
all right now that we have most of the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.530 
all right now that we have most of the
pieces<00:02:35.099> painted<00:02:35.640> we<00:02:35.760> could<00:02:35.879> start<00:02:36.090> assembling

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
pieces painted we could start assembling

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.399 
pieces painted we could start assembling
them<00:02:36.750> all<00:02:36.870> back<00:02:36.989> together

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
them all back together

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.610 
them all back together
as<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.489> can<00:02:38.579> see<00:02:38.730> put<00:02:38.970> most<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.620> larger

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
as you can see put most of the larger

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.899 
as you can see put most of the larger
pieces<00:02:40.859> back<00:02:41.159> together<00:02:41.340> we<00:02:41.609> still<00:02:41.730> have<00:02:41.879> a

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
pieces back together we still have a

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.539 
pieces back together we still have a
bunch<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.299> interior<00:02:42.780> stuff<00:02:43.049> to<00:02:43.170> do<00:02:43.549> we'll

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
bunch of the interior stuff to do we'll

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:45.589 
bunch of the interior stuff to do we'll
