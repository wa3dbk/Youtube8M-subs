00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
as a bass player why do you choose looks

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.240 
as a bass player why do you choose looks
or<00:00:17.369> strings<00:00:17.900> elixirs<00:00:18.900> just<00:00:19.170> sound<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.859> feel

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.130 
and last longer than any other string
I've<00:00:22.859> played<00:00:23.100> they<00:00:23.670> feel<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.390> good<00:00:24.660> they're<00:00:24.869> so

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
smooth the cut the coating on them is

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.550 
smooth the cut the coating on them is
comfortable<00:00:29.010> friendly<00:00:29.640> feels<00:00:30.119> familiar<00:00:30.560> the

comfortable friendly feels familiar the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.630 
comfortable friendly feels familiar the
tone<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:32.040> round<00:00:32.369> big<00:00:33.200> fat<00:00:34.200> punchy<00:00:34.829> especially

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
tone is round big fat punchy especially

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.510 
tone is round big fat punchy especially
in<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> low<00:00:36.030> mids<00:00:36.329> with<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> nickel<00:00:36.989> strings

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
in the low mids with the nickel strings

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.250 
in the low mids with the nickel strings
the<00:00:38.520> stainless<00:00:38.910> steel<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> great<00:00:39.629> top<00:00:39.960> and

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
the stainless steel have a great top and

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.330 
the stainless steel have a great top and
they<00:00:40.350> just<00:00:40.559> last<00:00:40.770> forever

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
they just last forever

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.799 
they just last forever
they<00:00:41.520> feel<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.910> new<00:00:42.180> set<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.540> strings

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
they feel like a new set of strings

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.350 
they feel like a new set of strings
every<00:00:43.500> time<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.739> pull<00:00:43.980> my<00:00:44.100> bass<00:00:44.280> out<00:00:44.489> yeah<00:00:45.329> I

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
every time I pull my bass out yeah I

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.119 
every time I pull my bass out yeah I
think<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.899> know<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.350> sort<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.590> just

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
think you know it's to sort of just

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.830 
think you know it's to sort of just
retaining<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.670> tone<00:00:48.000> life<00:00:48.239> longer<00:00:48.539> than<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
retaining that tone life longer than the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.080 
retaining that tone life longer than the
other<00:00:48.960> strings<00:00:49.320> yep<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.399> keys<00:00:50.579> really<00:00:50.879> in

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
other strings yep and the keys really in

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.810 
other strings yep and the keys really in
the<00:00:51.510> Nano<00:00:51.690> web<00:00:51.899> coding<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.770> was<00:00:53.100> round<00:00:53.520> strings

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
the Nano web coding so was round strings

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.639 
the Nano web coding so was round strings
which<00:00:53.969> are<00:00:54.090> go-to<00:00:54.329> for<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.870> many<00:00:55.050> bass<00:00:55.320> players

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
which are go-to for so many bass players

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.670 
which are go-to for so many bass players
just<00:00:55.980> get<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.460> big<00:00:56.820> full<00:00:57.149> round<00:00:57.649> clarity<00:00:58.649> of

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
just get that big full round clarity of

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.680 
just get that big full round clarity of
tone<00:00:58.980> right<00:00:59.399> but<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.090> problem<00:01:00.239> with<00:01:00.510> them<00:01:00.600> is

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
tone right but the problem with them is

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.420 
tone right but the problem with them is
that<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.289> gaps<00:01:01.500> between<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.890> windings<00:01:02.280> are

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
that the gaps between the windings are

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.830 
that the gaps between the windings are
spot<00:01:02.699> where<00:01:02.879> dirt<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.090> debris<00:01:03.359> can<00:01:03.539> collect

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
spot where dirt and debris can collect

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.329 
spot where dirt and debris can collect
and<00:01:04.049> that's<00:01:04.290> what<00:01:04.559> kills<00:01:04.830> your<00:01:04.920> tone

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
and that's what kills your tone

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.090 
and that's what kills your tone
so<00:01:05.820> by<00:01:06.270> coating<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.290> string<00:01:07.530> from<00:01:07.680> end<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.979> end

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
so by coating the string from end to end

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.429 
so by coating the string from end to end
it<00:01:08.549> provides<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.450> barrier<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.840> keep<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.260> gunk

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
it provides a barrier to keep that gunk

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.469 
it provides a barrier to keep that gunk
and<00:01:10.590> debris<00:01:10.890> from<00:01:11.040> not<00:01:11.310> collecting<00:01:11.790> there<00:01:11.970> and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
and debris from not collecting there and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.539 
and debris from not collecting there and
so<00:01:12.689> what<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.960> end<00:01:13.049> up<00:01:13.200> with<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> string

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
so what you end up with is a string

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.950 
so what you end up with is a string
that's<00:01:14.700> gonna<00:01:14.790> retain<00:01:15.090> its<00:01:15.150> tone<00:01:15.450> longer<00:01:15.840> than

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
that's gonna retain its tone longer than

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.050 
that's gonna retain its tone longer than
any<00:01:16.110> other<00:01:16.170> string<00:01:16.590> coated<00:01:17.100> or<00:01:17.189> uncoated<00:01:17.220> so

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
any other string coated or uncoated so

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.399 
any other string coated or uncoated so
what<00:01:18.420> about<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> field<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.140> string<00:01:19.229> is

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
what about the field of string is

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.870 
what about the field of string is
important<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.009> tend<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.580> a

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
important for you I tend to like a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.719 
important for you I tend to like a
string<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.990> feels<00:01:22.439> smooth<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.189> isn't<00:01:23.520> hard

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
string that feels smooth that isn't hard

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.410 
string that feels smooth that isn't hard
to<00:01:24.000> play<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.720> still<00:01:24.960> has<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> nice<00:01:25.909> feel<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
to play but still has a nice feel on the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.780 
to play but still has a nice feel on the
on<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.080> instrument<00:01:28.530> itself<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.430> elixirs

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
on the instrument itself the elixirs

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.399 
on the instrument itself the elixirs
have<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> nice<00:01:30.210> smooth<00:01:30.540> feel<00:01:30.840> my<00:01:31.020> hands<00:01:31.229> never

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
have a nice smooth feel my hands never

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.469 
have a nice smooth feel my hands never
get<00:01:31.680> stuck<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.220> string<00:01:32.549> noise<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:33.060> reduced

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
get stuck the string noise is reduced

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.770 
get stuck the string noise is reduced
dramatically<00:01:34.460> and<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.270> feel<00:01:36.570> they're

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
dramatically and they just feel they're

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.270 
dramatically and they just feel they're
easy<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.200> play<00:01:37.380> they're<00:01:37.590> familiar<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
easy to play they're familiar and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.179 
easy to play they're familiar and
comfortable<00:01:38.640> nice<00:01:39.240> yeah<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.560> when<00:01:41.009> we<00:01:41.100> were

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
comfortable nice yeah so when we were

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.710 
comfortable nice yeah so when we were
working<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.579> redeveloping<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.360> nano

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
working on redeveloping that nano

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.030 
working on redeveloping that nano
coating<00:01:43.079> for<00:01:43.200> bass<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.560> was<00:01:43.680> one<00:01:43.799> thing<00:01:43.920> we

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
coating for bass that was one thing we

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.200 
coating for bass that was one thing we
wanted<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.310> do<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.520> try<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.790> lot<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.090> from

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
wanted to do is try a lot of from

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.240 
wanted to do is try a lot of from
variations<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.439> figure<00:01:46.829> out<00:01:46.979> something<00:01:47.220> that

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
variations but figure out something that

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.310 
variations but figure out something that
really<00:01:47.549> works<00:01:47.700> well<00:01:47.820> for<00:01:47.970> bass<00:01:48.270> players<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:49.229> we

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
really works well for bass players so we

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.749 
really works well for bass players so we
took<00:01:49.470> all<00:01:49.799> those<00:01:49.920> variations<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.579> lot<00:01:50.700> of

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
took all those variations a lot of

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.859 
took all those variations a lot of
different<00:01:50.970> string<00:01:51.149> constructions<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.750> try

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
different string constructions and try

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.359
