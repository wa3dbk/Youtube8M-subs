really understood why I had that because

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.990 
really understood why I had that because
i<00:01:56.610> never<00:01:56.759> had<00:01:57.000> used<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.540> but<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.710> one<00:01:59.610> sense<00:01:59.850> it

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
i never had used it but in one sense it

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.429 
i never had used it but in one sense it
is<00:02:00.149> pretty<00:02:00.450> good<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.600> they<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:00.960> removed<00:02:01.259> it

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
is pretty good that they have removed it

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.990 
is pretty good that they have removed it
and<00:02:03.200> here<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.469> have<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:05.189> air<00:02:05.460> vents<00:02:05.850> which

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
and here you have the air vents which

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.499 
and here you have the air vents which
helped<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.680> places<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.710> 31<00:02:08.550> really<00:02:08.819> silent

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
helped the places in 31 really silent

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:17.010 
helped the places in 31 really silent
and<00:02:09.660> cool

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.710 

also<00:02:18.020> um<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:19.430> system<00:02:19.820> does<00:02:20.030> get<00:02:20.300> a<00:02:20.330> little<00:02:20.510> bit

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
also um the system does get a little bit

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.770 
also um the system does get a little bit
hot<00:02:20.960> but<00:02:21.380> that's<00:02:21.940> perfectly<00:02:22.940> normal<00:02:23.150> I've

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
hot but that's perfectly normal I've

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.440 
hot but that's perfectly normal I've
been<00:02:23.960> told<00:02:24.460> because<00:02:25.460> there's<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:26.060> brand<00:02:26.300> new

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
been told because there's a brand new

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.630 
been told because there's a brand new
chip<00:02:26.690> inside<00:02:27.050> that<00:02:27.440> helps<00:02:28.430> extract<00:02:30.400> less<00:02:31.400> heat

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
chip inside that helps extract less heat

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.670 
chip inside that helps extract less heat
from<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:31.880> system<00:02:32.360> which<00:02:33.140> makes<00:02:33.380> it<00:02:33.530> more

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
from the system which makes it more

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.870 
from the system which makes it more
efficient<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:39.160> system<00:02:40.160> i<00:02:40.280> think<00:02:40.520> is<00:02:40.670> really

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
efficient the system i think is really

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.920 
efficient the system i think is really
good<00:02:41.300> for<00:02:41.830> existing<00:02:42.830> users<00:02:43.280> also<00:02:43.750> people<00:02:44.750> who

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
good for existing users also people who

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.600 
good for existing users also people who
are<00:02:45.140> going<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.380> be<00:02:45.440> pile<00:02:45.740> of<00:02:45.860> places<00:02:46.190> in<00:02:46.400> three

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
are going to be pile of places in three

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.140 
are going to be pile of places in three
for<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.850> first<00:02:47.060> time<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:49.520> one's<00:02:49.880> really

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
for the first time it it one's really

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.550 
for the first time it it one's really
silent<00:02:50.780> it's<00:02:51.440> set<00:02:51.710> to<00:02:52.130> not<00:02:52.730> be<00:02:52.940> able<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.210> hear

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
silent it's set to not be able to hear

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.270
