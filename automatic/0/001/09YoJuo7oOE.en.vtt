00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
epidemic at this point in time and a lot

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.800 
epidemic at this point in time and a lot
of<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.430> has<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.670> do<00:01:29.939> with<00:01:30.090> what<00:01:30.299> children<00:01:30.689> are

of that has to do with what children are
eating<00:01:31.130> also<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.430> terms<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.759> all<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
eating also in terms of all the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.120 
eating also in terms of all the
chemicals<00:01:33.450> added<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.990> foods<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
chemicals added to the foods and the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.039 
chemicals added to the foods and the
beverages<00:01:35.700> yeah<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.210> beverages<00:01:36.659> are<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> whole

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
beverages yeah the beverages are a whole

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.410 
beverages yeah the beverages are a whole
nother<00:01:37.229> conversation<00:01:37.500> but<00:01:38.280> those<00:01:39.000> are<00:01:39.240> also

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
nother conversation but those are also

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.960 
nother conversation but those are also
contributing<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.890> poor<00:01:41.100> diet<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.700> once

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
contributing to the poor diet and once

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.450 
contributing to the poor diet and once
again<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.450> effects<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.290> are<00:01:43.680> broad<00:01:44.430> and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
again the effects of this are broad and

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.300 
again the effects of this are broad and
wide<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.439> can<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.680> very<00:01:46.860> confusing

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
wide and it can be very confusing

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.490 
wide and it can be very confusing
because<00:01:47.640> they<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:48.180> show<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:48.960> differently

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
because they can show up so differently

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.499 
because they can show up so differently
from<00:01:49.619> child<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.250> child<00:01:50.369> some<00:01:51.000> children<00:01:51.390> will

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
from child to child some children will

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.810 
from child to child some children will
have<00:01:51.600> immune<00:01:51.930> dysfunction<00:01:52.340> some<00:01:53.340> people<00:01:53.640> once

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
have immune dysfunction some people once

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.429 
have immune dysfunction some people once
again<00:01:53.970> will<00:01:54.299> have<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> behavioral<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
again will have the behavioral and the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.899 
again will have the behavioral and the
mood<00:01:55.619> disorders<00:01:57.469> other<00:01:58.469> children<00:01:59.070> will<00:01:59.340> just

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
mood disorders other children will just

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.999 
mood disorders other children will just
not<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.299> energy<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.810> will<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.439> feel<00:02:01.619> blah

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
not have energy and will just feel blah

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.679 
not have energy and will just feel blah
and<00:02:02.280> have<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.640> dark<00:02:02.850> circles<00:02:03.299> under<00:02:03.390> their

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
and have the dark circles under their

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.469 
and have the dark circles under their
eyes<00:02:03.869> or<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> lot<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.590> allergies<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.479> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
eyes or have a lot of allergies and the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.540 
eyes or have a lot of allergies and the
tricky<00:02:06.810> thing<00:02:07.020> here<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:08.340> can

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
tricky thing here is that that can

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.460 
tricky thing here is that that can
manifest<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:09.270> all<00:02:09.360> those<00:02:09.539> different<00:02:09.690> ways<00:02:10.050> in

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
manifest in all those different ways in

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.890 
manifest in all those different ways in
the<00:02:10.560> same<00:02:10.770> bottom<00:02:11.160> line<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.209> poor<00:02:12.450> diet

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
the same bottom line is the poor diet

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.320 
the same bottom line is the poor diet
that

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
that

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.680 
that
we're<00:02:13.600> given<00:02:14.410> our<00:02:14.530> children<00:02:15.010> in<00:02:15.190> this<00:02:15.340> country

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
we're given our children in this country

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.800 
we're given our children in this country
so<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:17.260> hope<00:02:17.860> that's<00:02:18.070> not<00:02:18.160> too<00:02:18.430> vague<00:02:18.790> but<00:02:19.390> the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
so I hope that's not too vague but the

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.350 
so I hope that's not too vague but the
effects<00:02:20.200> of<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.470> poor<00:02:20.770> diet<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.460> child<00:02:21.790> can

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
effects of the poor diet and a child can

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.090 
effects of the poor diet and a child can
really<00:02:22.600> manifest<00:02:23.200> in<00:02:23.320> a<00:02:23.380> number<00:02:23.740> of<00:02:23.830> ways<00:02:24.070> and

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
really manifest in a number of ways and

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.240 
really manifest in a number of ways and
once<00:02:24.550> again<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.940> idea<00:02:25.300> is<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:26.590> are<00:02:26.620> what

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
once again the idea is that you are what

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.920 
once again the idea is that you are what
you<00:02:27.430> eat<00:02:27.460> and<00:02:27.820> so<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.300> foods<00:02:28.570> that<00:02:28.690> we<00:02:28.900> eat

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
you eat and so the foods that we eat

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.320 
you eat and so the foods that we eat
it's<00:02:29.710> an<00:02:29.890> act<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.160> creation<00:02:30.520> in<00:02:30.910> terms<00:02:31.150> of

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
it's an act of creation in terms of

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.230 
it's an act of creation in terms of
making<00:02:31.810> us<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.680> then<00:02:32.950> contributes<00:02:33.550> to

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
making us and that then contributes to

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.510 
making us and that then contributes to
the<00:02:34.360> structure<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.440> body<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.310> lack

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
the structure of the body and the lack

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.210 
the structure of the body and the lack
of<00:02:36.550> appropriate<00:02:36.970> function<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:38.260> that's<00:02:39.010> what<00:02:39.190> I

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
of appropriate function so that's what I

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.430 
of appropriate function so that's what I
have<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.490> say<00:02:39.670> about<00:02:39.960> children<00:02:40.960> and<00:02:41.200> the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
have to say about children and the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.310 
have to say about children and the
effects<00:02:41.740> of<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.950> poor<00:02:42.130> diet
