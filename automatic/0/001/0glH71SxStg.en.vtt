which<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.190> should<00:02:55.370> be<00:02:55.870> then<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.620> xbox<00:02:58.069> and<00:02:58.280> ps3

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
which it should be then the xbox and ps3

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.150 
which it should be then the xbox and ps3
so<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.630> think<00:03:00.080> some<00:03:00.410> people<00:03:00.650> are<00:03:00.709> jumping<00:03:00.950> to

so I think some people are jumping to

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.039 
so I think some people are jumping to
conclusion<00:03:01.700> is<00:03:01.790> way<00:03:02.060> too<00:03:02.120> early<00:03:02.360> with<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.930> wii

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
conclusion is way too early with the wii

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.320 
conclusion is way too early with the wii
u<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.290> just<00:03:03.620> totally<00:03:04.040> dismissing<00:03:04.970> it<00:03:05.120> when

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
u and just totally dismissing it when

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.870 
u and just totally dismissing it when
you<00:03:05.510> really<00:03:05.930> shouldn't<00:03:06.319> and<00:03:07.190> we<00:03:07.310> should<00:03:07.670> the

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
you really shouldn't and we should the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.449 
you really shouldn't and we should the
lease<00:03:08.030> wait<00:03:08.360> and<00:03:08.630> see<00:03:09.290> what<00:03:09.500> they<00:03:09.680> they<00:03:10.310> have

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
3 is their frames per second because

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.620 
3 is their frames per second because
they<00:03:54.470> are<00:03:54.620> also<00:03:54.650> running<00:03:55.310> at<00:03:55.670> 60<00:03:56.299> frames<00:03:56.329> per

they are also running at 60 frames per
second<00:03:57.109> so<00:03:57.230> battlefield<00:03:57.829> 3<00:03:58.459> has<00:03:58.639> already<00:03:58.819> set

that<00:04:46.430> the<00:04:47.270> majority<00:04:47.450> of<00:04:47.900> gamers<00:04:48.560> if<00:04:48.800> you<00:04:49.280> say

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
that the majority of gamers if you say

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.040 
that the majority of gamers if you say
you<00:04:49.550> know<00:04:49.880> battlefield<00:04:50.210> 3<00:04:50.570> it's<00:04:50.720> only<00:04:50.930> going

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
you know battlefield 3 it's only going

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.590 
you know battlefield 3 it's only going
to<00:04:51.110> run<00:04:51.290> at<00:04:51.470> 30fps<00:04:52.190> they<00:04:52.970> probably<00:04:53.270> don't<00:04:53.450> even

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
to run at 30fps they probably don't even

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.090 
to run at 30fps they probably don't even
know<00:04:53.780> what<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.230> heck<00:04:54.380> you're<00:04:54.410> talking<00:04:54.560> about

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
know what the heck you're talking about

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.900 
know what the heck you're talking about
so<00:04:56.000> I<00:04:56.030> doubt<00:04:56.810> it's<00:04:57.260> going<00:04:57.500> to<00:04:57.650> be<00:04:57.800> that<00:04:58.100> big<00:04:58.880> of

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
so I doubt it's going to be that big of

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.880 
so I doubt it's going to be that big of
a<00:04:59.150> deal<00:04:59.360> but<00:04:59.690> modern<00:05:00.140> warfare<00:05:00.320> 3<00:05:00.500> is

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
a deal but modern warfare 3 is

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.420 
a deal but modern warfare 3 is
definitely<00:05:01.490> trying<00:05:01.760> to<00:05:01.910> make<00:05:02.060> it<00:05:02.150> a<00:05:02.210> deal

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
definitely trying to make it a deal

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.130 
definitely trying to make it a deal
because<00:05:04.430> they<00:05:04.820> feel<00:05:05.060> that<00:05:05.330> that's<00:05:05.480> one<00:05:05.900> edge

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
because they feel that that's one edge

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.710 
because they feel that that's one edge
that<00:05:06.440> they<00:05:06.590> have<00:05:06.890> over<00:05:07.520> their<00:05:08.060> competition

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
that they have over their competition

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.330 
that they have over their competition
they<00:05:08.840> did<00:05:09.020> come<00:05:09.290> out<00:05:09.350> and<00:05:09.680> say<00:05:09.800> one<00:05:10.130> thing

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
they did come out and say one thing

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.890 
they did come out and say one thing
though<00:05:10.580> but<00:05:11.120> I'm<00:05:11.210> going<00:05:11.360> to<00:05:11.420> have<00:05:11.510> to<00:05:11.540> agree

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
though but I'm going to have to agree

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.190 
though but I'm going to have to agree
with<00:05:12.110> them<00:05:12.260> on<00:05:12.440> they<00:05:13.310> said<00:05:13.670> look<00:05:14.180> you<00:05:14.720> ship<00:05:15.050> a

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
with them on they said look you ship a

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.800 
with them on they said look you ship a
game<00:05:15.590> and<00:05:15.890> not<00:05:15.950> an<00:05:16.670> engine<00:05:17.120> and<00:05:17.270> it<00:05:17.600> was<00:05:17.780> a

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
game and not an engine and it was a

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.860 
game and not an engine and it was a
clear<00:05:18.290> direct<00:05:18.740> blow<00:05:19.010> at<00:05:19.340> battlefield<00:05:20.270> 3<00:05:20.630> who

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
clear direct blow at battlefield 3 who

frostbite<00:05:24.920> to<00:05:25.310> frostbite<00:05:25.940> 2<00:05:26.150> engine<00:05:26.630> they're

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
frostbite to frostbite 2 engine they're

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.110 
frostbite to frostbite 2 engine they're
really<00:05:27.560> pushing<00:05:27.920> this<00:05:28.160> engine<00:05:28.610> and<00:05:28.820> what<00:05:28.970> it's

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
really pushing this engine and what it's

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.950 
really pushing this engine and what it's
capable<00:05:29.330> of<00:05:30.490> whereas<00:05:31.490> I<00:05:31.850> guess<00:05:32.270> also<00:05:32.540> the

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
capable of whereas I guess also the

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.660 
capable of whereas I guess also the
engine<00:05:33.530> is<00:05:33.650> also<00:05:33.950> held<00:05:34.190> them<00:05:34.310> back<00:05:34.460> because

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
engine is also held them back because

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.600 
engine is also held them back because
it's<00:05:35.270> so<00:05:35.540> powerful<00:05:35.780> that<00:05:36.080> they<00:05:36.590> can't<00:05:37.430> get

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
it's so powerful that they can't get

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.760 
it's so powerful that they can't get
