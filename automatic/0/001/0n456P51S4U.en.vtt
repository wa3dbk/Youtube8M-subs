00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
ones the KNN I found for my bike which

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.009 
ones the KNN I found for my bike which
is<00:00:26.640> kind<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.029> cool<00:00:27.210> because<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> holder

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
is kind of cool because this is a holder

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
what the K&amp;N filters actually look like

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.910 
what the K&amp;N filters actually look like
it's<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.540> know<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:36.809> like<00:00:36.989> K&amp;N<00:00:37.559> filters

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
the best air flow and stuff so it's

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.790 
the best air flow and stuff so it's
really<00:00:43.920> cool<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.289> know<00:00:46.350> comes<00:00:46.680> with

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
a lot more just better throttle response

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.920 
a lot more just better throttle response
more<00:00:58.410> power<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.699> it's<00:01:00.180> hard<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> believe

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
more power I can it it's hard to believe

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.750 
more power I can it it's hard to believe
because<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.379> was<00:01:01.500> kind<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.920> skeptical<00:01:02.340> about

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
because I was kind of skeptical about

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.969 
because I was kind of skeptical about
the<00:01:02.940> whole<00:01:02.969> thing<00:01:03.379> you<00:01:04.379> know<00:01:04.439> reading<00:01:04.830> reviews

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
the whole thing you know reading reviews

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.510 
the whole thing you know reading reviews
on<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:06.170> yeah<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.380> gives<00:01:07.680> me<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.130> much<00:01:08.280> more

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
on like yeah it gives me so much more

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.550 
on like yeah it gives me so much more
power<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.330> pop<00:01:09.510> wheelies<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.020> second<00:01:10.409> third

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
power I can pop wheelies in second third

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.340 
power I can pop wheelies in second third
gear<00:01:10.799> now<00:01:11.010> before<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.490> couldn't<00:01:12.229> you<00:01:13.229> know<00:01:13.290> I

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
gear now before I couldn't you know I

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.870 
gear now before I couldn't you know I
was<00:01:13.950> kind<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.509> pessimist<00:01:15.509> if<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.900> will

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
was kind of the pessimist if you will

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.620 
was kind of the pessimist if you will
but<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.330> really<00:01:18.869> does<00:01:19.200> make<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.439> difference

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
but it really does make a difference

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.070 
but it really does make a difference
especially<00:01:21.630> with<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.770> know<00:01:22.799> top-end<00:01:23.250> speed

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
especially with you know top-end speed

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.410 
especially with you know top-end speed
before<00:01:25.080> if<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.100> was<00:01:26.250> just<00:01:26.430> sitting<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.270> bike

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
before if I was just sitting on the bike

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.170 
before if I was just sitting on the bike
regular<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.560> would<00:01:29.070> be<00:01:29.189> pinned<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.640> sixth<00:01:29.970> gear

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
regular I would be pinned in sixth gear

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.100 
regular I would be pinned in sixth gear
and<00:01:30.590> it<00:01:31.590> would<00:01:31.770> kind<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.430> top<00:01:32.670> out<00:01:32.930> on<00:01:33.930> this

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and it would kind of top out on this

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.210 
and it would kind of top out on this
road<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.439> have<00:01:34.770> right<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.070> my<00:01:35.159> neighborhood

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
road I have right in my neighborhood

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.280 
road I have right in my neighborhood
it's<00:01:35.820> not<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.450> longest<00:01:36.659> road<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.200> would

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
it's not the longest road but it would

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.060 
it's not the longest road but it would
top<00:01:37.500> out<00:01:37.650> at<00:01:37.710> about<00:01:37.920> 58<00:01:38.659> 60<00:01:39.680> in<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.740> same

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
top out at about 58 60 in the same

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.980 
top out at about 58 60 in the same
distance<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.700> same<00:01:41.880> Road<00:01:42.180> I'm<00:01:42.420> topping<00:01:42.869> out

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
distance the same Road I'm topping out

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.530 
distance the same Road I'm topping out
now<00:01:43.170> at<00:01:43.290> about<00:01:43.380> close<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.890> 65<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.180> amazing

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
now at about close to 65 so it's amazing

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.910 
now at about close to 65 so it's amazing
what<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> difference<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:46.259> does<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.649> with<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
what a difference it does just with the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.100 
what a difference it does just with the
flow<00:01:47.220> especially<00:01:48.060> since<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.630> have<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> stock

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
flow especially since I have a stock

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.080 
flow especially since I have a stock
exhaust<00:01:49.500> cuz<00:01:49.829> they<00:01:50.310> don't<00:01:50.460> make<00:01:50.610> any<00:01:50.820> exhaust

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
exhaust cuz they don't make any exhaust

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.899 
exhaust cuz they don't make any exhaust
for<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.540> bike<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.490> kind<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.759> cool

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
for this bike so it's just kind of cool

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.270 
for this bike so it's just kind of cool
and<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.630> gives<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> lot<00:01:55.439> more<00:01:55.560> power<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.070> if

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
and it gives you a lot more power so if

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.639 
and it gives you a lot more power so if
you're<00:01:56.399> looking<00:01:56.899> to<00:01:57.899> increase<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.320> power<00:01:58.469> of

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
you're looking to increase the power of
