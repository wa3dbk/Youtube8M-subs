move list it looks the same again but it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.890 
move list it looks the same again but it
isn't<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.670> moves<00:01:38.910> are<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.210> little<00:01:39.510> bit<00:01:39.690> easier

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
isn't the moves are a little bit easier

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.010 
isn't the moves are a little bit easier
to<00:01:40.110> perform<00:01:40.320> an<00:01:40.770> ECW<00:01:41.310> Anarchy<00:01:42.090> wolves<00:01:42.480> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
to perform an ECW Anarchy wolves the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.470 
to perform an ECW Anarchy wolves the
moves<00:01:43.260> also<00:01:43.680> seemed<00:01:43.890> easier<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.460> remember<00:01:44.790> so

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
moves also seemed easier to remember so

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.149 
moves also seemed easier to remember so
you<00:01:45.570> won't<00:01:45.750> be<00:01:45.960> going<00:01:46.230> to<00:01:46.260> the<00:01:46.470> move<00:01:46.650> list<00:01:46.920> so

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
you won't be going to the move list so

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.220 
you won't be going to the move list so
much<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:48.120> does<00:01:48.300> not<00:01:48.480> mean<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.750> won't<00:01:49.080> need

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
much that does not mean you won't need

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.649 
much that does not mean you won't need
to<00:01:49.409> access<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.980> move<00:01:50.159> list<00:01:50.430> at<00:01:50.610> all<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.450> some

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
to access the move list at all for some

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.930 
to access the move list at all for some
reason<00:01:52.050> during<00:01:52.230> a<00:01:52.409> match<00:01:52.620> the<00:01:53.159> move<00:01:53.400> list<00:01:53.670> was

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
reason during a match the move list was

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.230 
reason during a match the move list was
locked<00:01:54.240> who<00:01:54.840> made<00:01:55.080> this<00:01:55.260> decision<00:01:56.240> just

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
locked who made this decision just

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.970 
locked who made this decision just
because<00:01:57.300> the<00:01:57.630> controls<00:01:58.080> are<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.409> little<00:01:58.800> bit

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
because the controls are a little bit

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.850 
because the controls are a little bit
easier<00:01:59.430> than<00:01:59.970> games<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.960> hadn't<00:02:01.470> you<00:02:01.650> do

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
easier than games that hadn't you do

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.740 
easier than games that hadn't you do
moves<00:02:02.159> by<00:02:02.370> the<00:02:02.400> same<00:02:02.729> engine<00:02:03.120> that<00:02:03.240> does<00:02:03.630> not

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
moves by the same engine that does not

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.060 
moves by the same engine that does not
mean<00:02:03.990> they<00:02:04.020> can<00:02:04.290> lock<00:02:04.440> the<00:02:04.590> move<00:02:04.830> list

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
mean they can lock the move list

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.370 
mean they can lock the move list
whenever<00:02:05.610> they<00:02:05.820> want<00:02:06.120> who<00:02:06.690> is<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.990> stupid
