 the rest it's simple you go in 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.409
 playlist you are going to watch for example 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.360
 I do not know me a game that you like 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.130
 enormously for example I do not know I 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.630
 forest admit let's apply if not 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.740
 so many moments so you have to know 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.570
 that the playlists are a little bit 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.950
 different it's all things what 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.689
 I add in fact admit that the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.270
 playlist I write it two years ago I add 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.369
 a trick today down the catch goes back 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.479
 forward so in order to have the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.310
 most recent playlists 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.050
 you go there you will lose 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.730
 of creation and there it will put you all 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.260
 stressful creases for example or 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.920
 iphone stein drift green 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.659
 reid a flora at 502 dead gta and 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.129
 the fight I was online and it was in 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.019
 accepting so you see it's very 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.819
 well distributed so now things 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.530
 that I added simply these 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.000
 latest added video and here it is 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.860
 playlists changes a little bit what is 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.909
 quite logical so now 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.620
 admit you want to watch 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.430

 general it's going voom here is nothing good 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.230
 complicated we agree now 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.060
 also if there is any, they want to 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.190
 find a game a little bit old 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.139

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.159
 file plus there are quite a few people 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.170
 who ask me how to set a 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.940
 joystick on the console or on 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.859
 the computer is just here 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.659

 strategy to another walsh times it is 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.169
 Also available here is a lot of 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.970
 choice you look for yourself 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:23.879
 have all the tracks last of the 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.410
 assassins 4 there really is a whole 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.639
 oath so after that you to search 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.889
 poking around I can not know she's 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.750
 what are your tastes actually according to the 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.190
 video games there are recent games mean 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.810
 normal in fact there is really everything 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.799
 I see a lot of play see there 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.690
 games as they are quite 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.280
 reason that goes back from there except 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.690
 that I send so much is that it 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.000
 simply go back through 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.040
 example you have the last night not 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.480
 you have mafia ii you have murderers 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.459
 the others that I did yesterday and 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.840
 recently you have the multiplayer of 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.410
 they are everywhere by May 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.120
 in playlists 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.859
 to you to search is not complicated 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.989
 after the worst case you do everything 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.129
 simply date of creation of agreement and 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.019
 there you will find on my 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.150
 first playlist I created at 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.859
 the time and his voice allows you all 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.000
 just to find you that too 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.199
 not complicated you see that's what I 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.060
 you sincerely say everything is tidy 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:09.209
 and something also for example you type 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.569
 bodyguard in the bar of 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.370
 research 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.810
 see there hams that appears to you 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.859
 type for example a series that you 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.049
 are particularly interesting 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.970
 hassar 5 multi right next to you 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.250
 click and here you have the playlist 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.650
 a certain unity is not complicated 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.969
 having worse cases if even you have the 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.750
 woe to fall on the ass the first 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:27.490
 episode you 're just going 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.910
 if you will fall on the suggestion 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.610
 that I did to you here that's all is 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.080
 there all the playlist and even from 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.880
 the same on the description there is still 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.320
 the frankly thing the guy who gets 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.600
 not find out that he really wants 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.860
 not looking so really he wants 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.540
 watch videos on my channel well 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.650
 obviously after if you do not want 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.750
 that's still your choice 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.400
 so here you are just too 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.290
 about them a little bit my 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:55.030
 configuration the title of my channel 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:56.770
 so playlist here nothing complicated and 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.020
 video because there are people 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.250
 sometimes they will be absent for 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.480
 I do not know me who one day they go 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.310

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.410
 the brand new that is that I'm in

 doing on pc that is a lot 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.770
 more beautiful graphically you put it 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.990
 of course and swell and titian 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.240

 when you want and if they wanted 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.590
 pass on our game when I explain and 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.930
 you go under my pseudo here okay 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.979
 and you go to video in playlist 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.140
 where you type they throw directly 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.390
 bodyguard admitting what I was doing 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.979
 still showed a thing a word comes to me from 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.660
 you type for example father and z because 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:48.310
 that there are also people who love 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.169
 well pb to teeth or plan against zombies 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.430
 you type the game entirely it's 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.990
 much better way savall you the 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.270
 suggest you have the whole playlist by 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.320
 example of pvz nothing complicated and there 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.570
 it's the same you have the same system 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.460
 of links you have exactly the same 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.479
 the same stuff here is nothing good 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.760
 complicated we agree 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:06.520
 your frankly look at me click and I 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.050
 just fall on all that's it 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.490
 that's what I wanted to show you 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.540
 that there are quite a few people who 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.400
 say yeah there's too many videos I'm 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.729
 not lose on the contrary it's still 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.840
 better tidy than you think sincerely 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.340
 that they would not end up now
