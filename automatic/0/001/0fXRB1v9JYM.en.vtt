00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
you got one base here and one base all

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.470 
you got one base here and one base all
the<00:00:27.420> way<00:00:27.480> over<00:00:27.599> there<00:00:27.980> so<00:00:28.980> each<00:00:29.609> face<00:00:29.910> has<00:00:30.210> a

another one over another one right there

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.000 
another one over another one right there
there's<00:01:21.880> a<00:01:21.910> little<00:01:22.120> slit<00:01:22.630> in<00:01:22.660> the<00:01:22.930> wall<00:01:23.170> so<00:01:23.979> you

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
there's a little slit in the wall so you

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.210 
there's a little slit in the wall so you
can<00:01:24.430> have<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.850> have<00:01:28.150> two<00:01:28.540> snipers<00:01:28.979> on<00:01:29.979> each

ramp you can see people from the other

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.080 
ramp you can see people from the other
base<00:01:43.540> from<00:01:43.840> here<00:01:44.050> but<00:01:44.680> if<00:01:44.920> you<00:01:45.820> feel<00:01:46.060> like

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
if you playing capture the flag and you

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.800 
if you playing capture the flag and you
want<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.459> get<00:02:09.610> pretty<00:02:10.090> much<00:02:10.300> done<00:02:10.569> with<00:02:10.690> the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
game pretty fast you just gotta grab a

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.350 
game pretty fast you just gotta grab a
warthog<00:02:14.890> or<00:02:15.220> among<00:02:15.550> us<00:02:15.790> or<00:02:15.970> ghosts<00:02:16.300> or

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.950 

made<00:02:29.030> them<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:29.740> develop<00:02:30.740> this<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.870> any

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960

you got you also got this oops this this
is<00:02:44.960> pretty<00:02:45.560> much<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.770> big<00:02:46.100> pathway<00:02:46.730> from<00:02:46.790> one

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
is pretty much a big pathway from one

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.100 
is pretty much a big pathway from one
base<00:02:47.300> to<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.570> other<00:02:49.450> you<00:02:50.450> could<00:02:50.690> fit<00:02:51.080> a

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
base to the other you could fit a

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.480 
base to the other you could fit a
warthog<00:02:51.710> up<00:02:51.920> here<00:02:52.160> and<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:54.860> could<00:02:55.070> just<00:02:55.130> run

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
warthog up here and you could just run

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.550 
warthog up here and you could just run
through<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:55.820> real<00:02:56.090> fast<00:02:56.300> if<00:02:56.660> you<00:02:56.870> have<00:02:57.020> a<00:02:57.050> flag

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
through it real fast if you have a flag

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.190 
through it real fast if you have a flag
in<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:57.920> plane<00:02:58.100> capsule<00:02:58.520> flag<00:02:58.760> or<00:02:59.200> something

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
in the plane capsule flag or something

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.350 
in the plane capsule flag or something
like<00:03:00.290> that<00:03:00.350> or<00:03:00.770> there's<00:03:01.430> also<00:03:01.550> sniper<00:03:01.970> things

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
right here but I want to watch out both

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.780 
right here but I want to watch out both
bases<00:03:05.990> could<00:03:06.260> kill<00:03:06.800> you<00:03:08.740> but<00:03:09.740> uh<00:03:10.990> it's<00:03:11.990> also<00:03:12.110> oh

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
bases could kill you but uh it's also oh

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.340 
bases could kill you but uh it's also oh
yeah<00:03:13.790> there's<00:03:14.060> teleporter<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.900> show<00:03:15.170> you<00:03:15.230> this

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
yeah there's teleporter to show you this

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.960 
yeah there's teleporter to show you this
oh<00:03:17.140> yeah<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.380> one<00:03:18.560> thing<00:03:18.770> about<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.880> other

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
oh yeah and one thing about the other

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.740 
oh yeah and one thing about the other
base<00:03:20.180> is<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:22.160> opening<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.330> door<00:03:23.510> with<00:03:23.660> a

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
base is that the opening the door with a

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.380 
base is that the opening the door with a
big<00:03:23.900> bang<00:03:24.560> right<00:03:24.710> here<00:03:24.920> is<00:03:25.100> not<00:03:25.670> as<00:03:25.910> why<00:03:26.210> does

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
big bang right here is not as why does

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.930 
big bang right here is not as why does
this<00:03:26.510> one<00:03:26.720> see<00:03:27.500> it's<00:03:27.710> a<00:03:27.770> little<00:03:27.830> not<00:03:28.610> as<00:03:28.730> wide

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
this one see it's a little not as wide

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.510 
this one see it's a little not as wide
so<00:03:29.750> you<00:03:29.780> can't<00:03:30.320> fit<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.710> rate<00:03:30.920> through<00:03:31.340> that

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
so you can't fit the rate through that

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.150 
so you can't fit the rate through that
one<00:03:31.700> so<00:03:32.020> on<00:03:33.020> the<00:03:33.200> other<00:03:33.320> base<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.710> race<00:03:33.830> pretty

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
one so on the other base the race pretty

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.970 
one so on the other base the race pretty
much<00:03:34.340> just<00:03:34.520> be<00:03:34.700> for<00:03:35.030> behind<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.900> gates<00:03:36.770> or

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
much just be for behind the gates or

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.760 
much just be for behind the gates or
whatever<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.460> just<00:03:38.180> keep<00:03:38.450> blind<00:03:39.050> firing<00:03:39.530> so

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
whatever and just keep blind firing so

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:48.610 
whatever and just keep blind firing so
you<00:03:39.890> can<00:03:40.490> kill<00:03:42.340> but

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.020 

I<00:03:48.709> got<00:03:49.549> the<00:03:49.640> teleporters<00:03:50.209> one<00:03:51.670> you<00:03:52.670> can<00:03:52.819> choose

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
I got the teleporters one you can choose

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.619 
I got the teleporters one you can choose
to<00:03:53.090> go<00:03:53.360> through<00:03:53.599> this<00:03:53.750> one<00:03:54.049> I<00:03:54.349> wouldn't<00:03:55.069> really

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
to go through this one I wouldn't really

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.500 
to go through this one I wouldn't really
but<00:03:56.830> don't<00:03:57.830> tell<00:03:58.040> people<00:03:58.400> you<00:03:58.849> just<00:03:58.879> go<00:03:59.150> either

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
but don't tell people you just go either

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:13.569 
but don't tell people you just go either
you<00:03:59.629> or<00:04:10.930> or<00:04:11.930> it<00:04:12.560> also<00:04:12.739> leads<00:04:13.010> into<00:04:13.250> the<00:04:13.370> death

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
you or or it also leads into the death

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:20.870 
you or or it also leads into the death
also<00:04:13.819> that's<00:04:14.629> pretty<00:04:15.200> dangerous

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.320 

this<00:04:21.630> one<00:04:21.900> this<00:04:22.800> one<00:04:23.070> leads<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.550> either<00:04:23.880> base

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
this one this one leads to either base

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.630 
this one this one leads to either base
and<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:25.800> other<00:04:25.920> base<00:04:26.130> committed<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.550> the

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
and the other base committed to the

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.260 
and the other base committed to the
other<00:04:26.760> base<00:04:26.970> it<00:04:27.210> just<00:04:27.480> randomize<00:04:28.610> so<00:04:29.610> you

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
other base it just randomize so you

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.300 
other base it just randomize so you
could<00:04:30.420> have<00:04:30.570> say<00:04:31.230> you<00:04:31.290> have<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.890> flag<00:04:32.100> from

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
could have say you have the flag from

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.280 
could have say you have the flag from
this<00:04:32.490> one<00:04:32.670> you<00:04:32.910> be<00:04:33.060> like<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.780> just<00:04:33.990> run<00:04:34.170> in

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
this one you be like you just run in

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.020 
this one you be like you just run in
here<00:04:34.500> and<00:04:34.650> you're<00:04:35.070> already<00:04:35.310> on<00:04:35.400> your<00:04:35.520> face<00:04:35.820> and

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
here and you're already on your face and

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.860 
here and you're already on your face and
just<00:04:36.210> gotta<00:04:36.390> jump<00:04:36.750> up<00:04:37.560> here<00:04:38.360> together<00:04:39.360> go<00:04:39.690> over

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
just gotta jump up here together go over

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.830 
just gotta jump up here together go over
here<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:41.580> things<00:04:41.850> are<00:04:42.030> like<00:04:42.180> pretty<00:04:42.450> the

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
here and the things are like pretty the

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.660 
here and the things are like pretty the
things<00:04:43.440> where<00:04:43.620> you<00:04:43.710> capture<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:44.130> flag<00:04:44.310> I

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
things where you capture the flag I

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.520 
things where you capture the flag I
pretty<00:04:45.180> much<00:04:45.240> just<00:04:45.330> floating<00:04:45.990> like<00:04:46.290> right

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
pretty much just floating like right

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.930 
pretty much just floating like right
here<00:04:46.800> so<00:04:47.070> you<00:04:47.160> just<00:04:47.280> got<00:04:47.430> it<00:04:47.490> like<00:04:49.640> go<00:04:50.640> up<00:04:50.670> here

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
here so you just got it like go up here

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.360 
here so you just got it like go up here
and<00:04:52.670> either<00:04:53.670> do<00:04:54.060> this<00:04:54.240> jump<00:04:54.780> and<00:04:55.050> hit<00:04:55.230> it<00:04:55.410> or<00:04:55.770> go

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
and either do this jump and hit it or go

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.900 
and either do this jump and hit it or go
up<00:04:56.490> there<00:04:56.640> and<00:04:56.700> just<00:04:56.820> following<00:04:57.860> um<00:04:58.910> there's

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
up there and just following um there's
