in its gonna work right now what we have
here<00:05:18.700> is<00:05:19.090> booting<00:05:19.810> just<00:05:20.169> going<00:05:20.320> to<00:05:20.380> do<00:05:20.500> a<00:05:20.530> quick

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
here is booting just going to do a quick

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.780 
here is booting just going to do a quick
example<00:05:22.320> of<00:05:23.320> course<00:05:23.680> you<00:05:23.800> need<00:05:23.919> a<00:05:24.160> GameCube

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
example of course you need a GameCube

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.030 
example of course you need a GameCube
controller<00:05:25.210> to<00:05:25.419> do<00:05:25.600> it<00:05:25.720> with<00:05:26.050> and<00:05:26.320> right<00:05:26.860> now<00:05:27.010> I

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
controller to do it with and right now I

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.400 
controller to do it with and right now I
don't<00:05:27.340> have<00:05:27.580> it<00:05:27.760> so<00:05:29.700> maybe<00:05:30.700> someday<00:05:31.030> I<00:05:31.390> have<00:05:32.229> my

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
don't have it so maybe someday I have my

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.880 
don't have it so maybe someday I have my
GameCube<00:05:33.310> controller<00:05:33.820> but<00:05:34.060> I<00:05:34.210> just<00:05:34.930> don't

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
GameCube controller but I just don't

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.159 
GameCube controller but I just don't
have<00:05:36.130> it<00:05:36.280> with<00:05:36.370> me<00:05:36.460> exactly<00:05:37.270> right<00:05:37.570> now<00:05:37.720> so

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
have it with me exactly right now so

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.469 
have it with me exactly right now so
basically<00:05:38.560> for<00:05:38.800> booting<00:05:39.160> me<00:05:39.280> you<00:05:40.060> guys<00:05:40.210> really

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
basically for booting me you guys really

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.090 
basically for booting me you guys really
don't<00:05:40.690> need<00:05:40.870> to<00:05:40.930> know<00:05:41.050> about<00:05:41.260> but--my<00:05:41.770> you<00:05:41.950> can

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
don't need to know about but--my you can

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.360 
don't need to know about but--my you can
backup

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
backup

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.820 
backup
or<00:05:43.460> iOS<00:05:44.150> you<00:05:44.540> can<00:05:44.570> backup<00:05:44.960> a<00:05:45.260> lot<00:05:45.500> of<00:05:45.620> things

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
or iOS you can backup a lot of things

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.250 
or iOS you can backup a lot of things
onto<00:05:46.250> your<00:05:46.370> sd<00:05:46.490> card<00:05:46.669> loop<00:05:47.030> and<00:05:47.240> your<00:05:47.660> iOS<00:05:47.930> is

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
onto your sd card loop and your iOS is

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.990 
onto your sd card loop and your iOS is
basically<00:05:48.650> your<00:05:48.889> Wii<00:05:49.040> firmware<00:05:49.520> you<00:05:49.669> can<00:05:49.820> back

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
basically your Wii firmware you can back

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.100 
basically your Wii firmware you can back
it<00:05:50.150> up<00:05:50.180> if<00:05:50.570> you<00:05:51.169> wish<00:05:51.820> not<00:05:52.820> required<00:05:53.240> but<00:05:53.840> just

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
it up if you wish not required but just

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.950 
it up if you wish not required but just
good<00:05:54.260> if<00:05:54.440> you're<00:05:54.830> a<00:05:54.889> Reese<00:05:55.190> a<00:05:56.180> heavy-duty

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
good if you're a Reese a heavy-duty

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.340 
good if you're a Reese a heavy-duty
hacker<00:05:57.650> because<00:05:58.340> if<00:05:59.240> you<00:05:59.419> install<00:05:59.750> but--my<00:06:00.169> as

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
hacker because if you install but--my as

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.129 
hacker because if you install but--my as
a<00:06:00.380> boot<00:06:00.830> to<00:06:01.160> you<00:06:01.669> can<00:06:01.820> basically<00:06:02.449> I<00:06:02.479> think<00:06:02.690> if

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
a boot to you can basically I think if

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.159 
a boot to you can basically I think if
you<00:06:03.320> have<00:06:03.500> your<00:06:03.620> SD<00:06:03.979> card<00:06:04.220> in<00:06:04.639> your<00:06:05.090> Wii<00:06:05.570> when

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
you have your SD card in your Wii when

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:07.840 
you have your SD card in your Wii when
it<00:06:06.290> boots<00:06:06.470> up<00:06:06.620> it<00:06:06.800> will<00:06:06.889> automatically<00:06:07.550> boot

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
it boots up it will automatically boot

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.879 
it boots up it will automatically boot
into<00:06:08.120> boot<00:06:08.479> 2<00:06:08.720> and<00:06:08.990> you<00:06:09.350> will<00:06:09.470> be<00:06:09.620> able<00:06:09.710> to

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
into boot 2 and you will be able to

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:14.200 
into boot 2 and you will be able to
restore<00:06:10.340> your<00:06:11.150> broken<00:06:12.050> firmware<00:06:12.710> and<00:06:13.610> fix<00:06:14.030> it
