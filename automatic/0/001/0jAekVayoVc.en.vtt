00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.290 
mote similarly to how the nunchuck
connects<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.470> do<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.920> so

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.450 

very<00:01:55.300> easy<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.780> hook<00:01:55.930> up<00:01:56.140> then<00:01:56.740> you<00:01:57.100> just<00:01:57.340> take

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
very easy to hook up then you just take

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.580 
very easy to hook up then you just take
your<00:01:57.520> GameCube<00:01:58.150> controller<00:01:58.630> and<00:01:58.960> you<00:01:59.440> would

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
your GameCube controller and you would

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.050 
your GameCube controller and you would
hook<00:01:59.710> it<00:01:59.890> right<00:01:59.950> up<00:02:00.340> just<00:02:00.580> like<00:02:00.730> you<00:02:00.880> normally

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
hook it right up just like you normally

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.330 
hook it right up just like you normally
would<00:02:01.300> on<00:02:01.480> the<00:02:01.690> Gamecube<00:02:02.140> console<00:02:02.620> just<00:02:03.130> like

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
would on the Gamecube console just like

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.160 
would on the Gamecube console just like
so<00:02:03.550> and<00:02:04.830> just<00:02:06.720> like<00:02:07.720> that

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
so and just like that

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.590 
so and just like that
you<00:02:08.410> are<00:02:08.530> ready<00:02:08.740> to<00:02:08.920> play<00:02:09.130> if<00:02:09.600> you're

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
you are ready to play if you're

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.300 
you are ready to play if you're

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.980 
let's do it okay here we go
so<00:02:23.800> acceleration<00:02:24.070> is<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:27.900> drifting<00:02:28.900> is

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
so acceleration is a and drifting is

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:38.280 
so acceleration is a and drifting is
going<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.260> be<00:02:30.750> our<00:02:35.700> there<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:36.820> go<00:02:37.000> see<00:02:37.959> you<00:02:38.140> can
