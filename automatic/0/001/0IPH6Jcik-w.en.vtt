00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
the greatest thing to use but crest of

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.050 
the greatest thing to use but crest of
alpha<00:00:52.530> lupi<00:00:52.650> this<00:00:53.040> is<00:00:53.190> all<00:00:53.520> for<00:00:53.790> a<00:00:53.850> hundred

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
alpha lupi this is all for a hundred

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
alpha lupi this is all for a hundred
class<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.510> strength<00:00:54.950> 147<00:00:55.970> Max<00:00:56.970> is<00:00:57.210> 181<00:00:57.900> so

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
class that strength 147 Max is 181 so

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.420 
class that strength 147 Max is 181 so
not<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> greatest<00:00:58.620> central<00:00:59.010> revived

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
not the greatest central revived

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.100 
not the greatest central revived
teammates<00:00:59.790> faster<00:01:00.240> small<00:01:00.450> more<00:01:00.600> orbs<00:01:00.870> carry

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
teammates faster small more orbs carry

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.320 
teammates faster small more orbs carry
more<00:01:01.260> ammo<00:01:01.440> special<00:01:02.400> weapons<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.820> hand<00:01:03.120> hands

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
more ammo special weapons and hand hands

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.370 
more ammo special weapons and hand hands
so<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.780> really<00:01:04.320> good<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.070> are<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> 3v3

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
so this is really good if you are a 3v3

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.720 
so this is really good if you are a 3v3
PvP<00:01:07.380> players<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.950> play<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.310> game<00:01:08.490> mode

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
PvP players you play that game mode

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.490 
PvP players you play that game mode
those<00:01:09.150> game<00:01:09.390> modes<00:01:09.570> definitely<00:01:10.170> pick<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.470> up

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
those game modes definitely pick that up

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.480 
those game modes definitely pick that up
but<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.980> apotheosis<00:01:11.430> fail<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.990> all

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
but the apotheosis fail this is all

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.060 
but the apotheosis fail this is all
discipline<00:01:14.490> 109<00:01:15.030> which<00:01:15.630> isn't<00:01:15.990> excuse<00:01:16.920> me

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
discipline 109 which isn't excuse me

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.070 
discipline 109 which isn't excuse me
which<00:01:17.220> isn't<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.670> greatest<00:01:17.760> to<00:01:18.060> get<00:01:18.180> max<00:01:18.390> 136

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
which isn't the greatest to get max 136

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.690 
which isn't the greatest to get max 136
but<00:01:19.320> mainly<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:19.950> your<00:01:20.190> punishment<00:01:20.310> Nate

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
but mainly it's your punishment Nate

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.880 
but mainly it's your punishment Nate
engineering<00:01:21.240> punish<00:01:21.510> health<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.020> activating

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
engineering punish health and activating

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.100 
engineering punish health and activating
your<00:01:23.040> sooner<00:01:23.280> super<00:01:23.850> regenerates<00:01:24.450> health<00:01:24.780> so

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
your sooner super regenerates health so

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.830 
your sooner super regenerates health so
not<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.830> greatest<00:01:26.100> thing<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.790> picked<00:01:27.390> up<00:01:27.540> as

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
not the greatest thing to picked up as

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.530 
not the greatest thing to picked up as
well<00:01:28.170> if<00:01:28.860> you're<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> PVE<00:01:29.580> player<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.390> might

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
want to pick that up but if not you

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.740

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
might want to just skip that but Plan C

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.149 
might want to just skip that but Plan C
alright<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.830> is<00:01:34.890> has<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.580> hip<00:01:35.850> fire<00:01:36.150> bonus
