00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.400
We can't simply give it away.
It's not cheap pig food.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.200
It's caviar.
-Right.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.600
They've decided to give them tools
to bring the profession to its knees

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.280
so certain cartels can benefit from it.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.920
It's scandalous to give
quality tuna fish away at low prices.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.800
The pressure from the cartel and the
buyers brings fishermen to their knees.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.880
We need to reclaim sovereignty
over our seas and our resources.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.160
Autonomy to the Mediterraneans
and let's stop fooling around.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.920
Give this product its added value.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.240
Who are the NGOs these days?
Greenpeace, WWF.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.720
Preserving our resources is also in
my interests: it's sustainable fishing.
