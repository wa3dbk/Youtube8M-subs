00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:10.719
 But outside on the face of the maze this time the big battle Otsu of the meeting with Nico Nico 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:16.960
 There is little that special event that if punishing Rose with you 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:20.960
 So the number of defeats involved, so how can you do the fastest gathering? 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:25.310
 This video is considered to be the fastest we will continue in the time attack format 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:29.059
 Korea Sokpa right side sympa is 5 I think I want to do 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:34.309
 It is said that repair is quite happy this time 

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:38.059
 Until now in the Moraeru's and I tricks this is the later and to drop out because 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.950
 Well Ya Well white beard Pirates of Naa was struggling to that effort 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.940
 The worst generations of these guys falling down 1 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:49.590
 Rayleigh is newly implemented in the techbook this time messed up 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.110
 It is a horse manner event Mao Ohtsu does not drop, but it goes around 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.970
 In terms of value 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:01.710
 Worked hard in all members of the user according to the number of punitive is the most it is is after 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.500
 It is the first thing that you can get a reward depending on the number of kills, but it is the best 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.310
 Hey 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:10.750
 It is the number to skip reward there, but there is ranking more than that 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.750
 It seems that you will be shown abduction after ranking but in charge of a little game mistake 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:18.910
 You a little that we thought that Na or Let luck 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:22.520
 They tend to after subdue not ranking secretary game it is the fact that I Rawaie 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:26.929
 This video is kind of a time attack form, but it is faster than myself now 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:31.530
 At all those who think a like, even twitter that I am waiting for the police and comments 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:36.270
 I will buy Hancock Par size for coming please 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.290
 8 I am migrating four times from the doctor . Basically there are a lot of miscellaneous fish Out at the s bar number 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.119
 It is a work that comes 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.020
 Since hp is Well, such is not is very high roughly 100,000 degree Well, where can break through 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.090
 Though 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:51.550
 Put We Usopp write tentatively book skill It is the guys also uses fastest of this time 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:56.380
 But it's kinda me 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:58.860
 I do not have enough you earn turn without being affected after about 23 Tan 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.860
 Here the Ya 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.649
 Yes I do-mer 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.250
 In Well though Bankuni it's along a path fastest 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.619
 It's a little Yabain because it is not good When the Verona comes out 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:16.760
 That's great too 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:21.230
 The material will be twice in the second session Rainbow colored materials may have come out 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.860
 Yes, it's a muddy positive Perona, but it's a pheromone's skill attribute, so it's in a medium or medium 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.819
 It is a mate 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:30.060
 So here in the first strike, this captain effect will invalidate 3 turns . 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.360
 So there is a return of how to deal with that 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.710
 I also want to introduce you 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.620
 Good schedule 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:41.940
 Yes yes 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:45.900
 It's the doctor's 4th floor Here is the mountain seaman Hogback Absalom? 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.069
 I wanted to introduce diameter Lorna Although the pump back of in Tsu car I know the case of Lorna 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.069
 That's Kimi but is 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:59.760
 8 I see 6 but I have fog back right 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.760
 I think I was able to easily penetrate because there is no exposure defense 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.080
 It sounds like that 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.670
 Yes I like it all 3 turns from once 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:13.459
 435 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:17.870
 Bosumonsu is when hp is remains 2 million that say I'm Yes I hope Hattan 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:21.080
 Usually attack 10,800 will be here before 3 turn attack by say 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:25.120
 In technique from the head came now in the pre-emptive strike 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.120
 We random conversion pointed out in either 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.760
 If you choose 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:37.220
 Well , Abe san's own voice came in at 20% or less with his voice period out 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.840
 a 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.840
 I will use Isaza 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.920
 It is ten thousand shots and 800 damage It is after 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:52.030
 I 'm going to seal this object bound at random 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:57.690
 It's not the place to say is example Yabe something and conquer Tokushutsu Well, except it 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.690
 So Well, this time I'll try that fastest Pared Time Attack 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:09.590
 Ultra-Kana Yes Nyanpasu also I hope but I have been strong mad for here 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.370
 I have a strong wisdom but if I don't get down to Maasan Town, I will damage it. 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.590
 is not it 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.120
 When you do so Bankuni little that 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.600
 The captain effect can not be activated. If the strength is less than 70%, oh how much more than 10%. 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.359
 It is useless if not 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.949
 So I 'm getting a bit of a safe measure like this 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.949
 It is Yamada agent to abandon Oh 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.650
 It is one more hit 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:37.790
 Yes Cobo Labor is I'm such will continue to missing you board power-up that is but 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.790
 As a result of having examined this previous wind 6 there was no big deal at 150 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.150
 My last name-yes 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.110
 2 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:50.420
 Well then a little 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:53.480
 Time appears to want to think but I do not see Migakusumi of this time attack large melee 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:58.820
 Otsu time is here 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:00.920
 Yes Well yourself what the fine array eyes of Nde Well Well kana Turn chain ings 1 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.040
 I think it was useless down 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:08.570
 And also I might take a look a little It is this time Well then but what is 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:13.470
 There are a lot of technical books, but after Chile , the eyes are pretty delicious. 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:17.639
 I want a little more attention at this event, but this is Azabu 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:22.770
 I want Marko, I am not a skilla yet, so high 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:28.110
 In that case this time is the formation event where the number of the end comes to be involved Otsu drops 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:33.449
 Though I do not shave or very punitive in the ranking and it is the minute you 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:37.050
 It is said that the reward that everyone can get according to the number of kills of everyone is covered by all means 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.630
 Everyone's a little in Otsu orbiting I think the kana Let luck 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.800
 That's it 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:47.110
 I want to do a game s slightly responsible person after the game 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:51.940
 If you can compete number of videos I thought that happy with the fact that everybody by all means little 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:56.560
 It is to say contains such as I would like the game to large melee Otsu of meeting this thing 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.620
 Etc. not positive but I'm here new and a little special event this time is an event 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.630
 The Nokon cheats 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:04.510
 This time I went to clear the fastest in the sixth attack this time by all means everyone a 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:09.180
 And fire Good luck 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.180
 Let's do it, thank you for watching 

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:20.059
 annoying 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:23.249
 Hmm
