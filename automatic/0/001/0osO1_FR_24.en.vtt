00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.309 

so<00:00:04.620> this<00:00:04.890> one<00:00:05.190> you<00:00:05.460> can<00:00:05.640> see<00:00:05.670> there<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.750> couple

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
so this one you can see there a couple

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.009 
so this one you can see there a couple
of<00:00:07.529> varieties<00:00:07.740> whereas<00:00:08.610> these<00:00:08.790> years<00:00:09.179> we<00:00:09.780> have

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
of varieties whereas these years we have

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.589 
of varieties whereas these years we have
tens<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:11.040> thousands<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.759> trees<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.389> San

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
tens of thousands of trees in San

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.950 
tens of thousands of trees in San
Francisco<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:13.679> that's<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.730> huge<00:00:15.000> resources

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
Francisco so that's a huge resources

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.500 
Francisco so that's a huge resources
that<00:00:16.139> we<00:00:16.289> could<00:00:16.500> tap<00:00:16.710> into<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.190> provide<00:00:17.730> food

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
that we could tap into to provide food

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.700 
that we could tap into to provide food
oh<00:00:18.869> this<00:00:19.740> one's<00:00:20.010> really<00:00:20.250> healthy<00:00:21.230> we<00:00:22.230> started

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
oh this one's really healthy we started

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.140 
oh this one's really healthy we started
the<00:00:22.830> organization<00:00:23.010> called<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.000> gorilla

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
the organization called the gorilla

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.939 
the organization called the gorilla
crafters<00:00:24.869> we<00:00:29.150> what<00:00:30.150> i<00:00:30.179> did<00:00:30.510> was<00:00:30.720> i<00:00:31.170> grafted

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
crafters we what i did was i grafted

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.610 
crafters we what i did was i grafted
fruiting<00:00:32.579> branches<00:00:32.759> onto<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.870> non<00:00:34.140> fruiting

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
fruiting branches onto the non fruiting

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.880 
fruiting branches onto the non fruiting
tree<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.700> one<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.450> grafted<00:00:37.140> off<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.770> this

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
tree this one is grafted off of this

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.360 
tree this one is grafted off of this
trunk<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.660> above<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.899> grubs<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.860> about<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
trunk and above the grubs so about the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.540 
trunk and above the grubs so about the
joint<00:00:41.700> there's<00:00:42.180> actually<00:00:42.780> already<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.550> branch

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
joint there's actually already a branch

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.569 
joint there's actually already a branch
that<00:00:44.940> branch<00:00:45.210> off<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:46.070> if<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.219> seem<00:00:47.430> like

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
that branch off of this if you seem like

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.389 
that branch off of this if you seem like
a<00:00:47.640> little<00:00:48.530> Frankenstein<00:00:49.530> ish<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.250> one

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
a little Frankenstein ish on the one

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.709 
a little Frankenstein ish on the one
hand<00:00:50.640> if<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.000> want<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.180> look<00:00:51.270> at<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.570> through

hand if you want to look at it through

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.200 
hand if you want to look at it through
one<00:00:51.930> lens<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> grab<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.760> did<00:00:54.000> last

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
one lens so this is a grab I did last

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.680 
one lens so this is a grab I did last
year

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
year

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.990 
year
there's<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.020> he'll<00:00:55.350> wing<00:00:55.559> pattern<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
there's a he'll wing pattern on the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.150 
there's a he'll wing pattern on the
branches<00:00:57.420> off<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.140> wasn't<00:00:58.379> very<00:00:58.559> selective

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
branches off and I wasn't very selective

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.029 
branches off and I wasn't very selective
in<00:00:59.309> terms<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.820> grafting<00:01:00.359> which<00:01:00.719> variety<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.980> I

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
in terms of grafting which variety so I

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.939 
in terms of grafting which variety so I
ended<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.579> with<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> confetti<00:01:03.780> tree<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.619> tree

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
ended up with a confetti tree the tree

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.850 
ended up with a confetti tree the tree
has<00:01:05.299> multicolored<00:01:06.299> leaves<00:01:06.630> Oh<00:01:07.020> see<00:01:07.590> like

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
has multicolored leaves Oh see like

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.429 
has multicolored leaves Oh see like
there's<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.220> grab<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.790> didn't<00:01:09.180> take<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
there's a grab that didn't take on the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.070 
there's a grab that didn't take on the
other<00:01:10.619> hand<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.520> really<00:01:11.790> radical<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
other hand it's really radical in the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.929 
other hand it's really radical in the
way<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.950> celebration<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.700> what

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
way that it's a celebration of what

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.880 
way that it's a celebration of what
nature<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.330> do<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:16.140> us<00:01:16.229> we're<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:16.530> the

nature can do for us we're just the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.399 
nature can do for us we're just the
catalyst<00:01:17.340> we're<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.240> doing<00:01:18.299> what<00:01:18.570> she<00:01:18.600> does

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
catalyst we're just doing what she does

catalyst we're just doing what she does
by<00:01:19.619> cross<00:01:19.830> pollination<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.520> cross

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
by cross pollination and cross

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.149 
by cross pollination and cross
propagation<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:21.930> we're<00:01:22.110> experimenting<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:23.040> a

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
propagation but we're experimenting in a

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.520 
propagation but we're experimenting in a
way<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.580> feels<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.200> delicious

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
way that feels like a delicious

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.520 
way that feels like a delicious
experiment<00:01:26.430> oh<00:01:26.670> yeah<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.290> tree

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
experiment oh yeah and on this tree

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.240 
experiment oh yeah and on this tree
sorry

sorry
so<00:01:30.000> camouflage<00:01:30.810> by<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.140> giant

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
so camouflage by this giant

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.910 
so camouflage by this giant
and<00:01:33.880> see<00:01:34.149> the<00:01:34.299> difference<00:01:34.750> between<00:01:34.990> this<00:01:35.560> Li

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
and see the difference between this Li

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.120 
and see the difference between this Li
and<00:01:36.280> this<00:01:37.210> one<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:38.350> giant<00:01:38.770> leave<00:01:38.920> actually

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
and this one the giant leave actually

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.120 
and this one the giant leave actually
came<00:01:39.640> from<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:40.090> Grafton<00:01:40.600> branch<00:01:41.289> this<00:01:41.770> is<00:01:41.920> the

came from the Grafton branch this is the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.779 
came from the Grafton branch this is the
Asian<00:01:42.640> hair<00:01:42.939> and<00:01:43.180> this<00:01:43.840> is<00:01:44.229> a<00:01:44.619> flowering<00:01:45.549> pear

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
Asian hair and this is a flowering pear

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.810 
Asian hair and this is a flowering pear
this<00:01:46.539> is<00:01:46.750> not<00:01:46.990> sanctioned<00:01:47.320> because<00:01:48.189> people

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
this is not sanctioned because people

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.380 
this is not sanctioned because people
think<00:01:49.570> of<00:01:49.929> fruit<00:01:50.799> trees<00:01:51.009> as<00:01:51.340> a<00:01:51.670> sort<00:01:52.149> of<00:01:52.240> a

think of fruit trees as a sort of a

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.990 
think of fruit trees as a sort of a

nuisance apparently a lot of people are
worried<00:01:55.390> about<00:01:55.509> growing<00:01:56.020> fruit<00:01:56.319> trees

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
worried about growing fruit trees

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.850 
worried about growing fruit trees
including<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:57.850> city<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.509> some<00:01:58.860> nonprofit

including the city and some nonprofit

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.609 
including the city and some nonprofit
organizations<00:02:00.579> so<00:02:01.390> they<00:02:01.619> strongly

organizations so they strongly

organizations so they strongly
discourage<00:02:03.250> planting<00:02:03.789> of<00:02:03.909> productive<00:02:04.390> trees

on<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.170> street<00:02:05.530> rats<00:02:05.890> can<00:02:06.009> be<00:02:06.250> inconvenient<00:02:06.700> I

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
on the street rats can be inconvenient I

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.660 
on the street rats can be inconvenient I
think<00:02:08.289> there<00:02:08.440> are<00:02:08.470> sometimes<00:02:08.739> people<00:02:09.369> who<00:02:09.489> own

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
think there are sometimes people who own

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.509 
think there are sometimes people who own
homes<00:02:09.700> who<00:02:10.239> had<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.750> bad<00:02:11.019> experience<00:02:11.250> but<00:02:12.250> what

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
homes who had a bad experience but what

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.640 
homes who had a bad experience but what
we've<00:02:12.670> discovered<00:02:13.360> is<00:02:13.660> that<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:14.049> with<00:02:14.230> really

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
we've discovered is that it with really

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.220 
we've discovered is that it with really
good<00:02:14.980> maintenance<00:02:15.489> and<00:02:15.730> stewardship<00:02:16.299> you<00:02:16.959> can

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
good maintenance and stewardship you can

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.530 
good maintenance and stewardship you can
make<00:02:17.500> sure<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.700> rats<00:02:18.910> are<00:02:19.150> kept<00:02:19.360> at<00:02:19.510> bay

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
make sure that the rats are kept at bay

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.170 
make sure that the rats are kept at bay
so<00:02:20.260> what<00:02:20.530> we<00:02:20.680> are<00:02:20.799> doing<00:02:20.980> is<00:02:21.280> we<00:02:21.519> only<00:02:21.880> grass

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
so what we are doing is we only grass

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.870 
so what we are doing is we only grass
trees<00:02:22.599> to<00:02:23.049> have<00:02:23.200> stewards<00:02:23.769> that<00:02:24.040> promise<00:02:24.730> to

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
trees to have stewards that promise to

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.660 
trees to have stewards that promise to
take<00:02:25.030> care<00:02:25.239> of<00:02:25.269> them<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:27.190> will<00:02:27.340> come<00:02:27.519> in

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
take care of them and that will come in

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.080 
take care of them and that will come in
monitoring<00:02:28.299> across<00:02:28.840> from<00:02:29.230> some<00:02:29.739> wells<00:02:30.090> house

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
monitoring across from some wells house

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:39.150 
monitoring across from some wells house
we<00:02:31.569> grafted<00:02:32.049> I<00:02:32.470> think<00:02:33.099> like<00:02:33.340> four<00:02:33.730> trees<00:02:38.160> the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
we grafted I think like four trees the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.770 
we grafted I think like four trees the
trees<00:02:39.400> like<00:02:39.640> something<00:02:40.000> is<00:02:40.090> going<00:02:40.239> wrong<00:02:40.510> and

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
trees like something is going wrong and

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.300 
trees like something is going wrong and
this<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:41.079> my<00:02:41.200> office<00:02:41.410> here<00:02:41.769> so<00:02:41.980> this<00:02:44.069> so<00:02:45.069> the

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
this is my office here so this so the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.349 
this is my office here so this so the
gorilla<00:02:45.609> grafter

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
gorilla grafter

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.170 
gorilla grafter
I<00:02:46.390> would<00:02:46.569> love<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.930> walk<00:02:47.470> within<00:02:47.769> the<00:02:48.579> confines

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
I would love to walk within the confines

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.849 
I would love to walk within the confines
of<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:50.500> law<00:02:51.510> this<00:02:52.510> one<00:02:52.780> okay<00:02:53.350> actually<00:02:53.590> I

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
of the law this one okay actually I

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.920 
of the law this one okay actually I
think<00:02:54.130> this<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.459> a<00:02:54.489> life<00:02:54.819> but<00:02:55.239> that's<00:02:55.540> this

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
think this is a life but that's this

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.259 
think this is a life but that's this
well<00:02:56.410> we're<00:02:56.829> attempting<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.700> do<00:02:57.910> is<00:02:58.239> to

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
well we're attempting to do is to

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.770 
well we're attempting to do is to
practice<00:02:59.230> in<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.709> small<00:03:00.100> scale<00:03:00.639> so<00:03:01.060> that<00:03:01.269> people

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
practice in a small scale so that people

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.979 
practice in a small scale so that people
could<00:03:01.989> see<00:03:02.019> that<00:03:02.700> having<00:03:03.700> fruit<00:03:04.180> trees<00:03:04.510> on<00:03:04.840> the

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
could see that having fruit trees on the

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.340 
could see that having fruit trees on the
sidewalk<00:03:05.470> isn't<00:03:05.769> something<00:03:06.519> dangerous<00:03:07.350> with

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
sidewalk isn't something dangerous with

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.349 
sidewalk isn't something dangerous with
proper<00:03:08.980> maintenance<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.760> doesn't<00:03:10.150> cause

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
proper maintenance it doesn't cause

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.509 
proper maintenance it doesn't cause
potential<00:03:11.049> problems<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:11.889> then<00:03:12.100> they<00:03:12.280> will

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
potential problems and then they will

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.900 
potential problems and then they will
slowly<00:03:12.790> grow<00:03:13.389> to<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:14.049> SAP<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.799> maybe<00:03:15.549> even

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
slowly grow to a SAP and maybe even

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.569 
slowly grow to a SAP and maybe even
cherish<00:03:16.510> this<00:03:17.019> resource<00:03:17.739> that<00:03:18.010> we<00:03:18.190> have<00:03:18.220> in
