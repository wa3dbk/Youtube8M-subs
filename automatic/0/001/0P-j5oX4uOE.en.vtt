00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello to you about the topic 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:11.260
 Today I want to tell you about the role 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.700
 overview and knowledge of the map by example 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.299
 soviet patent 100 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.640
 the beginning of the battle 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.689
 won't promise bits 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:26.800
 standing at the standard place of shelling that 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:29.020
 what happens in was against at full 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.590
 note as you can see the projectile flies and 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.590
 nowhere 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.609
 yourself and drive now I use the review 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.609
 other 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.000
 here they see and the projectile went nowhere 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.859
 I wait for Perry charge 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.859
 well gone 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.990
 from is displayed so. try 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.369
 shoot through 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.750
 pushing forward besides taking off 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.750
 gusli nothing happened 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.570
 He will now see somewhere to go watch 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.710
 completely the other way but not 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.710
 less there is a hit 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.650
 they too 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.550
 while I hit on gas we win 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:54.579
 will be that to the right that to the left that is 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.990
 there are train with order just falls 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.990
 the goal is the opposite 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.710
 it seems it was necessary to take a lead 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.710
 but also take on the lead 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.710
 this shell goes to the right 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.620
 well i'm alone 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.290
 we will use optics and knowledge 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.290
 terrain 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:39.020
 three options or they will go over the bridge 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.180
 which is quite likely just apt-85 there or 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.710
 across town 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.320
 a subscription that was in the city rather 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.750
 just go through the city that is a long time 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:53.030
 you can not stand but where will the art 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.720
 answer until the cap is displayed 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:01.810
 she basically for me vanshot on and but 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.810
 you can’t shoot at random 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.150
 we will wait for full details 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.570
 that's how long stand in one place 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.570
 you shouldn’t do anything 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:25.830
 tv trying to track me down to art 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:29.640
 worked or is waiting for reinforcement then 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.070
 cats are likely to get through 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.710
 city ​​behind 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:38.550
 put on them agony tt and drive around 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.580
 it is inconvenient for her to change 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.580
 position 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:54.090
 due to the fact that I have a review of 350 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:59.420
 adding ventilation has become 365 here on 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:02.790
 when used in stereo tube then 456 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.590
 canon 122 mm sotochku in 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:12.030
 Basically I do not use damage is not enough 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:16.069
 breakout 175 damage every 390 us 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.069
 case for the mode I charge the subcalera and 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:24.770
 breaking through 217 well and scattered guns 043 in 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:31.430
 principle on wait for full details 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:34.410
 but one-time damage pleases 85 review 340 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:38.460
 it is not known that he has pumped that 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.470
 so I try to put it 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.930
 it is possible to go farther from where 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:48.449
 she is change position 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:53.160
 at a3 we carry reviews of that 330 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.160
 so I don’t count on him too much 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:02.040
 but I'm waiting for someone to come across the bridge 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.680
 but still decide to move to another 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.680
 a place 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:16.099
 because standing behind the house I will not see 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:19.750
 if someone goes through the center well and 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.750
 kv-85 is spinning around here 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:33.919
 with us are you left the house is therefore therefore 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:37.330
 if you pass through the city, I do not see here 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.330
 he glows apt-85 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.330
 Malik position patrizia adepts well 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.840
 waiting for when he comes out 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:55.919
 the player himself must do this as I understand 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:06:01.310
 read where I am and bypass 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:01.310
 drove to the place where I did not find 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:09.620
 waiting for him to wait 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:15.199
 full details 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:18.190
 yes then we lit up accordingly 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:18.190
 to quickly change position 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.699
 in a straight line and move here it is 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.699
 lit up art 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.860
 so shoot right now including the sight 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:36.819
 go on I hope for him especially 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:41.439
 but take off miss art now 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:46.019
 I must shoot here by meter 

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:46.019
 boldly draw a card 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:55.669
 Mikhail Telling Gotovchenko 

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:59.830
 there is very little time 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:59.830
 I only have an advantage in the review 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:08.630
 I don't have armor for t8 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:13.040
 Only review Well, one-time damage 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.040
 so I have a maximum of two shots 

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:22.679
 I think more and survive I decide to go by 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.679
 straight here it is lit up 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.800
 I am trying to aim the flap 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.780
 we get a corresponding pro. 

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:47.560
 so here 

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:51.100
 I was helped by optics ignorance of the card on 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:53.460
 this is my all country of good luck on 

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.460
 battlefields
