hey Andrew 6 800 here within a video
about<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:04.020> piston<00:00:04.470> mod<00:00:04.620> for<00:00:04.859> Minecraft<00:00:05.629> the

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
about the piston mod for Minecraft the

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.379 
about the piston mod for Minecraft the
piston<00:00:07.080> is<00:00:07.460> like<00:00:08.840> this<00:00:10.910> this<00:00:11.910> part<00:00:12.240> right<00:00:12.300> here

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
piston is like this this part right here

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.570 
piston is like this this part right here
is<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.320> part<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:13.740> will<00:00:13.920> push<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.370> block

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
is the part that will push the block

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.189 
is the part that will push the block
with<00:00:14.849> with<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.120> piston<00:00:15.480> does<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.780> push<00:00:16.049> your

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
with with the piston does it push your

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.740 
with with the piston does it push your
block<00:00:16.379> once<00:00:16.859> we're<00:00:17.850> out<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.240> instead<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.539> that

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
block once we're out so instead of that

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.320 
block once we're out so instead of that
cobblestone<00:00:19.199> being<00:00:19.410> there<00:00:19.619> I'll<00:00:20.130> be<00:00:20.310> here<00:00:21.710> and

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
cobblestone being there I'll be here and

what you can do is if you want change
where<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.369> piston<00:00:26.760> issues<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:27.619> click

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
where the piston issues you just click

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.090 
where the piston issues you just click
that<00:00:28.650> side<00:00:31.850> and<00:00:32.850> then<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:34.380> get<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.559> go<00:00:34.770> up<00:00:34.800> you

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
that side and then you get to go up you

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.760 
that side and then you get to go up you
have<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.250> be<00:00:35.370> above<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.670> actually<00:00:36.300> sound

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
have to be above that actually sound

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.580 
have to be above that actually sound

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
will happen is put a redstone pushes it

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.979 
will happen is put a redstone pushes it
out<00:00:45.980> and<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.550> retracts<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.360> take<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.899> off

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
out and it retracts and you take it off

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.100 
out and it retracts and you take it off
the<00:00:49.140> red<00:00:49.260> stone<00:00:49.579> so<00:00:50.579> what<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.480> happen<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:52.079> you

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
the red stone so what can happen is you

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.470 
the red stone so what can happen is you
can<00:00:52.680> put<00:00:52.920> sand<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.390> will<00:00:54.570> push<00:00:54.809> sand<00:00:55.199> and

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
can put sand on it it will push sand and

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.990 
can put sand on it it will push sand and
people<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.469> also<00:00:58.620> push<00:00:58.890> items<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.609> let's

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
stand in little the to put seven blocks

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.520 
stand in little the to put seven blocks
if<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.110> stand<00:01:25.530> then<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.430> first<00:01:26.700> one<00:01:27.530> then

if you stand then on the first one then

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.359 
if you stand then on the first one then
you'll<00:01:28.650> pick<00:01:28.890> up<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.340> lot<00:01:29.759> more<00:01:30.710> all<00:01:31.710> right<00:01:31.920> here

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
you'll pick up a lot more all right here

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.109 
you'll pick up a lot more all right here
and<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.970> lot<00:01:33.150> higher<00:01:33.299> than<00:01:34.070> um<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.490> that's

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
and it's a lot higher than um so that's

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.670 
and it's a lot higher than um so that's
what<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.360> can<00:01:36.540> use<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:37.079> for<00:01:37.380> pushing

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
what you can use it for for pushing

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.950 
what you can use it for for pushing
stuff<00:01:38.000> anything<00:01:39.000> for<00:01:39.240> gravity<00:01:39.600> will<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:39.869> it

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
stuff anything for gravity will do it

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.310 
stuff anything for gravity will do it
the<00:01:40.049> sand<00:01:40.290> does<00:01:41.329> and<00:01:42.329> then<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:42.840> other<00:01:43.020> thing

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the sand does and then this other thing

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.010 
the sand does and then this other thing
I<00:01:43.590> made<00:01:44.340> was<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:46.740> right<00:01:46.920> here<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.369> see

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
I made was a so right here you can see

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.330 
I made was a so right here you can see
lava<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.500> don't<00:01:49.649> want<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.829> just<00:01:49.950> try<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.220> jump

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
lava you don't want to just try to jump

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.179 
lava you don't want to just try to jump
over<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.030> might<00:01:51.149> fall<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.509> or<00:01:51.630> something

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
over that you might fall in or something

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.100 
over that you might fall in or something
so<00:01:53.189> what<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.790> do<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.240> put<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.720> Redstone

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
so what you do is you put the Redstone

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.319 
so what you do is you put the Redstone
man<00:01:55.640> it<00:01:56.640> pushes<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:58.460> then<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.820> goes<00:02:00.030> in

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
man it pushes and then that goes in

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.649 
man it pushes and then that goes in
right<00:02:00.659> there<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.700> some<00:02:02.909> things<00:02:02.939> about<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.479> mod

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
right there so some things about the mod

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.219 
right there so some things about the mod
is<00:02:04.610> force<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.880> if<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.540> write<00:02:06.719> as<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:07.079> see

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
is force and if you write as you see

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.040 
is force and if you write as you see
right<00:02:07.259> there<00:02:07.970> when<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.090> arm<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.360> extended<00:02:09.660> out

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
right there when the arm is extended out

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.050 
right there when the arm is extended out
of<00:02:10.289> San<00:02:10.530> block<00:02:10.739> will<00:02:10.950> fall<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.370> there<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.550> it

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
of San block will fall in there and it

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.920 
of San block will fall in there and it
we'll<00:02:12.180> get<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.170> turn<00:02:14.010> back<00:02:14.280> into<00:02:14.430> sand<00:02:16.190> also<00:02:17.190> arm

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
we'll get a turn back into sand also arm

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.479 
we'll get a turn back into sand also arm
when<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.050> same<00:02:19.230> days<00:02:19.410> game<00:02:19.590> pushed<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.220> can

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
when the same days game pushed you can

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.780

couple flowers in it um what happens is

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
couple flowers in it um what happens is
the<00:04:58.530> flower<00:04:58.770> goes<00:04:59.010> down<00:04:59.250> here<00:04:59.810> hits<00:05:00.810> the

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
the flower goes down here hits the

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:09.260 
the flower goes down here hits the
pressure<00:05:02.460> pad<00:05:05.419> this<00:05:06.650> will<00:05:07.650> activate<00:05:08.070> and<00:05:08.430> this

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
pressure pad this will activate and this

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.409 
pressure pad this will activate and this
is<00:05:09.419> already<00:05:09.690> activated<00:05:09.990> right<00:05:10.260> here<00:05:10.910> so<00:05:11.910> it

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
is already activated right here so it

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.670 
is already activated right here so it
will<00:05:12.540> turn<00:05:12.810> this<00:05:13.080> one<00:05:13.320> off<00:05:14.810> and<00:05:15.810> then<00:05:16.410> went

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
will turn this one off and then went

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.320 
will turn this one off and then went
right<00:05:17.070> because<00:05:17.400> right<00:05:17.580> now<00:05:17.610> this<00:05:18.150> is

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
right because right now this is

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.700 
right because right now this is
activated<00:05:18.840> assume<00:05:18.990> that<00:05:19.140> nothing<00:05:19.410> can<00:05:19.560> get

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
activated assume that nothing can get

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.600 
activated assume that nothing can get
through<00:05:20.900> but<00:05:21.900> when<00:05:22.080> it<00:05:22.200> gets<00:05:22.290> turned<00:05:22.650> off<00:05:22.980> on

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
through but when it gets turned off on

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.440 
through but when it gets turned off on
this<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.750> water<00:05:24.960> can<00:05:25.229> get<00:05:25.380> through<00:05:26.120> so<00:05:27.120> what

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
this the water can get through so what

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.180 
this the water can get through so what
happens<00:05:27.840> is<00:05:28.110> that<00:05:30.080> in<00:05:31.080> there<00:05:31.260> that<00:05:31.530> VI<00:05:31.740> thing

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
happens is that in there that VI thing

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.370 
happens is that in there that VI thing
it<00:05:32.310> comes<00:05:32.490> down<00:05:32.700> to<00:05:32.880> act<00:05:33.060> out<00:05:33.270> in<00:05:35.030> its<00:05:36.030> that

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
it comes down to act out in its that

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.660 
it comes down to act out in its that
this<00:05:37.380> turns<00:05:37.740> off<00:05:38.060> see<00:05:39.060> you<00:05:39.210> as<00:05:39.270> your<00:05:39.450> house

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:41.670 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.540 

and<00:05:42.180> then<00:05:42.990> when<00:05:43.350> you<00:05:43.470> come<00:05:43.830> up<00:05:43.980> the<00:05:44.130> ladder<00:05:44.340> you

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
and then when you come up the ladder you

and then when you come up the ladder you
pick<00:05:44.760> it<00:05:44.880> up<00:05:45.000> and<00:05:45.240> its<00:05:45.660> back<00:05:45.720> to<00:05:45.900> normal<00:05:47.210> so
