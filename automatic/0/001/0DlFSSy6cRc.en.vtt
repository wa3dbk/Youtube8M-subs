Marcus<00:00:17.550> bettinelli<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.810> think<00:00:19.470> if<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.859> few<00:00:20.100> of

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
Marcus bettinelli I think if a few of

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.460 
Marcus bettinelli I think if a few of
the<00:00:20.250> boys<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.580> probably<00:00:20.850> agree<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.270> he's

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
the boys you probably agree that he's

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.720 
the boys you probably agree that he's
dug<00:00:22.470> exciting<00:00:22.830> games<00:00:22.980> sometimes<00:00:23.460> and

especially for the Queen his first full

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.439 
especially for the Queen his first full
season<00:00:25.920> playing<00:00:26.400> for<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> fool<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.119> think

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449
