in order for the species to survive

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.359 
in order for the species to survive
that's<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.110> reason<00:01:49.500> truffles<00:01:49.979> throw<00:01:50.189> out

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
that's the reason truffles throw out

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.090 
that's the reason truffles throw out
this<00:01:50.549> amazingly<00:01:51.270> complex<00:01:51.840> grouping<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.560> gases

this amazingly complex grouping of gases

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.999 
this amazingly complex grouping of gases
to<00:01:53.820> attract<00:01:54.450> animals<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.320> themselves<00:01:55.859> what

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
to attract animals to themselves what

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.469 
to attract animals to themselves what
the<00:01:56.130> animals<00:01:56.430> will<00:01:56.549> then<00:01:56.670> spread<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> spores

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
the animals will then spread the spores

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.420 
the animals will then spread the spores
you<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.530> paint<00:01:58.740> your<00:01:58.829> own<00:01:58.890> picture<00:01:59.100> for

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
see this but that makes them unique

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
minutes there's one right there see it

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.970 
minutes there's one right there see it
that's<00:02:33.650> a<00:02:33.920> it's<00:02:34.250> approaching<00:02:34.760> full<00:02:35.209> ripeness

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
that's a it's approaching full ripeness

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.649 
that's a it's approaching full ripeness
may<00:02:36.980> not<00:02:37.159> be<00:02:37.280> blowing<00:02:37.609> off<00:02:37.819> a<00:02:37.849> lot<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.180> gas<00:02:38.389> but

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
may not be blowing off a lot of gas but

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.119 
may not be blowing off a lot of gas but
it's<00:02:38.780> going<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:38.959> be<00:02:39.079> blowing<00:02:39.260> gas<00:02:39.590> pretty<00:02:39.799> soon

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
it's going to be blowing gas pretty soon

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:45.069 
it's going to be blowing gas pretty soon
and<00:02:41.030> that'll<00:02:41.569> make<00:02:41.689> it<00:02:42.849> just<00:02:43.849> right<00:02:44.090> for

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
and that'll make it just right for

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.929 
and that'll make it just right for
producing<00:02:45.560> oil<00:02:45.709> but<00:02:46.129> then<00:02:46.310> every<00:02:46.579> once<00:02:46.760> in<00:02:46.879> a

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:46.939 
producing oil but then every once in a

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.059 
producing oil but then every once in a
while<00:02:46.969> you<00:02:47.269> get<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.719> white<00:02:48.019> truffle<00:02:48.290> about<00:02:48.859> like

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
while you get a white truffle about like

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.879 
while you get a white truffle about like
that<00:02:49.370> that's<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.299> two-hour<00:02:50.659> truffle<00:02:51.169> and<00:02:51.319> that

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
that that's a two-hour truffle and that

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.649 
that that's a two-hour truffle and that
shoots<00:02:52.219> enough<00:02:52.549> endorphins<00:02:53.060> into<00:02:53.239> your<00:02:53.419> brain

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659

to get a sufficient amount of truffles
to<00:05:42.570> make<00:05:42.720> oil<00:05:43.020> you<00:05:43.740> know<00:05:43.830> let's<00:05:44.070> move<00:05:44.310> down<00:05:44.550> the

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
to make oil you know let's move down the

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.220 
to make oil you know let's move down the
hill<00:05:44.940> and<00:05:45.180> back<00:05:45.920> towards<00:05:46.920> the<00:05:47.070> house<00:05:48.140> and<00:05:49.140> they

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
hill and back towards the house and they

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.360 
hill and back towards the house and they
kind<00:05:49.440> of<00:05:49.560> look<00:05:49.740> and<00:05:49.890> poke<00:05:50.190> as<00:05:50.370> I<00:05:50.490> go<00:05:52.040> they<00:05:53.040> tend

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
kind of look and poke as I go they tend

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.660 
kind of look and poke as I go they tend
to<00:05:53.400> be<00:05:53.550> fairly<00:05:53.580> scattered<00:05:55.010> yet<00:05:56.010> some<00:05:56.280> days<00:05:56.460> are

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
to be fairly scattered yet some days are

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.790 
to be fairly scattered yet some days are
better<00:05:56.760> than<00:05:56.910> others

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:09.230 

I'm<00:06:01.800> questioned<00:06:02.220> about<00:06:02.310> that<00:06:02.640> one<00:06:08.060> back<00:06:09.060> to

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
I'm questioned about that one back to

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.600 
I'm questioned about that one back to
the<00:06:09.330> man

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
the man

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.490 
the man
there<00:06:09.699> is<00:06:09.849> though<00:06:10.150> truffles<00:06:11.050> contained

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
there is though truffles contained

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.369 
there is though truffles contained
upwards<00:06:12.099> of<00:06:12.370> 50<00:06:12.819> different<00:06:13.060> volatile<00:06:13.840> organic

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:14.379 
upwards of 50 different volatile organic

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:17.010 
upwards of 50 different volatile organic
compounds<00:06:14.889> what<00:06:14.979> we<00:06:15.099> call<00:06:15.340> VOCs<00:06:16.060> so<00:06:16.900> the

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
compounds what we call VOCs so the

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.110 
compounds what we call VOCs so the
common<00:06:17.500> a<00:06:17.620> combination<00:06:18.340> of<00:06:18.490> all<00:06:18.849> of<00:06:18.879> those

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
common a combination of all of those

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.230 
common a combination of all of those
compounds<00:06:19.840> makes<00:06:20.590> the<00:06:20.800> olfactory<00:06:21.240> reception

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
compounds makes the olfactory reception

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.719 
compounds makes the olfactory reception
to<00:06:22.960> a<00:06:23.169> truffle<00:06:23.650> oil<00:06:23.770> something<00:06:24.219> far<00:06:24.699> more

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:24.729 
to a truffle oil something far more

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:28.800 
to a truffle oil something far more
complex<00:06:25.330> and<00:06:25.479> what<00:06:25.659> we've<00:06:25.780> ever<00:06:26.020> experienced
