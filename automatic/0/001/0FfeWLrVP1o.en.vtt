00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.210
 hello my friends from youtube in this 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.740
 small video I want to show you the 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.300
 performance that I wear on my nails 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.640
 this is the second time 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.430
 I have my long fingernails and it is for this 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.250
 treatment that I do and I tell you the 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.460
 second b because it stops being bad and it 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.700
 they left me I put false fingernails 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.050
 those gel and they destroyed my nails and 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.870
 then I started doing this 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.570
 treatment and as you see I have my nails 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:35.950

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:40.390

 the complex I had to cut well cut 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.829

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.289

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.170

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.540
 hand 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.060

 how my cuticle pushed me 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.860
 I'm pushing everything to the cuticle 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.260
 and when I push it well, I wash 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.990

 then I wash my nails the hands and I 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.510
 I make it 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:20.769
 then I wear this 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:26.250
 nutran eo which is triple power of three 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:30.370
 power that strengthens the nails gives them 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.090
 nutrition and protects it from the 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.090
 break 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.760
 and I get 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.470
 after I put that as I paint 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.810
 this color that I bring here I put eta 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.490
 water has dropped some of the 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:52.200
 letters but the number is 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.200
 429 back 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.180
 I paint my nails, I give myself two passes 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:02.189
 this paint let it dry and 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:06.090
 then I give myself another last pasta of 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:09.090
 it's up that that protects me what 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.460
 it's the nails down and the nail protects me 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.650
 after I put on the paint 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.960
 in the performance that I do I do 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:23.020
 every four days or so 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.900
 I do all that I do not have to cut my 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.120
 cuticle every four days I just 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.640
 I do this treatment then I need 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.520
 file me the nail that I do we understand 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.040
 Assemble use is limited to one of 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.040
 crystal that are very good that you do not know 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.500
 it makes the bubble fringes 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.480
 it's very good they continue this treatment 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.939
 I recommend them if they want to grow 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.969
 also keep them healthy nails them 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:52.790
 I recommend using gloves when going to 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:54.890
 scrub that I recommend them so 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.049
 nails do not have to be in so much water 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.650
 if wet so long because that 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:02.329
 it makes you feel soft 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.060
