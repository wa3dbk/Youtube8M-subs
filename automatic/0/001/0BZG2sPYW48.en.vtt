in<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.069> area<00:02:45.520> or<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.819> bigger<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.510> area<00:02:46.900> the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
in the area or the bigger the area the

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.110

more<00:02:47.470> they'll<00:02:48.160> have<00:02:48.400> trouble<00:02:48.819> with<00:02:48.940> it

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
more they'll have trouble with it

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.470 
more they'll have trouble with it
because<00:02:49.599> the<00:02:49.900> Xbox<00:02:50.500> they<00:02:50.980> can<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.370> lot<00:02:51.640> more

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
because the Xbox they can a lot more

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.630 
because the Xbox they can a lot more
towards<00:02:53.019> that<00:02:53.140> area<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:53.680> make<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:54.040> game<00:02:54.280> run

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
towards that area and make the game run

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.449 
towards that area and make the game run
a<00:02:54.670> little<00:02:54.970> crappier<00:02:55.630> or<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:56.800> know<00:02:56.830> degrade

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
a little crappier or you know degrade

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.220 
a little crappier or you know degrade
the<00:02:57.580> graphics<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.150> little<00:02:58.450> bit<00:02:58.600> or<00:02:58.840> maybe<00:02:59.140> even

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
the graphics a little bit or maybe even

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.259 
the graphics a little bit or maybe even
cut<00:02:59.620> back<00:02:59.799> on<00:03:00.040> like<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:02.819> scaling<00:03:03.819> like<00:03:04.000> you

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
cut back on like the scaling like you

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.750 
cut back on like the scaling like you
know<00:03:04.390> fallout<00:03:04.900> they<00:03:05.049> load<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.650> level<00:03:05.980> based

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
know fallout they load the level based

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.120 
know fallout they load the level based
based<00:03:07.330> on<00:03:07.540> sections<00:03:08.080> of<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.290> map<00:03:08.470> you<00:03:08.739> slowly

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
based on sections of the map you slowly

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.650 
based on sections of the map you slowly
see<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.640> map<00:03:09.790> load<00:03:10.030> in<00:03:10.180> as<00:03:10.330> you're<00:03:10.510> walking

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
see the map load in as you're walking

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.110 
see the map load in as you're walking
and<00:03:11.080> it<00:03:11.140> makes<00:03:11.319> it<00:03:11.410> almost<00:03:11.530> look<00:03:11.799> seamless

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
and it makes it almost look seamless

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.430 
and it makes it almost look seamless
well<00:03:13.120> they<00:03:13.450> could<00:03:13.600> actually<00:03:13.750> look<00:03:14.110> you<00:03:14.319> know

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
well they could actually look you know

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.380 
well they could actually look you know
cut<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:14.830> back<00:03:15.069> or<00:03:15.130> cut<00:03:15.459> back<00:03:15.670> somewhere<00:03:15.970> and

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
cut that back or cut back somewhere and

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.449 
cut that back or cut back somewhere and
give<00:03:16.540> you<00:03:16.660> more<00:03:16.900> of<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.380> video<00:03:17.920> memory<00:03:18.130> cache

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
give you more of the video memory cache

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.509 
give you more of the video memory cache
a<00:03:18.670> for<00:03:18.910> items<00:03:19.330> to<00:03:20.019> make<00:03:20.170> it<00:03:20.380> flow<00:03:20.950> smoother

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
a for items to make it flow smoother

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.810 
a for items to make it flow smoother
through<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:22.000> smaller<00:03:22.269> areas<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:24.220> this<00:03:24.670> is

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
through the smaller areas and this is

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.970 
through the smaller areas and this is
why<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.060> PlayStation<00:03:25.750> freezes<00:03:26.350> all<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.769> time

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
why the PlayStation freezes all the time

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.880 
why the PlayStation freezes all the time
and<00:03:27.220> why<00:03:27.340> Skyrim<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.030> other<00:03:28.239> other<00:03:29.230> other

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
and why Skyrim and other other other

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.620 
and why Skyrim and other other other
other<00:03:30.220> things<00:03:30.670> on<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:30.910> console<00:03:31.299> worked

PlayStation<00:03:58.920> versus<00:03:59.920> the<00:04:00.040> xbox<00:04:00.579> and<00:04:00.820> it<00:04:01.060> seems

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
PlayStation versus the xbox and it seems

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.000 
PlayStation versus the xbox and it seems
like<00:04:01.420> they're<00:04:01.540> going<00:04:01.720> to<00:04:01.810> do<00:04:01.900> this<00:04:02.079> again<00:04:02.140> the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
like they're going to do this again the

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.620 
like they're going to do this again the
PlayStation<00:04:03.670> seems<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.180> have<00:04:04.329> the<00:04:04.480> better

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
PlayStation seems to have the better

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.750 
PlayStation seems to have the better
processor<00:04:05.350> this<00:04:05.560> time<00:04:05.799> around<00:04:05.950> book<00:04:06.579> from<00:04:06.700> the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
processor this time around book from the

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.720 
processor this time around book from the
specs<00:04:07.150> that<00:04:07.329> I've<00:04:07.450> seen<00:04:08.250> there's<00:04:09.250> both<00:04:09.459> the

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
specs that I've seen there's both the

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.220 
specs that I've seen there's both the
both<00:04:09.880> of<00:04:10.030> us<00:04:10.090> to<00:04:10.269> have<00:04:10.450> like<00:04:10.480> eight<00:04:10.810> gigs<00:04:11.109> of

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
both of us to have like eight gigs of

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.559 
both of us to have like eight gigs of
ram<00:04:11.470> I<00:04:11.829> think<00:04:12.790> it<00:04:12.850> was<00:04:12.940> eight<00:04:13.060> gigs<00:04:13.329> and<00:04:13.510> I

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
ram I think it was eight gigs and I

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.059 
ram I think it was eight gigs and I
think<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.870> xbox<00:04:14.290> is<00:04:14.470> rumored<00:04:14.769> to<00:04:14.799> have<00:04:14.890> like

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
think the xbox is rumored to have like

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.490 
think the xbox is rumored to have like
an<00:04:15.190> ATM

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
an ATM

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.740 
an ATM
processor<00:04:17.500> which<00:04:17.680> basically<00:04:18.419> it<00:04:19.419> is

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
processor which basically it is

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.089 
processor which basically it is
somewhere<00:04:20.079> without<00:04:20.289> guests<00:04:20.709> I<00:04:20.919> mean<00:04:21.069> I

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
somewhere without guests I mean I

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:23.959 
somewhere without guests I mean I
figured<00:04:21.789> they<00:04:21.909> started<00:04:22.360> working<00:04:22.750> on<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:22.960> Xbox

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:23.969 
figured they started working on the Xbox

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:27.480 
figured they started working on the Xbox
2009-2010<00:04:24.969> the<00:04:25.240> 720<00:04:25.870> in<00:04:26.020> whatever<00:04:26.710> car<00:04:27.159> was<00:04:27.370> in

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
2009-2010 the 720 in whatever car was in

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.510 
2009-2010 the 720 in whatever car was in
like<00:04:27.610> 2010<00:04:28.300> I<00:04:28.330> think<00:04:28.659> my<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.080> big<00:04:29.349> car<00:04:29.590> in<00:04:29.889> 2010

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
like 2010 I think my the big car in 2010

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.860 
like 2010 I think my the big car in 2010
was<00:04:30.669> like<00:04:30.819> the<00:04:32.550> was<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.639> 680<00:04:34.000> out<00:04:34.210> then<00:04:34.449> I<00:04:34.659> know

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
was like the was the 680 out then I know

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.950 
was like the was the 680 out then I know
the<00:04:35.050> 580<00:04:35.500> was<00:04:35.969> but<00:04:36.969> this<00:04:37.120> is<00:04:37.240> G<00:04:37.419> forces<00:04:37.810> in<00:04:37.930> the

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
the 580 was but this is G forces in the

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.559 
the 580 was but this is G forces in the
video<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:39.340> I<00:04:39.490> figured<00:04:39.819> that's<00:04:40.000> where<00:04:40.180> about

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:40.569 
video and I figured that's where about

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.080 
video and I figured that's where about
where<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:41.020> graphics<00:04:41.770> will<00:04:41.919> fall<00:04:42.069> into<00:04:42.280> so

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
where the graphics will fall into so

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.510 
where the graphics will fall into so
what<00:04:43.270> does<00:04:43.419> this<00:04:43.539> mean<00:04:43.599> it<00:04:44.169> means<00:04:44.560> you're

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
what does this mean it means you're

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.070 
what does this mean it means you're
going<00:04:45.669> to<00:04:45.759> get<00:04:45.819> graphics<00:04:46.240> about<00:04:46.509> as<00:04:46.750> good<00:04:46.900> as

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
going to get graphics about as good as

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.379 
going to get graphics about as good as
the<00:04:47.199> pc<00:04:47.530> can<00:04:47.680> deliver<00:04:47.979> and<00:04:48.250> we<00:04:48.909> got<00:04:49.030> to<00:04:49.120> win<00:04:49.240> on

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
the pc can deliver and we got to win on

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.719 
the pc can deliver and we got to win on
developers<00:04:49.930> to<00:04:50.080> even<00:04:50.319> to<00:04:50.560> kind<00:04:51.190> of<00:04:51.310> tweak<00:04:51.550> it

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
developers to even to kind of tweak it

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.809 
developers to even to kind of tweak it
based<00:04:52.419> off<00:04:52.629> that<00:04:52.659> so<00:04:53.110> PC<00:04:53.500> games<00:04:53.770> which<00:04:54.669> are

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:54.819 
based off that so PC games which are

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:56.969 
based off that so PC games which are
been<00:04:55.270> able<00:04:55.629> to<00:04:55.930> run<00:04:56.169> what<00:04:56.469> next-generation

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
been able to run what next-generation

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:58.529 
been able to run what next-generation
consoles<00:04:57.699> have<00:04:57.759> been<00:04:57.909> able<00:04:58.030> to<00:04:58.180> run<00:04:58.330> for<00:04:58.509> a

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
consoles have been able to run for a

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.010 
consoles have been able to run for a
while<00:04:58.719> will<00:04:59.620> be<00:05:00.129> able<00:05:00.580> to<00:05:01.030> actually<00:05:01.210> reap<00:05:01.840> the

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
while will be able to actually reap the

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.779 
while will be able to actually reap the
benefits<00:05:02.500> of<00:05:02.620> their<00:05:02.770> very<00:05:02.919> strong<00:05:03.190> processors

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
benefits of their very strong processors

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.330 
benefits of their very strong processors
because<00:05:03.969> when<00:05:04.419> it<00:05:05.080> takes<00:05:05.319> a<00:05:05.530> while<00:05:05.740> for<00:05:06.099> people

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
because when it takes a while for people

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.640 
because when it takes a while for people
to<00:05:06.819> get<00:05:07.210> the<00:05:07.449> good<00:05:07.659> graphics<00:05:08.139> out<00:05:08.259> of<00:05:08.379> a<00:05:08.469> game

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
to get the good graphics out of a game

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.490 
to get the good graphics out of a game
for<00:05:09.520> example<00:05:09.879> look<00:05:10.000> at<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.150> X<00:05:10.360> trucks<00:05:10.750> 360

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
for example look at the X trucks 360

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.019 
for example look at the X trucks 360
they<00:05:12.069> had<00:05:12.310> the<00:05:13.349> call<00:05:14.349> of<00:05:14.469> duty<00:05:14.500> to<00:05:14.889> you<00:05:15.699> compare

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:16.029 
they had the call of duty to you compare

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:19.050 
they had the call of duty to you compare
call<00:05:16.270> of<00:05:16.389> duty<00:05:16.629> 24<00:05:17.430> even<00:05:18.430> to<00:05:18.520> call<00:05:18.729> of<00:05:18.819> duty<00:05:19.029> 4

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
call of duty 24 even to call of duty 4

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.689 
call of duty 24 even to call of duty 4
it's<00:05:19.539> night<00:05:19.840> and<00:05:19.870> day<00:05:20.219> that's<00:05:21.219> because<00:05:21.580> they

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
it's night and day that's because they

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.339 
it's night and day that's because they
actually<00:05:21.849> learn<00:05:22.180> how<00:05:22.419> to<00:05:22.479> get<00:05:22.659> those<00:05:22.810> graphics

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
actually learn how to get those graphics

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:24.600 
actually learn how to get those graphics
out<00:05:23.500> of<00:05:23.650> it<00:05:23.740> they<00:05:23.830> learn<00:05:24.009> about<00:05:24.190> the<00:05:24.370> tweak

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
out of it they learn about the tweak

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.330 
out of it they learn about the tweak
they<00:05:24.849> learn<00:05:25.060> how<00:05:25.090> to<00:05:25.529> basically<00:05:26.529> make<00:05:26.830> their

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
they learn how to basically make their

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.700 
they learn how to basically make their
engines<00:05:28.090> run<00:05:28.330> smooth<00:05:28.719> on<00:05:29.110> the<00:05:29.259> platform

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
engines run smooth on the platform

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.129 
engines run smooth on the platform
they're<00:05:29.860> given<00:05:30.360> but<00:05:31.360> what<00:05:31.779> do<00:05:31.839> you<00:05:31.930> guys<00:05:32.080> think

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
they're given but what do you guys think

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.469 
they're given but what do you guys think
that<00:05:32.740> about<00:05:33.250> the<00:05:33.639> PlayStation<00:05:34.240> whether

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
that about the PlayStation whether

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:35.879 
that about the PlayStation whether
you're<00:05:34.779> splitting<00:05:35.110> up<00:05:35.289> their<00:05:35.440> video<00:05:35.680> memory

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
you're splitting up their video memory

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.430 
you're splitting up their video memory
cache<00:05:36.219> a<00:05:36.400> again<00:05:36.839> do<00:05:37.839> you<00:05:37.930> think<00:05:38.139> it's<00:05:38.259> going<00:05:38.379> to

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
cache a again do you think it's going to

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.050 
cache a again do you think it's going to
be<00:05:38.560> a<00:05:38.589> downgrade<00:05:38.860> do<00:05:39.460> you<00:05:39.550> think<00:05:39.759> it's<00:05:39.909> going

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
be a downgrade do you think it's going

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.670 
be a downgrade do you think it's going
to<00:05:40.120> be<00:05:40.270> a<00:05:40.449> hinderance<00:05:40.900> this<00:05:41.050> time<00:05:41.289> or<00:05:41.529> you

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
to be a hinderance this time or you

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.140 
to be a hinderance this time or you
think<00:05:41.800> you<00:05:41.949> should<00:05:42.129> going<00:05:42.250> to<00:05:42.310> be<00:05:42.370> so<00:05:42.520> big<00:05:42.759> it's

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150
