kind of how I structured my books and
things<00:00:23.689> like<00:00:23.810> that<00:00:24.020> and<00:00:24.230> then<00:00:24.920> I've<00:00:25.820> sat

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
things like that and then I've sat

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.580 
things like that and then I've sat
through<00:00:26.300> lecture<00:00:26.630> what<00:00:26.779> I<00:00:26.810> was<00:00:27.080> where<00:00:27.529> I<00:00:27.560> was

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
through lecture what I was where I was

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.470 
through lecture what I was where I was
just<00:00:27.740> bored<00:00:28.070> as<00:00:28.220> hell<00:00:28.250> and<00:00:28.699> it<00:00:28.940> didn't<00:00:29.270> apply

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
just bored as hell and it didn't apply

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.660 
just bored as hell and it didn't apply
to<00:00:29.510> me<00:00:29.660> so<00:00:30.020> I<00:00:30.050> figured<00:00:30.289> I'll<00:00:30.920> just<00:00:30.980> try<00:00:31.400> to<00:00:31.460> run

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
to me so I figured I'll just try to run

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.340 
to me so I figured I'll just try to run
through<00:00:31.820> this<00:00:31.970> in<00:00:32.180> ten<00:00:32.510> minutes<00:00:32.660> and<00:00:32.960> then<00:00:33.080> we

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
through this in ten minutes and then we

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.049 
through this in ten minutes and then we
can<00:00:33.530> talk<00:00:33.620> about<00:00:33.680> any<00:00:34.040> nutrition<00:00:34.580> topics<00:00:34.730> you

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
look at nutrition as a hierarchy when

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.029 
look at nutrition as a hierarchy when
working<00:01:02.059> with<00:01:02.180> people<00:01:02.480> so<00:01:02.890> starting<00:01:03.890> at<00:01:03.980> the

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:04.039 
working with people so starting at the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:06.609 
working with people so starting at the
most<00:01:04.220> important<00:01:04.670> topics<00:01:05.270> first<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:06.500> then

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
most important topics first and then

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.170 
most important topics first and then
working<00:01:06.890> our<00:01:07.130> way<00:01:07.160> down<00:01:07.490> most<00:01:08.030> of<00:01:08.149> our

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
working our way down most of our

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.639 
working our way down most of our
industry<00:01:08.539> focuses<00:01:08.930> on<00:01:09.080> stuff<00:01:09.350> that's<00:01:09.530> not

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
industry focuses on stuff that's not

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.639 
industry focuses on stuff that's not
even<00:01:09.830> on<00:01:09.950> here<00:01:10.190> like<00:01:10.460> miracle<00:01:11.440> diets<00:01:12.440> and

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
even on here like miracle diets and

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:14.469 
even on here like miracle diets and
programs<00:01:13.070> but<00:01:13.550> they<00:01:13.670> don't<00:01:13.850> they<00:01:14.060> don't<00:01:14.330> they

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
programs but they don't they don't they

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.080 
programs but they don't they don't they
don't<00:01:14.770> that's<00:01:15.770> what<00:01:15.979> sells<00:01:16.220> by<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.520> way<00:01:16.670> but

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
don't that's what sells by the way but

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.700 
don't that's what sells by the way but
they<00:01:17.210> don't<00:01:17.390> focus<00:01:17.750> on<00:01:18.049> them<00:01:18.229> on<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.500> major

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
they don't focus on them on the major

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.050 
they don't focus on them on the major
steps<00:01:18.979> people<00:01:19.130> need<00:01:19.400> to<00:01:19.490> start<00:01:19.670> taking<00:01:19.790> them

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
steps people need to start taking them

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.820 
steps people need to start taking them
really<00:01:20.360> make<00:01:20.510> a<00:01:20.540> difference<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:21.200> what<00:01:21.740> is

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
really make a difference so what is

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.620 
really make a difference so what is
different<00:01:22.250> I'd<00:01:22.820> kind<00:01:23.150> of<00:01:23.210> take<00:01:23.420> of<00:01:23.570> a

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
different I'd kind of take of a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.929 
different I'd kind of take of a
different<00:01:24.049> approach<00:01:24.290> with<00:01:24.400> more<00:01:25.400> athletes

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
different approach with more athletes

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.580 
different approach with more athletes
which<00:01:26.119> probably<00:01:26.390> most<00:01:26.600> of<00:01:26.810> you<00:01:26.900> guys<00:01:27.049> are<00:01:27.110> and

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
which probably most of you guys are and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.160 
which probably most of you guys are and
in<00:01:28.009> the<00:01:28.250> general<00:01:28.610> population<00:01:28.759> where<00:01:29.479> you<00:01:30.080> know

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
in the general population where you know

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.660 
in the general population where you know
maybe<00:01:30.380> some<00:01:30.650> of<00:01:30.680> your<00:01:30.830> clients<00:01:31.040> fall<00:01:31.400> under

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
maybe some of your clients fall under

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.149 
maybe some of your clients fall under
that<00:01:31.820> or<00:01:32.090> whatever<00:01:32.780> so<00:01:33.220> what<00:01:34.220> I<00:01:34.250> do<00:01:34.369> is<00:01:34.640> I<00:01:34.790> I

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
that or whatever so what I do is I I

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.980 
that or whatever so what I do is I I
kind<00:01:37.159> of<00:01:37.310> work<00:01:37.580> through<00:01:37.759> a<00:01:37.820> hierarchy<00:01:38.119> with

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
kind of work through a hierarchy with

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.859 
kind of work through a hierarchy with
different<00:01:39.320> demographics<00:01:39.860> so<00:01:40.659> I'll<00:01:41.659> just<00:01:41.780> run

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
different demographics so I'll just run

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.450 
different demographics so I'll just run
through<00:01:42.020> them<00:01:42.110> both<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:42.409> then<00:01:42.500> we<00:01:42.590> can<00:01:42.710> do

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
through them both and then we can do

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.380 
through them both and then we can do
whatever<00:01:43.610> all<00:01:44.060> right

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
whatever all right

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.319 
whatever all right
so<00:01:44.630> general<00:01:45.020> population<00:01:45.619> generally<00:01:46.520> most

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
so general population generally most

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.960 
so general population generally most
people<00:01:47.590> they<00:01:48.590> just<00:01:48.619> eat<00:01:49.159> all<00:01:49.460> day<00:01:49.759> and

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
people they just eat all day and

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.380 
people they just eat all day and
crap<00:01:50.829> typical<00:01:51.829> refined<00:01:52.220> ytk<00:01:52.820> American<00:01:53.210> diet

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
crap typical refined ytk American diet

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.300 
crap typical refined ytk American diet
so<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:54.530> number<00:01:54.740> one<00:01:54.860> thing<00:01:54.979> you<00:01:55.009> can<00:01:55.130> start

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
so the number one thing you can start

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.710 
so the number one thing you can start
working<00:01:55.729> with<00:01:55.850> them<00:01:55.970> on<00:01:56.090> is<00:01:56.240> just<00:01:56.390> improving

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
working with them on is just improving

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.170 
working with them on is just improving
their<00:01:56.899> food<00:01:57.079> choices<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:57.619> it's<00:01:57.770> an<00:01:57.860> easy

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
their food choices and it's an easy

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.039 
their food choices and it's an easy
because<00:01:59.180> they're<00:01:59.420> not<00:01:59.509> gonna<00:01:59.630> sit<00:01:59.869> there<00:01:59.899> and

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
because they're not gonna sit there and

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.899 
because they're not gonna sit there and
track<00:02:00.320> calories<00:02:00.799> most<00:02:00.979> of<00:02:01.189> them<00:02:01.399> and<00:02:01.579> I'll

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
track calories most of them and I'll

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.520 
track calories most of them and I'll
tell<00:02:02.090> you<00:02:02.210> why<00:02:02.329> tracking<00:02:02.840> calories<00:02:03.259> for<00:02:03.439> that

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
tell you why tracking calories for that

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.800 
tell you why tracking calories for that
demographic<00:02:03.799> is<00:02:04.100> actually<00:02:04.460> doesn't<00:02:05.450> work<00:02:05.479> for

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
most of them but the the highest level

population you're just getting them to

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.979

easiest educational templates to do with

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.330 
easiest educational templates to do with
that<00:02:17.810> is<00:02:18.079> just<00:02:18.350> talking<00:02:18.590> about<00:02:18.769> specific

Dietary<00:02:19.879> Approaches<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:20.450> this<00:02:20.599> is<00:02:20.690> where

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
Dietary Approaches so this is where

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.380 
Dietary Approaches so this is where
Paleo<00:02:21.230> diet<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:21.680> think<00:02:21.890> is<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:22.220> effective<00:02:22.730> for<00:02:23.000> a

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
Paleo diet I think is so effective for a

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.850 
Paleo diet I think is so effective for a
lot<00:02:23.629> of<00:02:23.750> people

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
lot of people

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.410 
lot of people
because<00:02:25.370> for<00:02:25.850> people<00:02:26.030> who<00:02:26.090> don't<00:02:26.240> care<00:02:26.360> about

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
because for people who don't care about

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.730 
because for people who don't care about
nutrition<00:02:26.960> they<00:02:27.170> don't<00:02:27.320> know<00:02:27.380> what<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.620> hell

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740

a<00:02:27.770> carbohydrate<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:29.450> know<00:02:29.570> all<00:02:29.780> that

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
a carbohydrate is you know all that

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.720 
a carbohydrate is you know all that
stuff<00:02:30.320> it's<00:02:30.590> just<00:02:30.710> a<00:02:30.920> simplification<00:02:31.340> of

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
stuff it's just a simplification of

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.870 
stuff it's just a simplification of
everything<00:02:32.150> it's<00:02:32.270> like<00:02:32.330> look<00:02:32.860> eat<00:02:33.860> which<00:02:34.490> you

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
know from our evolutionary past you know

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.190 
know from our evolutionary past you know
you<00:02:37.340> know<00:02:37.730> that<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:38.240> piece<00:02:38.570> of<00:02:38.600> fruit<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:39.020> better

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
you know that a piece of fruit is better

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.840 
you know that a piece of fruit is better
for<00:02:39.440> you<00:02:39.620> than<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.860> fruit<00:02:40.370> roll-up<00:02:40.610> or

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
for you than a fruit roll-up or

for you than a fruit roll-up or
something<00:02:41.150> like<00:02:41.330> that<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:41.660> it's<00:02:42.200> just<00:02:42.260> an<00:02:42.470> easy

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
something like that so it's just an easy

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.800 
something like that so it's just an easy
educational<00:02:43.760> tool<00:02:43.970> with<00:02:44.270> people<00:02:44.600> and

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
educational tool with people and

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.620 
educational tool with people and
optimizing<00:02:45.709> food<00:02:45.920> choices<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:47.090> like<00:02:47.390> if

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
optimizing food choices is you like if

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.330 
optimizing food choices is you like if
people<00:02:48.170> get<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:48.440> right<00:02:48.709> that<00:02:48.950> takes<00:02:49.160> them

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
people get that right that takes them

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.520 
people get that right that takes them
90%<00:02:50.030> of<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.450> way<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:51.020> they<00:02:51.140> don't<00:02:51.260> have<00:02:51.350> to

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
90% of the way and so they don't have to

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.260 
90% of the way and so they don't have to
sit<00:02:51.709> there<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:51.980> worry<00:02:52.220> about<00:02:52.280> stuff<00:02:53.090> they're

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
sit there and worry about stuff they're

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.180 
sit there and worry about stuff they're
not<00:02:53.300> going<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.600> do<00:02:53.720> which<00:02:53.930> is<00:02:53.959> track<00:02:54.709> calories

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
not going to do which is track calories

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.560 
not going to do which is track calories
and<00:02:55.370> carbohydrates<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:56.030> all<00:02:56.150> these<00:02:56.270> things

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
and carbohydrates and all these things

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.290 
and carbohydrates and all these things
so<00:02:56.860> really<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.489> actually<00:02:58.850> doing<00:02:59.150> that

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
so really and and actually doing that

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.600 
so really and and actually doing that
can't<00:02:59.630> really<00:02:59.840> make<00:02:59.989> up<00:03:00.230> for<00:03:01.070> crappy<00:03:01.340> food

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
can't really make up for crappy food

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:02.080 
can't really make up for crappy food
choices

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
choices

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.670 
choices
I<00:03:02.270> mean<00:03:02.450> athletes<00:03:02.900> can<00:03:03.080> get<00:03:03.230> results<00:03:03.590> on

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
I mean athletes can get results on

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.160 
I mean athletes can get results on
subpar<00:03:04.250> food<00:03:04.580> choices<00:03:04.850> because<00:03:05.750> because

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
subpar food choices because because

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
subpar food choices because because

they're very meticulous in their

training hard an average person is not
that's<00:03:09.230> why<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:10.220> know<00:03:10.310> we<00:03:10.400> have<00:03:10.520> all<00:03:10.640> these

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
that's why you know we have all these

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.130 
that's why you know we have all these
diets<00:03:11.060> no<00:03:11.209> one's<00:03:11.360> getting<00:03:11.600> anywhere<00:03:11.840> because

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
diets no one's getting anywhere because

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.320 
diets no one's getting anywhere because
they're<00:03:12.260> not<00:03:12.410> focusing<00:03:13.010> on<00:03:13.160> improving<00:03:13.850> food

they're not focusing on improving food
choices<00:03:14.570> which<00:03:14.870> is<00:03:14.989> hard<00:03:15.350> to<00:03:15.530> do<00:03:15.830> in<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.220> real

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
choices which is hard to do in the real

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.550 
choices which is hard to do in the real
world<00:03:16.750> but<00:03:17.750> it's<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:17.989> most<00:03:18.110> important<00:03:18.530> step

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
world but it's the most important step

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.260 
world but it's the most important step
so<00:03:19.130> you<00:03:19.220> got<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.520> just<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:19.940> got<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.150> keep

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
so you got to just you got to keep

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.699 
so you got to just you got to keep
pounding<00:03:20.600> on<00:03:20.690> people<00:03:20.870> about<00:03:21.110> that<00:03:21.290> you<00:03:21.470> got<00:03:21.590> to

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
pounding on people about that you got to

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:22.990 
pounding on people about that you got to
improve<00:03:21.950> your<00:03:22.100> food<00:03:22.250> choices<00:03:22.520> you<00:03:22.730> got<00:03:22.880> to

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
improve your food choices you got to

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.150 
improve your food choices you got to
stop<00:03:23.150> eating<00:03:23.330> so<00:03:24.050> many<00:03:24.140> refined<00:03:24.590> foods<00:03:24.920> and

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
stop eating so many refined foods and

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.120 
stop eating so many refined foods and
all<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.340> stuff<00:03:26.470> then<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:27.500> get<00:03:27.739> into<00:03:27.890> diet

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
all that stuff then I get into diet

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.340 
all that stuff then I get into diet
structure<00:03:28.549> more<00:03:28.730> for<00:03:28.940> practicality<00:03:29.480> than

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
structure more for practicality than

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.220 
structure more for practicality than
anything<00:03:30.799> so<00:03:31.549> you<00:03:32.480> know<00:03:32.570> the<00:03:32.780> type<00:03:32.930> of<00:03:32.959> guy<00:03:33.170> who

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
anything so you know the type of guy who

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.289 
anything so you know the type of guy who

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
could follow any diet plan because I'm

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.570 
could follow any diet plan because I'm
an<00:03:35.390> athlete<00:03:35.660> and<00:03:35.900> I'll<00:03:36.260> suffer<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.280> I'll<00:03:37.370> make

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
an athlete and I'll suffer and I'll make

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.340 
an athlete and I'll suffer and I'll make
sacrifices<00:03:38.180> and<00:03:38.390> all<00:03:38.630> you<00:03:38.750> eat<00:03:38.810> six<00:03:39.140> small

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
sacrifices and all you eat six small

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.810 
sacrifices and all you eat six small
meals<00:03:39.380> a<00:03:39.680> day<00:03:39.709> and<00:03:39.980> starve<00:03:40.250> at<00:03:40.400> night<00:03:40.580> and<00:03:40.760> be

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
meals a day and starve at night and be

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.660 
meals a day and starve at night and be
miserable<00:03:41.080> because<00:03:42.080> that's<00:03:42.530> just<00:03:42.680> that's

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
miserable because that's just that's

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.210 
miserable because that's just that's
what<00:03:43.820> we<00:03:43.940> do<00:03:44.090> we're<00:03:44.269> athletes<00:03:44.660> right<00:03:44.840> what<00:03:45.530> 90%

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
what we do we're athletes right what 90%

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.400 
what we do we're athletes right what 90%
of<00:03:46.700> most<00:03:47.090> busy<00:03:47.510> professionals<00:03:48.049> that<00:03:48.170> you<00:03:48.260> work

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
of most busy professionals that you work

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.650 
of most busy professionals that you work
with<00:03:48.730> they<00:03:49.730> see<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:50.090> plan<00:03:50.299> and<00:03:50.420> they're<00:03:50.540> like

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
with they see that plan and they're like

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.390 
with they see that plan and they're like
 it<00:03:51.410> I'm<00:03:51.590> never<00:03:51.739> going<00:03:51.980> to<00:03:52.040> follow<00:03:52.220> that

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
 it I'm never going to follow that

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.090 
 it I'm never going to follow that
like<00:03:52.820> this<00:03:53.570> is<00:03:53.690> completely<00:03:54.410> impractical<00:03:54.650> and

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
like this is completely impractical and

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.550 
like this is completely impractical and
again<00:03:55.579> you<00:03:56.090> have<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.329> separate<00:03:56.840> what<00:03:57.110> you<00:03:57.350> can

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
again you have to separate what you can

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.170 
again you have to separate what you can
do<00:03:57.739> from<00:03:57.980> what<00:03:58.160> your<00:03:58.280> clients<00:03:58.640> can<00:03:58.730> do<00:03:58.910> and

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
do from what your clients can do and

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.360 
do from what your clients can do and
that<00:03:59.630> was<00:03:59.720> a<00:03:59.780> big<00:03:59.989> step<00:04:00.260> for<00:04:00.440> me<00:04:00.470> for<00:04:01.010> starting

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
that was a big step for me for starting

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.770 
that was a big step for me for starting
to<00:04:01.430> get<00:04:01.579> results<00:04:01.820> with<00:04:02.030> people<00:04:02.299> so<00:04:02.540> and

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
to get results with people so and

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.479 
to get results with people so and
actually<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.440> lot<00:04:03.560> of<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.769> research<00:04:04.070> is<00:04:04.220> coming

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
actually a lot of the research is coming

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:05.620 
actually a lot of the research is coming
out<00:04:04.579> we<00:04:04.700> could<00:04:04.820> talk<00:04:04.940> about<00:04:05.060> this<00:04:05.269> that<00:04:05.480> meal

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
out we could talk about this that meal

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.180 
out we could talk about this that meal
frequency<00:04:06.170> is<00:04:06.260> irrelevant<00:04:06.739> so<00:04:06.890> this<00:04:07.040> whole

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
frequency is irrelevant so this whole

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.490 
frequency is irrelevant so this whole
idea<00:04:07.340> that<00:04:07.579> we<00:04:07.730> needed<00:04:07.970> six<00:04:08.959> small<00:04:09.170> meals<00:04:09.200> a

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
idea that we needed six small meals a

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.819 
idea that we needed six small meals a
day

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
day

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.620 
day
it's<00:04:10.250> an<00:04:10.310> optimized<00:04:10.730> body<00:04:10.940> composition<00:04:11.329> is

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
it's an optimized body composition is

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.630 
it's an optimized body composition is
completely<00:04:12.140> false<00:04:12.410> is<00:04:12.829> completely<00:04:13.370> false

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
completely false is completely false

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.160 
completely false is completely false
there's<00:04:13.820> a<00:04:13.910> lot<00:04:14.150> of<00:04:14.299> new<00:04:14.420> research<00:04:14.570> coming<00:04:14.930> out

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
there's a lot of new research coming out

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.599 
there's a lot of new research coming out
that<00:04:15.350> you<00:04:15.530> can<00:04:15.680> eat<00:04:15.769> two<00:04:15.920> meals<00:04:15.950> a<00:04:16.250> day<00:04:16.280> get

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
that you can eat two meals a day get

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.880 
that you can eat two meals a day get
great<00:04:16.790> results<00:04:16.989> with<00:04:17.989> busy<00:04:18.200> professionals

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
great results with busy professionals

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.250 
great results with busy professionals
what's<00:04:19.160> more<00:04:19.370> doable<00:04:19.780> getting<00:04:20.780> them<00:04:20.900> to<00:04:21.079> eat<00:04:21.229> a

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
what's more doable getting them to eat a

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.860 
what's more doable getting them to eat a
good<00:04:21.470> lunch<00:04:21.530> and<00:04:21.950> dinner<00:04:22.190> or<00:04:23.030> trying<00:04:23.660> to<00:04:23.720> get

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
good lunch and dinner or trying to get

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.530 
good lunch and dinner or trying to get
them<00:04:24.080> to<00:04:24.110> pack<00:04:24.410> Tupperware's<00:04:24.950> and<00:04:25.419> you<00:04:26.419> know

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
them to pack Tupperware's and you know

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.180 
them to pack Tupperware's and you know
eat<00:04:26.720> six<00:04:26.990> small<00:04:27.169> meals<00:04:27.200> and<00:04:27.650> all<00:04:27.740> that<00:04:27.890> stuff

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
eat six small meals and all that stuff

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.270 
eat six small meals and all that stuff
so<00:04:28.220> setting<00:04:29.210> up<00:04:29.330> a<00:04:29.590> it's<00:04:30.590> it's<00:04:30.860> not<00:04:31.070> that<00:04:31.130> that

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
so setting up a it's it's not that that

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.670 
so setting up a it's it's not that that
can't<00:04:31.640> work<00:04:31.729> that<00:04:31.910> works<00:04:32.090> great<00:04:32.360> too<00:04:32.599> but<00:04:33.289> it's

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
can't work that works great too but it's

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.100 
can't work that works great too but it's
really<00:04:33.800> about<00:04:34.250> taking<00:04:35.150> new<00:04:35.450> research<00:04:35.930> and

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
really about taking new research and

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.260 
really about taking new research and
then<00:04:36.229> telling<00:04:37.039> people<00:04:37.310> listen

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
then telling people listen

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.210 
then telling people listen
you<00:04:38.540> can<00:04:38.720> you<00:04:38.930> can<00:04:39.110> actually<00:04:39.290> just<00:04:39.740> eat<00:04:39.980> lunch

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
you can you can actually just eat lunch

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.460 
you can you can actually just eat lunch
and<00:04:40.430> dinner<00:04:40.610> and<00:04:40.880> if<00:04:41.420> you<00:04:41.900> got<00:04:42.110> good<00:04:42.290> food

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
and dinner and if you got good food

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.750 
and dinner and if you got good food
choices<00:04:42.740> going<00:04:43.010> on<00:04:43.130> you're<00:04:43.280> gonna<00:04:43.400> get<00:04:43.610> great

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
choices going on you're gonna get great

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.660 
choices going on you're gonna get great
results<00:04:43.940> and<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:45.740> biggest<00:04:46.160> change<00:04:46.340> I've<00:04:46.550> made

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
results and the biggest change I've made

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.640 
results and the biggest change I've made
in<00:04:46.820> the<00:04:46.910> last<00:04:46.940> year<00:04:47.360> is<00:04:47.600> that<00:04:47.810> structure<00:04:48.290> my

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
in the last year is that structure my

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.290 
in the last year is that structure my
it's<00:04:48.980> it's<00:04:49.220> based<00:04:49.610> on<00:04:49.730> intermittent<00:04:50.180> fasting

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
it's it's based on intermittent fasting

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.560 
it's it's based on intermittent fasting
mine's<00:04:50.780> called<00:04:51.020> intermittent<00:04:51.500> feast<00:04:51.680> but

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
mine's called intermittent feast but

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.940 
mine's called intermittent feast but
people<00:04:53.570> who<00:04:53.690> never<00:04:53.960> got<00:04:54.200> results<00:04:54.470> before<00:04:54.830> are

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
people who never got results before are

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.470 
people who never got results before are
now<00:04:55.070> starting<00:04:55.280> to<00:04:55.460> get<00:04:55.610> results<00:04:56.000> because<00:04:56.330> they

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
now starting to get results because they
