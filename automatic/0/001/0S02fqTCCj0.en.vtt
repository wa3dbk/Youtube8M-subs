students that has total mastery over a

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.530 
students that has total mastery over a
concept<00:01:14.570> so<00:01:15.140> I<00:01:15.170> used<00:01:15.530> this<00:01:16.159> term<00:01:17.000> in<00:01:17.060> my

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
concept so I used this term in my

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.690 
concept so I used this term in my
lessons<00:01:17.990> and<00:01:18.110> develop<00:01:18.920> a<00:01:18.980> concept<00:01:19.490> of<00:01:19.640> what

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
lessons and develop a concept of what

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.210 
lessons and develop a concept of what
total<00:01:20.210> mastery<00:01:20.450> actually<00:01:21.140> means<00:01:21.380> at<00:01:22.100> some

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
total mastery actually means at some

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.490 
total mastery actually means at some
critical<00:01:22.790> juncture<00:01:23.570> such<00:01:23.870> as<00:01:24.020> a<00:01:24.050> skill<00:01:24.470> that

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
critical juncture such as a skill that

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.500 
critical juncture such as a skill that
needs<00:01:24.830> to<00:01:24.920> be<00:01:25.010> mastered<00:01:25.550> I<00:01:25.730> asked<00:01:26.300> the

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
needs to be mastered I asked the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.900 
needs to be mastered I asked the
students<00:01:27.050> to<00:01:27.620> rate<00:01:27.980> their<00:01:28.280> total<00:01:28.700> mastery

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
students to rate their total mastery

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.740 
students to rate their total mastery

skill from 10 being total mastery to 1
being<00:01:33.320> not<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:34.270> then<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.510> assign<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.260> teams

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500

scoring 4 to 4 to 7 range of the mastery

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.260 
scoring 4 to 4 to 7 range of the mastery
will<00:01:54.560> grasp<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.370> concepts<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:56.030> they<00:01:56.120> will

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
will grasp the concepts and they will

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
will grasp the concepts and they will
become<00:01:57.070> helpers<00:01:58.070> for<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.520> mentor<00:01:59.230> now<00:02:00.230> the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
become helpers for the mentor now the

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.170 
become helpers for the mentor now the
second<00:02:00.710> strategy<00:02:01.010> that<00:02:01.400> you<00:02:01.520> need<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.820> do<00:02:02.000> is

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
second strategy that you need to do is

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.740 
second strategy that you need to do is
to<00:02:02.330> keep<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:03.050> group's<00:02:03.530> small<00:02:04.370> a<00:02:04.730> maximum<00:02:05.390> of<00:02:05.480> 6

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
to keep the group's small a maximum of 6

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.979 
to keep the group's small a maximum of 6
kids<00:02:06.050> any<00:02:06.800> more<00:02:07.250> than<00:02:07.460> 6<00:02:07.790> and<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.209> groups<00:02:08.750> can

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
kids any more than 6 and the groups can

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.860 
kids any more than 6 and the groups can
sometimes<00:02:09.679> become<00:02:10.060> unruly<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.569> that's

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
sometimes become unruly and that's

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.479 
sometimes become unruly and that's
similar<00:02:12.319> to<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.500> lot<00:02:12.739> of<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.010> groups<00:02:13.220> that<00:02:13.310> you

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
similar to a lot of the groups that you

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.759 
similar to a lot of the groups that you
operate<00:02:13.700> inside<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.330> classroom<00:02:14.840> now<00:02:15.500> don't

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
operate inside the classroom now don't

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.680 
operate inside the classroom now don't
forget<00:02:16.099> some<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.459> kids<00:02:16.670> who<00:02:16.790> have<00:02:17.030> mastery

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
forget some of the kids who have mastery

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.649 
forget some of the kids who have mastery
skills<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.319> one<00:02:18.560> two<00:02:18.950> or<00:02:19.099> three<00:02:19.459> can<00:02:20.090> also<00:02:20.269> be

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
the kids understand what their concept

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.920 
the kids understand what their concept
is<00:02:36.110> that<00:02:36.590> they<00:02:36.769> need<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.040> grasp<00:02:37.580> now<00:02:38.360> this<00:02:38.720> is

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
is that they need to grasp now this is

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.369 
is that they need to grasp now this is
critical<00:02:39.349> it<00:02:40.040> must<00:02:40.580> be<00:02:40.819> a<00:02:40.849> simple<00:02:41.480> one-step

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
critical it must be a simple one-step

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.770 
critical it must be a simple one-step
procedure<00:02:43.129> for<00:02:43.910> example<00:02:44.269> don't<00:02:44.480> tackle

understands<00:02:47.930> fractions<00:02:48.590> so<00:02:49.340> if<00:02:49.459> you<00:02:49.580> want<00:02:49.790> us

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
understands fractions so if you want us

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.150 
understands fractions so if you want us
to<00:02:49.910> teach<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.330> skill<00:02:50.599> use<00:02:51.410> vulgar<00:02:51.739> fractions

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
to teach a skill use vulgar fractions

and convert them to a percent that's a

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.830 
and convert them to a percent that's a
simple<00:02:54.890> skill<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.489> one<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:56.450> kids<00:02:56.660> can

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
simple skill and one that the kids can

simple skill and one that the kids can
work<00:02:57.049> on<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:02.090> once<00:03:02.329> you<00:03:02.480> have<00:03:02.630> your<00:03:02.840> kids<00:03:03.079> in

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
work on so once you have your kids in

work on so once you have your kids in
their<00:03:03.530> groups<00:03:03.799> they're<00:03:04.010> ready<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.310> go<00:03:04.579> then

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
their groups they're ready to go then

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.120 
their groups they're ready to go then
you<00:03:05.329> need<00:03:05.569> to<00:03:05.720> move<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.140> groups<00:03:06.440> away<00:03:06.829> from

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
you need to move the groups away from

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.130 
you need to move the groups away from
each<00:03:07.250> other<00:03:07.400> this<00:03:08.239> is<00:03:08.299> quite<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:08.690> noisy

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
each other this is quite a noisy

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.690 
each other this is quite a noisy
activity<00:03:09.590> because<00:03:09.799> you<00:03:09.920> have<00:03:10.099> a<00:03:10.130> quite<00:03:10.459> a<00:03:10.489> few

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
activity because you have a quite a few

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.580 
activity because you have a quite a few
learning<00:03:10.970> groups<00:03:11.510> around<00:03:11.810> in<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.110> classroom

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
learning groups around in the classroom

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.259 
learning groups around in the classroom
and<00:03:12.709> there<00:03:12.860> is<00:03:12.980> still<00:03:13.340> behavior<00:03:14.030> management

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
and there is still behavior management

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.479 
and there is still behavior management
that<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:14.930> have<00:03:15.049> to<00:03:15.200> consider<00:03:15.530> now<00:03:16.310> I've<00:03:16.459> used

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
that you have to consider now I've used

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.160 
that you have to consider now I've used
this<00:03:16.849> strategy<00:03:17.030> quite<00:03:17.569> a<00:03:17.599> lot<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.049> I've

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
this strategy quite a lot and I've

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.050 
this strategy quite a lot and I've
always<00:03:18.410> found<00:03:18.739> out<00:03:19.010> that<00:03:19.190> kids<00:03:19.400> work<00:03:19.670> quite

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
always found out that kids work quite

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.569 
always found out that kids work quite
well<00:03:20.390> when<00:03:20.569> they<00:03:20.750> have<00:03:20.989> a<00:03:21.319> single<00:03:21.680> focus<00:03:22.069> are

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
well when they have a single focus are

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.640 
well when they have a single focus are
interacting<00:03:23.239> only<00:03:23.569> with<00:03:23.810> a<00:03:23.840> small<00:03:24.019> group<00:03:24.410> and

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
interacting only with a small group and

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.309 
interacting only with a small group and
I've<00:03:25.190> kept<00:03:25.489> on<00:03:25.670> task<00:03:26.000> by<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.480> Mentors

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
I've kept on task by the Mentors

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.780 
I've kept on task by the Mentors
now<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:27.739> want<00:03:28.010> to<00:03:28.040> remember<00:03:28.280> that<00:03:28.610> their

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
now you want to remember that their

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.940 
now you want to remember that their
mentors<00:03:29.150> are<00:03:29.329> normally<00:03:30.049> your<00:03:30.260> better<00:03:30.530> behaved

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
mentors are normally your better behaved

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.390 
mentors are normally your better behaved
children<00:03:31.700> so<00:03:32.450> sometimes<00:03:32.989> you<00:03:33.920> need<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:34.250> have

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
children so sometimes you need to have

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.520 
children so sometimes you need to have
the<00:03:34.549> groups<00:03:34.819> on<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.359> floor<00:03:35.630> away<00:03:35.989> at<00:03:36.350> their

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
the groups on the floor away at their

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.650 
the groups on the floor away at their
desks<00:03:37.010> they<00:03:37.549> can<00:03:37.730> be<00:03:37.880> anywhere<00:03:38.450> in<00:03:38.510> a

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
desks they can be anywhere in a

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.720
