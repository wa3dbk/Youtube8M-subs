00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.809
 today I would like to return to the topic 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:15.110
 upgrades brushes and talk about such 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.910
 here are small flutes which are very 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.669
 widely applied in painting 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.619
 for the so-called feathering for 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:26.559
 smoothing out contours for smoothing 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:28.730
 borders between masks for removing sharpness 

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:29.719
 commercially available feathering 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.100
 synthetic 

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:36.320
 brush shading they are very soft and name 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.280
 why it is not convenient to work fresh 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.400
 paints unlike bristles from new 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.440
 bristle brush which is great 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.120
 for this kind of tasks including for 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.110
 drawing some hair type details and 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.500
 so on and so forth grass mist for 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.899
 painting 2 sessions are well suited such 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.180
 Fritz school brushes meet 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.059
 rarely marketed unlike 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.240
 attacks the course of building parts in 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.609
 particular firms from cairo such brushes 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:15.170
 penny 

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:17.960
 at the cost of 15 rubles in my opinion up to 20 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.619
 good bristle there is quite hardy 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.869
 but the disadvantage of this brush is this one 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.310
 glued in wooden sticks 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.109
 It is intended to brush 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.420
 took away more liquid paint 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:34.479
 and we will not need him to interfere with that is 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.759
 we do not need extra paint in the brush and 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.069
 to fix this situation somewhat 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:43.329
 we take the hammer go to the stairs 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:46.909
 cage and flatten 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.799
 break this piece of wood here we beat 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.649
 on the tip 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.539
 Chuck metal wood once 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:58.459
 flattened sometimes by the way it flies 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:00.679
 pops up from even better yes let me remind you that 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.829
 the brush should be exactly the bristle because 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:06.159
 what is the sale of synthetic brush 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.289
 there is 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.390
 blend mixture of bristles plus synthetics 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.420
 ethics such brushes are no good need to take 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.319
 Only the stubble, and it is desirable to himself 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.750
 the bristle pile itself was even 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.959
 such cysts meet brushes repeat 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.840
 very hardy and unpretentious and 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.640
 and the main advantage is that they are nothing 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.970
 not worth it and you can not use 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.750
 just as a consumable item here 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.230
 ball on the ball flattened to 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:47.060
 some limit brush diverge so 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:50.569
 like a fan you get such a feather from 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.000
 20 room it is well suited for 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:58.030
 small to medium sized 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 work and already 25 number for such large 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:06.260
 to work on large formats here 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.380
 more stubble it is more soaking up 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.730
 absorbent 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.600
 This is the shape of the liner. 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.420
 how much flattened 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.600
 before repeat sometimes pops up 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.049
 a piece of wood which is very good but if 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.650
 it remains that it becomes such 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.870
 about two millimeters thick to 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.579
 undesirable overdoing no no 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.950
 you need to hammer very hard otherwise 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.769
 can take off the bristles 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.069
 break bristle so here we have turned 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:44.359
 such semi-finished products can work and them 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.810
 but they have short handles by the way here we see 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.639
 and 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.250
 their bristles are longer than normal 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.290
 school flutes which is better it more 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.730
 soft 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:57.980
 This is how a pen can be easily replaced. 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:02.180
 it is easily removed at least 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.910
 this company she is not glued planted on 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.280
 small studs here and so disappears under 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.549
 knife sleeve 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.060
 and with the same knife these are taken out 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:17.040
 short carnations 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:19.620
 they get very easy pen 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.550
 it is desirable to change and because 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:26.840
 long handles get more radius 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:30.690
 action arm movement 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.510
 which is better which is much more convenient 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.860
 the work of the brush we have no nothing 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:40.380
 attached besides nails to bristles 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.690
 there it is planted tightly enough 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.950
 filled with silicone such brushes 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.050
 not very well behaved 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.100
 climb and climb only the first time in 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.190
 first couple hours of work here is a little bit 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:05:01.410
 round the sleeve can be a hammer can 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:03.090
 with pliers and stick in ca 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.760
 any pen suitable 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.639
 more or less from the old brush here I have 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.639
 already such here I already show cysts 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.860
 which are planted on such a pen here 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:21.110
 exactly the same 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:23.310
 20 brush number here is more than 25 Fritz 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.229
 here's how you see a very handy tool 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:30.330
 obtained which does not cost anything for 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.750
 damage as the abrasion of the brush moths can 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.940
 start up for such rough work 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:44.010
 some for pro masonry but for now 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:45.900
 this is a great great shading soft 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.450
 o need to choose bristles of course 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.750
 look if good bristle can 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.780
 dial such hands and use 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.030
 So 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.030
 Well on this all subscribe good luck
