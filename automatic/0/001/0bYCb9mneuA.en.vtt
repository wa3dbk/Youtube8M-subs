00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.870
 with friends from youtube or three I do not know that 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:06.970
 in the world of video games and today I'm going 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.210
 to make a video to show them how 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.990
 make your own skin for nintendo 3ds 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.990
 so let's start 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.150
 and good before starting first which is 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.800
 a skin that I have diverted you there with that 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.480
 ask what are skins 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.000
 many others have not but good 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.080
 I show this is a skin that you see here 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.160
 these here are all skins 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.220
 normally you find this in 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.160
 any store where they sell 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.710
 obviously a 3ds do not generate 3d it 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.570
 find in any store but what 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.360
 happens if you want to make your own ski 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.420
 is not a personalized one and only you 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.640
 let's say you have super ideas of your 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.650
 head and you would like to have a corner 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.110
 well but you do not find it that way 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.780
 as you would have a shop for 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.060
 easy here to see how they can do 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.710
 their own has no problems 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.390
 Well the first thing we are is the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.710
 photoshop and these two forms that the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.340
 I will leave in the description for 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.710
 download good as I said before one 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.290
 you can make your own corner that 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.630
 avoiding it and all that is super editable 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.149
 this just create a layer put it under 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.670
 of this image and that 's it 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.869
 basically it's already done and they can edit it 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.659
 that they want they can put in what 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.110
 want from look from a simple 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.540
 image how are we going to do the test here 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.040
 from a picture seat they can place 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.300
 there 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:50.670
 until you create your own design 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.670
 make this your own designs 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.930
 it's pretty good you can use 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.620
 simply an image in the image that 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.590
 more like they place it and it's already 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.520
 now this image here is the 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.290
 basically where are the cameras the 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.270
 part of above since it is the later 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.450
 here we could put simply I do not know 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.580
 if it is in this case they simply place 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.490
 this lead fund do not have to place 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.070
 nothing else and so basically it 's towards 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.200
 an easy and simple corner like them 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.540
 I say from a simple image place a 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.210
 simple picture as well as just like me 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.110
 I did 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.970
 You can even create your own bone design 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.490
 anyone can create their own design 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.160
 using pokÃ©mons or the game that 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.660
 love of you as you want 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.250
 as you want as I say 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.040
 can use from a simple 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.980
 image 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.730
 until what can come out of your 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.849
 imagination is what I tell them good me 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.489
 once you have the design made of my 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.090
 own skin then let's move on to the 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.090
 Next steps 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.020
 patagones 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.630
 good what we do now once 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:39.560
 we already have our images is to print 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.680
 and where we should print then there 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:46.160
 is the case what we can do would be 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.380
 easier to print this on paper 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.470
 sticker that you can find it in 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:55.850
 any library and if your printer does not 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:59.330
 admit this paper or you do not have do not use 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.460
 that what you can go to do is go to 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.670
 some printing and that you print it not 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:08.210
 It's going to cost a lot and also follows a 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:11.240
 premium 130 you will have more quality and 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.520
 clarity that's clear you carry 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.210
 your files can 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.280
 psd editable from photoshop but now 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.490
 they say that I felt bad to download in 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.110
 a sticker paper and that's it 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.389
 well I hope you liked this 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.360
 video make a video of how to do this 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.969
 the same thing between xl is exactly what 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.179
 same 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:35.469
 and then I'm going to make a video of how 

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:37.360
 paste how we're going to do to paste and 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:41.459
 all that and how it will end at the end 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.459
 so good I say goodbye
