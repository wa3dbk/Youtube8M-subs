00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
how it all began there was something

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.089

about

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
about

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.050 
about
the<00:03:35.430> car<00:03:35.670> owners<00:03:36.569> which<00:03:37.379> are<00:03:37.890> maybe<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.819> little

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
the car owners which are maybe a little

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.600 
the car owners which are maybe a little
skin<00:03:39.689> and<00:03:39.959> there

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610

the<00:03:40.700> quality<00:03:41.480> problem<00:03:41.900> with<00:03:42.110> some<00:03:42.350> beers<00:03:42.680> and

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
the quality problem with some beers and

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.990 
the quality problem with some beers and
I<00:03:43.670> think<00:03:43.910> it's<00:03:44.030> something<00:03:44.450> historic<00:03:44.990> a<00:03:45.080> team

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.660 

part<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.240> the<00:03:48.390> pass<00:03:48.600> because<00:03:48.870> now<00:03:49.470> maybe<00:03:49.920> maybe

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
part of the pass because now maybe maybe

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.070 
part of the pass because now maybe maybe
it's<00:03:50.940> connecting<00:03:51.360> with<00:03:51.510> that<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.870> bill

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
it's connecting with that that bill

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.440 
it's connecting with that that bill
gives<00:03:52.380> our<00:03:53.450> more<00:03:54.450> international

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
gives our more international

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.660 
gives our more international
people<00:03:57.260> yeah<00:03:57.470> I'd<00:03:57.920> say<00:03:58.129> that<00:03:58.160> I'd<00:03:58.489> say<00:03:58.610> the

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
people yeah I'd say that I'd say the

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.790 
people yeah I'd say that I'd say the
people<00:03:58.910> are<00:03:59.180> always<00:03:59.330> looking<00:03:59.810> for<00:03:59.840> the<00:04:00.470> next

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
people are always looking for the next

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.339 
people are always looking for the next
hit<00:04:00.980> they<00:04:01.580> are<00:04:01.640> not

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
hit they are not

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.349 
hit they are not
most<00:04:03.769> of<00:04:03.980> them<00:04:04.159> repeating<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:04.879> same<00:04:05.090> beer

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
most of them repeating the same beer

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.679 
most of them repeating the same beer
twice<00:04:05.810> so<00:04:06.909> you're<00:04:07.909> always<00:04:08.120> looking<00:04:08.659> for

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:08.689 
twice so you're always looking for

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:12.520 
twice so you're always looking for
something<00:04:08.870> else<00:04:09.379> and<00:04:09.790> our<00:04:10.810> local<00:04:11.810> Brewers<00:04:12.079> are

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
something else and our local Brewers are

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.830 
something else and our local Brewers are
at<00:04:13.159> their<00:04:13.370> public

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
at their public

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.090 
at their public
and<00:04:16.350> model

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
and model

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.689 
and model
I<00:04:18.160> think<00:04:18.910> it<00:04:19.000> is

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.870 

easier<00:04:22.699> and<00:04:22.910> faster<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.540> sell<00:04:24.130> yes<00:04:25.130> I<00:04:25.310> think<00:04:25.370> I

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
easier and faster to sell yes I think I

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.860 
easier and faster to sell yes I think I
think

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
think

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.500 
think
and<00:04:27.260> there's<00:04:27.470> also<00:04:27.680> that
