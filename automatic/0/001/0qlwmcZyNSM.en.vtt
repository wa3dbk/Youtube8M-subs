00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.740
 hi very good youtube 73 and today 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.110
 they found videos of communities 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.269
 also how to learn a good unit that 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.190
 Let's start this map, I'm going to 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.889
 leave in the video review so that 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.240
 download it and learn william 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:22.270
 I hope it happens for you so that 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:25.490
 can do this they also have to 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.230
 learn the technique to join time or 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.820
 neighbors are going to happen this 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.230
 to jump the first they will reach the 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.940
 second and they will not get to the third 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.650
 because these kitchens are programmed 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.070
 so that when one falls on top they go down 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:43.540
 and lose I do not understand or it has to be 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.670
 fast and fast, well you have 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.650
 what to do is this the following are going to go 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.790
 running with the w are also going to go 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.250
 Running was shown walking like this 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.739
 they understand they are running with the double 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.540
 when they reach the edge 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:00.190
 They are on the verge go to assault with 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.820
 spacebar with the scroll of the 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.640
 mouse or jumping up with the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.110
 ball up and they will press the app 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.390
 it's fine or they're going to go next 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.450
 otherwise they will go to the opposite side go 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.640
 to lose it and to pass in the air you 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.050
 they're going to have to do is drop the wy 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.300
 drop it because look what happens if 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.010
 tight the w and the to be to that 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.870
 place 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.410
 they have me 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:31.000
 it's like as wine does not go to the place 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.380
 they saw the turns and it's like as 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.460
 that still depends on the arch because 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.370
 I learn the w 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:41.850
 then for this to happen 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.850
 you have to press the a and loosen the w 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.250
 good 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:53.580
 then it is a synchronized movement w 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.610
 he jumped when he jumped spinning 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.320
 mouse absolved at the w turn the mouse 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.880
 to the left is the place where I go 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.380
 to jump and squeeze the is well look 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.180
 this has to achieve this movement 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.800
 to follow the other box the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.600
 movement is Sunday is exactly 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.640
 the same movement look at let me 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.980
 like the other side so they can 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.549
 to understand it is exactly my movement 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.140
 now let's go the inverse of that 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:23.230
 let's tighten the let's tighten the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.930
 this time we will go with w running alone 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.939
 we press jump loose the w 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.560
 we move the mouse to the side where 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.569
 let's jump or in this case to the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:37.430
 right and that 's fine look 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:39.480
 it's good now what happens when 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.560
 we want to do this 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:47.959
 to continue to keep looking long 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.959
 that what you have to do is 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.940
 do the same principle so that 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.170
 there for here is the one for here is the 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.070
 so that is the way of that and so 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.220
 successively 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.310
 so look when you wake up 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.640
 you will go the mouse to the side here 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.510
 come and let it go double in the air 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.550
 remember thank you and go over what 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.940
 you have to do is when you get there 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.819
 well jump like that they saw jump again 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.220
 jump well but at the time 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.980
 we jump there you have to turn the mouse 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.290
 to the right in this case because the 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.250
 step is there and press it on me 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.470
 they understand as if it were the same 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.819
 principle that I explained to you so that way 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:35.030
 everyone captures taca taca taca taca if I 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.819
 understand to continue after this 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.890
 after this one 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.420
 in this way of a and that nothing else 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.650
 simple they have others that are more 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.709
 complicated like this 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.170
 It's hard for me to get there but with a little 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:55.920
 of perseverance 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:58.220
 it can also be reached later that 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.160
 they are more difficult 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:05.350
 I'm going to 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:09.390
 I will show well how 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:13.810
 as it is said in other potatoes as a unit 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:18.489
 good if you liked the video 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:23.169
 and subscribe I know it hurts a lot that the 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.950
 channel is new good I say goodbye because 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.610
 due to the finished 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.610
 good
