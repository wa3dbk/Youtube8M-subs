00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:09.500
 moin moin we were hardworking and have 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.420
 here still a greenhouse grown 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.700
 the plant that is so constructed more 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.850
 or less like what I im with 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.760
 garden has 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.180
 but we have a pitched roof here 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.180
 made 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:35.379
 and we have the sun blind here 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:42.300
 Now we see others have ventilation 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:46.030
 The wind is made in style 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.780
 be over a ventilated ps the wind 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.260
 can constantly pull over it and the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.960
 heat and remove the moisture 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:04.809
 it then always falls from the outside 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:12.990
 otherwise it is structured like mine 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:12.990
 Greenhouse in the corners we have 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.250
 a total of about 80 concrete hall fetched 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:32.310
 and outside around 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.979
 here, too, the path plates on which the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:41.050
 plates are anchored 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:43.710
 here on this band travel for 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.710
 have concreted in 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:59.020
 this 4 is a bit smaller but us 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:02:02.050
 have outside a height of two meters 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.080
 10 taken though I am now in 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.850
 say retrospect would be limited 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.090
 exactly two meters 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:14.310
 because this foil you can buy the 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:22.209
 thickness of the film to have exactly is for 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:23.770
 two meters because here we are 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.040
 made that we attach ribbons here 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.040
 can 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:37.260
 reveal a figure for example it 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:43.010
 to fix works great here like 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:45.390
 You can also see the ventilation works 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.930
 Tomatoes are not brown foul 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:53.570
 So this works with the dissipation of 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:57.050
 Moisture so beautiful we can open the door 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.050
 decorate the outside ski 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.620
 wonderful 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.659
 already looked at small 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.069
 is doing quite well 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:33.769
 zoom i ran ran ventilated 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:42.769
 you can see that 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:47.549
 so much fun when neighbors 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:50.099
 must be one by one until next time 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:55.440
 did produce reasonable test 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:04:01.500
 I have one with my foil house 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:09.230
 window is installed here 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:16.250
 can open flaps close 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:16.250
 and here I see the story 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:36.040
 that works well 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:39.500
 closed very well here 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.470
 on top of that has just seen now 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:53.650
 I stopped , I have two plates 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:53.650
 open cleft or all three heard 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.400
 quite well 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.310
 By now I do not have these the 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:12.040
 Wet on the foil our software 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.040
 greenhouses
