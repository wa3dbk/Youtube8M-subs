style as what they're what they call
that<00:00:19.320> that's<00:00:20.010> because<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.460> has<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.730> rotating

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
that that's because it has this rotating

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.720 
that that's because it has this rotating

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
air tanks when you're diving so that you

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.900 
air tanks when you're diving so that you
don't<00:00:28.529> run<00:00:28.740> out<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.890> air<00:00:29.070> while<00:00:29.310> you're<00:00:29.460> down

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
below the water I live in Minnesota so I

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.100 
below the water I live in Minnesota so I
don't<00:00:32.430> really<00:00:32.520> have<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.790> lot<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.059> diving<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.930> do

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
don't really have a lot of diving to do

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.830 
don't really have a lot of diving to do
but<00:00:34.530> whatever<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.910> does<00:00:36.120> not<00:00:36.239> come<00:00:36.480> like<00:00:36.600> this

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
but whatever it does not come like this

but whatever it does not come like this
however<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.200> should<00:00:37.260> should<00:00:37.860> name<00:00:38.070> right<00:00:38.280> away

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
however I should should name right away

it comes with a black plastic strap that

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.510 
it comes with a black plastic strap that
I've<00:00:42.540> thrown<00:00:42.840> away<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.500> don't<00:00:43.710> even<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.309> thought

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
I've thrown away I don't even I thought

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.860 
I've thrown away I don't even I thought
I<00:00:44.579> had<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.000> hand<00:00:45.239> somewhere<00:00:45.600> but<00:00:45.780> I've

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
I had it on hand somewhere but I've

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.040 
I had it on hand somewhere but I've
looked<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.320> can't<00:00:46.590> find<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.719> what<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.750> did<00:00:48.870> is

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
looked I can't find it so what I did is

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.690 
looked I can't find it so what I did is
I<00:00:49.140> replaced<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.980> strap<00:00:50.399> from

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
I replaced it with this strap from

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.240 
I replaced it with this strap from
clockworks<00:00:51.570> energy.com<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.649> believe<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.129> is

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
clockworks energy.com I believe it is

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.380

I'll put a link below if you're

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.810 
I'll put a link below if you're
interested<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:56.010> color<00:00:56.250> they<00:00:56.550> called

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
interested but this color they called

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.799 
interested but this color they called
James<00:00:57.180> Bond

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
James Bond

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.869 
James Bond
I<00:00:57.899> guess<00:00:58.649> Sean<00:00:58.859> Connery<00:00:59.309> wore<00:00:59.579> something

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
I guess Sean Connery wore something

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.709 
I guess Sean Connery wore something
similar<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.510> one<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.780> Bond<00:01:00.930> movies<00:01:01.370> but

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
similar in one of the Bond movies but

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.270 
similar in one of the Bond movies but
not<00:01:03.719> one<00:01:03.949> misconception<00:01:04.949> or<00:01:05.070> one

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
not one misconception or one

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.090 
not one misconception or one
mislabelling<00:01:06.270> really<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.409> Amazon<00:01:07.619> and

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
mislabelling really is on Amazon and

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.469 
mislabelling really is on Amazon and
some<00:01:08.250> other<00:01:08.369> places<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.939> think<00:01:08.970> they<00:01:09.240> still

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
some other places I think they still

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.539 
some other places I think they still
have<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.020> if<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.200> take<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:11.189> label

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
have this but if you take the label

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.630 
have this but if you take the label
that's<00:01:11.670> 20<00:01:12.150> mil<00:01:12.619> 20<00:01:13.619> millimeters<00:01:14.040> wide<00:01:14.220> band

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
that's 20 mil 20 millimeters wide band

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.700 
that's 20 mil 20 millimeters wide band
well<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.150> not<00:01:15.570> if<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.990> measure<00:01:16.200> between<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
well it's not if you measure between the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.649 
well it's not if you measure between the
lugs<00:01:20.450> it's<00:01:21.450> quite<00:01:21.780> clearly<00:01:22.110> 22<00:01:23.119> so<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.150> don't

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
lugs it's quite clearly 22 so I don't

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.050 
lugs it's quite clearly 22 so I don't
know<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.290> don't<00:01:26.159> know<00:01:26.280> if<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.490> still<00:01:26.640> labeled

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
know I don't know if it's still labeled

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.929 
know I don't know if it's still labeled
like<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.479> last<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.869> checked<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.200> was<00:01:28.939> they

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
like that last I checked it was they

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.219 
like that last I checked it was they
really<00:01:30.210> should<00:01:30.420> look<00:01:30.600> over<00:01:30.840> their<00:01:30.990> product

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
really should look over their product

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.270 
really should look over their product
line<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.710> actually<00:01:31.770> know<00:01:32.040> what<00:01:32.130> they're

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
line and actually know what they're

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.280 
line and actually know what they're
selling<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.970> guess<00:01:33.150> they<00:01:33.329> don't<00:01:33.720> care<00:01:34.079> or

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
selling but I guess they don't care or

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.390 
selling but I guess they don't care or
whatever<00:01:34.799> but<00:01:35.040> anyway<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.369> other

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
whatever but anyway the other

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.819 
whatever but anyway the other
measurements<00:01:36.060> it's<00:01:36.240> some<00:01:36.509> 12.1<00:01:37.350> millimeters

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
measurements it's some 12.1 millimeters

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.520 
measurements it's some 12.1 millimeters
thick<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:38.850> 92<00:01:39.450> grams<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.170> bit<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
thick it's 92 grams it's a bit on the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.380 
thick it's 92 grams it's a bit on the
weighty<00:01:40.740> side<00:01:41.070> but<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.430> solid<00:01:41.670> stainless<00:01:42.090> so

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
weighty side but it's solid stainless so

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.539 
weighty side but it's solid stainless so
it's<00:01:42.479> not<00:01:42.659> surprising<00:01:42.860> or<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:46.340> yeah<00:01:47.340> it

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
it's not surprising or is it yeah it

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.100 
it's not surprising or is it yeah it
looks<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.240> polished<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.840> side

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
looks like it is polished on the side

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.450 
looks like it is polished on the side
but<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.409> still<00:01:49.590> looks<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:49.920> stainless<00:01:50.340> it

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
but it still looks like stainless it

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.649 
but it still looks like stainless it
certainly<00:01:50.729> feels<00:01:51.030> heavy<00:01:51.240> enough<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.479> be

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
certainly feels heavy enough to be

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.740 
certainly feels heavy enough to be
stainless<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:53.100> says<00:01:53.399> 48<00:01:54.000> point<00:01:54.479> five

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750

really<00:02:01.350> true<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.740> mean<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.399> dial<00:02:02.850> might

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
really true I mean that the dial might

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.060 
really true I mean that the dial might
be<00:02:03.210> 44<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.049> whole<00:02:04.200> thing<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.469> closer<00:02:04.920> to

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
be 44 but the whole thing is closer to

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.920 
be 44 but the whole thing is closer to
47<00:02:05.939> looks<00:02:06.869> like<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.140> just<00:02:07.170> smudge<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
47 looks like I just smudge the

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.000 
47 looks like I just smudge the
a<00:02:07.990> dial<00:02:08.530> there<00:02:08.830> but<00:02:09.039> that's<00:02:09.220> okay<00:02:10.740> this<00:02:11.740> one's

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
a dial there but that's okay this one's

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.620 
a dial there but that's okay this one's
even<00:02:12.190> older<00:02:12.520> than<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.760> last<00:02:12.790> watch<00:02:13.240> I<00:02:13.390> showed

it<00:03:52.480> from<00:03:52.660> for<00:03:52.959> this<00:03:53.049> design<00:03:53.440> but<00:03:53.620> it's<00:03:53.769> I<00:03:54.040> think

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
it from for this design but it's I think

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.240 
it from for this design but it's I think
it's<00:03:54.400> quite<00:03:54.519> obvious<00:03:55.260> but<00:03:56.260> either<00:03:56.769> way<00:03:56.980> it's

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
it's quite obvious but either way it's

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.699 
it's quite obvious but either way it's
it's<00:03:57.579> a<00:03:57.670> nice<00:03:57.820> watch<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.510> I<00:03:59.049> have<00:03:59.380> to<00:03:59.500> say<00:03:59.680> I
