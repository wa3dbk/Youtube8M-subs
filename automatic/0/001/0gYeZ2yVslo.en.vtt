and clip your fish what you wanted to do

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.670 
and clip your fish what you wanted to do
is<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.270> caramelize<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:53.050> want<00:02:53.200> those<00:02:53.349> spices

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
is to caramelize you want those spices

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.530 
is to caramelize you want those spices
to<00:02:53.920> caramelize<00:02:54.400> it's<00:02:54.730> definitely<00:02:55.150> not<00:02:55.270> burn

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
to caramelize it's definitely not burn

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.640 
to caramelize it's definitely not burn
if<00:02:55.690> they<00:02:55.810> burn<00:02:56.020> they're<00:02:56.230> going<00:02:56.349> to<00:02:56.440> become

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
if they burn they're going to become

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.320 
if they burn they're going to become
bitter<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.610> course<00:02:57.880> lose<00:02:58.150> their

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
bitter and of course lose their

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.780 
bitter and of course lose their
nutritional<00:02:58.810> value<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:59.709> I<00:02:59.739> would<00:02:59.890> say<00:03:00.099> cook<00:03:00.670> it

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
nutritional value so I would say cook it

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.850 
nutritional value so I would say cook it
for<00:03:00.910> about<00:03:01.030> two<00:03:01.420> minutes<00:03:01.720> over<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:02.140> moderate

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860

for about two minutes over a moderate
heat<00:03:03.010> on<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.250> first<00:03:03.520> side<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:04.090> flip<00:03:04.600> it<00:03:04.630> once

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
heat on the first side and flip it once

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.140 
heat on the first side and flip it once
more<00:03:05.200> if<00:03:05.860> you've<00:03:06.040> got<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.190> piece<00:03:06.400> like<00:03:06.670> this<00:03:06.730> one

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
more if you've got a piece like this one

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.490 
more if you've got a piece like this one
that's<00:03:07.330> actually<00:03:07.660> square<00:03:08.020> in<00:03:08.200> cross-section

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
that's actually square in cross-section

carbohydrates<00:03:32.950> fat<00:03:33.220> or<00:03:33.370> protein<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:34.480> they're

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
carbohydrates fat or protein so they're

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.420 
carbohydrates fat or protein so they're
going<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:34.930> reduce<00:03:35.049> the<00:03:35.380> energy<00:03:35.560> density<00:03:35.980> of

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
going to reduce the energy density of

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.630 
going to reduce the energy density of
this<00:03:37.030> yogurt<00:03:37.510> reducing<00:03:38.350> energy<00:03:38.799> density<00:03:39.280> in

this yogurt reducing energy density in

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.130 
this yogurt reducing energy density in
our<00:03:39.910> foods<00:03:40.180> is<00:03:40.330> really<00:03:40.660> important<00:03:41.080> because

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
our foods is really important because

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.440 
our foods is really important because
basically<00:03:41.830> we're<00:03:42.670> overfed<00:03:43.269> and

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
basically we're overfed and

basically we're overfed and
undernourished<00:03:43.900> so<00:03:44.680> I'm<00:03:44.769> addressing<00:03:45.160> that

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
undernourished so I'm addressing that

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.120 
undernourished so I'm addressing that
calorie<00:03:45.880> imbalance<00:03:46.480> right<00:03:46.690> here<00:03:47.380> with<00:03:47.980> these
