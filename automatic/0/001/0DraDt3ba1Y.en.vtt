00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.280
 Here we present a structure of 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.140
 a lan would be a laptop that would be the 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.750
 that we are going to raise this one that is here 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.460
 right then this right 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.960
 this one that we see is the laptop that 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.170
 we are going to lift we have already put a 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.400
 ip address and we have picked your brand 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.849
 we would therefore have connected that 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.019
 portable by a network cable to a router 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.349
 which is what we have here in the middle 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:34.349
 in blue 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.410
 this router would be the one we have here 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.480
 effectively and now we take and we had 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.260
 than having another cable also connected 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.360
 He cited the laptop that way 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.559
 this other computer would make a network of 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.180
 local area between the two teams 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.199
 we also know that we have a network 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.770
 wireless, we have a wifi there 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.770
 activated 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.740
 and we could use also he has a 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.270
 dhcp server that gives me ip addresses and 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.360
 could also use the phone 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.479
 mobile here we have it as connecting the 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.910
 mobile wifi would give me the ip address 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.280
 of the router through its wireless and 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.660
 your dhcp server and it could be in the 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.660
 same local area network 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.100
 from here I could start the equipment 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.970
 with a program that there is for you to send 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.970
 the magic package 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.590
 it would reach the computer and lift it 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.470
 again to other devices that I can 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.690
 use would be my tablet here I have a 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.100
 tablet which through a program 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.530
 I could send you also have to remember 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.119
 that has to have activated the wifi and 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.430
 must belong to the same area network 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.450
 local with which would take the address 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.270
 ip of the dhcp server that would have the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.090
 router activated 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.170
 well I would send the package through the 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.860
 When the wool would pass the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.380
 the wifi network would pass it to the wiring of the 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.380
 portable router and it would arrive 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.420
 directly to the laptop to turn it on 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.819
 let's see for example how we could do 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.749
 this 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.889
 with our android device that is 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:28.560
 this tablet 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:31.200
 we started a program a program 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.209
 wake on lan that what he will do is send 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.370
 the magic package there we have the 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.349
 ip address of the laptop and its mac 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.290
 through the wifi will come that 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.030
 information to the router the router the 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.550
 will send by the cable and activate the 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.620
 switched on 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.910
 well we press therefore 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.520
 to turn on 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.940
 in sending there they put you wake 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.610
 we pass we give him touch in wave 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.150
 click on it 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.490
 and let's look at how the pulsar goes 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.870
 turn on and the package arrived and 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.640
 now the laptop will start to light up 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.950
 on the right which is the one that really 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.950
 we have to enable there what we have 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.230
 see how simple once we have 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.940
 everything configured or remotely I'm 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.709
 connecting and igniting through me 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:30.160
 tablet the devices this one will send a pin 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.599
 or a series of pin in such a way that they are 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.280
 connections that I will have to 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.360
 answer the team that is being 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.190
 turning on once it is 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.990
 is properly configured 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.660
 or connected 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.360
 is going to answer this is going to receive the 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.860
 signal and it will appear as in green 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.820
 as he has received and that there is connection 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.820
 with the remote equipment 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.210
 there we have it now with its windows 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.790
 working 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:06.209
 we have raised the equipment remotely 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.579
 ok let's go on then how to power 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.230
 activate remotely through our 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:14.150
 phone or smartphone in this case 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.150
 we will use then or an iphone
