difficult to read coverages but at least
against<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:58.850> computer<00:01:59.030> you<00:01:59.450> should<00:01:59.480> be<00:01:59.690> able

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
against the computer you should be able

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.060 
against the computer you should be able
to<00:01:59.870> tell<00:02:00.050> if<00:02:00.080> its<00:02:00.290> owner<00:02:00.470> man<00:02:00.680> coverage

coming out the diamond will cover three

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.840 
coming out the diamond will cover three
let's<00:02:06.710> go<00:02:06.830> ahead<00:02:06.980> and<00:02:07.100> focus<00:02:07.280> on<00:02:07.520> those<00:02:07.640> two

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
let's go ahead and focus on those two

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.729 
let's go ahead and focus on those two
corners<00:02:08.239> on<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.479> outside<00:02:08.899> now<00:02:09.170> look<00:02:09.410> out<00:02:09.590> or

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
corners on the outside now look out or

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.229 
corners on the outside now look out or
lined<00:02:09.950> up<00:02:10.099> this<00:02:10.280> time<00:02:10.519> you<00:02:10.789> look<00:02:11.000> you'll

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
lined up this time you look you'll

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.610 
lined up this time you look you'll
notice<00:02:11.540> that<00:02:11.569> this<00:02:11.810> corner<00:02:12.200> again<00:02:12.379> this<00:02:12.499> is

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
notice that this corner again this is

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.589 
notice that this corner again this is
the<00:02:12.650> left<00:02:12.890> cornerback<00:02:13.219> and<00:02:13.609> this<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:14.510> the

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
the left cornerback and this is the

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.209 
the left cornerback and this is the
right<00:02:14.780> cornerback<00:02:15.109> what<00:02:15.620> they're<00:02:15.799> doing<00:02:16.099> is

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:16.219 
right cornerback what they're doing is

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:17.470 
right cornerback what they're doing is
they're<00:02:16.249> actually<00:02:16.730> turned<00:02:16.999> in

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
they're actually turned in

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.059 
they're actually turned in
and<00:02:17.569> they're<00:02:18.019> actually<00:02:18.140> looking<00:02:18.500> towards<00:02:18.980> the

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
and they're actually looking towards the

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.339 
and they're actually looking towards the
quarterback<00:02:19.580> into<00:02:19.819> this<00:02:19.970> direction<00:02:20.300> here<00:02:20.420> and

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
quarterback into this direction here and

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.780 
quarterback into this direction here and
if<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.530> see<00:02:21.769> that<00:02:21.980> then<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.370> means<00:02:22.519> that

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
if you see that then that means that

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.479 
if you see that then that means that
zone<00:02:23.060> coverage<00:02:23.510> so<00:02:23.840> if<00:02:24.440> you're<00:02:24.890> looking<00:02:25.040> at<00:02:25.370> it

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
zone coverage so if you're looking at it

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.680 
zone coverage so if you're looking at it
and<00:02:25.549> you<00:02:25.610> notice<00:02:25.940> that<00:02:26.090> they're<00:02:26.209> doing<00:02:26.330> that

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
and you notice that they're doing that

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.300 
and you notice that they're doing that
then<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.409> can<00:02:27.440> pretty<00:02:27.650> much<00:02:27.739> tell<00:02:28.069> if<00:02:28.190> it's

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
then you can pretty much tell if it's

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.680 
then you can pretty much tell if it's
manner<00:02:28.519> zone<00:02:28.760> coverage<00:02:29.090> at<00:02:29.209> least<00:02:29.360> against

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
manner zone coverage at least against

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.940 
manner zone coverage at least against
the<00:02:29.750> computer<00:02:29.930> now<00:02:30.349> there's<00:02:30.560> some<00:02:30.650> things

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
the computer now there's some things

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.289 
the computer now there's some things
that<00:02:31.159> your<00:02:31.430> opponent<00:02:31.610> may<00:02:31.879> do<00:02:31.940> whenever

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
that your opponent may do whenever

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.750 
that your opponent may do whenever
you're<00:02:32.540> playing<00:02:32.810> them<00:02:33.019> if<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:34.069> translates

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
you're playing them if this translates

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.360 
you're playing them if this translates
into<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.269> NCAA<00:02:35.959> full<00:02:36.769> edition<00:02:37.129> of<00:02:37.190> a<00:02:37.220> game

let's go and look at that and we'll go

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.949 
let's go and look at that and we'll go
ahead<00:02:41.269> and<00:02:41.360> get<00:02:41.480> out<00:02:41.599> of<00:02:41.660> this<00:02:41.720> video

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
anyways so it's not going to make a

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.330 
anyways so it's not going to make a
difference<00:02:57.290> i'm<00:02:57.650> trying<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:57.980> show<00:02:58.040> you<00:02:58.190> guys

bump-and-run<00:03:05.120> this<00:03:05.390> time<00:03:05.569> this<00:03:05.720> is<00:03:05.840> that<00:03:05.989> zone

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
bump-and-run this time this is that zone

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.920 
bump-and-run this time this is that zone
defense<00:03:06.650> but<00:03:06.859> now<00:03:06.980> notice<00:03:07.400> how<00:03:07.579> we<00:03:07.640> do<00:03:07.849> this<00:03:08.030> we

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
defense but now notice how we do this we

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.599 
defense but now notice how we do this we
call<00:03:09.109> bump<00:03:09.379> and<00:03:09.500> run<00:03:09.620> at<00:03:09.859> those<00:03:10.040> corners<00:03:10.489> on

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
call bump and run at those corners on

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.160 
call bump and run at those corners on
the<00:03:10.700> outside<00:03:11.120> they're<00:03:11.359> both<00:03:11.540> actually

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
the outside they're both actually

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.240 
the outside they're both actually
showing<00:03:12.410> that<00:03:12.680> there<00:03:12.799> look<00:03:12.920> like<00:03:13.040> they're<00:03:13.190> in

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
showing that there look like they're in

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.430 
showing that there look like they're in
man<00:03:13.400> coverage<00:03:13.609> so<00:03:14.000> that<00:03:14.810> would<00:03:15.019> be<00:03:15.170> something

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
man coverage so that would be something

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.160 
man coverage so that would be something
that<00:03:15.680> if<00:03:16.220> your<00:03:16.549> opponent<00:03:16.760> was<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.359> do<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.870> come

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
that if your opponent was to do and come

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.420 
that if your opponent was to do and come
out<00:03:18.379> here<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:18.680> they<00:03:18.890> call<00:03:19.069> a<00:03:19.099> zone<00:03:19.400> defense

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
out here and they call a zone defense

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.610 
out here and they call a zone defense
and<00:03:19.879> they<00:03:19.940> call<00:03:20.120> bump<00:03:20.359> and<00:03:20.510> run<00:03:20.599> then<00:03:21.470> it

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
and they call bump and run then it

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.589 
and they call bump and run then it
doesn't<00:03:21.769> look<00:03:22.040> like<00:03:22.099> man<00:03:22.730> defense<00:03:23.209> or<00:03:23.540> it

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
doesn't look like man defense or it

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.940 
doesn't look like man defense or it
looks<00:03:23.750> like<00:03:23.900> man<00:03:24.079> defense<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:24.620> doesn't<00:03:24.859> look

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
looks like man defense and doesn't look

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.500 
looks like man defense and doesn't look
like<00:03:25.099> zone<00:03:25.340> defense<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:25.910> I<00:03:25.940> want<00:03:26.120> to<00:03:26.180> throw

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
like zone defense so I want to throw

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.390 
like zone defense so I want to throw
that<00:03:26.720> out<00:03:26.780> you<00:03:27.079> guys<00:03:27.200> it's<00:03:27.950> something<00:03:28.280> that

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
that out you guys it's something that

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.000 
that out you guys it's something that
you<00:03:28.430> guys<00:03:28.730> can<00:03:29.030> look<00:03:29.209> at<00:03:29.480> that<00:03:30.230> hopefully<00:03:30.799> when

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
you guys can look at that hopefully when

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.620 
you guys can look at that hopefully when
you<00:03:31.069> guys<00:03:31.220> do<00:03:31.519> get<00:03:31.700> into<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:32.030> actual<00:03:32.269> game<00:03:32.389> we

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
you guys do get into the actual game we

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.000 
you guys do get into the actual game we
actually<00:03:32.840> start<00:03:33.019> playing<00:03:33.319> it<00:03:33.560> that<00:03:33.739> you<00:03:33.859> can

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
actually start playing it that you can

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.229 
actually start playing it that you can
tell<00:03:34.190> if<00:03:34.280> it's<00:03:34.370> man<00:03:34.519> or<00:03:34.669> zone<00:03:34.700> coverage<00:03:35.150> at

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
tell if it's man or zone coverage at

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.599 
tell if it's man or zone coverage at
least<00:03:35.389> initially<00:03:35.650> now<00:03:36.650> they<00:03:36.859> call<00:03:37.040> bump<00:03:37.430> and

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
least initially now they call bump and

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.129 
least initially now they call bump and
run<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:38.030> that's<00:03:38.180> going<00:03:38.329> to<00:03:38.419> change<00:03:38.569> things<00:03:38.840> up

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
run and that's going to change things up

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.440 
run and that's going to change things up
so<00:03:39.440> again<00:03:39.709> that<00:03:39.889> was<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.130> idea<00:03:40.250> of<00:03:40.489> this<00:03:40.639> video

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
so again that was the idea of this video

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.970 
so again that was the idea of this video
