00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.169
 I'll tell you about the game aura suite 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.119
 as the game is very interesting and not to 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.039
 upset you at the end of the review will say 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.169
 immediately it is available only for 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.329
 owners of devices with the processors 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.009
 grad developers promise that in 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.539
 near future device list 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.489
 much increase 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.220
 after this game you are completely different 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.020
 look at the enemy battles because 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.630
 never has war been like that 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.180
 melodic and beautiful feature 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.760
 This game is abstract and very 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.280
 an unusual flow of the gameplay you 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.860
 control a planet that constantly 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.380
 generates new units submitted 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.450
 normal dot and hold 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.730
 these points near you in the future 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.450
 the number of units generated can be 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.300
 increase 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.730
 the goal of the game is to conquer all 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.979
 the rest of the planets attack tactics you 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.049
 coming up yourself for example you can 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.810
 pick up the whole army and send them to 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.240
 another planet or with the advent of new 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.969
 units immediately send them to attack 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.770
 for conquering the enemy planet you 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:17.609
 need to send at least twice 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.710
 more units 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:22.460
 what they have on the enemy's planet 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.960
 every time a fighter dies 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.390
 reproduced a short sound i would 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.409
 advised you to send immediately great 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.299
 number of fighters 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.429
 while they will deal with 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.609
 opponents you can listen 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.259
 pleasant melody in many levels you 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:40.439
 will play with several opponents 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.539
 and then the game teaches us to be cunning 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.939
 not to sacrifice your fighters 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.840
 Sometimes you can wait until someone with 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.659
 these opponents 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.030
 start a battle between themselves as soon as 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.579
 children, the planet will be with weak protection 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.039
 You can immediately send to a non-army 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.880
 thereby ensure insignificant for 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.259
 her loss 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.319
 control in the game is carried out 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.509
 quite simple with one touch of the screen 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.909
 select the area of ​​the units we need 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.429
 and the following indicate the place where they 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.619
 move graphics in the game done 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.349
 well only now it is not clear why 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.250
 developers instead of black not 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.650
 set as 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.270
 Anyway background space I think the picture was 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.300
 would be much more beautiful 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.130
 as for sound 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.950
 there is nothing to complain about complete relaxation and 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.440
 nice atmosphere game for real 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.560
 captivates and delays sometimes 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.750
 even so it's hard to put it down on that 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.640
 me all subscribe to our channel 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.860
