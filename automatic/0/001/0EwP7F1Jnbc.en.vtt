00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
that's all it ever did basically I think

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.590 
that's all it ever did basically I think
I<00:01:03.590> shot<00:01:03.859> about<00:01:04.100> four<00:01:04.580> videos<00:01:04.970> on<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.360> first

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.320 
I shot about four videos on the first
one<00:01:05.840> before<00:01:06.350> it<00:01:06.470> it<00:01:06.680> went<00:01:06.979> to<00:01:07.190> funk<00:01:07.430> belly<00:01:08.090> up

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
one before it it went to funk belly up

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.290 
one before it it went to funk belly up
so<00:01:09.080> I<00:01:09.140> started<00:01:09.229> using<00:01:09.649> the<00:01:09.920> second<00:01:10.310> one<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:10.729> it

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
so I started using the second one and it

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.990 
so I started using the second one and it
lasted<00:01:11.720> about<00:01:11.869> two<00:01:12.800> days<00:01:12.950> longer<00:01:13.459> and<00:01:13.640> I

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
lasted about two days longer and I

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.520 
lasted about two days longer and I
pulled<00:01:14.270> it<00:01:14.360> out<00:01:14.420> of<00:01:14.479> my<00:01:14.630> pocket<00:01:14.840> one<00:01:15.170> day<00:01:15.319> and

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
pulled it out of my pocket one day and

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.339 
pulled it out of my pocket one day and
the<00:01:15.709> orange<00:01:16.069> light<00:01:16.340> was<00:01:16.490> on<00:01:16.640> so<00:01:17.450> even<00:01:17.869> from<00:01:18.170> the

00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:18.349

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:20.020

beginning<00:01:18.740> I<00:01:18.830> kind<00:01:19.099> of<00:01:19.160> suspected<00:01:19.729> that

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
beginning I kind of suspected that

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.050 
beginning I kind of suspected that
either<00:01:20.509> there's<00:01:21.200> a<00:01:21.229> memory<00:01:21.590> issue<00:01:21.979> or<00:01:22.940> it's

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
either there's a memory issue or it's

in the world I want to see well I came

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.449 
in the world I want to see well I came
upstairs<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.810> know<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:15.230> started<00:02:16.069> kind<00:02:16.340> of

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
upstairs and you know I started kind of

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.160 
upstairs and you know I started kind of
playing<00:02:16.670> around<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.239> I<00:02:17.780> pushed<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.140> button

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
playing around and I pushed the button

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.150 
playing around and I pushed the button
on<00:02:18.890> here<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.640> turn<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.209> power<00:02:20.390> on<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:21.010> notice<00:02:22.010> it

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
on here to turn the power on I notice it

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.580 
on here to turn the power on I notice it
does<00:02:22.280> have<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:22.489> slightly<00:02:23.270> smaller<00:02:23.840> LED<00:02:24.410> which

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
does have a slightly smaller LED which

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.759 
does have a slightly smaller LED which
is<00:02:24.739> nice<00:02:24.950> it's<00:02:25.190> not<00:02:25.370> so<00:02:25.670> visual<00:02:26.590> but<00:02:27.590> the

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
is nice it's not so visual but the

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.259 
is nice it's not so visual but the
orange<00:02:28.010> light<00:02:28.250> started<00:02:28.580> flashing<00:02:28.790> at<00:02:29.060> me

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
orange light started flashing at me

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.509 
orange light started flashing at me
kept<00:02:30.050> hitting<00:02:30.319> the<00:02:30.380> buttons<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:30.950> it's<00:02:31.280> like

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
kept hitting the buttons and it's like

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.790 
kept hitting the buttons and it's like
great<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:31.940> thing<00:02:32.390> doesn't<00:02:32.720> work<00:02:32.750> either<00:02:33.080> you

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
great this thing doesn't work either you

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.259 
great this thing doesn't work either you
know<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:33.950> can<00:02:34.340> at<00:02:34.459> least<00:02:34.489> turn<00:02:34.819> the<00:02:34.940> power<00:02:35.120> on

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
know I can at least turn the power on

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.460 
know I can at least turn the power on
and<00:02:35.690> turn<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.019> power<00:02:36.140> off

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
and turn the power off

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.220 
and turn the power off
so<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:37.430> started<00:02:37.790> inspecting<00:02:38.060> more<00:02:38.540> closely<00:02:38.840> and

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
so I started inspecting more closely and

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.370 
so I started inspecting more closely and
oh<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.920> discovered<00:02:40.819> that<00:02:41.540> on<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.870> side<00:02:42.110> of<00:02:42.140> this

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
oh I discovered that on the side of this

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.180 
oh I discovered that on the side of this
unit<00:02:42.739> it<00:02:42.920> actually<00:02:43.370> has<00:02:43.580> a<00:02:44.500> micro<00:02:45.500> SD<00:02:45.920> card

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
unit it actually has a micro SD card

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.330 
unit it actually has a micro SD card
slot<00:02:47.110> which<00:02:48.110> immediately<00:02:48.799> caught<00:02:49.310> my

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
slot which immediately caught my

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.539 
slot which immediately caught my
attention<00:02:50.019> so<00:02:51.019> I<00:02:51.350> took<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.920> little<00:02:52.069> four<00:02:52.370> gig

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
attention so I took a little four gig

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.210 
attention so I took a little four gig
micro<00:02:53.360> SD<00:02:53.720> card<00:02:54.019> that<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.260> have<00:02:54.319> and<00:02:54.890> put<00:02:55.100> it

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
micro SD card that I have and put it

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.970 
micro SD card that I have and put it
into<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.519> side<00:02:55.760> of<00:02:55.910> this<00:02:56.030> unit<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:57.680> have<00:02:57.860> to

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
into the side of this unit you have to

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.400 
into the side of this unit you have to
kind<00:02:58.190> of<00:02:58.280> position<00:02:58.850> that<00:02:58.880> just<00:02:59.299> right<00:02:59.569> to<00:03:00.049> get

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
kind of position that just right to get

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.309 
kind of position that just right to get
it<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.650> spring<00:03:00.950> in<00:03:01.130> there<00:03:01.340> so<00:03:01.900> walks<00:03:02.900> into<00:03:03.170> the

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
it to spring in there so walks into the

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.160 
it to spring in there so walks into the
side<00:03:03.560> of<00:03:03.680> it<00:03:03.769> like<00:03:03.920> that<00:03:04.130> right<00:03:04.370> there<00:03:05.170> so

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
side of it like that right there so

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.500 
side of it like that right there so
apparently<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.950> distributor<00:03:07.760> has<00:03:08.030> seen<00:03:08.330> my

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
apparently a distributor has seen my

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.690 
apparently a distributor has seen my
video<00:03:08.780> bagging<00:03:09.650> this<00:03:09.769> product<00:03:10.160> on<00:03:10.340> YouTube

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
video bagging this product on YouTube

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.280 
video bagging this product on YouTube
and<00:03:10.940> has<00:03:11.060> sent<00:03:11.330> me<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.510> new<00:03:11.720> model<00:03:12.079> that

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
and has sent me a new model that

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.259 
and has sent me a new model that
actually<00:03:13.130> has<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.459> card<00:03:13.700> slot<00:03:13.940> so<00:03:13.970> this

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
actually has the card slot so this

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.080 
actually has the card slot so this
contains<00:03:14.690> no<00:03:14.930> internal<00:03:15.410> memory<00:03:15.739> you<00:03:16.370> use<00:03:16.579> a

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
contains no internal memory you use a

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.039 
contains no internal memory you use a
micro<00:03:17.690> SD<00:03:18.079> card<00:03:18.620> in<00:03:18.890> this<00:03:19.310> unit<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:19.820> it<00:03:20.750> seems

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
micro SD card in this unit and it seems

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.410 
micro SD card in this unit and it seems
to<00:03:21.170> have<00:03:21.350> solved<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:22.010> issue<00:03:22.190> of<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:23.150> unit

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
to have solved the issue of the unit

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.240 
to have solved the issue of the unit
freezing<00:03:23.870> up<00:03:24.019> and<00:03:24.260> crashing<00:03:24.769> I<00:03:24.920> think<00:03:24.950> it

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
freezing up and crashing I think it

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.000 
freezing up and crashing I think it
probably<00:03:25.760> was<00:03:26.000> a<00:03:26.030> memory<00:03:26.510> issue<00:03:26.690> before<00:03:27.049> so

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
probably was a memory issue before so

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.160 
probably was a memory issue before so
once<00:03:28.670> I<00:03:28.790> figured<00:03:29.090> that<00:03:29.269> out<00:03:29.299> put<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.720> card<00:03:29.959> in

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
once I figured that out put the card in

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.340 
once I figured that out put the card in
turn<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.769> unit<00:03:31.010> on<00:03:31.160> here<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:32.690> when<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:33.200> light

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
turn the unit on here and when the light

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.650 
turn the unit on here and when the light
comes<00:03:33.709> in<00:03:33.920> to<00:03:34.100> go<00:03:34.220> solid<00:03:34.519> you<00:03:35.239> hold<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.510> button

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
comes in to go solid you hold the button

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.270 
comes in to go solid you hold the button
down<00:03:35.810> there<00:03:36.200> for<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.530> second<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:36.980> when<00:03:37.190> it

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
down there for a second and when it

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.949 
down there for a second and when it
starts<00:03:37.549> flashing<00:03:37.819> a<00:03:38.060> few<00:03:38.239> times<00:03:38.450> now<00:03:38.600> you're

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
starts flashing a few times now you're

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.430 
starts flashing a few times now you're
recording<00:03:39.670> so<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:41.269> video<00:03:41.510> quality<00:03:41.810> on<00:03:42.170> this

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
recording so the video quality on this

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.570 
recording so the video quality on this
I'll<00:03:42.920> kind<00:03:43.160> of<00:03:43.220> point<00:03:43.519> it<00:03:43.640> around<00:03:44.120> her

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
I'll kind of point it around her

for a couple of hours now or so and kind
of<00:04:19.590> put<00:04:19.739> it<00:04:19.830> through<00:04:19.980> its<00:04:20.130> paces<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:20.670> I<00:04:20.700> have

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
of put it through its paces and I have

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.020 
of put it through its paces and I have
to<00:04:21.000> say<00:04:21.209> that<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.810> new<00:04:21.959> micro<00:04:22.920> SD<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.430> TF<00:04:23.700> slot

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.090 
to say that the new micro SD the TF slot
here<00:04:24.390> on<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.690> side<00:04:24.930> is<00:04:25.230> probably<00:04:25.830> going<00:04:26.040> to

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
here on the side is probably going to

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.890 
here on the side is probably going to
make<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.430> whole<00:04:26.730> difference<00:04:26.760> in<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.420> world

this product to try to change my mind
and<00:04:32.880> I'm<00:04:33.840> gonna<00:04:34.020> have<00:04:34.170> to<00:04:34.320> say<00:04:34.500> I<00:04:34.530> like<00:04:34.860> this

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
and I'm gonna have to say I like this

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.000 
and I'm gonna have to say I like this
product<00:04:35.490> so<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.750> old<00:04:36.930> one<00:04:37.230> with<00:04:37.530> the<00:04:37.680> built-in

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
product so the old one with the built-in

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.010 
product so the old one with the built-in
memory<00:04:38.220> it<00:04:38.520> just<00:04:38.790> had<00:04:39.000> too<00:04:39.330> many<00:04:39.450> inherent

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
memory it just had too many inherent

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.900 
memory it just had too many inherent
issues<00:04:40.440> but<00:04:40.740> I<00:04:40.770> think<00:04:40.830> had<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.400> addition<00:04:41.820> of

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
issues but I think had the addition of

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.510 
issues but I think had the addition of
the<00:04:42.030> TF<00:04:42.300> card<00:04:42.510> slot<00:04:42.900> on<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.020> side<00:04:43.140> is<00:04:43.740> proper

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
the TF card slot on the side is proper

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.410 
the TF card slot on the side is proper
this<00:04:45.510> is<00:04:45.660> gonna<00:04:45.900> boost<00:04:46.230> this<00:04:46.440> product<00:04:47.420> also

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
this is gonna boost this product also

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.630 
this is gonna boost this product also
the<00:04:48.540> prices<00:04:48.990> come<00:04:49.200> down<00:04:49.460> originally<00:04:50.460> these

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
if you take the card out it will pretty

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.900 
if you take the card out it will pretty
much<00:05:28.290> it<00:05:28.470> just<00:05:28.500> goes<00:05:28.830> directly<00:05:29.430> into<00:05:29.729> a

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
much it just goes directly into a

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.060 
much it just goes directly into a
charging<00:05:30.479> State<00:05:30.840> and<00:05:31.200> if<00:05:31.290> the<00:05:31.410> cards<00:05:31.710> in<00:05:31.919> and

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
charging State and if the cards in and

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.860 
charging State and if the cards in and
it<00:05:32.130> activates<00:05:32.610> through<00:05:32.850> the<00:05:32.940> USB<00:05:33.240> so<00:05:33.660> when<00:05:33.780> you

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
it activates through the USB so when you

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.540 
it activates through the USB so when you
plug<00:05:34.020> it<00:05:34.200> into<00:05:34.350> your<00:05:34.470> computer<00:05:35.010> you<00:05:35.040> can<00:05:35.220> watch

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
plug it into your computer you can watch

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.400 
plug it into your computer you can watch
the<00:05:35.790> videos<00:05:36.120> and<00:05:36.330> transfer<00:05:36.750> the<00:05:36.870> files<00:05:37.110> and

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
the videos and transfer the files and

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.820 
the videos and transfer the files and
everything<00:05:37.560> and<00:05:39.080> so<00:05:40.080> when<00:05:40.380> you<00:05:40.470> plug<00:05:40.680> this

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
everything and so when you plug this

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.610 
everything and so when you plug this
unit<00:05:40.890> into<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.729> USB<00:05:42.419> it's<00:05:43.020> going<00:05:43.320> to<00:05:43.380> light<00:05:43.590> up

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
unit into the USB it's going to light up

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.880 
unit into the USB it's going to light up
and<00:05:44.270> it's<00:05:45.270> going<00:05:45.390> to<00:05:45.479> charge<00:05:45.840> and<00:05:46.320> I<00:05:46.620> think

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
and it's going to charge and I think

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.560 
and it's going to charge and I think
when<00:05:47.040> it's<00:05:47.190> done<00:05:47.280> charging<00:05:47.700> the<00:05:48.150> light<00:05:48.360> will

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
when it's done charging the light will

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.430 
when it's done charging the light will
go<00:05:48.600> out<00:05:48.960> that's<00:05:49.770> how<00:05:49.860> the<00:05:49.979> other<00:05:50.100> unit<00:05:50.910> worked

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
go out that's how the other unit worked

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.440 
go out that's how the other unit worked
for<00:05:51.560> a<00:05:51.590> couple<00:05:51.800> of<00:05:51.920> days<00:05:52.040> before<00:05:52.250> it<00:05:52.490> went

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
for a couple of days before it went

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.700 
for a couple of days before it went
belly-up<00:05:53.750> on<00:05:53.990> me<00:05:54.140> so<00:05:55.210> I<00:05:56.210> am<00:05:56.960> going<00:05:57.290> to<00:05:57.500> test

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
belly-up on me so I am going to test

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.340 
belly-up on me so I am going to test
this<00:05:57.890> product<00:05:58.190> some<00:05:58.490> more<00:05:58.730> and<00:05:59.230> you<00:06:00.230> know

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
this product some more and you know

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.590

hopefully<00:06:01.250> I'm<00:06:01.760> gonna<00:06:02.030> go<00:06:02.180> ahead<00:06:02.270> and<00:06:02.390> give

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
hopefully I'm gonna go ahead and give

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.510 
hopefully I'm gonna go ahead and give
this<00:06:02.720> a<00:06:02.780> good<00:06:03.020> review<00:06:03.440> for<00:06:03.650> now<00:06:03.800> but<00:06:04.070> if<00:06:04.160> it<00:06:04.340> if

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
this a good review for now but if it if

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.870 
this a good review for now but if it if
it<00:06:04.670> fails<00:06:05.030> within<00:06:05.480> the<00:06:05.600> next<00:06:05.780> week<00:06:06.880> somebody's

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
it fails within the next week somebody's

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.760 
it fails within the next week somebody's
in<00:06:08.060> for<00:06:08.090> it<00:06:08.450> because<00:06:08.900> you<00:06:09.320> know<00:06:09.410> a<00:06:09.440> lot<00:06:09.740> of

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
in for it because you know a lot of

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.140 
in for it because you know a lot of
people<00:06:10.070> have<00:06:10.160> reported<00:06:10.610> back<00:06:10.730> that<00:06:10.790> there's

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
people have reported back that there's

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.510 
people have reported back that there's
works<00:06:11.420> fine<00:06:11.780> I'm<00:06:12.500> curious<00:06:12.830> if<00:06:13.040> they're<00:06:13.190> using

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
works fine I'm curious if they're using

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.490 
works fine I'm curious if they're using
the<00:06:13.610> internal<00:06:13.940> memory<00:06:14.210> or<00:06:14.390> the<00:06:14.540> TF<00:06:14.900> card<00:06:15.290> I

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
the internal memory or the TF card I

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.200 
the internal memory or the TF card I
think<00:06:15.800> this<00:06:15.950> is<00:06:16.100> a<00:06:16.130> much<00:06:16.340> better<00:06:16.550> design<00:06:16.820> on

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
think this is a much better design on

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.660 
think this is a much better design on
this<00:06:17.420> so<00:06:17.770> anyway<00:06:18.770> I<00:06:19.040> just<00:06:19.070> wanted<00:06:19.430> to<00:06:19.550> do

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:19.670 
this so anyway I just wanted to do

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.860 
this so anyway I just wanted to do
another<00:06:19.880> quick<00:06:20.240> review

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
another quick review

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.870 
another quick review
I<00:06:20.900> think<00:06:21.440> the<00:06:21.560> distributor<00:06:22.100> has<00:06:22.340> probably

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
I think the distributor has probably

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.090 
I think the distributor has probably
changed<00:06:23.390> my<00:06:23.630> mind<00:06:23.960> because<00:06:24.260> I<00:06:24.560> do<00:06:24.620> like<00:06:24.920> the

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 
changed my mind because I do like the

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.920 
changed my mind because I do like the
design<00:06:25.400> of<00:06:25.550> this<00:06:25.670> one<00:06:26.270> thing<00:06:26.450> I<00:06:26.570> don't<00:06:26.630> like

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
design of this one thing I don't like

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.340 
design of this one thing I don't like
this<00:06:27.140> the<00:06:27.350> thin<00:06:27.620> hollow<00:06:28.430> plastic<00:06:28.820> sound

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
this the thin hollow plastic sound

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.240 
this the thin hollow plastic sound
because<00:06:31.510> also<00:06:32.510> I<00:06:32.810> changed<00:06:33.650> out<00:06:33.830> the<00:06:33.860> little

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
because also I changed out the little

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.130 
because also I changed out the little
lanyard<00:06:34.460> thing<00:06:34.880> I<00:06:35.000> put<00:06:35.210> my<00:06:35.330> own<00:06:35.480> lanyard<00:06:35.960> on

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:36.140 
lanyard thing I put my own lanyard on

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.400 
lanyard thing I put my own lanyard on
there<00:06:36.380> but<00:06:37.010> when<00:06:37.220> it's<00:06:37.370> connected<00:06:37.850> to<00:06:38.090> my<00:06:38.270> keys

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.530 

the<00:06:42.410> hollow<00:06:42.740> sound<00:06:43.130> drives<00:06:43.700> me<00:06:43.850> nuts<00:06:44.120> it's<00:06:44.330> so

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
the hollow sound drives me nuts it's so

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.740 
the hollow sound drives me nuts it's so
loud<00:06:44.810> you<00:06:45.440> know<00:06:45.560> it<00:06:45.830> needs<00:06:46.160> to<00:06:46.370> be<00:06:46.520> more<00:06:47.510> of<00:06:47.630> a

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
loud you know it needs to be more of a

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.410 
loud you know it needs to be more of a
kind<00:06:48.110> of<00:06:48.230> a<00:06:48.520> soundproof<00:06:49.520> sound<00:06:50.120> state

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:50.420 
kind of a soundproof sound state

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.370 
kind of a soundproof sound state
whatever<00:06:52.060> design<00:06:53.060> or<00:06:53.390> maybe<00:06:53.660> thickened<00:06:54.110> up<00:06:54.200> on

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
whatever design or maybe thickened up on

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.659 
whatever design or maybe thickened up on
the<00:06:54.470> plastic<00:06:54.950> a<00:06:55.040> little<00:06:55.070> bit<00:06:55.400> or<00:06:55.490> something

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:55.669

off<00:07:10.250> the<00:07:10.280> bat<00:07:10.430> because<00:07:10.820> the<00:07:11.090> battery<00:07:11.390> life<00:07:11.540> is

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:11.570 
off the bat because the battery life is

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.180 
off the bat because the battery life is
supposed<00:07:12.080> to<00:07:12.140> be<00:07:12.260> an<00:07:12.350> hour<00:07:12.500> to<00:07:12.800> an<00:07:12.890> hour<00:07:13.010> and<00:07:13.100> a
