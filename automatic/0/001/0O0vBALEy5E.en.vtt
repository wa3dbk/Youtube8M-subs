00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.680

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.130
 wanna do i wanna do about 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:10.300
 the same in principle as you are only with 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:12.640
 milk and that is, you are vertically in 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.650
 yarkoyu this shorter court right away Th 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.750
 we study now with a glass if 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:22.000

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.730
 opa opa opa opa m for the sake of my pulls 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.799
 tree is waiting 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:32.950
 I am more sophisticated, I think 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:35.370
 experience i like the cover with water 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.850
 Digging a little iodine to that was 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.250
 about 2 percent iodine solution is 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:53.910
 so beautiful only from this could 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:53.910
 make it release so mean so 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:13.530
 so the question is who can see better max bye 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:19.150
 what I said is almost not visible 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.020
 look blue here you can see why listen 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:29.170
 blue got 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:32.650
 it's a secret I won't tell anyone just 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.550
 caterpillars then generally bluish me look 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:41.140
 as well as well and what we see 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:42.910
 about 4 you know how in inkavote for 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.820
 color blind type there discharges they 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.070
 red circles so me today 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.460
 It turned out but in general you can see so-so well 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:55.500
 In general, there let the audience appreciate here 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.500
 see here and so can be seen on Max 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.420
 familiar thing yah now my so 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.910
 let's say the old grandfather's way said 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.920
 I have his troubles Vladimir and no 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:12.120
 Vladimir Ilyich Lenin before that did 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.120
 so here 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:25.820
 or so 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:28.150
 there is no lighter 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.150
 by water 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:54.410
 still the case of the master I'm afraid so 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:58.060
 I think for a pancake well, look by the way about you 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.190
 to beak began to emerge only in here 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:04.210
 parallel direct dyes 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:07.640
 crossed and therefore koloboks studied 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.430

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.530
 see what you see now 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.300
 Well, I think the question is now removed from 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.430
 who is better seen but although I also 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.490
 seems to be a good start too 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.830
 be careful you just need to 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.400
 neatly do but the main thing is that the way 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.300
 max 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:29.060
 turned out to be very cool as you 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.550
 the loser will have to do more 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.720
