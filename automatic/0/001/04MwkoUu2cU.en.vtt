thing<00:00:47.360> you<00:00:47.570> need<00:00:47.600> would<00:00:47.960> be<00:00:48.080> TLS<00:00:48.610> you<00:00:49.610> can<00:00:49.760> also

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
thing you need would be TLS you can also

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.080 
thing you need would be TLS you can also
use<00:00:50.240> bacon<00:00:50.630> bond<00:00:50.890> fimo<00:00:51.890> deco<00:00:52.220> Joe<00:00:52.430> I'll<00:00:52.760> also

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
use bacon bond fimo deco Joe I'll also

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.930 
use bacon bond fimo deco Joe I'll also
be<00:00:53.270> testing<00:00:53.870> out<00:00:54.020> a<00:00:54.290> technique<00:00:55.040> on<00:00:55.400> which<00:00:55.700> I'll

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
be testing out a technique on which I'll

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.420 
be testing out a technique on which I'll
use<00:00:55.970> common<00:00:56.900> school<00:00:57.230> glue<00:00:57.440> to<00:00:57.890> see<00:00:58.070> if<00:00:58.250> it

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
use common school glue to see if it

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.030 
use common school glue to see if it
works<00:00:58.670> when<00:00:59.060> sticking<00:00:59.930> to<00:01:00.140> Palmer<00:01:00.500> clip<00:01:00.830> and

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
works when sticking to Palmer clip and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.420 
works when sticking to Palmer clip and
the<00:01:01.160> last<00:01:01.340> thing<00:01:01.520> you<00:01:01.610> need<00:01:01.690> would<00:01:02.690> be<00:01:03.430> course

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
the last thing you need would be course

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.399 
the last thing you need would be course
glitter<00:01:04.790> you<00:01:05.269> can<00:01:05.299> see<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.810> texture<00:01:06.200> is<00:01:06.380> very

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
glitter you can see the texture is very

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.849 
glitter you can see the texture is very
coarse<00:01:07.100> almost<00:01:08.090> like<00:01:08.270> a<00:01:08.450> sanding<00:01:09.020> sugar<00:01:09.049> now

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:09.859 
coarse almost like a sanding sugar now

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:12.219 
coarse almost like a sanding sugar now
you<00:01:09.920> can<00:01:10.189> also<00:01:10.399> use<00:01:10.850> a<00:01:11.090> fake<00:01:11.479> deco<00:01:11.810> sugar<00:01:12.049> I

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
you can also use a fake deco sugar I

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.990 
you can also use a fake deco sugar I
like<00:01:12.500> using<00:01:12.679> fake<00:01:13.009> deco<00:01:13.310> sugar<00:01:13.549> I<00:01:13.670> think<00:01:13.700> this

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
like using fake deco sugar I think this

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.429 
like using fake deco sugar I think this
would<00:01:14.149> make<00:01:14.179> it<00:01:14.329> look<00:01:14.539> more<00:01:14.750> realistic<00:01:15.079> this

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
would make it look more realistic this

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.889 
would make it look more realistic this
way<00:01:15.590> so<00:01:15.890> first<00:01:16.130> take<00:01:16.850> your<00:01:16.909> conditioned<00:01:17.509> ball

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
way so first take your conditioned ball

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.510 
way so first take your conditioned ball
of<00:01:18.200> polymer<00:01:18.560> clay<00:01:18.710> pinch<00:01:19.280> it<00:01:19.490> like<00:01:19.700> this<00:01:21.520> pinch

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
of polymer clay pinch it like this pinch

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.520 
of polymer clay pinch it like this pinch
on<00:01:22.759> all<00:01:22.969> four<00:01:23.210> sides<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:24.999> then<00:01:26.289> keep<00:01:27.289> rotating

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
on all four sides and then keep rotating

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.250 
on all four sides and then keep rotating
it

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.190 

now<00:01:33.830> this<00:01:34.010> part<00:01:34.280> can<00:01:34.430> get<00:01:34.580> a<00:01:34.610> little<00:01:34.820> messy<00:01:35.200> so

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
now this part can get a little messy so

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.540 
now this part can get a little messy so
I'm<00:01:36.350> going<00:01:36.590> to<00:01:36.620> make<00:01:36.800> two<00:01:36.980> different<00:01:37.130> ones<00:01:37.430> one

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
I'm going to make two different ones one

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.590 
I'm going to make two different ones one
with<00:01:38.060> school<00:01:38.840> glue<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:39.290> one<00:01:39.560> with<00:01:39.770> TLS<00:01:40.360> so<00:01:41.360> I'm

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
with school glue and one with TLS so I'm

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.720 
with school glue and one with TLS so I'm
just<00:01:41.810> going<00:01:42.080> to<00:01:42.110> coat<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.680> surface<00:01:42.860> there's

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
just going to coat the surface there's

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.300 
just going to coat the surface there's
just<00:01:44.090> a<00:01:44.180> small<00:01:44.420> dab<00:01:44.660> not<00:01:44.900> too<00:01:45.050> much<00:01:45.230> on<00:01:45.590> the

guess there's not much of a difference
between<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:50.550> TLS<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.780> PVA<00:03:52.170> glue<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.770> I

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
between the TLS and the PVA glue and I

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.080 
between the TLS and the PVA glue and I
recommend<00:03:53.870> substituting<00:03:54.890> TLS<00:03:55.920> on<00:03:56.100> different

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
recommend substituting TLS on different

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.240 
recommend substituting TLS on different
occasions<00:03:57.180> but<00:03:57.690> when<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:57.960> comes<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.380> sticking

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
occasions but when it comes to sticking

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.540 
occasions but when it comes to sticking
stuff<00:03:59.970> on<00:04:00.240> it<00:04:00.780> like<00:04:01.140> glitter<00:04:01.530> but<00:04:01.950> if<00:04:02.160> you<00:04:02.430> were

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
stuff on it like glitter but if you were

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.640 
stuff on it like glitter but if you were
to<00:04:02.760> stick<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.540> polymer<00:04:03.930> clay<00:04:04.080> pieces<00:04:04.380> together

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
to stick to polymer clay pieces together

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.229 
to stick to polymer clay pieces together
I<00:04:04.890> can't<00:04:05.190> guarantee<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.550> it<00:04:05.790> was<00:04:05.880> thick<00:04:06.090> well

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
I can't guarantee that it was thick well

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.660 
I can't guarantee that it was thick well
I'll<00:04:06.750> let<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:06.930> cool<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.530> when<00:04:08.160> it's<00:04:08.310> done<00:04:08.430> cool

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
I'll let it cool and when it's done cool

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.699 
I'll let it cool and when it's done cool
and<00:04:08.820> you<00:04:08.910> should<00:04:08.940> glaze<00:04:09.300> it<00:04:09.510> but<00:04:10.320> if<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.590> were

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
and you should glaze it but if you were

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.110 
and you should glaze it but if you were
to<00:04:10.890> use<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.040> head<00:04:11.280> pin<00:04:11.459> you<00:04:11.580> have<00:04:11.640> to<00:04:11.820> turn<00:04:12.000> it

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
to use a head pin you have to turn it

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.360 
to use a head pin you have to turn it
into<00:04:12.239> a<00:04:12.390> charm<00:04:12.750> so<00:04:14.090> I'm<00:04:15.090> just<00:04:15.300> gonna<00:04:15.450> give<00:04:15.780> my

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
into a charm so I'm just gonna give my

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.560 
into a charm so I'm just gonna give my
charm<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.459> quick<00:04:17.669> loop<00:04:17.880> here

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.720 

it's<00:04:22.900> time<00:04:23.200> to<00:04:23.230> glaze<00:04:23.590> them<00:04:23.770> and<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.190> glaze<00:04:24.430> is

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
it's time to glaze them and the glaze is

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
it's time to glaze them and the glaze is
to<00:04:24.910> seal<00:04:25.180> in<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:26.620> fake<00:04:27.610> sugar<00:04:27.910> on<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.720> outside

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
to seal in the fake sugar on the outside

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.270 
to seal in the fake sugar on the outside
I<00:04:29.350> like<00:04:29.530> to<00:04:29.740> use<00:04:29.890> triple<00:04:30.160> thick<00:04:31.740> this<00:04:32.740> was<00:04:33.010> the

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
I like to use triple thick this was the

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.600 
I like to use triple thick this was the
one<00:04:33.460> I<00:04:33.670> used<00:04:34.000> he<00:04:34.300> LS<00:04:34.570> way<00:04:34.780> and<00:04:35.530> this<00:04:35.830> one<00:04:36.040> was

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
one I used he LS way and this one was

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.660 
one I used he LS way and this one was
one<00:04:36.850> where<00:04:37.120> I<00:04:37.150> used<00:04:37.510> a<00:04:37.870> school<00:04:38.410> glue<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:39.490> use

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
one where I used a school glue to use

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.180 
one where I used a school glue to use
school<00:04:40.000> glue<00:04:40.180> or<00:04:40.480> to<00:04:40.690> use<00:04:40.810> TLS<00:04:41.140> fimo<00:04:41.650> gel<00:04:41.710> gel
