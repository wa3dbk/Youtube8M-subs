video<00:00:05.730> I'm<00:00:06.000> going<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.330> be<00:00:06.509> showing<00:00:06.690> you<00:00:06.930> how<00:00:07.379> to

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
video I'm going to be showing you how to

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.470 
video I'm going to be showing you how to
use<00:00:07.560> multi-touch<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.730> resize<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.269> core

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
use multi-touch to resize the core

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.020 
use multi-touch to resize the core
graphics<00:00:09.690> drawing<00:00:10.290> this<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.370> useful<00:00:11.610> I

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
graphics drawing this is useful I

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.030 
graphics drawing this is useful I
actually<00:00:12.540> use<00:00:12.840> this<00:00:12.990> in<00:00:13.170> zoomify<00:00:13.500> for

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
actually use this in zoomify for

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.189 
actually use this in zoomify for
selecting<00:00:14.820> your<00:00:14.910> cropping<00:00:15.179> so<00:00:15.900> it's<00:00:16.080> pretty

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
selecting your cropping so it's pretty

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.260 
selecting your cropping so it's pretty
cool<00:00:16.470> now<00:00:17.130> there's<00:00:17.340> no<00:00:17.460> way<00:00:17.580> built-in<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.150> do

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
cool now there's no way built-in to do

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.120 
cool now there's no way built-in to do
this<00:00:18.449> but<00:00:18.690> we<00:00:18.869> can<00:00:18.990> use<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.350> apples<00:00:19.740> built-in

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
this but we can use the apples built-in

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.490 
this but we can use the apples built-in
multi-touch<00:00:20.640> api's<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.449> risk<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:22.020> resize

resizer all right now under classes
we're<00:00:34.980> going<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.430> normal<00:00:35.820> create<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.180> new

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
we're going to like normal create a new

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.889 
we're going to like normal create a new
UI<00:00:36.600> view<00:00:36.899> class<00:00:37.079> good<00:00:38.239> then<00:00:39.239> I'll<00:00:39.450> call<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.750> may

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
UI view class good then I'll call it may

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.160 
UI view class good then I'll call it may
view<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:41.430> I'll<00:00:42.180> set<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.480> up<00:00:42.660> an<00:00:42.780> interface

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
view and I'll set it up an interface

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.299 
view and I'll set it up an interface
builder<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:43.800> our<00:00:43.890> main<00:00:44.040> view<00:00:46.309> subscribe

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
builder so it's our main view subscribe

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.639 
builder so it's our main view subscribe
this<00:00:49.579> alright<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:50.730> now<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.300> our<00:00:51.390> main

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
this alright so now this is our main

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.930 
this alright so now this is our main
this<00:00:52.649> will<00:00:52.800> get<00:00:52.920> drawn<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.430> we're<00:00:53.610> going<00:00:53.789> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
this will get drawn so we're going to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.080 
this will get drawn so we're going to
have<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> CG<00:00:54.449> float<00:00:54.719> diameter<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.910> you'll<00:00:56.910> see

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
have a CG float diameter and you'll see

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.000 
have a CG float diameter and you'll see
what<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.719> second<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.260> we're<00:00:58.829> going

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
what this is in a second and we're going

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.369 
what this is in a second and we're going
to<00:00:59.160> make<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.309> void<00:00:59.699> well<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.320> to

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
to make a void well and it's going to

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.979 
to make a void well and it's going to
return<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.680> CG<00:01:02.100> float<00:01:02.370> cg<00:01:02.969> Sloat<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.750> um

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
return a CG float cg Sloat is just um

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.160 
return a CG float cg Sloat is just um
you<00:01:04.769> know<00:01:04.890> an<00:01:05.070> integer<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.880> whole<00:01:06.450> number<00:01:06.659> cg

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
you know an integer is a whole number cg

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.080 
you know an integer is a whole number cg
float<00:01:07.500> there's<00:01:07.799> any<00:01:08.070> kind<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.490> number<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
float there's any kind of number it's a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.130 
float there's any kind of number it's a
floating<00:01:09.510> point<00:01:09.720> number<00:01:11.510> alright<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.720> our<00:01:12.750> CG

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
floating point number alright so our CG

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.440 
floating point number alright so our CG
float<00:01:13.380> method<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.830> going<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.159> say<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:15.330> going

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
float method is going to say it's going

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.690 
float method is going to say it's going
to<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.689> called<00:01:16.009> distance<00:01:17.840> cgpoint<00:01:19.520> he<00:01:20.520> one<00:01:20.759> of

to be called distance cgpoint he one of
point2<00:01:23.700> d<00:01:23.939> point<00:01:24.350> p2<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.729> method<00:01:27.299> is

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
point2 d point p2 and this method is

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.080 
point2 d point p2 and this method is
going<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.780> use<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> point<00:01:28.259> distance<00:01:28.680> formula

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
going to use the point distance formula

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.550 
going to use the point distance formula
but<00:01:30.090> before<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:30.810> anything<00:01:30.840> with<00:01:31.380> this

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
but before we can do anything with this

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.410 
but before we can do anything with this
we<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.400> understand<00:01:32.909> what<00:01:33.030> we're<00:01:33.180> doing

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
we have to understand what we're doing

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.130 
we have to understand what we're doing
so<00:01:33.960> anyway<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> uiview<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.210> mess<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.020> always

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
so anyway on a uiview a mess that always

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.929 
so anyway on a uiview a mess that always
gets<00:01:37.439> called<00:01:37.680> called<00:01:37.920> touchings<00:01:38.310> moves<00:01:38.640> and

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
gets called called touchings moves and

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.539 
gets called called touchings moves and
touches<00:01:39.659> boobs<00:01:40.049> all<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.770> does<00:01:41.009> all<00:01:41.280> its

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
touches boobs all it does all its

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.429 
touches boobs all it does all its
responsible<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.540> handling<00:01:43.110> multiple

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
responsible for is handling multiple

responsible for is handling multiple
touch<00:01:43.979> events<00:01:44.490> which<00:01:44.700> means<00:01:44.729> if<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.509> put<00:01:45.689> on

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
touch events which means if you put on

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.719 
touch events which means if you put on
five<00:01:46.049> fingers<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.860> screen<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.399> going<00:01:47.640> to

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
five fingers on the screen it's going to

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.639 
five fingers on the screen it's going to
call<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.149> touches<00:01:48.570> move<00:01:48.810> whenever<00:01:49.170> any<00:01:49.470> of

call one touches move whenever any of
them<00:01:49.799> moves<00:01:50.070> but<00:01:50.880> there's<00:01:51.509> going<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.899> be<00:01:51.930> an

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
them moves but there's going to be an

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
you know contain the different touch

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.850 
you know contain the different touch
objects<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.990> we're<00:01:58.259> going<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.469> declare<00:01:58.740> our

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.319 
objects so we're going to declare our
voice<00:01:59.040> touches<00:01:59.700> moved<00:02:00.350> Clary<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:02.610> here<00:02:03.180> is

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
voice touches moved Clary and in here is

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.440 
voice touches moved Clary and in here is
where<00:02:03.509> we're<00:02:03.719> going<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.290> get<00:02:04.590> two<00:02:04.829> points<00:02:05.040> so

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
where we're going to get two points so

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.719 
where we're going to get two points so
touches<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.689> an<00:02:06.869> MS<00:02:07.229> set<00:02:07.530> ms<00:02:08.009> set<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.429> like<00:02:08.610> an

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
touches is an MS set ms set is like an

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.729 
touches is an MS set ms set is like an
unordered<00:02:09.270> array<00:02:09.420> there's<00:02:09.929> no<00:02:10.080> folders<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.619> it

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
unordered array there's no folders to it

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.980 
unordered array there's no folders to it
so<00:02:11.039> if

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
so if

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:20.660 
so if
touches<00:02:13.640> count<00:02:15.230> bang<00:02:16.230> goes<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:17.990> anna<00:02:18.990> sog<00:02:19.670> not

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
touches count bang goes to anna sog not

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.580 
touches count bang goes to anna sog not
two<00:02:21.390> fingers<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.620> little<00:02:23.610> church<00:02:24.590> otherwise

two fingers a little church otherwise

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.640 
two fingers a little church otherwise
there<00:02:25.920> are<00:02:25.950> two<00:02:26.280> touches<00:02:26.490> so<00:02:26.820> we<00:02:26.910> can<00:02:27.060> say<00:02:27.270> for

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
there are two touches so we can say for

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.380 
there are two touches so we can say for
you<00:02:28.650> are<00:02:28.830> touch<00:02:29.130> t<00:02:30.000> in<00:02:30.270> touches<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:32.240> here<00:02:33.240> will

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
you are touch t in touches and here will

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:42.410 
you are touch t in touches and here will
they<00:02:33.420> get<00:02:33.930> coordinates<00:02:36.860> cg<00:02:37.880> 40k<00:02:40.190> 1642<00:02:41.420> all

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
they get coordinates cg 40k 1642 all

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.670 
they get coordinates cg 40k 1642 all
right<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:42.990> we'll<00:02:43.320> say<00:02:44.690> sound<00:02:45.690> pretty<00:02:45.960> big<00:02:46.260> step

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
right so we'll say sound pretty big step

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.730 
right so we'll say sound pretty big step
I'm<00:02:47.190> just<00:02:47.520> doing<00:02:47.790> was<00:02:47.970> hastily<00:02:48.690> will<00:02:49.320> say<00:02:49.530> if

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
I'm just doing was hastily will say if

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.480 
I'm just doing was hastily will say if
step<00:02:50.040> equals<00:02:50.910> zero<00:02:51.240> then<00:02:51.750> p1<00:02:52.410> equals<00:02:53.190> T

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
step equals zero then p1 equals T

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:00.440 
step equals zero then p1 equals T
location<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.600> you<00:02:54.840> self<00:02:55.650> not<00:02:55.860> view<00:02:56.150> else<00:02:59.450> p2

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
location and you self not view else p2

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.770 
location and you self not view else p2
equals<00:03:01.080> T<00:03:01.470> location<00:03:02.220> in<00:03:02.340> here<00:03:02.580> so<00:03:03.210> talk<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.690> you

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
equals T location in here so talk to you

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.170 
equals T location in here so talk to you
and<00:03:04.050> at<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.190> end<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.460> this<00:03:05.520> method<00:03:05.880> will<00:03:05.970> say

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
and at the end of this method will say

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.660 
and at the end of this method will say
step<00:03:06.450> because<00:03:06.810> one<00:03:06.990> time<00:03:07.200> up<00:03:07.380> alright<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.520> now

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
step because one time up alright so now

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.970 
step because one time up alright so now
we'll<00:03:08.850> have<00:03:09.060> two<00:03:09.360> points<00:03:09.750> p1<00:03:09.960> and<00:03:10.290> p2<00:03:10.440> these

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
we'll have two points p1 and p2 these

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.250 
we'll have two points p1 and p2 these
are<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.250> two<00:03:11.460> points<00:03:11.910> two<00:03:12.360> locations<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:13.170> the

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
are the two points two locations of the

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.170 
are the two points two locations of the
fingers<00:03:13.680> on<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.250> screen<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:14.790> now<00:03:15.630> we'll<00:03:17.180> we'll

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
fingers on the screen so now we'll we'll

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.630 
fingers on the screen so now we'll we'll
get<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.290> distance<00:03:19.650> between<00:03:19.830> these<00:03:20.160> two<00:03:20.220> four

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
get the distance between these two four

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.320 
get the distance between these two four
fingers<00:03:21.300> and<00:03:21.540> make<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.990> diameter<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:23.550> i'll

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
fingers and make it the diameter so i'll

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.010 
fingers and make it the diameter so i'll
say<00:03:24.660> diameter<00:03:25.620> equals<00:03:26.610> self<00:03:27.420> distance<00:03:28.050> d1<00:03:29.040> of

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
say diameter equals self distance d1 of

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.900 
say diameter equals self distance d1 of
point<00:03:31.020> p2<00:03:31.350> now<00:03:32.070> we<00:03:32.130> have<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.550> make<00:03:32.730> the

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
point p2 now we have to make the

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.510 
point p2 now we have to make the
distance<00:03:33.090> method<00:03:33.840> work<00:03:34.110> so<00:03:34.830> if<00:03:35.100> you<00:03:35.250> over<00:03:35.460> a

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
distance method work so if you over a

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.700 
distance method work so if you over a
call<00:03:35.730> from<00:03:35.940> simple<00:03:36.300> algebra<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:37.380> get<00:03:37.560> the

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
call from simple algebra to get the

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.900 
call from simple algebra to get the
difference<00:03:38.010> between<00:03:38.130> two<00:03:38.520> points<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.880> just

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
difference between two points you just

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.240 
difference between two points you just
use<00:03:39.240> the<00:03:39.360> Pythagorean<00:03:40.140> theorem<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:41.040> we're

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
use the Pythagorean theorem so we're

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.440 
use the Pythagorean theorem so we're
going<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.430> return<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.940> square<00:03:42.270> root<00:03:42.510> of<00:03:44.270> t<00:03:45.270> 1

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
going to return the square root of t 1

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.530 
going to return the square root of t 1
not<00:03:45.720> like<00:03:46.380> dot<00:03:47.190> y<00:03:47.400> minus<00:03:47.700> p2<00:03:48.300> dot<00:03:48.690> y<00:03:49.250> squared

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
not like dot y minus p2 dot y squared

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.000 
not like dot y minus p2 dot y squared
plus<00:03:51.540> tau<00:03:52.130> which<00:03:53.130> is<00:03:53.310> exponent<00:03:54.500> p<00:03:55.500> 1<00:03:55.710> dot<00:03:55.890> x

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
plus tau which is exponent p 1 dot x

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.080 
plus tau which is exponent p 1 dot x
minus<00:03:56.400> p<00:03:56.760> 2<00:03:56.940> x<00:03:57.410> squared<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:58.790> this<00:03:59.790> works

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
minus p 2 x squared and this works

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.800 
minus p 2 x squared and this works
mathematically<00:04:00.900> so<00:04:01.710> yeah<00:04:02.610> now<00:04:03.270> these<00:04:03.570> will

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
mathematically so yeah now these will

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.480 
mathematically so yeah now these will
always<00:04:04.080> be<00:04:04.230> positive<00:04:04.470> so<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:05.040> square<00:04:05.220> root

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
always be positive so the square root

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.940 
always be positive so the square root
method<00:04:05.520> won't<00:04:05.970> flip<00:04:06.330> out<00:04:06.560> it'll<00:04:07.560> give<00:04:07.710> you<00:04:07.830> an

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
method won't flip out it'll give you an

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.890 
method won't flip out it'll give you an
accurate<00:04:08.100> distance<00:04:08.520> so<00:04:09.390> we're<00:04:09.510> just<00:04:09.540> setting

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
accurate distance so we're just setting

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.110 
accurate distance so we're just setting
the<00:04:09.930> diameter<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.740> now<00:04:10.920> say<00:04:11.220> itself<00:04:11.640> sent

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
the diameter and now say itself sent

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.860 
the diameter and now say itself sent
needs<00:04:12.330> display<00:04:12.750> this<00:04:13.530> just<00:04:13.890> means<00:04:14.600> redraw<00:04:15.600> our

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
needs display this just means redraw our

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.920 
needs display this just means redraw our
view<00:04:16.200> it<00:04:16.350> will<00:04:16.500> recall<00:04:17.010> our<00:04:17.340> draw<00:04:18.090> rect<00:04:18.420> method

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
view it will recall our draw rect method

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.990 
view it will recall our draw rect method
in<00:04:19.080> this<00:04:19.859> method<00:04:20.100> we're<00:04:20.459> going<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.760> draw<00:04:20.970> a

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
in this method we're going to draw a

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.030 
in this method we're going to draw a
circle<00:04:21.270> in<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:21.750> middle<00:04:21.780> of<00:04:22.020> the<00:04:22.140> screen<00:04:22.320> which

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
circle in the middle of the screen which

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.310 
circle in the middle of the screen which
will<00:04:23.070> have<00:04:23.729> what<00:04:24.300> you'll<00:04:24.479> have<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.780> diameter

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
will have what you'll have the diameter

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.750 
will have what you'll have the diameter
that<00:04:25.350> we<00:04:25.590> want

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
that we want

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.560 
that we want
so<00:04:26.970> let's<00:04:27.150> say<00:04:27.950> cgpoint<00:04:28.950> or<00:04:29.370> let's<00:04:29.820> declare<00:04:29.970> cg

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
so let's say cgpoint or let's declare cg

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.670 
so let's say cgpoint or let's declare cg
correct<00:04:31.580> circle<00:04:32.580> frame<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:33.390> let's<00:04:34.200> calculate

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
correct circle frame and let's calculate

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.030 
correct circle frame and let's calculate
the<00:04:35.130> frame<00:04:35.370> so<00:04:35.610> we'll<00:04:35.850> say<00:04:36.030> circle<00:04:37.020> frame<00:04:37.260> or

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
the frame so we'll say circle frame or

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.660 
the frame so we'll say circle frame or
agenda<00:04:38.430> x<00:04:38.760> equals<00:04:39.380> self<00:04:40.380> dot<00:04:40.590> frame<00:04:41.010> that<00:04:41.370> size

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
agenda x equals self dot frame that size

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.690 
agenda x equals self dot frame that size
that<00:04:41.940> with<00:04:42.180> over<00:04:42.600> two<00:04:42.840> minus<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:43.740> terrible

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
that with over two minus and terrible

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.860 
that with over two minus and terrible
subtract<00:04:45.210> how<00:04:45.540> about<00:04:46.820> diameter<00:04:47.820> over<00:04:48.360> two<00:04:48.600> and

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
subtract how about diameter over two and

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.590 
subtract how about diameter over two and
it<00:04:49.500> uses<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.950> order<00:04:50.340> of<00:04:50.460> operations<00:04:50.580> so<00:04:51.420> this

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
it uses the order of operations so this

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.150 
it uses the order of operations so this
will<00:04:51.780> be<00:04:51.870> separate<00:04:52.260> from<00:04:52.290> this<00:04:52.680> it<00:04:52.980> will

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
will be separate from this it will

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.330 
will be separate from this it will
subtract<00:04:54.110> will<00:04:55.110> say<00:04:55.260> circle<00:04:55.500> claim<00:04:56.190> now

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
subtract will say circle claim now

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.670 
subtract will say circle claim now
origin<00:04:56.760> that<00:04:56.940> y<00:04:57.090> equals<00:04:57.390> self<00:04:57.870> dot<00:04:58.080> frame<00:04:58.350> that

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
origin that y equals self dot frame that

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.500 
origin that y equals self dot frame that
size<00:04:58.950> that<00:04:59.910> height<00:05:00.300> over<00:05:00.750> 2<00:05:01.050> minus<00:05:02.510> diameter

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
size that height over 2 minus diameter

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
size that height over 2 minus diameter
over<00:05:04.020> two<00:05:04.320> and<00:05:05.270> now<00:05:06.270> we'll<00:05:06.480> say<00:05:06.690> circle<00:05:07.140> frame

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
over two and now we'll say circle frame

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.370 
over two and now we'll say circle frame
that<00:05:07.770> side<00:05:08.040> that<00:05:08.070> width<00:05:08.610> equals<00:05:09.380> diameter

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
that side that width equals diameter

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.650 
that side that width equals diameter
circle<00:05:11.250> frame<00:05:11.670> that<00:05:11.880> size<00:05:12.090> that<00:05:12.390> height

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
circle frame that size that height

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.100 
circle frame that size that height
equals<00:05:13.230> diameter<00:05:13.910> alright<00:05:14.910> so<00:05:15.720> now<00:05:15.840> we<00:05:15.900> have

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
equals diameter alright so now we have

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.840 
equals diameter alright so now we have
to<00:05:16.230> draw<00:05:16.380> the<00:05:16.410> circle<00:05:16.920> and<00:05:17.130> you<00:05:17.250> can<00:05:17.430> remember

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
to draw the circle and you can remember

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.970 
to draw the circle and you can remember
this<00:05:18.000> we<00:05:18.240> just<00:05:18.270> get<00:05:18.630> the<00:05:18.750> context<00:05:21.710> all<00:05:22.710> right

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
this we just get the context all right

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.450 
this we just get the context all right
it<00:05:23.250> will<00:05:23.520> succeed<00:05:23.910> econ<00:05:24.300> jack<00:05:24.540> straw<00:05:25.460> how

will<00:05:49.020> draw<00:05:49.170> the<00:05:49.200> circle<00:05:49.740> that<00:05:49.890> we<00:05:50.040> want<00:05:50.310> let's

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
will draw the circle that we want let's

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.970 
will draw the circle that we want let's
see<00:05:51.180> if<00:05:51.270> we<00:05:51.420> have<00:05:51.540> any<00:05:51.810> errors<00:05:52.380> or<00:05:52.620> anything

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
see if we have any errors or anything

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.730 
see if we have any errors or anything
like<00:05:53.010> that<00:05:56.750> looks<00:05:57.750> like<00:05:57.930> we<00:05:58.110> have<00:05:58.170> four<00:05:58.500> errors

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
like that looks like we have four errors

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.560 
like that looks like we have four errors
and<00:05:59.070> they're<00:05:59.190> actually<00:05:59.610> just<00:05:59.640> two<00:06:00.000> errors<00:06:00.330> so

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
and they're actually just two errors so

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.560 
and they're actually just two errors so
here<00:06:01.520> instead<00:06:02.520> of<00:06:02.580> saying<00:06:02.820> some<00:06:03.060> Tapia<00:06:03.420> we

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
here instead of saying some Tapia we

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.480 
here instead of saying some Tapia we
just<00:06:03.750> Excel<00:06:04.110> because<00:06:04.320> we're<00:06:04.620> actually<00:06:04.770> a<00:06:05.190> view

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
just Excel because we're actually a view

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.490 
just Excel because we're actually a view
ourselves<00:06:05.610> right<00:06:06.030> that's<00:06:06.360> fixing<00:06:06.900> alright<00:06:07.230> so

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
ourselves right that's fixing alright so

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.350 
ourselves right that's fixing alright so
now<00:06:07.650> we've<00:06:07.890> got<00:06:08.070> it<00:06:08.250> all<00:06:08.430> configured<00:06:09.030> with<00:06:09.210> our

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
now we've got it all configured with our

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.030 
now we've got it all configured with our
stuff<00:06:09.660> but<00:06:10.170> there's<00:06:10.350> one<00:06:10.470> last<00:06:10.650> step<00:06:10.890> you<00:06:10.950> have

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
stuff but there's one last step you have

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.520 
stuff but there's one last step you have
to<00:06:11.250> take<00:06:11.430> before<00:06:11.670> it'll<00:06:12.060> actually<00:06:12.240> work

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
to take before it'll actually work

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.620 
to take before it'll actually work
because<00:06:13.530> in<00:06:13.770> order<00:06:13.890> to<00:06:14.040> detect<00:06:14.550> to<00:06:15.000> two

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
because in order to detect to two

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.290 
because in order to detect to two
touches<00:06:15.900> are<00:06:16.170> more<00:06:16.410> like<00:06:17.130> we<00:06:17.340> do<00:06:17.460> here<00:06:17.880> you

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
touches are more like we do here you

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.180 
touches are more like we do here you
have<00:06:18.510> to<00:06:18.660> enable<00:06:18.840> a<00:06:19.080> property<00:06:19.530> on<00:06:19.560> the<00:06:19.680> view<00:06:20.010> so

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
have to enable a property on the view so

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.890 
have to enable a property on the view so
we'll<00:06:20.340> open<00:06:20.520> back<00:06:20.940> up<00:06:20.970> our<00:06:21.330> view<00:06:21.510> controller

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
we'll open back up our view controller

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.930 
we'll open back up our view controller
an<00:06:22.080> interface<00:06:22.470> builder<00:06:22.710> click<00:06:23.430> on<00:06:23.550> the<00:06:23.610> view

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
an interface builder click on the view

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.910 
an interface builder click on the view
we're<00:06:24.390> going<00:06:24.510> to<00:06:24.600> go<00:06:24.690> to<00:06:24.720> properties<00:06:25.050> and<00:06:25.770> we

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:25.920 
we're going to go to properties and we

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.250 
we're going to go to properties and we
have<00:06:26.010> to<00:06:26.160> check<00:06:26.400> multi-touch<00:06:27.330> all<00:06:27.960> right

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
have to check multi-touch all right

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.350 
have to check multi-touch all right
right<00:06:28.410> there<00:06:28.680> it<00:06:29.250> has<00:06:29.400> to<00:06:29.520> be<00:06:29.580> checked<00:06:29.850> or<00:06:30.180> else

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
right there it has to be checked or else

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.070 
right there it has to be checked or else
it<00:06:31.020> won't<00:06:31.320> work<00:06:31.650> for<00:06:32.400> multi-touch<00:06:32.970> so<00:06:33.330> let's

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
it won't work for multi-touch so let's

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.780 
it won't work for multi-touch so let's
run<00:06:34.290> it<00:06:34.430> and<00:06:36.200> if<00:06:37.200> we<00:06:37.470> drag<00:06:37.800> our<00:06:37.980> fingers<00:06:38.340> we

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:38.790 
run it and if we drag our fingers we

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.279 
run it and if we drag our fingers we
have<00:06:38.970> a<00:06:39.000> circle<00:06:39.540> with<00:06:39.780> the<00:06:39.810> diet

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
have a circle with the diet

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:44.450 
have a circle with the diet
a manner<00:06:40.529> of<00:06:40.710> which<00:06:41.099> yeah<00:06:41.999> we<00:06:42.180> want<00:06:43.069> as<00:06:44.069> I<00:06:44.189> put

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
a manner of which yeah we want as I put

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.639 
a manner of which yeah we want as I put
them<00:06:44.610> together<00:06:44.759> it'll<00:06:45.180> be<00:06:45.419> 0<00:06:45.930> but<00:06:46.499> yeah

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:46.649 
them together it'll be 0 but yeah

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:48.579 
them together it'll be 0 but yeah
basically<00:06:46.860> that's<00:06:47.399> how<00:06:47.520> that's<00:06:48.210> how
