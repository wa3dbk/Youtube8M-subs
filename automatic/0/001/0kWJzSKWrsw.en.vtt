00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.730
 I agreed to seventh higher to know increased 

00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:08.240
 for the fifth string 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.650
 to do the agreed seventh major 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.160
 know augmented for the fifth string 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.830
 we start from the seventh major corde 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:23.539
 ninth we had but the index finger 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.539
 instead of stepping, it makes me a seed 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.360
 I remove that the sharp F of the first 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.689
 pictures to the person agreed five 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.689
 dead 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.370
 the bass we started from the sixth although 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.379
 so it can be complete very 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.379
 incomplete the bass always part 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.280
 It is also important to note that in 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.280
 this case the king 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.620
 but technically to add a 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.760
 tension 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.019
 I have to have all the notes 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.719
 previous for example if I want 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.189
 do a ninth agreed I have 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.310
 have to have the first the third to the 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:10.690
 fifth the seventh and the ninth if I 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.600
 I want to make a chord with an eleven 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:20.460
 on a technical level I remembered I should have 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:22.720
 the ninth should be 1 3 5 7 9 and 11 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.610
 we sometimes do not put all the 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.710
 tensions to reach a record 30 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.570
 with this same logic a three chord 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.660
 dinners should have all the tensions 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.090
 possible should be the full scale 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.340
 we do not put all the tensions 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.680
 simply why 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.440
 on the guitar I do not have 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.290
 so much possibility of making a rope of 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.600
 seven notes are missing strings and the 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.450
 visitation would become very 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.830
 complicated but it's not a big problem in 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.170
 the case of wanted to play an obscene 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.180
 increased that has the ninth of the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.950
 Cut is the most practical fingering that 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.390
 we have to play a major chord 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.390
 seventh 11 increases then 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.740
 all right
