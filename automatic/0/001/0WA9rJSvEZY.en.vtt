choices<00:04:36.889> you<00:04:37.130> can<00:04:37.250> I<00:04:37.550> don't<00:04:37.940> know<00:04:38.090> maybe<00:04:38.300> I

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
choices you can I don't know maybe I

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.090 
choices you can I don't know maybe I
would<00:04:38.630> I<00:04:38.840> would<00:04:39.080> think<00:04:39.199> if<00:04:39.350> you<00:04:39.380> click<00:04:39.680> if<00:04:39.919> you

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
would I would think if you click if you

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.700 
would I would think if you click if you
touch<00:04:40.340> that<00:04:40.370> it's<00:04:40.970> a<00:04:41.090> touchscreen<00:04:41.330> tablet<00:04:42.080> of

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
touch that it's a touchscreen tablet of

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.740 
touch that it's a touchscreen tablet of
course<00:04:43.070> so<00:04:43.789> if<00:04:43.850> you<00:04:43.910> touch<00:04:44.060> that<00:04:44.300> you<00:04:44.479> can<00:04:44.600> get

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
course so if you touch that you can get

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.900 
course so if you touch that you can get
information<00:04:44.870> on<00:04:45.350> your<00:04:45.530> guns<00:04:45.770> or<00:04:46.190> or<00:04:46.760> maybe

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
information on your guns or or maybe

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.529 
information on your guns or or maybe

what you're looking at now I kind of put
a<00:04:58.130> little<00:04:58.190> kind<00:04:59.000> of<00:04:59.030> like<00:04:59.180> a<00:04:59.240> glossy<00:05:00.160> glossy

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
a little kind of like a glossy glossy

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.310 
a little kind of like a glossy glossy
thing<00:05:01.610> on<00:05:01.760> the<00:05:01.880> front<00:05:02.180> to<00:05:02.479> make<00:05:02.510> it<00:05:02.780> look<00:05:02.990> very

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
thing on the front to make it look very

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.820 
thing on the front to make it look very
nice<00:05:06.039> but<00:05:07.039> yeah<00:05:07.250> so<00:05:07.490> kind<00:05:07.760> of<00:05:07.849> a<00:05:08.620> hexagonal<00:05:09.620> I

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
nice but yeah so kind of a hexagonal I

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.600 
nice but yeah so kind of a hexagonal I
think<00:05:10.130> you'd<00:05:10.250> call<00:05:10.400> it

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
think you'd call it

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.219 
think you'd call it
hexagonal<00:05:10.940> pattern<00:05:12.910> but<00:05:13.910> but<00:05:14.810> yeah<00:05:14.930> I<00:05:15.020> thought

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
hexagonal pattern but but yeah I thought

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:16.870 
hexagonal pattern but but yeah I thought
the<00:05:15.440> hexagonal<00:05:15.770> pattern<00:05:16.280> would<00:05:16.430> kind<00:05:16.669> of<00:05:16.729> be

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
the hexagonal pattern would kind of be

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.020 
the hexagonal pattern would kind of be
the<00:05:17.169> touch<00:05:18.169> sensors<00:05:20.440> but<00:05:21.440> anyway<00:05:21.919> guys<00:05:22.070> this

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
the touch sensors but anyway guys this

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.460 
the touch sensors but anyway guys this
