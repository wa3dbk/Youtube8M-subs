00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.400
 nice that you clicked ours 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.900
 girls jette and nele show you how 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.350
 we have our breakfast honey ourselves 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.120
 do 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.170
 strictly speaking, it's a delicious one 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.030
 pretty sweet syrup as soon as the first 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.280
 Dandelion should bloom with the 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.470
 Honey production starts the first 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.900
 Flowers are most intense in color 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.340
 and in taste 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.649
 already picking would have two things 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.870
 Note the place where you pick and the 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.030
 When he picks the flowers on the daytime 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.980
 Roadside with a lot of traffic or where 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.230
 Many dogs are taken for a walk 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.329
 let her stand up rather collects 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.440
 a green meadow in nature or at 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.390
 you are in the garden in the midday sun 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.679
 the dandelion flowers are rich in flavors and 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.109
 they make the tasteful 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.030
 Distinguished from also pulls the 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:01.230
 bloom in the evening and you can 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.230
 process worse 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.479
 we only need the dandelions 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.719
 Yellow flowers add the yellow leaves 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.979
 pluck is idle you needed at least 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:20.200
 200 grams of it for a liter 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.909
 liquid are better 250 grams with it 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.490
 the liquid becomes firmer when cooking 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.890
 and give her a cut one 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.959
 Organic lemon if you do not 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.819
 be sure that the lemon is unsprayed 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:34.630
 is you give that out instead 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:36.429
 squeezed juice with a liter 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.560
 water will boil the whole thing now 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:43.179
 The addiction should be about five 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.039
 Cook vigorously for a few minutes then you set 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.869
 aside the pot and since today 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.880
 finished with a lid closed 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.420
 leave the pot content overnight 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.420
 pull through 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.590
 the next day she lacks the clear 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.770
 liquid with a cloth diaper or 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.479
 a kitchen towel out vigorously from 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.310
 bring as much juice for 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.310
 the honey can be further processed 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.260
 As with jam, sugar will also be added 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.389
 given that ratio one to one 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.049
 means one kilo of sugar in one liter 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.049
 pour juice 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:36.020
 Smells good as everything has to be strong for 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.000
 boil for four minutes and then 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.870
 possibly over hours slowly 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.870
 continue to simmer 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.150
 It has been cooking for almost two hours with us 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.950
 until the consistency was slightly fluid 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:57.830
 and the color amber-like 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:59.870
 the liquid shines in hot 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.760
 clean glasses filled to screwed and 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.760
 put on the lid for ten minutes 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.360
 because the glasses are really hot 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.450
 you should be here 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.740
 adult help 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.600
 Now you just have to decide if 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.490
 you eat the delicious honey yourself 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:21.080
 would like or to a dear person 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.580
 Incidentally, I wanted to give away from june 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.860
 the dandelion pulls with his 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.870
 blossom back to that point 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.860
 you your finished readers in the 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.860
 standing on the shelf
