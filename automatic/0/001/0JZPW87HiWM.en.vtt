00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.580
 and taking advantage of the confusion between both 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.520
 families 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.720
 romeo and julieta manage to sneak away and 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.060
 run away 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.360
 to take refuge in the coma 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:15.620
 but suddenly they are friars 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:19.160

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:23.200

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.729
 but the feet 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:55.189
 final scene is the hundred believing that 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.449
 she has died and she will give herself a 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:05:00.100
 stabbing to know that he died 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.190
 LOL 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.370
