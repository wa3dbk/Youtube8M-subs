we've<00:00:46.220> had<00:00:46.340> a<00:00:46.370> lot<00:00:46.640> of<00:00:46.670> requests<00:00:47.090> for<00:00:47.239> smaller

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
we've had a lot of requests for smaller

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.030 
we've had a lot of requests for smaller
sweat<00:00:48.050> because<00:00:48.379> a<00:00:48.410> lot<00:00:48.590> of<00:00:48.620> guys<00:00:48.830> are

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
sweat because a lot of guys are

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.710 
sweat because a lot of guys are
downsizing<00:00:49.550> even<00:00:49.879> on<00:00:50.000> their<00:00:50.120> umbrella<00:00:50.450> rigs

downsizing even on their umbrella rigs

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.910 
downsizing even on their umbrella rigs
they're<00:00:50.870> trying<00:00:51.110> to<00:00:51.140> downsize<00:00:51.379> and<00:00:51.770> put<00:00:51.890> a

they're trying to downsize and put a

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.979 
they're trying to downsize and put a
smaller<00:00:52.220> minnow<00:00:52.489> on<00:00:52.580> the<00:00:53.210> problem<00:00:53.629> with<00:00:53.780> the

smaller minnow on the problem with the

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.540 
smaller minnow on the problem with the
smaller<00:00:54.350> bait<00:00:54.680> shows<00:00:54.920> when<00:00:55.129> they<00:00:55.250> start

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
smaller bait shows when they start

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.830 
smaller bait shows when they start
making<00:00:55.670> them<00:00:55.910> that<00:00:56.090> small<00:00:56.420> out<00:00:56.570> of<00:00:56.690> regular

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
making them that small out of regular

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.390 
making them that small out of regular
soft<00:00:57.260> plastic<00:00:57.620> they<00:00:57.710> don't<00:00:57.890> move<00:00:58.010> very<00:00:58.309> well

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
soft plastic they don't move very well

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.160 
soft plastic they don't move very well
because<00:00:59.120> they<00:00:59.239> can't<00:00:59.449> really<00:00:59.660> make<00:00:59.780> them<00:00:59.960> thin

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
because they can't really make them thin

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.380 
because they can't really make them thin
enough<00:01:00.410> to<00:01:00.500> get<00:01:00.620> any<00:01:00.739> action<00:01:00.980> out<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:02.239> last

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
enough to get any action out the last

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.990 
enough to get any action out the last
acting<00:01:02.989> so<00:01:03.680> flexible<00:01:04.220> we<00:01:04.339> can<00:01:04.369> make<00:01:04.640> ours<00:01:04.880> a

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
acting so flexible we can make ours a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.310 
acting so flexible we can make ours a
little<00:01:05.030> bit<00:01:05.330> softer<00:01:05.810> than<00:01:05.899> what<00:01:05.990> anybody<00:01:06.170> else

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
little bit softer than what anybody else

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.200 
little bit softer than what anybody else
can<00:01:06.740> is<00:01:07.310> we<00:01:07.460> know<00:01:07.580> it's<00:01:07.729> not<00:01:07.850> going<00:01:08.000> to<00:01:08.090> fall

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
can is we know it's not going to fall

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.450 
can is we know it's not going to fall
apart<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:08.869> that<00:01:09.590> gives<00:01:09.740> us<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.009> ability<00:01:10.040> to

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
apart so that gives us the ability to

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.920 
apart so that gives us the ability to
make<00:01:10.610> a<00:01:10.640> softer<00:01:11.240> bait<00:01:11.420> with<00:01:11.540> a<00:01:11.630> lot<00:01:11.780> more

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
make a softer bait with a lot more

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.660 
make a softer bait with a lot more
action<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:12.410> what<00:01:12.590> we<00:01:12.710> did<00:01:12.890> on<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.130> slim<00:01:13.340> swims

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
action and what we did on the slim swims

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.359 
action and what we did on the slim swims
is<00:01:14.240> we<00:01:14.420> added<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.840> tail<00:01:15.619> we<00:01:15.860> actually<00:01:16.130> change

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
is we added a tail we actually change

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.280 
is we added a tail we actually change
its<00:01:16.520> shape<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:17.180> it's<00:01:17.300> actually<00:01:19.930> grabs<00:01:20.930> water

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
its shape so it's actually grabs water

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.870 
its shape so it's actually grabs water
better<00:01:21.530> so<00:01:21.830> that<00:01:21.950> it<00:01:21.979> doesn't<00:01:22.399> take<00:01:22.490> a<00:01:22.520> lot<00:01:22.820> of

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
better so that it doesn't take a lot of

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.249 
better so that it doesn't take a lot of
action<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:23.330> get<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.600> tail<00:01:23.780> moving<00:01:24.110> in<00:01:24.200> the

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
action to get the tail moving in the

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:25.900 
action to get the tail moving in the
water<00:01:24.410> so<00:01:25.280> whether<00:01:25.430> you're<00:01:25.580> going<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.759> throw

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
water so whether you're going to throw

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.370 
water so whether you're going to throw
it<00:01:26.000> on<00:01:26.060> an<00:01:26.180> umbrella<00:01:26.420> rig<00:01:26.690> or<00:01:26.840> it's<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.080> crappie

lure or anything you're gonna get a lot

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.240 
lure or anything you're gonna get a lot
of<00:01:29.420> action<00:01:29.630> even<00:01:29.990> on<00:01:30.170> a<00:01:30.200> really<00:01:30.560> slow<00:01:30.800> retrieve

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
of action even on a really slow retrieve

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.920 
of action even on a really slow retrieve
I<00:01:31.610> have<00:01:31.910> one<00:01:32.090> set<00:01:32.360> up<00:01:32.479> right<00:01:32.690> here

20-inch largemouth it's a universal bait
it's<00:02:12.480> one<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.690> those<00:02:12.750> things<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.110> whether
