this spread out now now let's tie in our
body<00:02:37.630> now<00:02:38.630> I<00:02:38.870> recommend<00:02:39.560> it<00:02:39.790> this<00:02:40.790> Arizona

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
body now I recommend it this Arizona

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.790 
body now I recommend it this Arizona
diamond<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:43.910> it's<00:02:44.170> it's<00:02:45.170> really<00:02:45.470> good

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
diamond is that it's it's really good

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.650 
diamond is that it's it's really good
stuff<00:02:45.920> for<00:02:46.070> creating<00:02:46.550> these<00:02:46.640> bodies<00:02:47.060> but<00:02:47.480> you

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
stuff for creating these bodies but you

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.750 
stuff for creating these bodies but you
don't<00:02:47.870> just<00:02:48.080> tie<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:48.350> on<00:02:48.650> like<00:02:49.040> this<00:02:49.220> I<00:02:49.430> suppose

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
don't just tie it on like this I suppose

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.090 
don't just tie it on like this I suppose
you<00:02:49.880> could<00:02:50.120> but<00:02:50.750> i<00:02:50.959> find<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.709> doesn't<00:02:51.980> give

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
you could but i find it doesn't give

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.490 
you could but i find it doesn't give
quite<00:02:52.280> enough<00:02:52.520> sparkle<00:02:52.940> business<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:54.170> what<00:02:54.380> we

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
quite enough sparkle business so what we

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.290 
quite enough sparkle business so what we
do<00:02:54.620> instead<00:02:54.800> is<00:02:55.010> we<00:02:55.160> take<00:02:55.430> about<00:02:55.700> an<00:02:55.850> inch<00:02:56.090> of

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
do instead is we take about an inch of

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.250 
do instead is we take about an inch of
the<00:02:56.390> Arizona<00:02:56.810> diamond<00:02:57.200> ring<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:59.540> half<00:02:59.690> and

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
the Arizona diamond ring and a half and

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.390 
the Arizona diamond ring and a half and
then<00:03:00.320> we're<00:03:00.470> going<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.680> cut<00:03:00.890> this<00:03:01.130> into

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
then we're going to cut this into

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.790 
then we're going to cut this into
sixteenth<00:03:01.970> inch<00:03:02.180> long<00:03:02.510> pieces<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.440> leave<00:03:03.620> it

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
sixteenth inch long pieces and leave it

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.199 
sixteenth inch long pieces and leave it
in<00:03:03.920> your<00:03:03.950> little<00:03:04.190> dish<00:03:04.430> that<00:03:04.670> you've<00:03:04.790> got<00:03:05.000> or

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
in your little dish that you've got or

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.120 
in your little dish that you've got or
whatever<00:03:05.450> you've<00:03:05.600> got<00:03:05.630> there<00:03:06.140> so<00:03:06.920> that<00:03:06.950> we're

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
whatever you've got there so that we're

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.800 
whatever you've got there so that we're
just<00:03:07.220> going<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.430> cut<00:03:07.640> this<00:03:07.820> into<00:03:08.030> very<00:03:08.720> fine

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
just going to cut this into very fine

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.900 
just going to cut this into very fine
little<00:03:09.290> pieces<00:03:09.530> because<00:03:10.430> we're<00:03:10.550> going<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:10.730> dub

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
little pieces because we're going to dub

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:20.510 
little pieces because we're going to dub
it<00:03:12.280> back<00:03:13.280> on<00:03:13.520> again

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.830 

this<00:03:21.520> is<00:03:21.640> a<00:03:21.670> cooking<00:03:22.030> show<00:03:22.060> I've<00:03:22.420> already<00:03:22.630> had

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
this is a cooking show I've already had

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.699 
this is a cooking show I've already had
this<00:03:23.050> done<00:03:23.730> mmm<00:03:24.959> so<00:03:25.959> that<00:03:26.110> you<00:03:26.200> just<00:03:26.349> reach<00:03:26.530> in

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
this done mmm so that you just reach in

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.540 
this done mmm so that you just reach in
the<00:03:26.800> oven<00:03:27.099> to<00:03:27.160> take<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.489> out

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:44.410 

so<00:03:33.210> you<00:03:33.270> will<00:03:33.570> likely<00:03:33.870> need<00:03:34.260> wax

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.670 

okay<00:03:46.450> you<00:03:47.450> only<00:03:47.599> end<00:03:47.810> up<00:03:48.050> with<00:03:48.230> a<00:03:48.260> little<00:03:48.530> bit

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
okay you only end up with a little bit

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.740 
okay you only end up with a little bit
you<00:03:49.430> really<00:03:49.730> don't<00:03:49.940> need<00:03:50.090> any<00:03:50.300> more<00:03:50.540> than<00:03:50.720> that

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
you really don't need any more than that

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.100 
you really don't need any more than that
I<00:03:51.140> find<00:03:52.130> it<00:03:52.280> easier<00:03:52.640> to<00:03:52.700> dub<00:03:53.000> this<00:03:53.209> using<00:03:54.050> a

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
I find it easier to dub this using a

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.559 
I find it easier to dub this using a
dubbing<00:03:54.380> loop<00:03:54.620> as<00:03:54.770> opposed<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.520> trying<00:03:56.420> to

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
dubbing loop as opposed to trying to

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.690 
dubbing loop as opposed to trying to
twist<00:03:56.780> it<00:03:56.930> on<00:03:57.080> because<00:03:57.290> it's<00:03:57.470> a<00:03:57.680> it's<00:03:58.280> kind<00:03:58.640> of

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
twist it on because it's a it's kind of

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.350 
twist it on because it's a it's kind of
like<00:03:59.170> fine<00:04:00.170> wire<00:04:00.640> find<00:04:01.640> you<00:04:01.760> Sparkle<00:04:02.180> stuff

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
like fine wire find you Sparkle stuff

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.460 
like fine wire find you Sparkle stuff
it's<00:04:02.540> very<00:04:02.750> coarse<00:04:03.580> it<00:04:04.580> it<00:04:05.209> will<00:04:05.390> stick<00:04:05.690> to<00:04:05.720> wax

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
it's very coarse it it will stick to wax

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.790 
it's very coarse it it will stick to wax
but<00:04:06.800> when<00:04:07.280> you<00:04:07.370> try<00:04:07.610> to<00:04:07.720> turn<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.780> on<00:04:08.989> you<00:04:09.709> know

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
but when you try to turn it on you know

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.009 
but when you try to turn it on you know
sometimes<00:04:10.090> just<00:04:11.090> keep<00:04:11.269> spinning<00:04:11.660> off<00:04:11.840> and

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
sometimes just keep spinning off and

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.050 
sometimes just keep spinning off and
you'll<00:04:12.140> get<00:04:12.290> a<00:04:12.350> great<00:04:12.500> big<00:04:12.650> body<00:04:12.970> we're<00:04:13.970> going

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
you'll get a great big body we're going

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.460 
you'll get a great big body we're going
to<00:04:14.120> trim<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.420> body<00:04:14.630> down<00:04:14.810> anyway<00:04:15.170> when<00:04:15.319> we're

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
to trim the body down anyway when we're

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.099 
to trim the body down anyway when we're
done<00:04:15.590> in<00:04:15.769> a<00:04:15.860> second<00:04:16.190> so<00:04:16.790> we'll<00:04:17.570> make<00:04:17.720> it<00:04:17.840> double

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
done in a second so we'll make it double

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.310 
done in a second so we'll make it double
oh<00:04:20.799> and<00:04:22.300> then<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.330> can<00:04:23.600> run<00:04:23.750> go<00:04:23.960> ahead<00:04:23.990> and<00:04:24.200> run

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
oh and then you can run go ahead and run

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.909 
oh and then you can run go ahead and run
your<00:04:24.440> thread<00:04:24.710> up<00:04:24.919> to<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.220> eye<00:04:25.300> and<00:04:26.680> if<00:04:27.680> you

can put your half hitch into it for a
couple<00:04:33.680> mins<00:04:34.130> it<00:04:34.280> stays<00:04:35.139> and<00:04:38.169> then<00:04:39.169> I<00:04:39.200> like<00:04:39.470> to
