00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
the moment we're rank em it looks like

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.080 
the moment we're rank em it looks like
an<00:00:39.989> N<00:00:40.170> interrupt<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.680> me<00:00:40.829> but<00:00:41.399> as<00:00:41.550> an<00:00:41.730> M<00:00:41.910> and

from<00:00:46.219> ranking<00:00:47.219> up<00:00:47.340> let's<00:00:47.610> see<00:00:47.850> how<00:00:48.690> much<00:00:48.809> we

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
from ranking up let's see how much we

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.790 
from ranking up let's see how much we
need<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.829> need<00:00:50.149> 75<00:00:51.149> bill<00:00:51.539> which<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.110> quite<00:00:52.739> a

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
need we need 75 bill which is quite a

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.180 
need we need 75 bill which is quite a
lot<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.460> fill<00:00:53.789> up<00:00:54.030> now<00:00:54.270> I'm<00:00:54.510> not<00:00:54.719> too<00:00:54.780> sure

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
lot is that fill up now I'm not too sure

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.979 
lot is that fill up now I'm not too sure
but<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.550> think<00:00:56.579> we're<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> quarter<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
but I think we're like a quarter of the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.439 
but I think we're like a quarter of the
way<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.590> rank<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.949> up<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.789> we<00:00:59.850> are<00:00:59.940> quite<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.210> ways

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
way to rank it up so we are quite a ways

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.680

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.189 
much do we need to rank up though
because<00:04:30.080> I<00:04:30.530> probably<00:04:31.400> got<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:31.669> lot<00:04:31.880> two<00:04:32.750> hundred

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199
