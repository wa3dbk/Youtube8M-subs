00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:02.880
 is reading them 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.799
 Theme Euro financial crisis this year as well 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.079
 most urgent appeared 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:12.819
 a very important one is found 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:15.179
 Gallen 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.179
 as one of the most urgent 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.619
 will we get mixed crisis of the United States of America 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.619
 turn at least as well 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.749
 you still have a d-mark at home 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:30.650
 understand the longing 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.940
 the German 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.180
 After de Maizière I can understand it is unjustified 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.730
 because if we followed the d-mark 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.730
 then the d-mark would be due to speculation 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.990
 the 30 000th 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.070
 Securities currency traders in the world 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.690
 Here, the market upgraded had evaluated evaluated 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.630
 that is our export 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.880
 would be essential 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.650
 collapsed 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.900
 and maybe hundreds of thousands, maybe 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.900
 lost more than a million jobs 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.090
 that does not make the ordinary citizen clear the euro they said 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.479
 Percent in this situation have been good for Germany 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.479
 therefore allow us a little review 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.800
 m on the start of the common currency one in DD 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.800
 1978 by a Frenchman 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.080
 and a German has been launched Valerie there was under it 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.690
 Make up for it 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.660
 the German-French togetherness within the new leadership 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.470
 Helmut Schmidt and Giscard Esther like to play 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.320
 Although not made for cracker but here and there for detuning the fulfillment 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.450
 "Plan of the French president went this with Helmut 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.390
 Schmidt pre-discussed the two at the last Council meeting in Copenhagen 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.420
 had the plan of their own European monetary system 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.070
 Helmut Schmidt defends the possible costs of a monetary union when it comes from 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.119
 Speaking of a price we need to be fit again that may be so 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.319
 that we make sacrifices here and there and there 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.629
 only one will recognize later that was not a victim at all and that it was 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.389
 been predicted for an economic success of the 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:16.569
 German wave 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.149
 will benefit greatly 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:20.219
 you are 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.119
 with debt to Euro 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:25.459
 in a nutshell, blamed for the unrest in Europe 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.489
 You could say that 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.919
 but it is not correct 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:36.439
 because what we did back then was the production of a European one 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.919
 monetary system 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.959
 while maintaining the 4 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.289
 and maintaining the topic 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.189
 what we have today 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:50.239
 has the question off and abolished the d-mark we have back then 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.789
 not wanted 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:53.549
 Indeed 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.189
 I have it in principle 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.449
 not disapproved 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:01.449
 as the 1991 92nd 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.999
 has been decided 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:07.379
 But you also have to add that at that time 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.929
 today almost 20 years ago 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:13.019
 some bad mistakes have been made 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.019
 for example 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.119
 you have rightly seen 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:22.159
 that the common currency demands 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.159
 reasonably common state 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.009
 for sky politics debt policy 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:31.729
 for that one has so-called 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.210
 stability and growth pact 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.429
 closed 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:40.779
 but that has never been ratified, it is not a legally binding representative 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:42.039
 Unfortunately 

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:45.129
 and the worst thing is 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.860
 the Germans and the French were the first to break this treaty 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.599
 much sooner than you 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.599
 but not in the same amount if you compare that 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:56.389
 it was a 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.040
 smaller offense it would all be very clear offense 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.330
 under the 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.989
 Trouble does not matter 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.539
 if the two most important states in Europe have to break the pact 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:09.590
 you wonder 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.979
 if some small ones 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:14.979
 Even the Lebanon off the same clock must not be surprised 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.159
 they said 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:22.449
 And this month now si has the idea of ​​the common currency 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.249
 my full support 

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:26.499
 We wonder 

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:31.240
 but when does she no longer have her full support, for example Dan? 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.320
 if you go to 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.820
 Greece and maybe Arndt, maybe Spain too 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.400
 Portugal 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.400
 or to save Italy 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.539
 Aachen 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:46.879
 he also has 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:48.280
 tomorrow and the day after tomorrow 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.509
 my support 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:52.659
 because 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:55.210
 the European central bank 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.210
 led by a frenchman jean-claude trichet 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.930
 her thing so far 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.199
 flawless 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.180
 has made 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.169
 Naturally 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.719
 Must-have man like Greece and others have helped the country 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.029
 Error the 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.949
 like in Berlin 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:17.289
 was to be at night 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.469
 To say Monets we do not want to help 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:23.379
 our good money will not give it anymore 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:26.830
 that the Greeks retire earlier than we German 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.520
 that was wrong 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.379
 and percent 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:33.550
 for the future 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.620
 we will 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.529
 much more help 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:37.270
 have to 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.879
 as before yes 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:41.879
 you just have to imagine how it should go 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:44.130
 were reversed 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.590
 a country like Greece reintroduces its own currency 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.590
 or Germany 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.499
 here is this currency there 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:56.830
 the speculation 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.999
 in Lambarene and in New York 

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:01.720
 that this new currency 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.719
 is devalued to the basement 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:06.339
 or the other way around 

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:09.789
 the newly emerging German market was 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:12.789
 that will be upgraded to heaven 

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:16.080
 and from our export always shots 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.550
 Love nothing on the contrary 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.240
 At the same time, we would be doing away with the loss of exports 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:30.819
 of hundreds of thousands, perhaps more than a million jobs are experiencing this 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:31.599
 called 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:34.580
 if you think a little bit further 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.559
 Euro washes end and he puts through national currency 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.460
 then we'll do that »with a chaotic state
