reinforces<00:02:24.200> simple<00:02:25.099> math<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:26.480> that's<00:02:26.659> what<00:02:26.840> I

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
reinforces simple math and that's what I

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.780 
reinforces simple math and that's what I
like<00:02:27.079> it<00:02:27.260> for<00:02:27.469> it's<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.859> little<00:02:28.250> bit<00:02:28.370> too<00:02:28.609> much

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
like it for it's a little bit too much

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.580 
like it for it's a little bit too much
for

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
for

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.729 
for
a<00:02:29.650> six-year-old<00:02:30.489> yet<00:02:30.970> but<00:02:31.870> my<00:02:32.170> wife<00:02:32.349> and<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:32.680> do

a six-year-old yet but my wife and I do

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.850 
a six-year-old yet but my wife and I do
use<00:02:33.160> it<00:02:33.370> in<00:02:33.720> her<00:02:34.720> family<00:02:35.230> board<00:02:35.440> game<00:02:35.650> night

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
use it in her family board game night

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.190 
use it in her family board game night
and<00:02:36.099> some<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.120> stuff<00:02:37.360> that<00:02:37.390> she<00:02:37.599> does<00:02:38.019> with

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
and some of the stuff that she does with

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.690 
and some of the stuff that she does with
family<00:02:38.530> board<00:02:38.769> game<00:02:38.950> night<00:02:39.129> at<00:02:39.280> schools

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
family board game night at schools

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.520 
family board game night at schools
they're<00:02:40.450> always<00:02:40.569> looking<00:02:40.810> for<00:02:41.170> something

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
they're always looking for something

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.570 
they're always looking for something
that's<00:02:41.739> either<00:02:42.120> math<00:02:43.120> or<00:02:43.150> literacy<00:02:44.580> related

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
that's either math or literacy related

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.160 
that's either math or literacy related
and<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:45.940> fits<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.330> bill<00:02:46.450> perfectly

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
and this fits the bill perfectly

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.470 
and this fits the bill perfectly
so<00:02:47.709> on<00:02:47.799> my<00:02:47.980> turn<00:02:48.190> I've<00:02:48.370> got<00:02:48.549> three<00:02:48.849> cards<00:02:49.150> I

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
so on my turn I've got three cards I

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.850 
so on my turn I've got three cards I
simply<00:02:50.230> play<00:02:50.650> in<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:51.280> five<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.360> redraw

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
simply play in the five and I redraw

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.990 
simply play in the five and I redraw
someone<00:02:53.860> else<00:02:54.010> would<00:02:54.190> playing<00:02:54.610> on<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.849> other

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
someone else would playing on the other

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.630 
someone else would playing on the other
side<00:02:55.330> moving<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.989> total<00:02:56.349> up<00:02:56.560> let's<00:02:57.220> just<00:02:57.459> say

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
side moving the total up let's just say

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.940 
side moving the total up let's just say
they<00:02:57.819> played<00:02:58.090> in<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.299> six<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:58.989> now<00:02:59.560> we've<00:02:59.739> got

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
they played in the six and now we've got

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.839 
they played in the six and now we've got
11<00:03:00.599> at<00:03:01.599> any<00:03:01.810> point<00:03:02.170> in<00:03:02.290> time<00:03:02.319> you<00:03:03.220> can<00:03:03.250> jump<00:03:03.700> it

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
11 at any point in time you can jump it

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.770 
11 at any point in time you can jump it
all<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.150> way<00:03:04.269> up<00:03:04.299> to<00:03:04.810> 99<00:03:05.440> if<00:03:05.769> you<00:03:06.340> go<00:03:06.549> over<00:03:07.090> 99

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
all the way up to 99 if you go over 99

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.440 
all the way up to 99 if you go over 99
in<00:03:08.170> other<00:03:08.319> words<00:03:08.500> if<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.829> take<00:03:08.860> it<00:03:09.310> over<00:03:09.489> if<00:03:10.180> all

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
in other words if I take it over if all

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.800 
in other words if I take it over if all
I<00:03:10.480> had<00:03:10.630> let's<00:03:11.500> just<00:03:11.769> say<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:12.340> had<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.060> 8<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:13.690> a

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
I had let's just say I had a 8 and a

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.479 
I had let's just say I had a 8 and a
bunch<00:03:13.989> of<00:03:14.079> other<00:03:14.200> numbered<00:03:14.590> cards<00:03:15.040> and<00:03:15.310> I

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
bunch of other numbered cards and I

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.000 
bunch of other numbered cards and I
didn't<00:03:15.790> have<00:03:15.910> any<00:03:16.060> way<00:03:16.299> to<00:03:16.780> bring<00:03:17.319> it<00:03:17.440> down<00:03:17.680> I

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
didn't have any way to bring it down I

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.949 
didn't have any way to bring it down I
would<00:03:18.519> have<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.849> play<00:03:19.030> it<00:03:19.239> and<00:03:19.390> I<00:03:19.540> would<00:03:19.690> lose

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
would have to play it and I would lose

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.830 
would have to play it and I would lose
one<00:03:20.319> of<00:03:20.349> my<00:03:20.470> chips<00:03:21.060> but<00:03:22.060> what<00:03:22.269> you're<00:03:22.450> hoping

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
one of my chips but what you're hoping

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.920 
one of my chips but what you're hoping
to<00:03:22.900> do<00:03:23.230> is<00:03:23.530> have<00:03:24.310> any<00:03:24.670> one<00:03:25.060> of<00:03:25.090> these<00:03:25.390> numbered

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
to do is have any one of these numbered

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.319 
to do is have any one of these numbered
are<00:03:26.319> these<00:03:26.980> types<00:03:27.280> of<00:03:27.489> cards<00:03:27.940> that<00:03:28.120> are<00:03:28.209> going

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
are these types of cards that are going

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.630 
are these types of cards that are going
to<00:03:28.390> break<00:03:28.599> the<00:03:28.780> rules<00:03:28.989> so<00:03:29.829> I<00:03:29.860> could<00:03:30.280> play<00:03:30.459> the

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
to break the rules so I could play the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.759 
to break the rules so I could play the
99<00:03:31.150> right<00:03:31.480> back<00:03:31.720> on<00:03:31.959> them<00:03:32.110> keep<00:03:32.319> it<00:03:32.470> right<00:03:32.590> at

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
99 right back on them keep it right at

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.009 
99 right back on them keep it right at
99<00:03:33.280> stays<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.660> same

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
99 stays the same

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.640 
99 stays the same
same<00:03:35.769> deal<00:03:36.450> reverse<00:03:37.450> direction<00:03:37.780> send<00:03:38.560> it

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
same deal reverse direction send it

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.229 
same deal reverse direction send it
right<00:03:38.980> back<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:39.609> person<00:03:39.940> that<00:03:40.090> just

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
right back to the person that just

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.160 
right back to the person that just
popped<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:40.720> up<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.959> 99<00:03:41.910> subtract<00:03:42.910> 10<00:03:43.359> and<00:03:43.690> the

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
popped it up to 99 subtract 10 and the

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.640 
popped it up to 99 subtract 10 and the
numbered<00:03:44.500> cards<00:03:44.950> range<00:03:45.280> from<00:03:46.180> 2<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.959> 10<00:03:47.290> I

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
numbered cards range from 2 to 10 I

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.089 
numbered cards range from 2 to 10 I
believe<00:03:48.160> I<00:03:48.489> think<00:03:48.730> I'm<00:03:48.970> right<00:03:49.120> on<00:03:49.299> that<00:03:49.920> so<00:03:50.920> the

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
believe I think I'm right on that so the

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.370 
believe I think I'm right on that so the
math<00:03:51.280> is<00:03:51.519> simple<00:03:51.760> nice<00:03:52.569> little<00:03:52.870> addition<00:03:53.079> as

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
math is simple nice little addition as

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.800 
math is simple nice little addition as
it<00:03:53.500> builds<00:03:53.769> up<00:03:54.130> you<00:03:54.819> can<00:03:55.000> jump<00:03:55.269> start<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:55.690> all

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
it builds up you can jump start it all

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.870 
it builds up you can jump start it all
the<00:03:55.900> way<00:03:55.989> to<00:03:56.019> 99<00:03:56.650> but<00:03:56.980> you<00:03:57.099> better<00:03:57.370> be<00:03:57.639> ready

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
the way to 99 but you better be ready

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.210 
the way to 99 but you better be ready
for<00:03:58.060> somebody<00:03:58.780> a<00:03:58.810> layer<00:03:58.989> reverse<00:03:59.440> direction

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
for somebody a layer reverse direction

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.539 
for somebody a layer reverse direction
on<00:04:00.639> you<00:04:01.049> and<00:04:02.049> you<00:04:02.590> you<00:04:02.980> know<00:04:03.099> hope<00:04:03.310> you<00:04:03.430> have

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
on you and you you know hope you have

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.099 
on you and you you know hope you have
something<00:04:03.790> like<00:04:03.880> a<00:04:04.030> subtract<00:04:04.480> 10<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:04.989> then

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
something like a subtract 10 and then

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.949 
something like a subtract 10 and then
send<00:04:05.319> it<00:04:05.380> on<00:04:05.500> down<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.739> line<00:04:06.040> plays<00:04:06.940> very<00:04:07.540> fast

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
send it on down the line plays very fast

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.330 
send it on down the line plays very fast
very<00:04:08.440> simple<00:04:09.370> very<00:04:09.849> easy<00:04:09.910> to<00:04:10.299> teach<00:04:10.569> and

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
very simple very easy to teach and

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.370 
very simple very easy to teach and
definitely<00:04:12.340> educational<00:04:13.120> for<00:04:13.630> the<00:04:13.720> younger

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
definitely educational for the younger

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:22.020 
definitely educational for the younger
kids<00:04:14.560> so<00:04:15.570> 99<00:04:16.570> will<00:04:17.109> bust<00:04:18.299> all<00:04:19.299> right<00:04:19.539> 90<00:04:20.880> 99<00:04:21.880> or

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
kids so 99 will bust all right 90 99 or

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.529
