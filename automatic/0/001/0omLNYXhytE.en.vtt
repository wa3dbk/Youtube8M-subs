just find that these grind up a little
bit<00:00:59.340> better<00:00:59.489> because<00:00:59.940> they're<00:01:00.120> softer<00:01:00.570> but<00:01:01.199> if

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
bit better because they're softer but if

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.619 
bit better because they're softer but if
you<00:01:01.649> grind<00:01:01.980> them<00:01:02.129> up<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.430> stuff<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:03.300> fine

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629
