00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.360
 for clients we are here with a powerful one and the future has to go 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:07.359
 electoral we begin already 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.090
 the last times are putting the sea of ​​interesting in regards 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.079
 to the future of file sharing by p2p 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.260
 since I was a kid I felt that general freedom of printing 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.289
 We can start 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.190
 when the French assembly does not 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.329
 asked the hadopi law this the French president's attempt to regulate 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.280
 the downloads through the internet that allowed to suspend the connection 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.229
 to the users that after two warnings 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.440
 continued to download files without paying royalties 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.610
 the law that was already approved because not all the senators of the 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.689
 sarkozy match 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:09.410
 and the opposition voted against 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.940
 clear that as a good politician he managed to re-present the law 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.990
 to approve 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.750
 keep it up 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.940
 which shows that those of the laws and governments is pure joke 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.760
 the worst thing is that the european parliament has remembered its telecom package that 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.070
 included the need 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.300
 of a court order to interrupt the Internet connection giving free access 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.820
 the works of replacement to any government to take forward a law 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.390
 Similary 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.360
 however when we were one step away from the creation of the police 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.039
 internet more like eliana the european parliament 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.600
 has put all this project on hold 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.560
 which implies that it goes into quarantine until September 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.130
 when it will be revised and modified 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.890
 Maybe the mobilizations that have taken place had something to do 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.340
 against the restrictions on the rights and fundamental freedoms of 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.730
 Internet users 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.160
 and to the dam fact these were managed 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.100
 competent authorities 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.440
 the most obvious effect of bad times for the web we have it 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.739
 just looking at Sweden where a similar law was passed 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.009
 and already the first month of life saw how it was reduced to internet traffic in the 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:15.209
 country by 33% 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.969
 this is referred to the sentence of the pirate case and surprisingly to the 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:23.930
 sentenced to the known attack to a fine and two commas 7 million euros and although 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.510
 years of jail curiously before making his official statement the decision 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.099
 it leaked through the internet as if it were a pirated movie 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.480
 ironic truth the three members of pirate and who have appealed the sentence 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.499
 they have assured that they will continue fighting and that they will not pay the fine 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:41.580
 but the best was yet to come 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.670
 when it was discovered that the judge belonged adidas associations of 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.980
 specifically copyright defense of the Swedish association 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.520
 for that ugly copyright and the Swedish association for protection 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.400
 industrial legal that boss and let's go 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.899
 that as a judge and part to the leaves a lot to be desired 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:00.540
 only for that reason could it be considered a null judgment 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.900
 and the defense apc the repetition of the trial 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.230
 based on this discovery that yes during the trial the pirate party have 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.870
 grown 20% and has become the third political force in the country 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.379
 what would happen if I achieved a seat and another question for reflection 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.799
 is that we are in favor of piracy or against the taking away of our 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:21.769
 liberties 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.999
 but the thing does not end here because in Spain we have our own 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:27.500
 punishment with the new minister of culture 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.049
 angels gonzález-sinde 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.280
 a person whose curriculum vitae accumulates management positions 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:35.760
 related to the boyfriend of the sgae and is full unfortunate 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.919
 statements about enter I got your possible supervision the association of 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:43.659
 netizens not only to kick a campaign against it but it has 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.909
 convened a demonstration for next May 24 in Madrid in front of the 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:49.159
 culture Ministry 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:50.370
 to claim 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.950
 civil rights the universality and while gas of the network 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:57.779
 but is that for the internet has been raised against the minister the twiter 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.950
 cinema that since it got more than a thousand followers in a few days 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.300
 the facebook group will tell me that it has already more than 30 thousand 400 members and 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.180
 of course multiple blogs 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.520
 They have made clear the danger that represents a person who confuses 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.869
 lodges with megas and that pretends to condemn internet 

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:16.239
 be at the head of the culture ministry 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.829
 Of course, this has not been the only thing we have suffered 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.600
 just in holy week when people get blind of rates while ben hur 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.030
 the news leaps on all the news of a judgment against the 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.539
 Web 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.499
 psp info that hides nothing to pay 4 thousand 900 euros for helping the distribution 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:35.059
 of copyrighted content what will forget band and we will 

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:39.360
 reveals the brilliant David Bravo is that that news happened almost half a year before and 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.800
 it became news, what a coincidence 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.110
 josé martínez 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.960
 fishing there was no condemnatory sentence because both parties 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.719
 they reached a prior agreement 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:51.610
 the owner of infoca stick has 22 years old the creature was declared 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.159
 guilty for fear and to avoid greater evils as civil trial even when 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:58.709
 he knew that he had never before been condemned to a page in Spain 

00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:00.669
 remove this type of content 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.300
 said clearly I would not want to put it bent as a victory for the 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.039
 copyright and what has been is point of manipulation tinker 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.919
 to balance that tension and to prove that we are super bowls we had 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.970
 the madrid actinver cali the father of the water that was going to celebrate his 20 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:17.919
 anniversary 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.979
 the one of the water announced clear 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.280
 as expected, he made it clear that the strike and that only the tip of the iceberg 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:27.289
 come new, much more powerful technologies that will allow us to do 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.650
 things that we would have never imagined the best is yet to come sir vernet 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.800
 we would like it to be like this but with this panorama of censorship 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.650
 I do not know if we're going to get very far 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.570
 talking about censorship the popular news promotion site menaame me 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.229
 attend to its foundations when it is usual that they revolted 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.620
 against the arbitrary exclusion of certain members by the 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.969
 small managers 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:53.419
 without going into many details what happened is that this year caused that 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.329
 the news about the irregular performance of miami were voted 

00:05:57.329 --> 00:06:00.780
 massively in their own menéame they come to monopolize the whole cover 

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:05.770
 finally the maelstrom grew so much that they could not pay and that happened to him 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.669
 giving them a good lesson in humility of the official minerals we hope that 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:13.470
 the afternoon, think about me and your particular band and whoever can change something 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.650
 panorama of this type of webs 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.590
 we said goodbye as always with a little humor remembering that thieves and 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.289
 technology do not get along too well 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:26.279
 this is shown once again the case occurred in New York where a smart 

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:30.289
 friend of the stranger got the bag of a girl who kept jones mazón 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.580
 with google earth and it has activated 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.620
 the system of positioning people through the mobile 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.680
 he was able to give his exact location and therefore the police evening 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.460
 just had to follow the rest of the mobile in google maps and in a few hours 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.719
 was recovered while the individual 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:49.189
 even today he wondered how a country they had met 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:52.399
 and you know that if you want to be up to date with what is happening in the world 

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:53.189
 digital 

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:56.050
 can follow us in prison with the king 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.860
 digital lifestyle 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.290
 alec libertés until the next news
