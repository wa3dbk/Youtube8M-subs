00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
putting it through the crease after I

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.289 
putting it through the crease after I

was looking at this footage it really

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.580 
was looking at this footage it really
didn't<00:01:52.509> make<00:01:52.600> that<00:01:52.750> much<00:01:52.869> of<00:01:53.020> a<00:01:53.079> difference<00:01:53.409> so

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.500 
so the fact that I like this one is like
a<00:05:28.130> pretty<00:05:28.370> big<00:05:28.580> deal<00:05:28.700> and<00:05:31.180> then<00:05:32.180> I'm<00:05:32.270> applying

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
a pretty big deal and then I'm applying

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.620 
a pretty big deal and then I'm applying
this<00:05:32.750> gloss<00:05:33.110> from<00:05:33.320> Sigma<00:05:33.770> as<00:05:33.950> well<00:05:34.250> it<00:05:34.570> kind<00:05:35.570> of

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
this gloss from Sigma as well it kind of

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.150 
this gloss from Sigma as well it kind of
just<00:05:35.810> complimented<00:05:36.320> the<00:05:36.410> eyes<00:05:36.560> perfectly

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
just complimented the eyes perfectly

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.430 
just complimented the eyes perfectly
because<00:05:37.520> it<00:05:37.670> has<00:05:37.850> a<00:05:37.880> very<00:05:38.330> warm<00:05:38.780> orangie<00:05:39.260> base

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
because it has a very warm orangie base

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.380
