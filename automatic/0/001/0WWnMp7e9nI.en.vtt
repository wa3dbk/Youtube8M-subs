the ATV to the other side torsion bar
it's<00:00:48.160> made<00:00:48.370> out<00:00:48.550> of<00:00:48.579> a<00:00:48.790> spring<00:00:49.269> steel<00:00:49.629> so<00:00:50.470> it

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
it's made out of a spring steel so it

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.950 
it's made out of a spring steel so it
acts<00:00:50.830> like<00:00:50.979> a<00:00:51.400> regular<00:00:51.699> coilover<00:00:52.390> spring<00:00:52.690> but

acts like a regular coilover spring but

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.460 
acts like a regular coilover spring but
it's<00:00:53.199> just<00:00:53.680> straight<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.930> very<00:00:56.110> adjustable

AR meeeeee you can move the clamp in on

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.490 
AR meeeeee you can move the clamp in on
the<00:01:14.860> a<00:01:14.890> arm<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:16.240> have<00:01:16.390> a<00:01:16.420> loser<00:01:16.869> set<00:01:17.110> up<00:01:17.259> or<00:01:17.470> out

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.130 
on the a arm to have a tighter set up
this<00:01:21.820> helps<00:01:22.150> a<00:01:22.210> lot<00:01:22.330> when<00:01:22.540> you're<00:01:22.630> tuning<00:01:22.990> your

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
this helps a lot when you're tuning your

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.620 
this helps a lot when you're tuning your
atv<00:01:23.800> because<00:01:24.640> everybody<00:01:25.240> has<00:01:25.360> different

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
atv because everybody has different

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.340 
atv because everybody has different
tires<00:01:26.380> their<00:01:27.100> weights<00:01:27.430> different<00:01:28.000> so<00:01:28.240> you<00:01:29.140> may

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
tires their weights different so you may

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.960 
tires their weights different so you may
get<00:01:29.500> more<00:01:29.740> roll<00:01:30.010> with<00:01:30.280> one<00:01:30.490> rider<00:01:30.700> than

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
get more roll with one rider than

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.600 
get more roll with one rider than
another<00:01:31.210> rider<00:01:31.480> and<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.890> can<00:01:33.220> make<00:01:33.340> all<00:01:33.520> these

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
another rider and you can make all these

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.450 
another rider and you can make all these
adjustments<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.300> fine-tune<00:01:34.810> your<00:01:34.840> setup

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460

another<00:01:36.460> thing<00:01:36.760> that<00:01:36.909> we<00:01:37.000> have<00:01:37.030> available

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.100

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
different torsion bars clubs and bars

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.310 
different torsion bars clubs and bars
look<00:01:47.409> like<00:01:47.590> this<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:49.450> is<00:01:49.510> what<00:01:49.900> actually

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
look like this this is what actually

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.719 
look like this this is what actually
twists<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:50.920> connects<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.310> two<00:01:51.460> sides

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
twists and connects the two sides

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.899 
twists and connects the two sides
together<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.990> thicker<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.530> bar<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:54.190> stiffer

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
together the thicker the bar the stiffer

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.320 
together the thicker the bar the stiffer
the twist<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:56.670> less<00:01:57.670> body<00:01:57.970> roll<00:01:58.210> you

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
the twist and the less body roll you

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.590 
the twist and the less body roll you
have<00:01:59.100> Center<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.250> bar<00:02:01.350> smaller<00:02:02.350> diameter

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
have Center the bar smaller diameter

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.300 
have Center the bar smaller diameter
that'll<00:02:04.600> twist<00:02:04.870> a<00:02:04.960> lot<00:02:05.110> easier<00:02:05.320> and<00:02:05.770> it<00:02:06.220> will

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
that'll twist a lot easier and it will

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.369 
that'll twist a lot easier and it will
have<00:02:06.460> more<00:02:07.240> body<00:02:07.420> roll<00:02:07.720> so<00:02:07.990> you<00:02:08.049> can<00:02:08.229> really

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
have more body roll so you can really

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.949 
have more body roll so you can really
tune<00:02:08.769> for<00:02:09.099> your<00:02:09.250> track<00:02:09.489> your<00:02:09.729> setup<00:02:10.090> what<00:02:10.720> kind

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
tune for your track your setup what kind

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.930 
tune for your track your setup what kind
of<00:02:11.019> writing<00:02:11.260> you're<00:02:11.530> doing<00:02:11.830> so<00:02:12.459> if<00:02:12.549> you<00:02:12.640> wanted

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
to use this bar for TT you could set up

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.190 
to use this bar for TT you could set up
exactly<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:16.090> roll<00:02:16.420> rate<00:02:16.450> you're<00:02:16.780> looking<00:02:17.019> for

exactly the roll rate you're looking for

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.869 
exactly the roll rate you're looking for
