00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.900
 Hi guys, I'm good 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.660
 The makeup today is to leave that I am 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.090
 seeing the famous is not idolized and very 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.830
 dear black eye, I adore 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.420
 makeup I think the makeup that more 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.040
 I use this way to get out because it's very 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.360
 practice and work with any type of 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.700
 clothes ne 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.070
 Anyway, she's really beautiful. 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.170
 I already tutored this photo. 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.750
 see I did the same video 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.450
 makeup the same products and even 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.789
 the eyelashes that is an eyelash of 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.809
 Chinese people are children but it is very good 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.809
 very cute 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.699
 I also used the Pope's shadow skin 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.890
 to Feminice to tracta is that this 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.719
 quartet that is the quartet that I always 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.859
 I would advise anyone who asks to buy 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.649
 because it has brown 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.719
 The pact has black opaque I have beige that 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.890
 to illuminate and has a little gold that is 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.840
 an old gold so it runs to 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.820
 anyone is a joker always gives 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.670
 a little shine I highly recommend 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.950
 good quality shades we bran 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.990
 anyway I use both to do the makeup 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.220
 so black olhão as makeup more 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.030
 basic 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.430
 Come on, let's go to the starting pencil. 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.110
 beige below the eyebrow and I do this 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.610
 to increase my look 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.009
 I do this because it better defines the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.780
 contour of my eyebrow and also 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.369
 because it facilitates the estimate at the time of 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.200
 apply the shade brown linen with when 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.229
 she will meet with beige and will stay 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.770
 more clarinha 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.150
 basically this step is more laborious 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.189
 of makeup 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.049
 you will pass black all around the outline 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.790
 eye both on the mobile eyelid with 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.579
 lower eyelash region and also 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.979
 waterfront is scary because you 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.130
 apply this lapse is very honored 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.020
 get horrible finish is okay 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.340
 really bad even but so do not worry 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.590
 We 're going to train people, we 'll make a 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.430
 lots of things and things will improve me 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.259
 I guarantee 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.299
 so it does not exist I'm sure 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.580
 that a lot of people start to do think 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.119
 It's wrong that it 's not legal and it gave up. 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.489
 halfway is 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.099
 friend does not exist will work 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:20.890
 applying continue to apply continue to 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:22.959
 apply will be all right can 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.030
 to get around everything half porradinha even has 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.799
 to be a lapse but you do not want to 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.959
 sell the fish but what was a black is 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.060
 very soft but has already been giving 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.140
 want to sell more selling black pearl 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.730
 it's great 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.209
 you formally lower lashes 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.290
 with the straight brush and a judge who is 20 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.599
 sigma 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.329
 I'm in the lower region spreading 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.739
 pencil or seeing pencil and also throughout the 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.510
 outline I did there on the 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:51.220
 upper inner corner will finally 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:54.190
 spread all over I was brand new 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.379
 newbie did just that I applied blows 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.099
 across the border and did not rise much was 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:02.230
 so brave spent in lisbon was mine 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.390
 makeup of life 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.470
 Then I evolved but finally continue 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.060
 It is a cool thing and now circumvents 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.659
 brown shadow with the same thing ten 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.670
 cel 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:14.109
 the outline all that black that I did 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.419
 with lactic brown shadow 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.669
 once again the makeup does not need 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:20.560
 be perfect right now because the 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:22.060
 people will graduate but it is important 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.459
 put enough brown there to have 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.230
 product to fade the black pencil is 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.359
 difficult to solve then the more 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.829
 brown you have better will get easier 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.019
 of you smoke understood why I 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.299
 I put the first one in the sequence now 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.190
 I came back with a cuddly brush the same 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.329
 shadow and will form with movements 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.190
 circular 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.930
 there where I 'm right on top of the pencil 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.669
 Black makes a stronger movement or 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.489
 pressing but the tco against the eyelid 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:46.510
 it is necessary to resolve this lapse which I 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.000
 I'm going up 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.949
 I 'm going to take the pretension of the brush and I'm going 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.760
 causing it to cut - in my 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:54.819
 skin 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.420
 this way it becomes lighter and softer 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:01.840
 it's the trick of so-called pressure or ten cel 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.239
 there is little pressure, it gets much clearer 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.410
 pressure becomes darker but pressure 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.750
 sometimes it's important to you 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.970
 develop the product there to finally 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.349
 left the head unmarked 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.690
 good now I'll apply the black shadow 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.860
 opaque light beats throughout the 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.669
 mobile eyelid 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.930
 I applied the three layers applies a 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.270
 another one after another builds 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.430
 Because it 's important that it gets very dark. 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.470
 right after all is not a black olhão 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.690
 You can keep an eye black. 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.570
 lead has to be black black then 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.780
 Does not save a shadow the shadow by 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.790
 favor with shadow 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.350
 Now I'm going to get a little brush to 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.940
 same black shadow and I'll let you know 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.860
 meeting the black with the brown shadow 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.760
 to stay on the mark what I 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.740
 I have already explained more trainees as well as 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.410
 the lower children to seal the pencil 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.850
 pencil does not melt does not drain and I go 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.000
 doing this until the time you think you're 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.000
 OK 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.540
 one more time I go back to brown shadow 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.479
 and prone to cuddling and finishing 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.360
 final, people always come back in brown, right? 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:10.000
 anyway it's good, right? 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.990
 it's worth it so fast it does all 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.240
 difference 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.800
 Good you can not imagine if you can 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.180
 Just leave black but I do not 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.250
 I can not even look small I think 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.960
 it gets better then an illuminated 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.460
 dinha delegates in the inner corner with 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.430
 shadow of the moon when she meets 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.890
 black it turns lightly golden 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.539
 to finish the black eyeliner on the 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.860
 is a custom I have because 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.169
 the only thing that lasts in my line 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.720
 water is to enjoy that I touch 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:38.919
 brush chuchu and I will grow more 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:41.680
 aid indoor and I'll take a 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.960
 stamped on the moving eyelid with this 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.530
 eyeliner left over it does not stick 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.479
 I do not take it anymore, it's just the leftovers. 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:52.510
 seeing the stamp to make it darker and 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.919
 to make it last longer than I 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.630
 I passed in my pain, I have to go back. 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.259
 black spends a little black forming 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:01.360
 just a little bit 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:05.110
 just to make sure it's because the thing 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.789
 shadow opaque she will be there to understand 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.009
 eyeliner even if it is not 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:14.440
 sealed before but the shadow she goes 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:15.820
 hold on for sure I end up with 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.710
 false eyelashes 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.479
 I have a tutorial of this here in the blog 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.940
 here on the blog on youtube on the blog of 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:24.780
 Boleiro is finally just clicking on the corner 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.780

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.800
 is ready our super black oil 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:31.930
 called if you do not want a faded 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.729
 brown can be made with gray 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.520
 I recommend brown because it gives a 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:37.870
 beautiful finish for brown and 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.479
 from black goes to brown and goes to 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.669
 skin understand how the side works and 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:44.830
 I used a button top blend with two 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:47.470
 I applied the top in the outline and the owner 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.599
 inside I taught this in the tutorial to 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.919
 rihanna is there in the corner can click 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:53.680

 has no secret is to just make the whole 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.240
 side with the darker lipstick as 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.060
 It's a pencil and in there you apply. 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.849
 It's clear that I'm in love with my 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:07.120
 I'm wearing a straight face powder 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:10.539
