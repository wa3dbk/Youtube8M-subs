mind<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.920> case<00:03:20.190> that<00:03:20.579> you<00:03:20.700> slide<00:03:21.090> in<00:03:21.390> this

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
mind you the case that you slide in this

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.409 
mind you the case that you slide in this
case<00:03:21.690> your<00:03:21.870> iPhone<00:03:22.260> is<00:03:23.040> very<00:03:23.400> slim<00:03:23.880> anyway<00:03:24.389> I

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419

case your iPhone is very slim anyway I
mean<00:03:24.569> imagine<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:25.380> know<00:03:25.560> maybe<00:03:25.829> half<00:03:26.099> the

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
mean imagine you know maybe half the

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.339 
mean imagine you know maybe half the
size<00:03:26.549> of<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.880> phone<00:03:27.090> in<00:03:27.389> addition<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.200> it's

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
size of the phone in addition so it's

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.920 
size of the phone in addition so it's
not<00:03:28.530> cumbersome<00:03:29.250> it's<00:03:29.459> not<00:03:29.639> a<00:03:29.669> big<00:03:30.000> thing<00:03:30.359> to

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
not cumbersome it's not a big thing to

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.659 
not cumbersome it's not a big thing to
carry<00:03:31.169> in<00:03:31.380> your<00:03:31.410> pocket<00:03:31.889> it's<00:03:32.069> comfortable

what you what you're announcing here
Aviva<00:03:39.720> is<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.829> Android<00:03:41.340> version<00:03:41.730> so<00:03:42.120> let's

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
Aviva is the Android version so let's

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.809 
Aviva is the Android version so let's
talk<00:03:42.450> about<00:03:42.599> this<00:03:42.959> from<00:03:43.380> i-tech<00:03:43.859> yes<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:44.669> the

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
talk about this from i-tech yes so the

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.789 
talk about this from i-tech yes so the
idea<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.329> the<00:03:45.450> concept<00:03:45.480> is<00:03:45.959> very<00:03:46.049> similar<00:03:46.500> to

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
idea and the concept is very similar to

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.289 
idea and the concept is very similar to
the<00:03:46.889> iPhone<00:03:47.010> version<00:03:47.459> what<00:03:47.790> we<00:03:47.940> have<00:03:48.060> seen

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
the iPhone version what we have seen

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.050 
the iPhone version what we have seen
before<00:03:48.480> but<00:03:48.930> now<00:03:49.739> we<00:03:50.280> have<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.489> gadget<00:03:50.730> for

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
before but now we have a gadget for

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.210 
before but now we have a gadget for
Android<00:03:51.450> phones<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:52.139> all<00:03:52.319> Android<00:03:52.799> user<00:03:52.980> will

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
Android phones so all Android user will

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.979 
Android phones so all Android user will
be<00:03:53.310> very<00:03:53.519> happy<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:54.030> see<00:03:54.060> this<00:03:54.359> via<00:03:54.690> prime

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
be very happy to see this via prime

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.870 
be very happy to see this via prime
through<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.829> special<00:03:56.220> thing<00:03:56.430> here<00:03:56.459> is

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
through the special thing here is

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.550 
through the special thing here is
because<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.510> Android<00:03:57.900> there's<00:03:58.380> no

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
because the Android there's no

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.800 
because the Android there's no
specification<00:03:59.130> about<00:03:59.669> the<00:03:59.970> port<00:04:00.299> so<00:04:00.690> it's

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
specification about the port so it's

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.640 
specification about the port so it's
sometimes<00:04:01.019> on<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.410> left<00:04:01.620> sometimes<00:04:02.040> right

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
sometimes on the left sometimes right

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.289 
sometimes on the left sometimes right
that's<00:04:04.650> right<00:04:04.919> so<00:04:05.250> we<00:04:05.280> need<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.579> small<00:04:06.000> cable

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
that's right so we need a small cable

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.369 
that's right so we need a small cable
here<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.370> it's<00:04:08.370> quite<00:04:08.700> easy<00:04:08.730> we<00:04:09.540> just<00:04:09.840> plug<00:04:10.200> it

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
here and it's quite easy we just plug it

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.289 
here and it's quite easy we just plug it
in<00:04:11.660> power<00:04:12.660> on<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.109> projector<00:04:13.769> so<00:04:14.730> you<00:04:14.879> simply

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
in power on the projector so you simply

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.420 
in power on the projector so you simply
plug<00:04:15.599> it<00:04:15.780> into<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.289> microUSB<00:04:16.620> port

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
plug it into the microUSB port

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.250 
plug it into the microUSB port
yes<00:04:17.579> that<00:04:17.789> correct<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.479> would<00:04:18.630> be<00:04:18.750> available

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
and then the projects of the camera as

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.930 
and then the projects of the camera as
