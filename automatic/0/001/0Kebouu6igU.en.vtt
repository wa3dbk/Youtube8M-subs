00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.740
 on the other hand angers and scientists of France Telecom in 2008 of the range 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.140
 technical arte of the professional order paris 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.950
 it's not me who makes you sit on towel-dried hair for even better 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.720
 on hair cci 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.720
 we pass a little brush for the remaining students 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.180
 so for the bangs I will never repeat enough but always 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.340
 work when she was still wet 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.360
 because with him his hair must be insisted on the basis of France 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.280
 especially at the root level 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.320
 which will allow to give him a precise movement ie, for example 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.150
 if the basket 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.600
 then we insist on the length can reach a maximum of things 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.019
 on the other hand if you work on a bang with already dried 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.019
 there you are going to have trouble in capo six years the bangs 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.960
 finally we finish with the round brush that will finalize the blow dry 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.760
 after I finish drying the rest of my hair, I'll attack 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.230
 at the crepe of the folder of my hair 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.670
 all this degrades if you say light so j -c here i used the father who 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.630
 operates 5 of the arte de l'orÃ©al professional paris technical range 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.530
 then from nature 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.640
 or so simply imperial with very tight teeth 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.510
 grab a wide band of hair 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.730
 then creates country 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.020
 then doing back and forth movements 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.170
 little trick to have a much more marked crepe 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.160
 when you make the first stroke of the lease comes 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.560
 on full-length 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.900
 you come back to make a second on the whole length 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.900
 then on a third as many times as you want 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.670
 everything depends on the result you want to get 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.640
 then just repeat the same gestures with the other Belgians who 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.959
 is the folder of your hair then cons cons is very careful and 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.170
 thought to learn from the gaps below the hair but that 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.439
 found in the back of your head 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.709
 it is very important because if not if you criticize the top 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.769
 behind you are going to have something very simple to tichy 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.129
 then use a boar bristle brush to control your score 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:30.659
 you just have to put the swimmers you want 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.809
 of course you can use a normal brush sometimes that if we will have 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:37.729
 tendency to destructure your crepe and therefore to work your volume 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:42.329
 unlike boar bristles and titoff brushes are more likely to 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.690
 caress the creped hair 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.169
 and so in fact allows you to get a rendering over 17 cents 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.119
 as far as destructured your page 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:54.499
 marc rochet check dg to fix it with flat pliers 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:57.829
 as we could see these few Chechen rebel strands then 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.269
 that it is obvious that everything is press or cowardice 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.739
 and here I hope I have to jacques tati with medouar what will 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.279
 allow the batten time to dry 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:10.289
 to gather in the image of the bangs is to get only one block 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.729
 here we attack the longest part, namely the curling of the hair 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.289
 why I decided to go on rats loop 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:27.579
 - defined and rather than components of latium 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.199
 so for that you have got bigger wicks than usual then 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.199
 pass your brother buckled to wali very quickly 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.229
 so if it's a curling iron you can go back up until already 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:41.279
 the base I do not have any problem doing it 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:43.420
 rather prefer to start gold m 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.919
 so we will say whole 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:48.189
 in the database 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.849
 so that's just going to allow you to actually loop all 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:51.619
 job 

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:54.009
 or so we'll say half the wick 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.239
 and get 300 villas are easier 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.489
 on the other hand if you have fine or very fine hair you can start 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:01.540
 your 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.549
 looping of the hair base 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.159
 if you use of course a hair straightener 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.590
 simply because your horse to relax much more easily 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:13.030
 and quickly and so you'll have a role of high standing ovation all of 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:16.029
 after 

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:24.579
 and that's the bulk of the work is over now we move on to 

00:04:24.579 --> 00:04:26.990
 hairstyles 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.130
 so as the title says I'm inspired a lot of jean hairstyle 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.040
 fernandez go fast in her character of melissa cordone in the superb 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.039
 ghost whisperer series 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.710
 of course I work his hairstyles in my own way 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.860
 and I will also bring my little touch copyists setting up and 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.719
 hairstyle 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:49.009
 with a butterfly wing for example 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:50.360
 or banners 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.360
 so do not ask the question at this time I'm not crazy 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.240
 in butterfly goals 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.520
 you and me not even why but here it is that's how it's life 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:01.279
 by cons it is obviously 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:05.330
 normally a morning goal that a big bow tie on the collar 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.740
 I will not wear bowties 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.740
 on my hair because it's too much to do the whole game 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.060
 good I'll let you quietly watch the end of the video by which I 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.749
 wanted to clarify 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:21.879
 for any question possibly on this type ariane hairstyle or so on 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.499
 all the other hairstyle 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:24.659
 former 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:28.409
 or the same if you have a question about% and the theme of the hairstyle in 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:33.119
 general you can come ask me on the forum already my hair for a 

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.779
 cock 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:35.669
 why now on the site 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.669
 you will see poissant along the forums you click on it 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.099
 and then you do not ask questions 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.059
 but first you have to register first I'm sorry but 

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:46.120
 that's where it goes like this 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.520
 and so there is why I rather prefer you ask the question to the 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.449
 bar simply what will allow us to better group the 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:54.089
 questions and for good reason 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:57.539
 so there it would avoid me from repeating always to had the same 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.989
 answers to the same questions here I hope you will understand 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.270
 but yesterday it will be much easier for you too to spot 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.689
 are the questions 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:08.409
 no new posed 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.819
 so by going to the forum if you spot your question ap you who 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:13.979
 were you will have your answer right away 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:15.690
 thank you very much anyway
