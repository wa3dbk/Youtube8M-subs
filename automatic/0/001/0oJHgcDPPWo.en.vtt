it<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.070> wired<00:00:26.279> controller<00:00:26.750> you<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.900> find

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
it is a wired controller you can find

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.279 
it is a wired controller you can find
this<00:00:28.199> online<00:00:28.710> for<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.070> think<00:00:29.340> 220<00:00:30.300> US<00:00:30.779> dollars

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
this online for I think 220 US dollars

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.590 
this online for I think 220 US dollars
and<00:00:33.829> 190<00:00:34.829> euros<00:00:35.280> I'm<00:00:35.520> not<00:00:35.610> positively<00:00:36.180> sure

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
and 190 euros I'm not positively sure

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.780 
and 190 euros I'm not positively sure
but<00:00:37.110> last<00:00:37.890> time<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.070> checked<00:00:38.160> that's<00:00:38.460> what<00:00:38.670> it

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
but last time I checked that's what it

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.030 
but last time I checked that's what it
was<00:00:38.940> now<00:00:39.840> as<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.050> can<00:00:40.140> see<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.590> has<00:00:40.620> some<00:00:40.890> nice

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
was now as you can see it has some nice

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.530 
was now as you can see it has some nice
designs<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.820> has<00:00:41.969> different<00:00:42.329> colored

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
designs that has different colored

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.010 
designs that has different colored
buttons<00:00:43.010> you<00:00:44.010> know<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.250> really<00:00:44.399> gives<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.760> good

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
buttons you know it really gives a good

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.020 
buttons you know it really gives a good
visual<00:00:46.020> aspect<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.920> controller<00:00:47.340> but<00:00:47.610> I

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
visual aspect to the controller but I

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.360 
visual aspect to the controller but I
think<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> big<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.559> big<00:00:49.590> highlight<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
think the big the big highlight is the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.880 
think the big the big highlight is the
performance<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.329> what<00:00:52.020> kind<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.289> quality<00:00:52.739> you

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
performance and what kind of quality you

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.250 
performance and what kind of quality you
get<00:00:53.100> when<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.370> play<00:00:53.610> call<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.879> duty<00:00:54.199> now<00:00:55.199> two

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
get when you play call of duty now two

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.170 
get when you play call of duty now two
things<00:00:55.800> two<00:00:56.190> key<00:00:56.430> qualities<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.030> this

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
things two key qualities of this

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.779 
things two key qualities of this
controller<00:00:57.570> really<00:00:57.930> help<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
controller really help and that is the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.529 
controller really help and that is the
trigger<00:01:00.000> stops<00:01:00.359> now<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:02.149> this<00:01:03.149> allows

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
trigger stops now that just this allows

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.590 
trigger stops now that just this allows
you<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.930> shoot<00:01:04.320> faster<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.070> allows<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.670> get

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
you to shoot faster it allows you to get

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.310 
you to shoot faster it allows you to get
your<00:01:06.720> trigger<00:01:07.020> finger<00:01:07.110> trigger<00:01:08.100> finger<00:01:08.659> a<00:01:09.659> lot

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
your trigger finger trigger finger a lot

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.840 
your trigger finger trigger finger a lot
faster<00:01:11.720> also<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:13.140> your<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:14.310> paddles<00:01:14.729> on

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
faster also you have your the paddles on

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.420 
faster also you have your the paddles on
the<00:01:14.939> back<00:01:15.119> now<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.509> i<00:01:16.049> believe<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> left<00:01:17.130> one<00:01:17.400> is

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
the back now I i believe the left one is

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.219 
the back now I i believe the left one is
the<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> button<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.420> right<00:01:18.570> one<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.049> B

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
the a button and the right one is the B

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.499 
the a button and the right one is the B
button<00:01:19.439> now<00:01:20.280> I'm<00:01:20.430> not<00:01:20.580> sure<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.820> might<00:01:21.150> throw<00:01:21.390> in

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
button now I'm not sure I might throw in

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.969 
button now I'm not sure I might throw in
some<00:01:21.689> gameplay<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.140> show<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.439> but<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.740> mean

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
some gameplay to show you but I mean

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.530 
some gameplay to show you but I mean
it's<00:01:23.340> pretty<00:01:23.610> simple<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.060> mean<00:01:24.210> y'all<00:01:24.360> should

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
it's pretty simple I mean y'all should

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.010 
it's pretty simple I mean y'all should
know<00:01:25.220> they<00:01:26.220> also<00:01:26.400> removed<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.210> rumble<00:01:27.810> pack

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
know they also removed the rumble pack

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.800 
know they also removed the rumble pack
from<00:01:28.259> inside<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.680> controller<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.810> very

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
from inside the controller so a very

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.210 
from inside the controller so a very
lightweight<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.439> mean<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.710> feels<00:01:31.860> like<00:01:32.070> nothing

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
lightweight I mean it feels like nothing

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.240 
lightweight I mean it feels like nothing
in<00:01:32.549> my<00:01:32.670> hand<00:01:32.970> now<00:01:33.180> i<00:01:33.930> will<00:01:34.740> say<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.009> my

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
in my hand now i will say that my

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.370 
in my hand now i will say that my
performance<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.720> call<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.930> duty<00:01:37.049> has

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
performance in the in call of duty has

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.530 
performance in the in call of duty has
really<00:01:37.770> increased<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:38.340> I've<00:01:38.700> really

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
really increased like I've really

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.480 
really increased like I've really
started<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.140> get<00:01:40.439> my<00:01:40.560> jump<00:01:40.770> shots<00:01:41.040> down<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.369> my

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
started to get my jump shots down to my

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.010 
started to get my jump shots down to my
drop<00:01:41.729> shots<00:01:41.970> down<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.390> know<00:01:42.479> I've<00:01:42.630> gotten<00:01:42.930> my

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
drop shots down you know I've gotten my

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.609 
drop shots down you know I've gotten my
shot<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.500> um<00:01:44.280> one<00:01:44.909> thing<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.240> will<00:01:45.299> say<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:46.020> that

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
shot on um one thing I will say is that

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.590 
shot on um one thing I will say is that
with<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> two<00:01:47.820> hundred<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.149> twenty<00:01:48.360> dollars

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
with the two hundred and twenty dollars

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.330 
with the two hundred and twenty dollars
price<00:01:48.869> point<00:01:49.170> I'm<00:01:49.350> not<00:01:49.500> really<00:01:49.740> sure<00:01:49.890> it's

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
price point I'm not really sure it's

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.450 
price point I'm not really sure it's
worth<00:01:50.490> your<00:01:50.700> money<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:51.149> think<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.020> uh<00:01:52.250> you'd<00:01:53.250> be

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
worth your money I think it uh you'd be
