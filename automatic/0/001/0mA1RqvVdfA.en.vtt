last few nights feel like I'm going
backwards<00:00:06.420> with<00:00:06.600> it<00:00:06.750> but<00:00:07.230> I'm<00:00:07.500> going<00:00:07.740> forwards

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
backwards with it but I'm going forwards

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.740 
backwards with it but I'm going forwards
I've<00:00:08.639> got<00:00:08.820> now<00:00:09.000> as<00:00:09.179> far<00:00:09.480> as<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:10.400> hazard<00:00:11.400> and

it over there is the brain this bit of
unwrapped<00:01:18.240> back<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.380> luminous<00:01:19.740> was<00:01:19.890> all

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
unwrapped back at the luminous was all

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.370 
unwrapped back at the luminous was all
tied<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.520> loom<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.689> go<00:01:21.810> through<00:01:21.840> and

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
tied in the loom so I can go through and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.350 
tied in the loom so I can go through and
find<00:01:23.340> which<00:01:23.549> wires<00:01:23.820> are<00:01:23.970> left<00:01:24.180> early

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
find which wires are left early

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.230 
find which wires are left early
indicator<00:01:24.780> wise<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.290> whatnot<00:01:26.119> for<00:01:27.119> those

indicator wise and whatnot for those

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.429 
indicator wise and whatnot for those
either<00:01:27.390> think<00:01:27.750> I'm<00:01:27.840> having<00:01:27.930> an<00:01:28.110> easy<00:01:28.290> time

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
either think I'm having an easy time

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.039 
either think I'm having an easy time
doing<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:28.979> wiring<00:01:29.280> or<00:01:29.640> wiring<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.119> easy<00:01:30.299> it

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
doing this wiring or wiring is easy it

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.410 
doing this wiring or wiring is easy it
might<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.650> if<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.310> them<00:01:32.640> like<00:01:33.090> lots<00:01:33.299> of

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
might be if you have them like lots of

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.760 
might be if you have them like lots of
all<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> different<00:01:34.079> colored<00:01:34.290> wires<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.740> all

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
all the different colored wires and all

all the different colored wires and all
the<00:01:34.829> rest<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.340> what<00:01:36.030> I've<00:01:36.150> been<00:01:36.390> doing<00:01:36.570> is

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the rest of it what I've been doing is

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.770 
the rest of it what I've been doing is
stripping<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.530> dry<00:01:38.400> lengthwise<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> need<00:01:39.180> out

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
stripping and dry lengthwise I need out

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.969 
stripping and dry lengthwise I need out
of<00:01:39.840> other<00:01:40.409> columns<00:01:41.299> to<00:01:42.299> give<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.540> an<00:01:42.659> idea

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
of other columns to give you an idea

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.789 
of other columns to give you an idea
these<00:01:43.979> bunch<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.520> wires<00:01:44.700> here<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.560> that<00:01:46.560> bunch

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
these bunch of wires here and that bunch

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.870 
these bunch of wires here and that bunch
there<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:48.270> stuff<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.720> top<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.880> have

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
there and the stuff on top of that have

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.120 
there and the stuff on top of that have
all<00:01:51.149> come<00:01:51.390> out<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.750> old<00:01:52.079> looms<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.950> had

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
all come out of old looms that I had

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.090 
all come out of old looms that I had
kicking<00:01:53.460> around<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.590> try<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:55.950> keep

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
kicking around and so I can try and keep

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.429 
kicking around and so I can try and keep
the<00:01:56.939> same<00:01:57.119> color<00:01:57.360> wise<00:01:57.570> all<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.020> way<00:01:58.140> through

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
the same color wise all the way through

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.020 
the same color wise all the way through
so<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.280> car<00:01:59.549> ok<00:02:00.509> that's<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.780> for<00:02:00.810> now
