sidelines<00:04:20.440> running

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
sidelines running

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.650 
sidelines running
over<00:04:21.070> there<00:04:21.220> and<00:04:21.370> so<00:04:21.550> you<00:04:22.150> know<00:04:22.240> they<00:04:22.360> did<00:04:22.630> a

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
over there and so you know they did a

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.230 
over there and so you know they did a
big<00:04:23.020> dog<00:04:23.260> pile<00:04:23.500> which<00:04:23.740> I<00:04:24.070> mean<00:04:24.610> anytime<00:04:25.060> you

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
big dog pile which I mean anytime you

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.490 
big dog pile which I mean anytime you

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.950 
can include the whole team and I think
it's<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:27.850> guys<00:04:28.000> on<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.240> field<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.720> bench
