00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 at 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.620
 e 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.730
 hi girls is ima so 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.500
 today I'm going to actually make you 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.689
 a capsule break or how to put a 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.670
 capsule one eats the break - in fact the 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.830
 that I learned in formation so I 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.560
 first prepare so pushed back so my 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.899
 cuticles so with my rest-ecully qg 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.329
 remove impurities 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:35.079
 I politely with a yellow white black 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.210
 like this is so I chose my 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.710
 capsule of course that is suitable for my 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.970
 nail so the tip always a small 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.370
 little bigger because if you 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.899
 learn too little she will not hold 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.390
 and me what I do in fact I read 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.640
 a little on the sides too to avoid to 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.990
 having to do it on the nail is very 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.640
 difficult to do on the trails 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.330
 in general to remove the demarcation 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:01:01.120
 of people so I himself a little bit 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:07.930
 it's like these had done the same 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:11.470
 on the other side I make a jump too 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:18.940
 shorten a single type to the capsule here 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:25.840
 we round up the plans of the suburbs 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:29.350
 inside picks up with my little 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.560
 brush know the dust because 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.330
 when you pay the dust from here 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.460
 so it's mourning so it gives 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.940
 so when we put the bag line and 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.530
 like this see so it's going to be less embarrassed 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.680
 at the demarcation level so here I have 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.479
 a length of so so here's where 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.770
 it's the only uncle I 'm doing this test 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.320
 this on this love there because it's 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.869
 shorter so compared to others 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.520
 so I 'm doing you on this one so is 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.670
 here on the free edge you have 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.770
 the notch so on the other side and we're going 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.960
 actually put the glue so in the 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.080
 big notches and hop I applied it on 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.600
 the free edge and fold it directly 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.069
 in one go for not that his phase of 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.140
 bubble if you have a bubble it's screwed 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.069
 you have to start again 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.780
 to take off your capsule I'm going to you 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.319
 to show that too in another video 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.870
 order his capsule if we missed 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.599
 so here you go directly 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.249
 in any case and once you press and 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.120
 you wait for it to adhere a little bit 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:26.830
 here 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.110
 and after you remove the demarcation I 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.769
 have ordered demarcation so I 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.450
 take my collar of home bd of course and 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.580
 so that's the news I bought 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.730
 this habit when those at 11 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.750
 24 this is what I worked 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.790
 with local training so here are people 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.290
 but still 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.930
 everywhere a program ie 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.700
 everywhere I put it down for beep 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.920
 up 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.579
 so I take my nail and I go on 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.150
 the free edge 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.599
 so after two long and hop 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.599
 I directly support 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:09.579
 alright here at once so we support a 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.920
 little bit even if for example you see 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:15.069
 that there is a bubble somewhere hop you 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.829
 make it okay you take that off with 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.599
 the acetone month once what I hope 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.900
 so I went there because next to that 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:25.090
 on the back this is like these and pop 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:32.109
 I support for that it adheres that 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:34.870
 the nail adheres on the sides like that 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:39.010
 will also stick to the sides 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.200
 wave to remember so that's it 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.049
 gives what it actually gives after 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.940
 have it applied with the glue so you 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.349
 see his ugly daughter because we already 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.660
 we did not cut it so it did too much 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.859
 long and we have the demarcation here 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.849
 so we will cut with a guillotine 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.250
 of anqing gating it's a kind of cut 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.049
 nails but to cut capsules 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.849
 you choose the size that you 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.530
 so I want to know what to choose 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.480
 close so cut a little bit always 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.549
 a little bigger like that you can 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:15.069
 relay but just after with the others 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:17.289
 had created your anthem in fact you 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.510
 so here we see we really see 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:22.980
 totally there 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:25.320
 the difference actually between the capsule 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.820
 and one kind and so what are we going to do 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.920
 we will remove the demarcation 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.250
 but we'll see each other again 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.250
 video
