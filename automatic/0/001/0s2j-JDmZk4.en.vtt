stage you probably get for a lot less
due<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.530> fact<00:01:46.740> that's<00:01:48.530> well<00:01:49.530> do<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.890> fact

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
due to the fact that's well do the fact

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.880 
due to the fact that's well do the fact
that<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:51.420> are<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.530> cheaper<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:52.920> States

that you are it's cheaper in States
there<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.850> $31.99<00:01:57.829> in<00:01:58.829> the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
there you have it it is $31.99 in the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.200 
there you have it it is $31.99 in the
States<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.250> believe<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.549> could<00:01:59.640> get<00:01:59.759> for<00:01:59.909> $20

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210
