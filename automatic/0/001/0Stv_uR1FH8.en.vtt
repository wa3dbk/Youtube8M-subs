and<00:00:14.709> I<00:00:14.889> gotta<00:00:15.100> say<00:00:15.369> it's<00:00:15.760> pretty<00:00:16.449> exciting

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
and I gotta say it's pretty exciting

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.689 
and I gotta say it's pretty exciting
there<00:00:17.289> are<00:00:17.470> some<00:00:17.859> disappointments<00:00:18.670> but

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:18.699 
there are some disappointments but

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.150 
there are some disappointments but
overall<00:00:19.090> it's<00:00:19.780> pretty<00:00:20.140> damn<00:00:20.440> impressive

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
overall it's pretty damn impressive

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.960 
overall it's pretty damn impressive
so<00:00:21.910> I'm<00:00:22.240> going<00:00:22.450> to<00:00:22.540> view<00:00:22.870> it<00:00:23.020> right<00:00:23.170> here<00:00:23.500> and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
so I'm going to view it right here and

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.820 
so I'm going to view it right here and
when<00:00:24.970> we<00:00:25.060> first<00:00:25.360> started<00:00:25.750> off<00:00:25.810> on<00:00:26.140> this

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
when we first started off on this

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.000 
when we first started off on this
multiplayer<00:00:27.400> reveal<00:00:27.850> we<00:00:28.150> see<00:00:28.420> like<00:00:28.600> these

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
multiplayer reveal we see like these

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.490 
multiplayer reveal we see like these
windmills<00:00:30.010> all<00:00:30.340> right<00:00:30.490> these<00:00:31.500> alternative

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
windmills all right these alternative

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.560 
windmills all right these alternative
sources<00:00:32.529> for<00:00:33.160> energy<00:00:33.340> and<00:00:33.969> this<00:00:34.180> is<00:00:34.360> very

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
sources for energy and this is very

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.900 
sources for energy and this is very
plausible<00:00:34.870> because<00:00:35.350> they're<00:00:36.310> starting<00:00:36.700> to<00:00:36.760> do

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
plausible because they're starting to do

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.700 
plausible because they're starting to do
that<00:00:37.030> right<00:00:37.270> now<00:00:37.300> and<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.200> whole<00:00:38.350> entire

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
that right now and the whole entire

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.500 
that right now and the whole entire
environment<00:00:39.160> you<00:00:39.670> know<00:00:39.790> trying<00:00:40.180> to<00:00:40.270> make<00:00:40.420> the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
environment you know trying to make the

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.180 
environment you know trying to make the
environment<00:00:40.750> better<00:00:41.050> here<00:00:41.590> on<00:00:41.680> earth<00:00:41.890> right

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
environment better here on earth right

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.060 
environment better here on earth right
and<00:00:42.930> obviously<00:00:43.930> what<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.380> future<00:00:44.680> looks<00:00:44.860> like

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
and obviously what the future looks like

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.370 
and obviously what the future looks like
is<00:00:45.280> they're<00:00:45.489> trying<00:00:45.640> to<00:00:45.880> kind<00:00:46.329> of<00:00:46.510> you<00:00:46.750> know

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
is they're trying to kind of you know

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.290 
is they're trying to kind of you know
stay<00:00:47.770> away<00:00:47.980> from<00:00:48.040> fossil<00:00:48.399> fuels<00:00:48.850> so<00:00:49.149> that

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
stay away from fossil fuels so that

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.720 
stay away from fossil fuels so that
could<00:00:49.750> be<00:00:49.780> indicating<00:00:50.649> what<00:00:50.890> this<00:00:51.190> specific

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
could be indicating what this specific

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.630 
could be indicating what this specific
map<00:00:51.970> is<00:00:52.239> implying<00:00:52.930> you<00:00:53.920> have<00:00:54.070> this<00:00:54.219> soldier

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
map is implying you have this soldier

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
like a mini EMP grenade that's pretty

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.370 
like a mini EMP grenade that's pretty
cool<00:01:06.280> you<00:01:06.549> could<00:01:06.670> just<00:01:06.969> you<00:01:07.149> know<00:01:07.319> throw<00:01:08.319> it

wherever you want and all their

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.179 
wherever you want and all their
electronics<00:01:10.719> are<00:01:10.840> disabled<00:01:11.380> I<00:01:11.560> think<00:01:12.069> that's

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
electronics are disabled I think that's

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.489 
electronics are disabled I think that's
a<00:01:12.249> really<00:01:12.399> good<00:01:12.609> tactic<00:01:13.149> and<00:01:13.329> honestly<00:01:14.139> I

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:14.499 
a really good tactic and honestly I

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:15.779 
a really good tactic and honestly I
think<00:01:14.530> it's<00:01:14.889> gonna<00:01:15.039> be<00:01:15.189> one<00:01:15.399> hell<00:01:15.609> of<00:01:15.639> an

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
think it's gonna be one hell of an

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:17.039 
think it's gonna be one hell of an
annoying<00:01:16.060> thing<00:01:16.119> when<00:01:16.479> it's<00:01:16.600> done<00:01:16.749> to<00:01:16.869> myself

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049

I honestly think they have improved

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:46.559 
I honestly think they have improved
compared<00:01:44.409> to<00:01:44.560> black<00:01:44.740> ops<00:01:45.069> 1<00:01:45.459> but<00:01:46.329> I<00:01:46.359> don't

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
compared to black ops 1 but I don't

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.120 
compared to black ops 1 but I don't
really<00:01:46.749> see<00:01:47.020> much<00:01:47.319> of<00:01:47.380> an<00:01:47.799> improvement

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
really see much of an improvement

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.089 
really see much of an improvement
compared<00:01:48.789> to<00:01:48.880> mw3<00:01:49.630> to<00:01:50.229> be<00:01:50.349> quite<00:01:50.679> honest<00:01:51.069> with

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:51.099 
compared to mw3 to be quite honest with

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:54.179 
compared to mw3 to be quite honest with
you<00:01:51.719> now<00:01:52.719> this<00:01:53.079> is<00:01:53.289> one<00:01:53.499> thing<00:01:53.770> that<00:01:53.919> I<00:01:53.950> thought

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
you now this is one thing that I thought

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.940 
you now this is one thing that I thought
was<00:01:54.369> really<00:01:54.609> cool<00:01:55.259> I'm<00:01:56.259> looking<00:01:56.560> at<00:01:56.709> it<00:01:56.829> right

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
was really cool I'm looking at it right

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.389 
was really cool I'm looking at it right
now<00:01:57.130> as<00:01:57.310> I<00:01:57.340> speak<00:01:57.429> it's<00:01:57.939> called<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.450> microwave

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
now as I speak it's called the microwave

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.039 
now as I speak it's called the microwave
yes<00:02:00.399> not<00:02:00.729> your<00:02:00.939> traditional<00:02:01.149> microwave<00:02:01.929> in

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
yes not your traditional microwave in

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.789 
yes not your traditional microwave in
your<00:02:02.169> house<00:02:02.349> but<00:02:02.889> the<00:02:03.549> actual<00:02:04.029> wave<00:02:04.869> now<00:02:05.770> I

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
your house but the actual wave now I

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.109 
your house but the actual wave now I
don't<00:02:06.069> know<00:02:06.219> if<00:02:06.310> you<00:02:06.369> guys<00:02:06.520> know<00:02:06.789> about<00:02:06.969> this

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
don't know if you guys know about this

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.029 
don't know if you guys know about this
but<00:02:07.329> in<00:02:07.479> real<00:02:07.630> life<00:02:07.869> alright<00:02:08.349> the<00:02:08.530> military

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
but in real life alright the military

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.130 
but in real life alright the military
actually<00:02:09.340> weaponized<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.360> microwave<00:02:10.869> it's

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
actually weaponized the microwave it's

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.940 
actually weaponized the microwave it's
like<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.470> big<00:02:11.800> dish

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
like this big dish

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.589 
like this big dish
and<00:02:13.040> they<00:02:13.310> shoot<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.670> towards<00:02:14.030> their<00:02:14.150> enemy

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
and they shoot it towards their enemy

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.300 
and they shoot it towards their enemy
and<00:02:14.629> it<00:02:14.959> actually<00:02:15.170> resists<00:02:15.890> them<00:02:16.069> it's<00:02:16.250> a

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
and it actually resists them it's a

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.670 
and it actually resists them it's a
non-lethal<00:02:16.550> weapon<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.540> actually<00:02:17.959> slows<00:02:18.290> them

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
non-lethal weapon it actually slows them

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.610 
non-lethal weapon it actually slows them
down<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:20.060> I'm<00:02:20.480> number<00:02:20.690> this<00:02:20.870> video<00:02:21.290> on<00:02:21.530> the

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
down so I'm number this video on the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.100 
down so I'm number this video on the
Internet<00:02:21.980> where<00:02:22.129> this<00:02:22.340> news<00:02:22.640> guy<00:02:22.910> was<00:02:23.629> testing

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
Internet where this news guy was testing

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.220 
Internet where this news guy was testing
it<00:02:24.200> out<00:02:24.319> and<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:25.670> hurt<00:02:26.030> it<00:02:26.269> really<00:02:26.750> did<00:02:26.989> hurt

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
it out and it hurt it really did hurt

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.750 
it out and it hurt it really did hurt
and<00:02:27.410> it<00:02:27.500> makes<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:27.830> get<00:02:28.069> out<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.400> way<00:02:28.550> or

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
and it makes you get out of the way or

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.930 
and it makes you get out of the way or
run<00:02:28.970> back<00:02:29.269> so<00:02:30.170> this<00:02:30.830> is<00:02:31.069> obviously<00:02:31.250> a<00:02:31.640> brand

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
run back so this is obviously a brand

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.960 
run back so this is obviously a brand
new<00:02:32.090> kill<00:02:32.390> streak<00:02:32.750> in<00:02:33.050> black<00:02:33.410> ops<00:02:33.680> 2<00:02:33.849> and<00:02:34.849> I

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
new kill streak in black ops 2 and I

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.550 
new kill streak in black ops 2 and I
honestly<00:02:35.180> think<00:02:35.420> that's<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.810> great<00:02:36.050> way<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:36.290> do

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
honestly think that's a great way to do

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.180 
honestly think that's a great way to do
things<00:02:37.239> so<00:02:38.239> you<00:02:38.810> know<00:02:38.840> we<00:02:39.110> see<00:02:39.349> some<00:02:39.590> perks<00:02:39.950> we

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
things so you know we see some perks we

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.369 
things so you know we see some perks we
see<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.569> quadrocopters<00:02:41.569> right<00:02:41.989> flying

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
see the quadrocopters right flying

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.309 
see the quadrocopters right flying
around<00:02:43.030> all<00:02:44.030> these<00:02:44.299> crazy<00:02:44.660> maps<00:02:44.989> that<00:02:45.200> they

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
around all these crazy maps that they

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.100 
around all these crazy maps that they
keep<00:02:45.500> on<00:02:45.650> going<00:02:45.799> back<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.340> forth<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.819> now<00:02:47.660> this

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
keep on going back and forth to now this

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.220 
keep on going back and forth to now this
is<00:02:48.260> one<00:02:48.500> cool<00:02:48.769> thing<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:50.209> missile<00:02:50.840> launcher

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
is one cool thing the missile launcher

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.170 
is one cool thing the missile launcher
I'm<00:02:51.319> luck<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:51.799> don't<00:02:52.370> really<00:02:52.489> remember<00:02:52.640> what<00:02:53.090> it

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
I'm luck I don't really remember what it

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.930 
I'm luck I don't really remember what it
was<00:02:53.299> called<00:02:53.569> in<00:02:53.900> black<00:02:54.470> ops<00:02:54.739> 1<00:02:55.040> but<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.760> pretty

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
was called in black ops 1 but it pretty

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.210 
was called in black ops 1 but it pretty
much<00:02:56.060> had<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.510> same<00:02:56.750> exact<00:02:57.170> sound<00:02:57.500> effect<00:02:57.920> and

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
much had the same exact sound effect and

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.280 
much had the same exact sound effect and
I<00:02:59.030> actually<00:02:59.329> I<00:02:59.569> believe<00:02:59.810> it<00:02:59.900> was<00:02:59.989> called<00:03:00.200> the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
I actually I believe it was called the

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.670 
I actually I believe it was called the
Strela<00:03:00.650> if<00:03:00.980> I'm<00:03:01.400> if<00:03:01.819> I'm<00:03:01.970> correct<00:03:02.180> on<00:03:02.480> that<00:03:02.680> so

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
Strela if I'm if I'm correct on that so

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.289 
Strela if I'm if I'm correct on that so
let's<00:03:03.890> just<00:03:04.040> call<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.370> Strela<00:03:04.700> for<00:03:04.940> now<00:03:05.060> so

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
let's just call the Strela for now so

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.289 
let's just call the Strela for now so
the<00:03:05.390> Strela<00:03:05.690> missile<00:03:06.140> right<00:03:06.380> in<00:03:06.980> black<00:03:07.730> ops<00:03:08.000> 1

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
the Strela missile right in black ops 1

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.150 
the Strela missile right in black ops 1
had<00:03:08.599> that<00:03:08.780> sound<00:03:09.019> that<00:03:09.380> when<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.590> walk<00:03:09.769> onto<00:03:10.010> a

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
had that sound that when you walk onto a

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.809 
had that sound that when you walk onto a
target

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
target

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.910 
target
same<00:03:11.420> exact<00:03:11.810> thing<00:03:12.019> in<00:03:12.049> here<00:03:12.349> except<00:03:12.829> the

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
same exact thing in here except the

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.440 
same exact thing in here except the
visuals<00:03:13.400> are<00:03:13.519> different<00:03:13.970> it's<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:14.209> like

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
visuals are different it's so like

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.620 
visuals are different it's so like
holographic<00:03:15.290> like<00:03:15.819> you<00:03:16.819> know<00:03:16.940> holographic

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
holographic like you know holographic

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.020 
holographic like you know holographic
sights<00:03:17.930> on<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.290> side<00:03:18.530> no<00:03:18.829> very<00:03:19.609> futuristic

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
sights on the side no very futuristic

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.410 
sights on the side no very futuristic
once<00:03:20.510> again<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:21.579> of<00:03:22.579> course<00:03:22.850> they<00:03:22.970> have<00:03:23.120> riot

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
once again and of course they have riot

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.140 
once again and of course they have riot
shields<00:03:23.989> now<00:03:24.170> it's<00:03:24.620> just<00:03:24.769> like<00:03:24.889> an<00:03:25.130> mw3<00:03:25.639> and

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
shields now it's just like an mw3 and

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.890 
shields now it's just like an mw3 and
I'm<00:03:26.299> w2<00:03:27.290> rather<00:03:28.180> you<00:03:29.180> know<00:03:29.299> both<00:03:29.510> those<00:03:29.720> two

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
I'm w2 rather you know both those two

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.599 
I'm w2 rather you know both those two
games<00:03:30.109> they<00:03:30.290> have<00:03:30.380> riot<00:03:30.620> shields<00:03:31.100> now<00:03:31.310> we<00:03:31.370> have

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
games they have riot shields now we have

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.240 
games they have riot shields now we have
riot<00:03:31.850> shields<00:03:32.389> they<00:03:32.660> also<00:03:32.870> show<00:03:33.319> these<00:03:33.620> really

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
riot shields they also show these really

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.099 
riot shields they also show these really
cool<00:03:34.489> robotic<00:03:35.090> things<00:03:35.359> that<00:03:35.569> have<00:03:35.720> double

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
cool robotic things that have double

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.610 
cool robotic things that have double
Gunners<00:03:36.620> on<00:03:36.769> each<00:03:36.920> side<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:38.200> you<00:03:39.200> know<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.319> got

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
Gunners on each side and you know I got

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.740 
Gunners on each side and you know I got
to<00:03:39.709> tell<00:03:39.829> you<00:03:39.950> over<00:03:40.100> all<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.910> maps<00:03:41.150> I'm<00:03:41.420> seeing

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
to tell you over all the maps I'm seeing

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.110 
to tell you over all the maps I'm seeing
on<00:03:41.959> this<00:03:42.049> game<00:03:42.319> they're<00:03:42.769> very<00:03:43.040> colorful<00:03:43.310> it's

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
on this game they're very colorful it's

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.910 
on this game they're very colorful it's
definitely<00:03:44.630> a<00:03:44.690> big<00:03:44.930> step<00:03:44.959> compared<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.769> black

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
definitely a big step compared to black

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.819 
definitely a big step compared to black
ops<00:03:46.250> 1<00:03:46.579> so<00:03:47.209> black<00:03:47.690> ops<00:03:47.930> 2<00:03:48.200> I<00:03:48.230> think<00:03:48.530> they<00:03:48.620> really

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
ops 1 so black ops 2 I think they really

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.039 
ops 1 so black ops 2 I think they really
heard<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.160> community<00:03:49.609> I<00:03:49.639> think<00:03:49.850> that<00:03:50.239> a<00:03:50.690> lot

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049

heard the community I think that a lot
of<00:03:51.170> people<00:03:51.380> thought<00:03:51.590> that<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:52.010> color<00:03:52.250> was

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
of people thought that the color was

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.270 
of people thought that the color was
kind<00:03:52.700> of<00:03:52.819> blandish<00:03:53.480> in<00:03:53.690> black<00:03:54.319> ops<00:03:54.590> 1<00:03:54.950> and<00:03:55.160> now

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
kind of blandish in black ops 1 and now

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.800 
kind of blandish in black ops 1 and now
the<00:03:55.340> kinda<00:03:55.760> reviving<00:03:56.359> that<00:03:56.389> they're<00:03:56.690> looking

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
up that saturation so this is one really

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.879 
up that saturation so this is one really
cool<00:04:05.359> thing<00:04:05.599> that<00:04:06.019> I'm<00:04:06.109> looking<00:04:06.230> at<00:04:06.470> right<00:04:06.530> now

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
cool thing that I'm looking at right now

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.750 
cool thing that I'm looking at right now
there<00:04:07.250> are<00:04:07.340> these<00:04:08.380> unmanned<00:04:09.579> whatever<00:04:10.579> they

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
there are these unmanned whatever they

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.360 
there are these unmanned whatever they
are<00:04:10.790> planes<00:04:11.510> little<00:04:12.079> tiny<00:04:12.319> like<00:04:12.650> planes<00:04:13.010> and

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
are planes little tiny like planes and

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.550 
are planes little tiny like planes and
they<00:04:13.549> actually<00:04:13.910> dive<00:04:14.269> down<00:04:14.630> and<00:04:14.690> do<00:04:14.959> kamikaze

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
they actually dive down and do kamikaze

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.190

attacks<00:04:16.039> to<00:04:16.729> your<00:04:16.849> enemy<00:04:17.299> so<00:04:17.900> this<00:04:18.079> is

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
attacks to your enemy so this is

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.900 
attacks to your enemy so this is
obviously<00:04:18.410> another<00:04:18.919> kill<00:04:19.250> streak<00:04:19.579> I<00:04:19.729> mean

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
obviously another kill streak I mean

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.490 
obviously another kill streak I mean
there's<00:04:20.120> hundreds<00:04:20.599> of<00:04:20.720> them<00:04:20.810> not<00:04:21.019> hundreds

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
there's hundreds of them not hundreds

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.310 
there's hundreds of them not hundreds

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
but there's probably over a dozen of

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.760 
but there's probably over a dozen of
them<00:04:24.440> in<00:04:24.530> the
