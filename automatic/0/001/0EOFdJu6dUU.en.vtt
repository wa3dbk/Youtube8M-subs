what's going on I have a new little work

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.759 
what's going on I have a new little work
on<00:00:04.210> my<00:00:04.390> car<00:00:04.660> here<00:00:06.299> I<00:00:07.299> took<00:00:07.930> off<00:00:08.170> my<00:00:08.200> old<00:00:08.530> hood

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:08.769 
on my car here I took off my old hood

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:19.470 
on my car here I took off my old hood
dampers<00:00:09.509> you<00:00:10.509> had<00:00:10.749> tiens<00:00:17.700> I<00:00:18.700> mean<00:00:19.180> they<00:00:19.300> serve

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
dampers you had tiens I mean they serve

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.530 
dampers you had tiens I mean they serve
the<00:00:19.660> purpose<00:00:19.690> but<00:00:20.350> they're<00:00:20.650> really<00:00:21.540> worn-out

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
the purpose but they're really worn-out

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.340 
the purpose but they're really worn-out
old<00:00:24.030> like<00:00:25.030> the<00:00:25.180> lubricant<00:00:25.630> stuffs<00:00:25.900> all<00:00:26.020> dried

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
old like the lubricant stuffs all dried

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.890 
old like the lubricant stuffs all dried
up<00:00:26.380> and<00:00:26.830> it's<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:28.090> know<00:00:28.120> it's<00:00:28.300> noisy<00:00:28.600> and

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
up and it's you know it's noisy and

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.450 
up and it's you know it's noisy and
rough<00:00:29.200> and<00:00:29.440> all<00:00:29.560> that<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:32.100> you<00:00:33.100> know<00:00:33.190> it's

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
rough and all that and you know it's

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.849 
rough and all that and you know it's
time<00:00:33.579> for<00:00:33.640> something<00:00:33.879> new<00:00:34.409> so<00:00:35.409> these<00:00:35.620> are

00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:35.859 
time for something new so these are

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:40.819 
time for something new so these are
really<00:00:36.339> sweet<00:00:39.569> okay

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
really sweet okay

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:52.189 
really sweet okay
all<00:00:41.829> right<00:00:42.039> check<00:00:42.219> this<00:00:42.339> out<00:00:42.579> oh<00:00:47.190> there<00:00:48.190> we<00:00:48.249> go

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.899 

these<00:00:53.199> are<00:00:53.379> Grimm<00:00:53.859> speed<00:00:54.159> I<00:00:54.429> think<00:00:54.819> they<00:00:54.879> just

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
these are Grimm speed I think they just

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.039 
these are Grimm speed I think they just
came<00:00:55.210> out<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.829> damn<00:00:57.729> near<00:00:57.999> 90<00:00:58.420> degree<00:00:58.719> angle

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.049 
came out so damn near 90 degree angle

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.719 
came out so damn near 90 degree angle
right<00:00:59.079> there<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.859> I<00:01:03.370> think<00:01:03.579> these<00:01:03.670> are

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:03.729 
right there and I think these are

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.560 
right there and I think these are
designed<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:04.830> pretty<00:01:05.830> much<00:01:06.010> lift<00:01:06.580> it<00:01:06.820> to<00:01:07.090> kind

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
designed to pretty much lift it to kind

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.930 
designed to pretty much lift it to kind
of<00:01:07.630> like<00:01:07.840> a<00:01:07.900> balancing<00:01:08.590> point<00:01:08.860> for<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.730> car<00:01:09.910> or

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
of like a balancing point for the car or

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.030 
of like a balancing point for the car or
something<00:01:10.420> like<00:01:10.540> that<00:01:10.600> so<00:01:11.470> you<00:01:11.530> know<00:01:11.770> it's<00:01:11.890> not

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
something like that so you know it's not

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.220 
something like that so you know it's not
so<00:01:12.670> much<00:01:12.850> stress<00:01:13.270> on<00:01:13.510> the<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:15.010> dampers<00:01:16.050> or<00:01:17.050> on

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
so much stress on the the dampers or on

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.280 
so much stress on the the dampers or on
the<00:01:17.320> car<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:19.060> yeah<00:01:19.210> not<00:01:19.390> only<00:01:19.660> does<00:01:19.870> it<00:01:19.900> you

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
the car so yeah not only does it you

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.620 
the car so yeah not only does it you
know<00:01:20.380> lift<00:01:20.710> up<00:01:20.950> a<00:01:21.160> lot<00:01:21.370> easier<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:21.970> sound<00:01:22.510> a

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
know lift up a lot easier and sound a

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.620 
know lift up a lot easier and sound a
lot<00:01:22.750> better<00:01:23.050> and<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.410> lot<00:01:23.500> smoother<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:25.060> you

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
lot better and a lot smoother but you

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.340 
lot better and a lot smoother but you
can<00:01:25.810> get<00:01:25.960> way<00:01:26.230> more<00:01:26.260> light<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.130> engine<00:01:27.400> bay

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
can get way more light to the engine bay

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.630 
can get way more light to the engine bay
look<00:01:29.350> at<00:01:29.440> that<00:01:29.560> you<00:01:29.650> can<00:01:29.680> like<00:01:29.950> pretty<00:01:30.520> much

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
look at that you can like pretty much

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.510 
look at that you can like pretty much
see<00:01:30.880> everything<00:01:31.090> now

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.149 

I<00:01:38.710> got<00:01:39.710> to<00:01:39.799> clean<00:01:39.979> that<00:01:40.159> up<00:01:40.189> I<00:01:41.590> have<00:01:42.590> some<00:01:42.860> stuff

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
I got to clean that up I have some stuff

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.800 
I got to clean that up I have some stuff
you<00:01:43.310> put<00:01:43.490> on<00:01:43.549> there<00:01:43.790> to<00:01:43.939> get<00:01:44.509> rid<00:01:44.570> of<00:01:44.810> that<00:01:46.810> and

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
you put on there to get rid of that and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.270 
you put on there to get rid of that and
now<00:01:48.049> I<00:01:48.080> haven't<00:01:48.320> installed<00:01:48.560> my<00:01:48.770> coil<00:01:48.979> overs

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
now I haven't installed my coil overs

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.779 
now I haven't installed my coil overs
yet<00:01:52.750> yeah<00:01:53.750> so<00:01:53.960> these<00:01:54.110> are<00:01:54.259> pre<00:01:54.409> beasts<00:01:54.789> and

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
yet yeah so these are pre beasts and

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.880 
yet yeah so these are pre beasts and
they're<00:01:56.299> not<00:01:56.390> like<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.720> typical<00:01:56.929> hood

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
they're not like the typical hood

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.160 
they're not like the typical hood
dampers<00:01:58.340> where<00:01:58.939> you<00:01:59.030> have<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.270> little<00:01:59.450> weird

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
dampers where you have the little weird

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.179 
dampers where you have the little weird
clip<00:02:01.330> there's<00:02:02.330> like<00:02:02.539> a<00:02:02.710> clip<00:02:03.710> that<00:02:03.740> goes

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
clip there's like a clip that goes

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.039 
clip there's like a clip that goes
around<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:04.759> goes<00:02:04.939> into<00:02:05.149> these<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:05.600> slit<00:02:06.020> here

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
around and goes into these a slit here

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.339 
around and goes into these a slit here
and<00:02:06.470> a<00:02:06.500> slit<00:02:06.710> underneath<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.310> it<00:02:07.399> comes<00:02:07.610> out

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
and a slit underneath and it comes out

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.710 
and a slit underneath and it comes out
where<00:02:09.349> it<00:02:09.440> catches<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.830> ball<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:11.330> I<00:02:11.360> literally

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
where it catches the ball so I literally

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.270 
where it catches the ball so I literally
just<00:02:12.049> snapped<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:12.590> on<00:02:12.709> there<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.040> now<00:02:13.130> it's

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
just snapped it on there and now it's

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.580 
just snapped it on there and now it's
pretty<00:02:13.489> much<00:02:13.640> locked

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
pretty much locked

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.199 
pretty much locked
the<00:02:15.590> only<00:02:15.709> problem<00:02:16.130> would<00:02:16.519> be<00:02:16.670> prying<00:02:17.090> it

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
the only problem would be prying it

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.630 
the only problem would be prying it
apart<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:19.400> then<00:02:20.090> these<00:02:20.269> have<00:02:20.569> like<00:02:21.350> flat<00:02:21.799> like

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
apart and then these have like flat like

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.699 
apart and then these have like flat like
a<00:02:22.670> flat<00:02:22.940> edge<00:02:23.090> on<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.360> inside<00:02:23.390> where<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.080> it's

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
a flat edge on the inside where it it's

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.580 
a flat edge on the inside where it it's
at<00:02:25.010> along<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.400> bracket<00:02:25.880> I<00:02:26.230> was<00:02:27.230> really<00:02:27.440> bad

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
at along the bracket I was really bad

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.140 
at along the bracket I was really bad
angle<00:02:27.920> isn't<00:02:28.069> hard<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.370> see<00:02:28.489> in<00:02:28.610> all<00:02:28.730> that<00:02:28.910> put

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
angle isn't hard to see in all that put

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.380 
angle isn't hard to see in all that put
it<00:02:30.110> pretty<00:02:30.230> much<00:02:30.410> isn't<00:02:30.680> going<00:02:30.860> anywhere<00:02:31.390> and

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
it pretty much isn't going anywhere and

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.770 
it pretty much isn't going anywhere and
all<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.230> new<00:02:33.350> hardware<00:02:34.269> it<00:02:35.269> actually<00:02:35.569> came

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
all the new hardware it actually came

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.410 
all the new hardware it actually came
with<00:02:35.840> like<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.739> washer<00:02:37.220> type<00:02:37.459> deal<00:02:37.730> actually

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
with like a washer type deal actually

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.990 
with like a washer type deal actually
made<00:02:39.049> onto<00:02:39.319> it<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.099> I<00:02:40.130> didn't<00:02:40.549> even<00:02:40.670> have<00:02:40.849> to

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
made onto it so I didn't even have to
