00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
butter great value actually it doesn't

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.330 
butter great value actually it doesn't
matter<00:00:15.500> it's<00:00:16.500> not<00:00:16.619> it's<00:00:16.770> not<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.039> chunky

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
matter it's not it's not the chunky

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.370 
matter it's not it's not the chunky
stuff<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.730> think<00:00:19.010> and<00:00:20.010> coffee<00:00:20.490> filters<00:00:21.140> okay<00:00:22.140> we

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
stuff I think and coffee filters okay we

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.620 
stuff I think and coffee filters okay we
drink<00:00:22.619> coffee<00:00:22.800> here<00:00:23.189> at<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.430> house<00:00:24.619> and<00:00:26.630> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
drink coffee here at the house and the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.349 
drink coffee here at the house and the
reason<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.019> use<00:00:28.050> coffee<00:00:28.470> filters<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.849> think

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
reason we use coffee filters is I think

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.100 
reason we use coffee filters is I think
it's<00:00:30.480> because<00:00:30.750> it's<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.260> very<00:00:31.289> very<00:00:31.769> soft<00:00:33.110> it's

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
it's because it's a very very soft it's

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.130 
it's because it's a very very soft it's
not<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.380> little<00:00:34.530> soft<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.130> more<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.840> don't<00:00:36.840> know<00:00:36.930> I

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
not a little soft is more I don't know I

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.040 
not a little soft is more I don't know I
read<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.530> somewhere<00:00:37.680> okay<00:00:38.070> now<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:39.690> reason<00:00:39.750> we

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
read it somewhere okay now the reason we

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.830 
read it somewhere okay now the reason we
use<00:00:40.110> peanut<00:00:40.530> butters<00:00:40.800> because<00:00:41.540> it<00:00:42.540> smells

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
use peanut butters because it smells

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.340 
use peanut butters because it smells
good
