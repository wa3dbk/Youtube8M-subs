00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
is the best of that species know a lot

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.670 
is the best of that species know a lot
of<00:01:08.490> these<00:01:08.700> are<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.180> not<00:01:09.540> really<00:01:09.869> quite<00:01:10.470> what

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
of these are just not really quite what

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.150 
of these are just not really quite what
I'm<00:01:10.800> looking<00:01:10.830> for<00:01:11.690> the<00:01:12.860> flowers<00:01:13.860> are<00:01:13.979> not

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
I'm looking for the flowers are not

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160 
I'm looking for the flowers are not
maybe<00:01:14.700> sitting<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.180> same<00:01:15.330> focal<00:01:15.840> plane<00:01:16.020> so

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
maybe sitting in the same focal plane so

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.660 
maybe sitting in the same focal plane so
i<00:01:16.229> won't<00:01:16.410> you<00:01:16.500> keep<00:01:16.770> everything<00:01:17.100> sharp<00:01:17.460> or

just<00:01:36.550> in<00:01:36.730> one<00:01:36.880> focal<00:01:37.300> planes<00:01:37.540> I'll<00:01:37.780> be<00:01:37.870> able<00:01:37.930> to

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020

this<00:03:13.050> work<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:14.670> first<00:03:14.880> thing<00:03:15.030> we<00:03:15.120> need<00:03:15.240> to<00:03:15.300> do

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
this work the first thing we need to do

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.140 
this work the first thing we need to do
is<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.590> determine<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.130> best<00:03:17.310> exposure<00:03:17.820> for

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
is to determine the best exposure for

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.000 
is to determine the best exposure for
the<00:03:18.270> background<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:18.990> best<00:03:19.200> exposure<00:03:19.620> is

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
the background and the best exposure is

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.750 
the background and the best exposure is
where<00:03:20.790> its<00:03:21.380> 255<00:03:22.380> in<00:03:22.560> each<00:03:22.770> channel<00:03:23.250> but<00:03:23.490> only

where its 255 in each channel but only

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.120 
where its 255 in each channel but only
just<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:24.390> want<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.350> background<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.830> be<00:03:25.920> fully

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
just I want the background to be fully

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.610 
just I want the background to be fully
exposed<00:03:26.610> but<00:03:27.150> not<00:03:27.360> so<00:03:27.780> much<00:03:27.930> like<00:03:28.260> spilling

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
exposed but not so much like spilling

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.800 
exposed but not so much like spilling
forward<00:03:29.130> onto<00:03:29.340> subject<00:03:29.910> it<00:03:30.090> then<00:03:30.480> becomes

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
forward onto subject it then becomes

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.810 
forward onto subject it then becomes
difficult<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.560> separate<00:03:31.980> subject<00:03:32.700> and

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
difficult to separate subject and

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.770 
difficult to separate subject and
background<00:03:34.760> in<00:03:35.760> order<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.120> do<00:03:36.240> this<00:03:36.420> we<00:03:36.480> need

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
background in order to do this we need

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.140 
background in order to do this we need
to<00:03:36.840> move<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.470> front<00:03:38.070> light<00:03:38.490> source<00:03:38.760> out<00:03:39.000> the

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
to move the front light source out the

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.210 
to move the front light source out the
way<00:03:39.270> first<00:03:39.440> because<00:03:40.440> all<00:03:40.740> we're<00:03:40.920> doing<00:03:41.130> is

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
way first because all we're doing is

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.320 
way first because all we're doing is
concentrating<00:03:41.460> and<00:03:42.000> getting<00:03:42.240> that

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
concentrating and getting that

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.040 
concentrating and getting that

background pure white flash powered up

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.530 
background pure white flash powered up
and<00:03:47.810> i'm<00:03:48.810> just<00:03:48.900> going<00:03:49.110> to<00:03:49.580> guess<00:03:50.580> the<00:03:51.030> exposure

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
and i'm just going to guess the exposure

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.540 
and i'm just going to guess the exposure
at<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.720> outset<00:03:52.110> got<00:03:52.620> my<00:03:52.740> sync<00:03:52.980> speed<00:03:53.130> set<00:03:53.520> at

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
at the outset got my sync speed set at

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.360 
at the outset got my sync speed set at
160th<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.720> we'll<00:03:55.290> start<00:03:55.560> off<00:03:55.740> with<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.070> flash

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
160th and we'll start off with the flash

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:04.980 
160th and we'll start off with the flash
power<00:03:56.670> quite<00:03:57.000> low<00:03:57.210> and<00:03:57.830> f<00:03:58.830> 20

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.230 

now<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.620> histogram<00:04:06.160> tells<00:04:06.490> me<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:06.970> although

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
now the histogram tells me that although

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.210 
now the histogram tells me that although
part<00:04:07.810> of<00:04:07.990> the<00:04:08.110> background<00:04:08.290> is<00:04:08.770> blinking

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
part of the background is blinking

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.820 
part of the background is blinking
therefore<00:04:09.640> fully<00:04:09.940> overexposed<00:04:10.750> another<00:04:11.530> part

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
therefore fully overexposed another part

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.410 
therefore fully overexposed another part
of<00:04:11.920> it<00:04:12.010> is<00:04:12.100> not<00:04:12.340> quite<00:04:12.610> there<00:04:12.820> yet<00:04:12.850> so<00:04:13.240> we'll

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
of it is not quite there yet so we'll

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.930 
of it is not quite there yet so we'll
increase<00:04:14.050> the<00:04:14.230> power<00:04:14.440> by<00:04:14.770> a<00:04:15.070> third<00:04:15.490> of<00:04:15.610> a<00:04:15.670> stop

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
increase the power by a third of a stop

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:23.330 
increase the power by a third of a stop
on<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.209> flash<00:04:17.790> try<00:04:18.790> that<00:04:18.940> again

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.909 

and<00:04:23.430> this<00:04:24.180> time<00:04:24.480> is<00:04:24.990> that<00:04:25.169> third<00:04:25.500> of<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.680> stock

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
and this time is that third of the stock

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.090 
and this time is that third of the stock
made<00:04:26.130> all<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.430> difference<00:04:26.610> so<00:04:27.330> it's<00:04:27.540> showing

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
made all the difference so it's showing

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.040 
made all the difference so it's showing
pure<00:04:29.100> white<00:04:29.370> for<00:04:29.850> the<00:04:29.910> whole<00:04:30.120> background<00:04:30.360> but

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
pure white for the whole background but

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.990 
pure white for the whole background but
of<00:04:31.139> course<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.770> front<00:04:32.310> of<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.490> subject<00:04:32.880> is<00:04:32.970> a

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
of course the front of the subject is a

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.750 
of course the front of the subject is a
bit<00:04:33.210> under<00:04:33.510> lit<00:04:33.750> so<00:04:34.740> now<00:04:35.130> we've<00:04:35.310> got<00:04:35.490> the

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
bit under lit so now we've got the

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.909 
bit under lit so now we've got the
exposure<00:04:36.720> for<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:36.900> background<00:04:37.110> sorted<00:04:37.800> out

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
exposure for the background sorted out

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.670 
exposure for the background sorted out
we<00:04:38.370> just<00:04:38.520> need<00:04:38.669> a<00:04:38.699> front<00:04:39.150> light<00:04:39.419> so<00:04:40.199> can<00:04:40.440> swing

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
we just need a front light so can swing

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:48.710 
we just need a front light so can swing
this<00:04:40.800> background

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.020 

and<00:04:49.290> it's<00:04:49.410> perfect<00:04:49.830> the<00:04:50.520> backgrounds

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
and it's perfect the backgrounds

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.430 
and it's perfect the backgrounds
blinking<00:04:51.420> away<00:04:51.480> so<00:04:51.630> it's<00:04:51.990> properly

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
blinking away so it's properly

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.910 
blinking away so it's properly
overexposed<00:04:53.070> and<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:54.660> front<00:04:55.170> of<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:55.470> subject

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
overexposed and the front of the subject

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.430 
overexposed and the front of the subject
is<00:04:56.100> very<00:04:56.640> nicely<00:04:56.910> lit<00:04:57.300> I'm<00:04:57.660> going<00:04:58.170> to<00:04:58.260> pull<00:04:58.410> it

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
is very nicely lit I'm going to pull it

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.900 
is very nicely lit I'm going to pull it
up<00:04:58.620> to<00:04:58.740> one<00:04:58.830> hundred<00:04:58.860> percent<00:04:59.070> there's<00:04:59.550> lots

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
up to one hundred percent there's lots

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.660 
up to one hundred percent there's lots
and<00:05:00.180> lots<00:05:00.480> of<00:05:00.630> detail<00:05:00.960> there<00:05:01.550> now<00:05:02.550> I'm

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
and lots of detail there now I'm

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.320 
and lots of detail there now I'm
hand-holding<00:05:03.420> because<00:05:04.460> the<00:05:05.460> flash<00:05:06.120> duration

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
hand-holding because the flash duration

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.510 
hand-holding because the flash duration
is<00:05:06.630> so<00:05:06.810> short<00:05:07.110> that<00:05:07.410> I<00:05:07.560> don't<00:05:07.770> need<00:05:08.040> to<00:05:08.370> have

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
is so short that I don't need to have

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.250 
is so short that I don't need to have
the<00:05:08.610> camera<00:05:08.940> and<00:05:09.030> a<00:05:09.060> tripod<00:05:09.270> to<00:05:09.870> get<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:09.990> sharp

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
the camera and a tripod to get a sharp

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.980 
the camera and a tripod to get a sharp
picture<00:05:10.650> and<00:05:11.420> even<00:05:12.420> if<00:05:12.480> it's<00:05:12.630> a<00:05:12.720> little<00:05:12.900> bit

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990
