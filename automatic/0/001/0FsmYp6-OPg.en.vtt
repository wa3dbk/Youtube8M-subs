 I'm here to bring you a new scoop 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.340
 national builders are happy 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.570
 than the first video or that of Senegal 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.690

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.870
 ivory that was requested of me 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.640
 so much and in the next episode vi 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.590
 I will bring the chile that it also was 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.539
 you demanded a lot though 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.949
 keep leaving like continue on 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.660

 tell me what teams you want in the next 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.580
 episodes to make them maybe even more 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.890
 let's say I like the teams a bit 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.870
 tropical exotic beautiful let us do it anyway 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.130
 let me know what in the comments 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.890
 favorite so I would say start 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.800
 immediately ivory coast very strong team 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.710
 budget not even too high a team 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.410
 ascom and very competitive still used 4 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.989
 3 3 3 in brackets that those two cdc 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.180
 and the central cc then I would say to leave 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.270
 immediately with the goalkeeper meanwhile imposed 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.770
 here is the goalkeeper and silver 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.320
 Sorrentine classic Ivorian goalkeeper 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:04.110
 that makes agreement with one of the two defenders 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.200
 central for which I put him why 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.470
 wanting there was like a porter 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.869
 Ivorian that type there that also came out 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.640
 but man of the match did not do me 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.259
 honestly crazy I didn't want 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.030
 spend all those credits for a 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.710
 goalkeeper who then maybe even did 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.869
 disgust anyway Sorrento is me 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.670
 really liked very good statistics 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.860
 pity that it is not very fast, however it is 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.700
 really a good goalkeeper then we go 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.990
 immediately set up a championship here 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.689
 nationality called ivory coast and we should 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.820
 find it here ivory coast tb e 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.759
 east but you can also use ox like 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.740
 as you have seen heaven now really is 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.689
 strong obviously to make the team more 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.490
 competitive as possible where you can too 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.070
 buy the various iv because there are 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.030
 they came out different or not match that one 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.799
 what do you want 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.710
 now it is very strong and fast good 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.880
 good pass good shot excellent in 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.399
 really good physical defense 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.560
 great right back who also tall 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.229
 high he attacks and defends with great 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.970
 ease then central defender of 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.659
 right used kolo toure is his 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.330
 version iv 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.560
 so if you want something stronger 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.690
 point there is version iv 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.190
 but I must say that the defense to me is 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.930
 really liked it so much because immediately 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.450
 type 12 flies at the most in five 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.040
 games I played and so I have to 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.580
 say that it is very solid as fast as 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.099
 enough strong head and defensively 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.110
 impenetrable like any other bamboo 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.700
 obamba his department mate is there 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.040
 also its version of the IT of 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.980
 transfer I loved bamboo so much 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.260
 he doesn't have much he has only 72 defense 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.000
 could have something more obviously 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.860
 but I must say that I liked it so much 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.530
 very dangerous head especially on 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.319
 relatively low corner place then 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.140
 I advise you to try Bamba too 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.670
 left-back used traore is there 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.459
 even a version of it I don't remember 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.470
 where he plays and wanting there is also bakayoko 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.360
 which is very good in the premier league 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.670
 however used traorÃ¨ because I go out to me 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.350
 has better statistics 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.569
 very fast discreet shot for a bronze 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.250
 well the dribbling excellent pass 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.590
 however the player is very complete e 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.420
 strong in defense in left-handed physique that 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.209
 play left with an assist in the cycle 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.799
 matches paid 2,500 credits I have to say 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.660
 which satisfied me a lot like 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.510
 player because he is really strong 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.750
 then we go to midfield we find how 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.430
 cdc right-handed with his head 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.799
 huge there is a forehead that girls 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.290
 but very high in the game is really strong 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.220
 because he manages to recover a slaughterhouse of 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.829
 balloons 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.380
 unfortunately it is not a large sorting machine 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.840
 as you can see 66 in passing is not 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.750
 shooting is also the maximum in life 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.359
 from the distance does not make sparks just a 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.819
 56 however for the role that must do that is 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.109
 recovers balls and perfect as of 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.250
 his is also very good 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:53.620
 department mate series d and that is me 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.900
 like icing and fast more than anything else 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.459
 manages to give good speed to the 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.840
 offensive maneuver especially in the 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.359
 counterattacks because a team that does 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.250
 many counter-attacks is a player 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.829
 quite complete pity that it did not 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.690
 a decent shot otherwise it would have been 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.030
 even stronger 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.620
 s recovers many balls in defense 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.480
 basically the role you make I have you 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.190
 the strongest player on the team 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.080
 according to me the cc and could not miss 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.170
 the boys and girls tour is a player 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.150
 phenomenal that I think is the 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.420
 best midfielder of the game because 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.850
 complete and very strong because he scores goals 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.760
 makes assists for the ball recovers the 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.980
 balloon physically is a mountain with 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.720
 90 of physical I want issued 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.040
 catalyst which increases speed 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.170
 passage then becomes even more 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.120
 a strong player for my style 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.160
 gaming is perfect because it recovers 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.510
 many balls and above all succeeds 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.220
 to sort them out to also shoot from 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.530
 perfect distance indeed made me 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.690
 like three longshot goals really 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.660
 beautiful so I have to say that it is too 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.970
 a phenomenal player costs 100,000 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.010
 credits but it is worth it all my life 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.290
 then we go with the attack we find how 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.680
 right wing stamps the fastest player 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:05.200
 of the game and is also a great has a 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.250
 great shot i have to say using in 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.820
 this team made me a couple of 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.200
 goal also a very nice longshot 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.200
 I must say that on the break it is lethal 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.400
 for which it is enough to see its speed 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.500
 also a great dribble to be a 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.760
 bronze is also a great shot then 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.180
 I must say that I really liked it 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.130
 so much stamps then as left wing is 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.410
 used gervinho which therefore lucky 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.480
 however however it is also strong 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.640
 in counterattacks and devastating anyway 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.740
 marks with good continuity and also makes 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.900
 lots of assists even if you don't have a shot e 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.000
 a very high pass pity that not 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.400
 four-star abilities would have made it 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.560
 fencing is a devastating wing yes but it is 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.840
 so yes he liked me so much too 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.480
 but obviously the strongest player 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.910
 because he is bankrupt the team is without 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.130
 Doumbia doubt that used that of 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.140
 cska you can also use drugs but I don't know 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.490
 how much it suits you if you have a player 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.100
 who takes the ball and solves the matches 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.930
 like doumbia who scores more goals than games 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.060
 play and in any case there are also many 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.280
 assist by seeing him so he is a player 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.200
 phenomenal then look even more into 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.770
 low 46 ability make this 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.930
 player 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.480
 let's say the player the attacker the most 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.300
 strong of the game because it manages to score goals 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.910
 in any way in any case 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.190
 any team in any position 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.930
 and with any training I think 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.580
 so raga not us 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.110
