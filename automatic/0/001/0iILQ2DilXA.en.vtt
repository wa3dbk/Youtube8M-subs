00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.730
 ruth 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.330
 hello then do not shut up 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.830
 welcome to a new video I'm the one 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.510
 have you already see the way how 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.890
 get the fantastic car 'in gta 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.560
 online since many of you have asked me 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.730
 in the fantastic car video 'well 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.770
 that there goes the explanation of how 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.060
 get it the first thing I'll do its 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.590
 location not really found 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.180
 no specific location where 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.330
 can you say chicken always appears 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.650
 here if it is not something rather random 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.660
 but aside always for these are the 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.090
 map that he pointed out and also in many 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.290
 sometimes it appears in port or whether 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.910
 do not forget to stop by if you do not 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.280
 you find because it is usually for that 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.900
 zone is worth downtown area and the 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.280
 port in the case of streets of 2000 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.920
 turns by accident is the car 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.250
 just look for a new session very 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.770
 easy lets it be online embodied to 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.330
 session and ready ok but what happens this 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.680
 car answered as people frequently 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.479
 but there are many sessions in which 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.009
 is there for a thousand laps that you do not 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.470
 you'll count then easier to give to 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.479
 search new session enter a session 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.160
 and search through the car be like this or 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.220
 wind we insulate from the car simply 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.750
 has not session and ready in this case and is 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.340
 looking for the downtown area the city 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.960
 but as I said before answer 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.070
 also quite often in the 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.390
 port 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.820
 and as you will see it does not cost me much 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.920
 find one simply when I turn 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.510
 a corner I find a riner amount 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.860
 but okay this is not the one we have 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.320
 find since you have two openings 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.480
 at the top of the roof there 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.070
 however, we will take it 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.690
 since it means that the files are 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.730
 charged and it will cost us less to find 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.620
 one equal to this one is worth the cousins ​​in the 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.350
 car and we also have a ride 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.780
 let's find an equal but with the roof 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.890
 closed since it is not an accessory that I 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.250
 have seen in the workshop that you can 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.020
 change it 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.750
 so it's very important that you look for one 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.520
 without the two holes in the ceiling but pass 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.620
 to fast camera since I am simply 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.600
 I looking for the car in the city 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.890
 I do not think it's relevant only 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.870
 be two rounds around the city to see if 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.430
 I find it in the downtown area 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.010
 forever 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.989
 well over here I found a car with 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.700
 the closed roof as you see is this and not 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.400
 it has holes in the roof only 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.319
 they are glass 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.120
 I think we have to choose the car 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.810
 take to the workshop and now he explained how 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.810
 you have to create it 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.820
 I will show you also what they are 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.230
 found if you want to be more for 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.090
 there but I already tell you can appear 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.640
 because it is part of the city of the area 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.120
 which marks in the central part but I say 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.120
 where it was 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.620
 once you have that the car directs to 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.220
 the saints fair 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.319
 and I was like the fantastic car of 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.549
 good video that we get to losantos 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.549
 we just put the car inside 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.030
 if you have the model in case you want it 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.980
 point it down now we have to give to 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.530
 repair 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.920
 we go to in vitro painting for 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.390
 main black matte and had to put 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.560
 the both the principal and the color 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.560
 secondary in black worth 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.250
 the second would be to go to the windows 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.200
 and put the limousines 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.200
 OK 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.280
 and then one of the most important 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.390
 it would be the wheels to have to go in 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.390
 the wheels you have to put 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:06.780
 but there were not types of wheels there 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.780
 raiders look for a flat these 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.140
 you are here with these wheels and you put them 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.170
 in the tire users you put them in 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.420
 black, you'll already have the car 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.700
 fantastic and you put the amount that 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.410
 you want all those things is worth and one 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.790
 complete the car's sensors because 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.260
 I honestly do not have pasta right now 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.330
 to do it instead what I'm going to 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.370
 to do is show the car how it has 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.490
 that the good finishes like 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.820
 It has to stay and you fix according to that 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.470
 well then well 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.880
 look at the other laps to the car to 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.800
 that you can see how good to look at all 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.640
 the details but simply those 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.530
 matt colors black flat tires 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.970
 lowriders cerebrito silvery windows 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.100
 limousine and you will have the car 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.780
