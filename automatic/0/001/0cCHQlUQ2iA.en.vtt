today I'm making this video actually
from<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.660> spring<00:00:10.500> that's<00:00:11.040> right<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.059> my

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
from a spring that's right this is my

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.959 
from a spring that's right this is my
brother<00:00:12.480> Joe<00:00:12.960> right<00:00:13.200> here<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.830> I'm<00:00:14.549> making<00:00:14.849> it

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
brother Joe right here and I'm making it

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.180 
brother Joe right here and I'm making it
from<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.389> spring<00:00:15.990> which<00:00:16.440> down<00:00:16.710> here<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.039> where

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
from a spring which down here is where

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.220 
from a spring which down here is where
the<00:00:17.279> spring<00:00:17.490> water<00:00:17.670> flows<00:00:17.970> as<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.750> can<00:00:18.900> see<00:00:19.109> in

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
the spring water flows as you can see in

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.910 
the spring water flows as you can see in
here<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.680> actually<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> spring<00:00:21.150> water<00:00:21.920> Springs

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
here is actually a spring water Springs

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.650 
here is actually a spring water Springs
pulling<00:00:23.460> from<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.789> spring<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.210> I'm<00:00:24.300> gonna<00:00:24.449> hand

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
pulling from a spring so I'm gonna hand

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.230 
pulling from a spring so I'm gonna hand
the<00:00:25.350> camcorder<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.980> Joe<00:00:26.279> he's<00:00:26.609> going<00:00:27.180> to

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
the camcorder to Joe he's going to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.540 
the camcorder to Joe he's going to
record<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.750> while<00:00:27.990> I'm<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.470> this<00:00:29.189> spring

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
record it while I'm in this spring

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.540 
record it while I'm in this spring
recording<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:31.070> basically<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.219> can<00:00:32.340> see<00:00:32.489> in

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
recording so basically you can see in

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.120 
recording so basically you can see in
here<00:00:32.700> basically<00:00:32.910> i<00:00:33.620> recommend<00:00:34.620> spring<00:00:34.920> water

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
here basically i recommend spring water

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.130 
here basically i recommend spring water
so<00:00:35.489> if<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.670> want<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.850> like<00:00:36.030> zoom<00:00:36.899> out<00:00:37.079> icon

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
so if you want to like zoom out icon

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.260 
so if you want to like zoom out icon
children<00:00:37.620> ready<00:00:37.980> as<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.340> just<00:00:38.520> fly<00:00:39.090> like

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
children ready as you can just fly like

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.690 
children ready as you can just fly like
a<00:00:39.300> see<00:00:39.570> me<00:00:39.719> whatever<00:00:40.110> um<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.190> basically<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
a see me whatever um so basically the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.240 
a see me whatever um so basically the
spring<00:00:41.969> water<00:00:42.180> flows<00:00:42.510> through<00:00:42.750> here<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.250> it

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
spring water flows through here and it

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.160 
spring water flows through here and it
comes<00:00:44.700> from<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> spring<00:00:45.390> now<00:00:45.600> strings<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.110> can

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
comes from a spring now strings you can

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.400 
comes from a spring now strings you can
stuck<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.190> see<00:00:47.430> my<00:00:47.550> face<00:00:47.760> are<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.410> so

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
stuck here I see my face are you so

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.560 
stuck here I see my face are you so
basically<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.920> spring<00:00:50.460> comes<00:00:51.030> out<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
basically a spring comes out of the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.689 
basically a spring comes out of the
ground<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.500> what<00:00:52.620> happens<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.550> basically

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
ground and what happens is it basically

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.639 
ground and what happens is it basically
has<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.660> much<00:00:54.750> energy<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.410> little

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
has so much energy that a little

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.740 
has so much energy that a little
literally<00:00:56.160> burst<00:00:56.430> out<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.789> ground<00:00:56.969> so

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
literally burst out of the ground so

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.000 
literally burst out of the ground so
when<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.020> drink<00:00:58.260> spring<00:00:58.590> water<00:00:58.800> you're

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
when you drink spring water you're

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.150 
when you drink spring water you're
actually<00:00:59.190> getting<00:00:59.660> minerals<00:01:00.770> energy<00:01:01.770> and

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
actually getting minerals energy and

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.950 
actually getting minerals energy and
water<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.969> actually<00:01:03.329> comes<00:01:03.539> right<00:01:03.809> out<00:01:03.840> of

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
water that actually comes right out of

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.840 
water that actually comes right out of
earth<00:01:04.170> itself<00:01:04.559> now<00:01:05.159> when<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.339> drink<00:01:05.580> tap

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
earth itself now when you drink tap

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.130 
earth itself now when you drink tap
water<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.240> reason<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.510> don't<00:01:06.659> recommend<00:01:06.869> tap

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
water the reason I don't recommend tap

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.230 
water the reason I don't recommend tap
water<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.500> because<00:01:07.770> tap<00:01:08.040> waters<00:01:08.460> contain

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
water is because tap waters contain

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.789 
water is because tap waters contain
health<00:01:09.810> sodium<00:01:10.439> fluoride<00:01:11.330> glory<00:01:12.650> traces<00:01:13.650> of

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
things like that and also tap water is

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.560 
things like that and also tap water is

it's<00:01:29.370> stagnant<00:01:29.940> the<00:01:30.480> water<00:01:30.720> actually<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.500> dead

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
it's stagnant the water actually is dead

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.980 
it's stagnant the water actually is dead
and<00:01:32.160> spring<00:01:32.820> water<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.150> alive<00:01:33.420> because<00:01:33.690> it's

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
and spring water is alive because it's

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.870 
and spring water is alive because it's
flowing<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.680> constantly<00:01:35.280> moving<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.730> into

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
flowing it's constantly moving it into

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.430 
flowing it's constantly moving it into
the<00:01:36.030> floor<00:01:36.300> you<00:01:36.390> can<00:01:36.450> hit<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> stream<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
the floor you can hit the stream the

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.080 
the floor you can hit the stream the
spring<00:01:37.680> water<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.010> constantly<00:01:38.280> moving<00:01:38.730> and

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
spring water is constantly moving and

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.640 
spring water is constantly moving and
that's<00:01:39.420> good<00:01:39.660> for<00:01:39.690> your<00:01:39.960> body<00:01:40.050> because<00:01:40.440> you'll

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
that's good for your body because you'll

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.980 
that's good for your body because you'll
either<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.640> live<00:01:41.970> water<00:01:42.240> or<00:01:42.540> dead<00:01:42.750> water

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
either have a live water or dead water

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.770 
either have a live water or dead water
now<00:01:43.290> like<00:01:43.800> I<00:01:43.890> said<00:01:43.950> dead<00:01:44.280> water<00:01:44.460> tap<00:01:45.330> water<00:01:45.540> has

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
now like I said dead water tap water has
