00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everybody in this video is to show how the 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.480
 cleaning bad time of your micro can 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.069
 help reduce noise and 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.349
 irritants 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.139
 notice that the noise of the children is well 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.299
 high and part of that problem 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.230
 because of the accumulated dirt between the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.420
 computer parts 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.670
 let's turn off the computer disconnect 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.320
 the cars to start cleaning 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.849
 just remembering that if you do not have any 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.710
 experience is not advised that you 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.360
 do this without the assistance of someone 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.470
 understand otherwise you can 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.470
 damage the equipment 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.890
 I just unmounted the pc then as 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.410
 You can realize now you're going to stay. 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.530
 easier to take the mound and open it 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.430
 clean the fan 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.430
 Let's take the screws here. 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.350
 I already managed to take it started. 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.350
 easy to open it 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.130
 the situation does not criticize either is a link 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.140
 needing a good cleaning 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.140
 Come on then it's opening the source. 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.189
 now let's remove peanuts from the source 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.189
 for easy cleaning 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.960
 Good, I'm using a damp cloth to 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.670
 clean 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.220
 in this case the most correct would be to use the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.380
 equipment art project and that 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.440
 you should avoid making the most of the radio 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.780
 imagine using a damp cloth so I know 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.240
 that this is the way more and more and more 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.670
 correct it then use this 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.230
 video only for information 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.560
 But now when I see the only 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.560
 viewer 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.000
 I'm going to leave now, I'll put him back 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.600
 including the computer 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.200
 it means that the police are 100% clean 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.850
 practically impossible now as you 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.050
 can you observe I'm putting it back 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.050
 fan at the source 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.000
 Okay, I already put it back in its due 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.870
 the two fans already put the 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.570
 source 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.900
 and is now reconnecting it to the 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.900
 motherboard 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.820
 ah 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.950
 the hitachi of addiction 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:43.520
 Ok I already rode again and we will aim 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.669
 the father that the handsome one who had a 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.900
 start 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.900
 it's much smaller 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:20.080
 so I have to like the video and 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.080
 next
