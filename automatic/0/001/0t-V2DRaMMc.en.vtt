hey folks your Minecraft I'm in here and
it's<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.540> number<00:00:12.840> sort<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.710> bad<00:00:13.950> map<00:00:14.340> where

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
it's a number sort of bad map where

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.970 
it's a number sort of bad map where
again<00:00:15.030> where<00:00:15.630> we<00:00:15.750> gonna<00:00:15.990> go<00:00:16.139> play<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> bad<00:00:16.740> map

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
again where we gonna go play a bad map

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.070 
again where we gonna go play a bad map
wells<00:00:17.220> might<00:00:17.490> not<00:00:17.640> necessarily<00:00:18.060> be<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.660> bad<00:00:18.720> map

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080

key that is nifty gold ingot so if i

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.760 
key that is nifty gold ingot so if i
give<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.210> an<00:00:48.390> old<00:00:48.539> gold<00:00:48.840> ingot<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.320> give<00:00:49.500> me<00:00:49.739> a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
give you an old gold ingot you give me a

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.029 
give you an old gold ingot you give me a
key<00:00:51.110> okay<00:00:52.250> can<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.340> open<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.730> key<00:00:53.910> with<00:00:54.090> this

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
key okay can I open the key with this

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:01.490 
key okay can I open the key with this
keyhole<00:00:57.469> so<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.680> drop<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.340> here<00:00:59.850> oh<00:01:00.500> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
keyhole so if I drop this in here oh the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.969 
keyhole so if I drop this in here oh the
door<00:01:01.680> actually<00:01:01.800> opens<00:01:03.320> can<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.350> take<00:01:04.830> this

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
door actually opens can I take this

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.469 
door actually opens can I take this
grass<00:01:05.280> block<00:01:06.920> maybe<00:01:07.920> not<00:01:08.130> oh<00:01:10.220> I<00:01:11.479> can't

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
grass block maybe not oh I can't

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.730 
grass block maybe not oh I can't
stealing<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.080> what<00:01:13.200> if<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.380> go<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.860> I

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
stealing it what if I go like this I

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.660 
stealing it what if I go like this I
thought<00:01:16.740> at<00:01:16.860> all<00:01:16.950> hopefully<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.369> don't<00:01:17.520> need<00:01:17.610> to

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
thought at all hopefully I don't need to

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.230 
thought at all hopefully I don't need to
get<00:01:17.820> back<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.090> there<00:01:18.920> lever<00:01:19.939> we<00:01:20.939> found<00:01:21.150> a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
get back in there lever we found a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.060 
get back in there lever we found a
leavers<00:01:21.720> we're<00:01:21.900> gonna<00:01:22.049> pull<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.350> lever<00:01:22.560> is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
leavers we're gonna pull that lever is

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.370 
leavers we're gonna pull that lever is
poor<00:01:23.810> apparently<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.869> one<00:01:25.049> doesn't<00:01:25.200> do

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
poor apparently that one doesn't do

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.499 
poor apparently that one doesn't do
anything<00:01:26.390> um<00:01:28.909> that<00:01:29.909> one<00:01:30.060> did<00:01:30.210> something

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
anything um that one did something

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.170 
anything um that one did something
something<00:01:31.380> something<00:01:31.850> okay<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:32.939> come<00:01:33.090> over

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
something something okay we come over

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.149 
something something okay we come over
here<00:01:33.860> hint<00:01:34.860> we<00:01:35.579> got<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> hint<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:37.710> hint<00:01:37.920> says

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
here hint we got a hint the hint says

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.980 
here hint we got a hint the hint says
this<00:01:38.729> design<00:01:39.329> uses<00:01:39.780> an<00:01:39.930> XOR<00:01:40.409> gate<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:41.520> means

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
this design uses an XOR gate that means

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:49.670 
this design uses an XOR gate that means
um<00:01:45.979> it's<00:01:46.979> not<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.340> or<00:01:47.630> this<00:01:48.630> xor<00:01:49.110> xor<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
um it's not and or this xor xor is the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.410 
um it's not and or this xor xor is the
opposite<00:01:50.040> that's<00:01:50.220> an<00:01:50.340> or<00:01:50.520> gate<00:01:50.549> right<00:01:52.520> oops<00:01:53.520> so

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
opposite that's an or gate right oops so

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.510 
opposite that's an or gate right oops so
let's<00:01:54.600> look<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.110> okay<00:01:55.619> we<00:01:55.770> got<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.040> we<00:01:56.369> are

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
let's look that okay we got it we are

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.850 
let's look that okay we got it we are

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
hey hey Shh she's gerbils my gerbils are

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.130 
hey hey Shh she's gerbils my gerbils are
awake<00:02:15.170> they're<00:02:15.439> making<00:02:15.680> noise<00:02:15.829> um<00:02:17.019> so<00:02:18.019> we're

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
awake they're making noise um so we're

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.970 
awake they're making noise um so we're
gonna<00:02:18.230> shoot<00:02:18.650> this<00:02:20.260> okay<00:02:21.260> we<00:02:21.500> can<00:02:21.650> deal<00:02:21.829> with

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
gonna shoot this okay we can deal with

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.949 
gonna shoot this okay we can deal with
this<00:02:22.159> this<00:02:22.519> is<00:02:22.819> uh<00:02:22.849> this<00:02:23.209> is<00:02:23.480> turning<00:02:23.689> out<00:02:23.900> to

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
this this is uh this is turning out to

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:30.839 
this this is uh this is turning out to
be<00:02:24.109> a<00:02:24.230> pretty<00:02:24.379> good<00:02:24.530> bad<00:02:24.890> map<00:02:25.129> weekend<00:02:25.640> oh<00:02:28.420> oh

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
be a pretty good bad map weekend oh oh

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.910 
be a pretty good bad map weekend oh oh
oh<00:02:31.849> oh<00:02:32.180> okay<00:02:33.109> maybe<00:02:33.469> there<00:02:33.680> should<00:02:33.799> be<00:02:33.889> a

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
oh oh okay maybe there should be a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.949 
oh oh okay maybe there should be a
little<00:02:34.010> more<00:02:34.129> water<00:02:34.340> down<00:02:34.639> here<00:02:34.879> I<00:02:35.060> think<00:02:35.870> I

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
little more water down here I think I

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:44.020 
little more water down here I think I
figured<00:02:36.019> it<00:02:36.379> out<00:02:36.639> so<00:02:37.639> we'd<00:02:37.790> come<00:02:37.879> over<00:02:38.209> here<00:02:43.030> is

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
figured it out so we'd come over here is

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.399 
figured it out so we'd come over here is
that<00:02:44.180> stuck<00:02:44.450> in<00:02:44.689> it<00:02:44.900> now<00:02:46.930> I'm<00:02:47.930> just<00:02:48.109> gonna<00:02:48.230> keep

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
that stuck in it now I'm just gonna keep

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:57.629 
that stuck in it now I'm just gonna keep
shooting<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:48.829> oh<00:02:49.329> come<00:02:50.329> on<00:02:50.599> oh<00:02:54.730> oh<00:02:55.730> oh<00:02:55.879> I<00:02:56.060> did<00:02:56.450> it

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
shooting it oh come on oh oh oh I did it
