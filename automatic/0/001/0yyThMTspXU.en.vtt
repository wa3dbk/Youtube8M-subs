hard<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.560> come<00:00:22.800> by<00:00:23.300> apparently<00:00:24.300> because

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
hard to come by apparently because

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.810 
hard to come by apparently because
everyone<00:00:26.550> apparently<00:00:26.849> cells<00:00:27.619> what<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> 11

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
everyone apparently cells what is a 11

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.609 
everyone apparently cells what is a 11
and<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.000> half<00:00:30.029> inch<00:00:30.510> which<00:00:30.810> would<00:00:31.050> be<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> little

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
and a half inch which would be a little

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.240 
and a half inch which would be a little
small<00:00:32.250> for<00:00:32.279> me<00:00:32.690> so<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.320> way<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.680> got<00:00:34.920> this

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
small for me so the way that I got this

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.430 
small for me so the way that I got this
was<00:00:35.910> through<00:00:36.149> one<00:00:36.390> website<00:00:36.690> called<00:00:37.020> baseball

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
was through one website called baseball

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.369 
was through one website called baseball
express<00:00:37.860> com<00:00:38.809> and<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> way<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.079> thought<00:00:40.260> we

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
express com and the way I thought we

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.350 
express com and the way I thought we
knew<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.950> was<00:00:41.190> assuming<00:00:41.910> we're<00:00:42.120> glove

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
knew that this was assuming we're glove

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.290 
knew that this was assuming we're glove
is<00:00:42.600> because<00:00:43.079> we<00:00:43.260> saw<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.940> 12-inch<00:00:44.940> no

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
is because we saw this 12-inch no

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.389 
is because we saw this 12-inch no

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
for about two weeks and you can see i'm

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.010 
for about two weeks and you can see i'm
not<00:02:01.140> totally<00:02:01.619> broken<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.430> yet<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.719> as<00:02:03.869> far

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
not totally broken in yet this is as far

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.160 
not totally broken in yet this is as far
as<00:02:04.170> i<00:02:04.259> could<00:02:04.320> squeeze<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:05.390> but<00:02:06.390> i'm<00:02:06.869> getting

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
as i could squeeze it but i'm getting

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.919 
as i could squeeze it but i'm getting
there<00:02:07.580> so<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:09.030> way<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.209> i<00:02:09.450> would<00:02:09.690> go<00:02:09.810> about

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
there so the way that i would go about

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.220 
there so the way that i would go about
