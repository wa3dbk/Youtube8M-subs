00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.530
 despite the pressure that has been there again for a while 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.090
 the protagonists showed in psv light 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.400
 you last night of a most frivolous 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.099
 the director and the technical side 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.840
 manager kicked a ball and 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.260
 trainer Fred Rutten did not let us know 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.750
 to lie awake from the worries at PSV 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.710
 no i looked and i body in bed and then 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:30.130
 I miss sleeping hear yes but not always 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.660
 more class I sleep so that kind of 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.220
 worries I can not live 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.500
 not namely totally not is also one 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.030
 theme in the group of players that turmoil that 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.820
 There is one that some people saw 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.150
 me we know it is not good but 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.510
 everyone has my mentality and the 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.830
 motivation to get it right and that 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.900
 we just knew we definitely I 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.760
 just there and psv is here in the small 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.440
 ensure arena in reeds to good 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.510
 to provide a starting position for it 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.170
 reaching the group stage in the europe 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.970
 league 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.680
 there is a lot of pressure on fred's team 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.640
 You could say that Rutten is a good one 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.199
 result 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.210
 what can take away from that pressure in between 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.610
 a bit busy because you are this season 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.610
 places euro public but I think that 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.440
 we just play that hans 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.650
 we are both considering the second 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.720
 coming to win and then take it 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.280
 water can back a bit off that you 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.560
 so here of the good because of euros 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.230
 audience for psv is to continue in the 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.340
 europe league bitter necessity 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.080
 opponent is favorite may be 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.940
 no problem 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.650
 and the Austrians who cherish that 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.050
 does also take a role there it is 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.930
 what rightfully mean we are pse and if 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.690
 you know that 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.590
 and how you do well in such a woman can 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.970
 so also one is young 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.960
 arena that she would be your garden now she would always 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.550
 have been very little competition 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.340
 they they lost 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.770
 recently that yes I have to say that 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.440
 as a psv we hear these opponents 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.210
 must enter it here way I 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.950
 so close and to ensure 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.030
 that we keep the zero because that is think in 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.510
 European competitions 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.510
 very important
