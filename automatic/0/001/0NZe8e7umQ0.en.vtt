and the lowest energy add on them at all
times<00:01:20.440> is<00:01:21.070> huge<00:01:21.580> what<00:01:22.060> we<00:01:22.210> did<00:01:22.390> is<00:01:22.420> we<00:01:22.570> just<00:01:22.810> had

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
times is huge what we did is we just had

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.920 
times is huge what we did is we just had
the<00:01:23.170> tank<00:01:23.440> on<00:01:23.650> the<00:01:24.550> right<00:01:25.150> hand<00:01:25.390> side<00:01:25.540> of<00:01:25.840> the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
the tank on the right hand side of the

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.840 
the tank on the right hand side of the
room<00:01:26.080> when<00:01:26.290> we<00:01:26.380> walk<00:01:26.620> in<00:01:26.650> take<00:01:27.160> the<00:01:27.220> twos<00:01:27.550> over

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
room when we walk in take the twos over

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.430 
room when we walk in take the twos over
there<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.300> then<00:01:28.690> they<00:01:28.810> would<00:01:28.990> just<00:01:29.020> always

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
there and then they would just always

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.350 
there and then they would just always
have<00:01:29.800> the<00:01:29.920> two<00:01:30.100> on<00:01:30.250> one<00:01:30.280> side<00:01:30.640> so<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:30.910> DPS

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
have the two on one side so the DPS

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.660 
have the two on one side so the DPS
didn't<00:01:31.780> need<00:01:31.900> to<00:01:32.050> switch<00:01:32.380> it<00:01:33.340> allowed<00:01:33.520> us<00:01:33.550> to

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
didn't need to switch it allowed us to

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.180 
didn't need to switch it allowed us to
have<00:01:33.820> a<00:01:33.880> lot<00:01:34.030> higher<00:01:34.210> dps<00:01:34.660> up<00:01:34.900> time<00:01:35.230> and<00:01:35.740> it

what you're really doing is there's a
couple<00:03:31.360> different<00:03:31.600> points<00:03:32.080> where<00:03:32.230> there<00:03:32.350> can

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
couple different points where there can

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.080 
couple different points where there can
be<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.590> little<00:03:32.709> bit<00:03:32.920> of<00:03:32.950> extra<00:03:33.130> raid<00:03:33.490> damage<00:03:33.730> but

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
be a little bit of extra raid damage but

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.060 
be a little bit of extra raid damage but
that's<00:03:34.270> really<00:03:34.570> you<00:03:35.320> know<00:03:35.410> your<00:03:35.590> points<00:03:36.010> of

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
that's really you know your points of

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.290 
that's really you know your points of
where<00:03:36.250> that's<00:03:36.459> going<00:03:36.610> to<00:03:36.700> happen<00:03:36.850> so<00:03:37.150> make

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
where that's going to happen so make

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.480 
where that's going to happen so make
sure<00:03:37.330> you're<00:03:37.570> cycling<00:03:37.810> your<00:03:38.110> cooldowns<00:03:38.530> for

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
sure you're cycling your cooldowns for

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.920 
sure you're cycling your cooldowns for
overloads<00:03:39.970> if<00:03:40.209> you<00:03:40.300> see<00:03:40.450> people<00:03:40.630> start

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
overloads if you see people start

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.770 
overloads if you see people start
getting<00:03:41.020> significantly<00:03:41.800> low<00:03:42.070> do<00:03:42.370> that<00:03:42.780> and

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
getting significantly low do that and

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.910 
getting significantly low do that and
then<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.080> other<00:03:44.200> thing<00:03:44.290> that<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.650> tanks

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
then the other thing that the tanks

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.280 
then the other thing that the tanks
thing<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.130> do<00:03:45.250> is<00:03:45.370> if<00:03:45.400> there's<00:03:45.610> going<00:03:45.730> to<00:03:45.820> be<00:03:45.850> a

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
thing to do is if there's going to be a

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.020 
thing to do is if there's going to be a
possibility<00:03:47.290> of<00:03:47.680> poops<00:03:48.160> overload<00:03:48.700> where<00:03:48.910> it's

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
possibility of poops overload where it's

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.790 
possibility of poops overload where it's
not<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.360> petrified<00:03:49.810> dog<00:03:50.020> doing<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:50.500> overload

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
not the petrified dog doing the overload

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.900 
not the petrified dog doing the overload

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
so all the bubbles knew all the chain

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:51.149 
so all the bubbles knew all the chain
partners<00:05:49.779> knew<00:05:50.050> where<00:05:50.199> they<00:05:50.259> were<00:05:50.289> going<00:05:50.409> all

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:56.469 
there's a little bit smoother a little

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:58.889 
there's a little bit smoother a little
bit<00:05:56.589> easier<00:05:56.680> to<00:05:56.889> heal<00:05:57.240> and<00:05:58.240> it's<00:05:58.419> just<00:05:58.629> kind<00:05:58.810> of

00:05:58.889 --> 00:05:58.899 
bit easier to heal and it's just kind of

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:01.529 
bit easier to heal and it's just kind of
a<00:05:58.990> frantic<00:05:59.259> fight<00:05:59.680> at<00:06:00.490> first<00:06:00.520> until<00:06:01.180> you<00:06:01.330> kind
