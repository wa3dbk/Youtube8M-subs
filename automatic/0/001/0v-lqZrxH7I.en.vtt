00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 how nice that you are to my video 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.180
 I have shown you today 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.269
 a video how to get an almost from there 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.179
 made and that this is so 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.340
 These are very even as pie 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.260
 you discovered it with dong but 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.730
 actually you do not need any from down 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.560
 So if you do not feel like it 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.630
 which one to create or which one 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.750
 You can easily buy extra 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.580
 make this pie and there I 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.859
 I already baked it in the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.510
 fridge and here I have one 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.099
 garage created the night we over 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.410
 in the fridge and now I hit 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.809
 are just a little bit on afterwards 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.120
 I made 200 milliliters 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.030
 cream I've cooked on and in 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.280
 I then dissolved 200 grams door 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.750
 until the whole is nice and even 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.870
 and then I leave that at the refrigerator 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.610
 so cool after I hit it 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.430
 I already have one here 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.449
 other location and I cover with 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.270
 who can not be one 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.449
 At first I have that a bit upstairs 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.550
 given on it and to look how the 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.420
 Garage behaves as easy as can 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.340
 to the whole and then I have opened 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.280
 my spatula so you down the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.260
 right on it and give it from below 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.869
 up in such a moderate motion 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.920
 on top of that they are not at the bottom right now 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.040
 salt you can then in the further 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.840
 But the pie is better 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.060
 Of course, complete 1 to cover 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.040
 and the best in a relative 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.689
 Of course, thin layer is one 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.920
 Even the dickmann left diana 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.610
 would like to have 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.750
 but after she is pretty cute 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.030
 I prefer her thin and texts then 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.390
 the whole gladly 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.649
 whole cakes with the garage one and 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.110
 after that with the spatula not so 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.930
 Well, it works like me now 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.280
 flat thing from dr oetker and it has so 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.460
 a straight side with the right one 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.780
 nice also the sides in the velcro known 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.659
 if there is a bit of cream somewhere 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.750
 You can get out at any time for more 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.200
 to do exactly this then 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.090
 and best of all there so fast 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.369
 work as possible because the garage is in 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.560
 the air also starts to dry 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.190
 and then she does not feel like this anymore 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.620
 beautiful 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.780
 lubricate and then just everything nice 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.820
 cover as much as you like 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.650
 need your flowers fit i have now 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.660
 That's why I'm going to color them 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.970
 then mix together then you need 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.230
 so I'll link you in 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.480
 the infobox 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.430
 So actually all ingredients as well as 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.720
 the video how to bloom easily 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.640
 button can create 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.080
 you only need very little ingredients 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.410
 and that's why I think that's great 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.590
 then I have ever such a back strength 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.090
 this because there while rolling out there 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.460
 nothing gets stuck at the table 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.410
 I used the underlay first 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.190
 but the band was taken away and that was 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.860
 not so useful 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.890
 then please keep your hands with you 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.810
 that for me to piece palm her 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.900
 can soft palm take him but me 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.880
 have my case then this home and 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.740
 That's why I take a small 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.160
 pieces and carry with it the dealers 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.500
 on 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.750
 so now I kneaded the whole thing 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.520
 So two colors to a piece that 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.840
 actually means way too much for 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.160
 the few flowers that I cut out 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.530
 You do not really want that 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.150
 In any case, he always turns that way 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.430
 nice and so she really does too 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.130
 could punch out and rolled edge tool 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.989
 so 1 mm thick from now I imagine 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.940
 the flowers and it is important 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.610
 to go for it 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.100
 then turn a bit left to the right 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.510
 I pressed briefly on it and each one 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.290
 flower then let out 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.540
 those are the finished flowers then already 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.310
 and here after the cake actually 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.530
 just next to me did not stand either 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.940
 in the fridge is not too tight so that 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.310
 I again some sugar me glue 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.850
 I need to use and there I have 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.010
 just the smaller flowers at the top 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.920
 then the middle ones in the middle and the 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.300
 small refitted and bottom 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.390
 That's how the cake looks 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.970
 I hope you have 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.380
 liked or would like to imitate 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.910
 if you have any questions 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.160
 Just write me in the 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.970
