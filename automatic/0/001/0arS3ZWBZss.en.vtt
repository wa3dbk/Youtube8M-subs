videos we're going to be talking about a

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.350 
videos we're going to be talking about a
stem<00:00:06.240> cutting<00:00:06.810> this<00:00:07.500> first<00:00:08.040> video<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.910> going

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
stem cutting this first video is going

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.020 
stem cutting this first video is going
to<00:00:09.480> explain<00:00:09.740> how<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:11.460> find<00:00:11.700> out<00:00:12.290> hard<00:00:13.290> wood

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
to explain how to find out hard wood

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.620 
to explain how to find out hard wood
semi<00:00:15.030> hard<00:00:15.420> wood<00:00:15.809> or<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.199> softwood<00:00:17.130> or<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.630> tip

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
semi hard wood or a softwood or a tip

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.920 
semi hard wood or a softwood or a tip
where<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:20.039> on<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.430> plant<00:00:21.029> we're<00:00:21.689> also

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
where is that on a plant we're also

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.910 
where is that on a plant we're also
going<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.740> find<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.850> notes<00:00:24.240> nodes<00:00:24.990> are<00:00:25.410> the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
going to find the notes nodes are the

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.290 
going to find the notes nodes are the
areas<00:00:26.460> where<00:00:27.240> either<00:00:27.810> root<00:00:28.650> or<00:00:29.070> new<00:00:29.970> growth

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
areas where either root or new growth

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.930 
areas where either root or new growth
will<00:00:30.720> occur<00:00:31.160> so<00:00:32.160> we're<00:00:32.340> just<00:00:32.369> going<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.759> be

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
will occur so we're just going to be

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.880 
will occur so we're just going to be
looking<00:00:33.270> at<00:00:33.450> one<00:00:33.690> or<00:00:33.719> two<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.380> then<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
looking at one or two and then in the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.310 
looking at one or two and then in the
next<00:00:35.250> video<00:00:35.579> we'll<00:00:35.880> actually<00:00:36.120> do<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:37.020> stem

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
next video we'll actually do a stem

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.619 
next video we'll actually do a stem
cutting<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:40.579> like<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.879> show<00:00:43.309> hardwood<00:00:44.629> softwood

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
but it's very very good for finding out

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.340 
but it's very very good for finding out
those<00:00:57.000> spots<00:00:58.340> hardwood<00:00:59.510> I'm<00:01:00.510> down<00:01:00.899> here<00:01:00.930> in

hard wood semi hard wood is further up
and<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:14.220> notice<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:14.909> got<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.180> lot<00:01:15.479> more<00:01:15.509> give

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
and you notice it's got a lot more give

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.499 
and you notice it's got a lot more give
to<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.610> but<00:01:17.610> there's<00:01:17.850> still<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.210> little

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
to it but there's still a little

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.789 
to it but there's still a little
resistance<00:01:20.090> this<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.150> semi<00:01:21.810> hardwood<00:01:22.530> or

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
resistance this is semi hardwood or

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.289 
resistance this is semi hardwood or
sometimes<00:01:23.759> called<00:01:23.939> soft<00:01:24.810> wood<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.000> then<00:01:27.000> up

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
sometimes called soft wood and then up

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.870 
sometimes called soft wood and then up
here<00:01:27.770> this<00:01:28.770> real<00:01:29.130> fluffy<00:01:29.490> part<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:31.380> tip

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
here this real fluffy part is the tip

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.660 
here this real fluffy part is the tip
it's<00:01:34.130> even<00:01:35.130> pale<00:01:35.700> pale<00:01:36.090> green<00:01:36.920> this<00:01:37.920> has<00:01:38.280> sort

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
it's even pale pale green this has sort

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.490 
it's even pale pale green this has sort

of a of a light wood cast and then down
here<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.340> actual<00:01:44.990> woody<00:01:45.990> if<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.439> pull<00:01:46.680> some

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
here in the actual woody if we pull some

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.550 
here in the actual woody if we pull some
of<00:01:47.009> these<00:01:47.130> leaves<00:01:47.640> away<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.750> thicker<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
of these leaves away it's thicker and

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.359 
of these leaves away it's thicker and
it's<00:01:49.860> actually<00:01:50.430> beginning<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.119> form<00:01:51.479> bark<00:01:52.369> so

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
it's actually beginning to form bark so

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.319 
it's actually beginning to form bark so
this<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.880> hardwood<00:01:55.399> semi<00:01:56.399> hardwood<00:01:57.090> or

this is hardwood semi hardwood or
softwood<00:01:57.439> and<00:01:58.439> then<00:01:59.280> up<00:01:59.520> here<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.909> your<00:02:00.329> tip

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
softwood and then up here is your tip

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:07.010 
softwood and then up here is your tip
now<00:02:02.689> everywhere<00:02:03.689> there<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> leaf<00:02:05.869> or<00:02:06.869> a

now everywhere there is a leaf or a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.700 
now everywhere there is a leaf or a
branch

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.220 

that<00:02:10.710> is<00:02:11.009> where<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.700> will<00:02:11.910> have<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.180> node<00:02:12.720> you

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
that is where you will have a node you

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.070 
that is where you will have a node you
can<00:02:14.040> see<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:15.050> right<00:02:16.050> here<00:02:17.630> where<00:02:18.630> it's<00:02:18.780> growing

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
can see it right here where it's growing

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.600 
can see it right here where it's growing
out<00:02:20.360> then<00:02:21.360> in<00:02:21.600> between<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.680> inter<00:02:23.310> node

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
out then in between is the inter node

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.670 
out then in between is the inter node
here's<00:02:24.570> another<00:02:24.900> node

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
here's another node

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.580 
here's another node
here's<00:02:26.220> another<00:02:26.430> node<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.270> so<00:02:27.959> on<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.380> so

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
here's another node and so on and so

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.780 
here's another node and so on and so
forth<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:30.290> these<00:02:31.290> are<00:02:31.620> where<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.220> will<00:02:32.430> you

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
forth so these are where you will you

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.900 
forth so these are where you will you
will<00:02:33.060> want<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.570> work<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:34.170> order<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.590> get<00:02:35.070> roots

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
will want to work in order to get roots

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.840 
will want to work in order to get roots
or<00:02:36.870> new<00:02:37.740> growth<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.940> can<00:02:39.120> see<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:39.690> here<00:02:40.350> on<00:02:40.850> our

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
or new growth you can see in here on our

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.130 
or new growth you can see in here on our
rosemary<00:02:42.980> that<00:02:44.209> not<00:02:45.209> only<00:02:45.390> has<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:45.959> grown

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
rosemary that not only has it grown

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.650 
rosemary that not only has it grown
leaves<00:02:46.620> but<00:02:47.250> it's<00:02:47.430> beginning<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.940> grow<00:02:48.300> some

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
leaves but it's beginning to grow some

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.750 
leaves but it's beginning to grow some
branches<00:02:49.380> so<00:02:50.040> all<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.550> these<00:02:50.790> are<00:02:51.239> nodes

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
branches so all of these are nodes

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.400 
branches so all of these are nodes
