00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
to things that we know about is that you

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.430 
to things that we know about is that you
have<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.850> work<00:00:48.030> along<00:00:48.390> certain<00:00:48.690> lines<00:00:49.079> you

know you think like a sort of
archaeologists<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.829> think<00:00:53.250> people<00:00:53.460> are<00:00:53.730> just

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
archaeologists I think people are just

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.479 
archaeologists I think people are just
genetically<00:00:54.809> encoded<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.920> look<00:00:56.160> back<00:00:56.460> and

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
genetically encoded to look back and

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.369 
genetically encoded to look back and
from<00:00:57.480> very<00:00:57.809> very<00:00:57.960> early<00:00:58.530> days<00:00:59.309> people<00:00:59.850> saw<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
from very very early days people saw the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.070 
from very very early days people saw the
remains<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:02.129> dinosaurs<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.390> can't<00:01:03.899> even

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
remains of dinosaurs I can't even

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.679 
remains of dinosaurs I can't even
imagine<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.949> would<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.129> like<00:01:05.479> to<00:01:06.479> come

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
imagine what it would be like to come

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.990 
imagine what it would be like to come
across<00:01:07.080> some<00:01:07.680> kind<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.340> know<00:01:08.369> immense

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
across some kind of you know immense

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.890 
across some kind of you know immense
skull<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:10.439> was<00:01:10.560> obviously<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.729> reptile<00:01:12.570> I

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
skull that was obviously of a reptile I

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.480 
skull that was obviously of a reptile I
mean<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.110> course<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.560> was<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> dragon<00:01:14.040> what<00:01:14.340> else

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
mean of course it was a dragon what else

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.440 
mean of course it was a dragon what else
could<00:01:14.640> have<00:01:14.909> been<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.390> dragon<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.920> an<00:01:17.549> archetype

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
could have been a dragon is an archetype

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
could have been a dragon is an archetype
that<00:01:18.780> people<00:01:19.530> interpret<00:01:20.340> differently<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:21.470> see

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
that people interpret differently I see

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.450 
that people interpret differently I see
dragons<00:01:22.860> as<00:01:23.659> creatures<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:25.020> magic<00:01:25.530> creatures

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
dragons as creatures of magic creatures

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.460 
dragons as creatures of magic creatures
of<00:01:26.610> great<00:01:26.850> power<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.299> great<00:01:27.540> intelligence

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
of great power and great intelligence

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.300 
of great power and great intelligence
and<00:01:29.159> it's<00:01:30.150> not<00:01:30.390> healing<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:31.409> makes<00:01:31.799> for<00:01:32.159> an

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
and it's not healing that makes for an

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.640 
and it's not healing that makes for an
interesting<00:01:32.729> problem<00:01:33.329> every<00:01:34.200> culture<00:01:34.619> has

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
interesting problem every culture has

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.399 
interesting problem every culture has
stories<00:01:35.220> about<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.360> strange<00:01:36.689> creatures<00:01:37.200> that

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
stories about the strange creatures that

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.469 
stories about the strange creatures that
you<00:01:37.530> need<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.799> watch<00:01:38.009> out<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.280> they're<00:01:39.240> all<00:01:39.360> a

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you need to watch out for they're all a

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.569 
you need to watch out for they're all a
little<00:01:39.540> bit<00:01:40.020> different<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:41.130> they<00:01:41.280> all<00:01:41.310> have

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
little bit different but they all have

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.999 
little bit different but they all have
the<00:01:41.729> same<00:01:41.939> kinds<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.509> human<00:01:43.380> underpinnings<00:01:43.920> I

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
the same kinds of human underpinnings I

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.999 
the same kinds of human underpinnings I
think<00:01:44.220> fantasy<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> human<00:01:45.600> impulse<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.799> try

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
think fantasy is a human impulse to try

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.620 
think fantasy is a human impulse to try
and<00:01:47.159> explain<00:01:47.610> things<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:48.360> aren't

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
and explain things that aren't

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.679
