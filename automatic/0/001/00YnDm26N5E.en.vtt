00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.700 
number one so let's go with the soft red
to<00:01:28.039> start<00:01:28.340> our<00:01:29.090> next<00:01:29.509> control<00:01:29.869> is<00:01:30.109> enhance

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
to start our next control is enhance

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.899 
to start our next control is enhance
foliage<00:01:31.369> this<00:01:32.329> defaults<00:01:32.749> at<00:01:32.840> 50%<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:33.909> this

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
foliage this defaults at 50% and this

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.849 
foliage this defaults at 50% and this
controls<00:01:35.359> the<00:01:35.539> degree<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:35.990> which<00:01:36.259> you<00:01:36.590> want<00:01:36.679> to

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
controls the degree to which you want to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:39.219 
controls the degree to which you want to
apply<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.340> filter<00:01:37.759> so<00:01:38.630> if<00:01:38.719> you<00:01:38.810> move<00:01:38.990> this<00:01:39.079> to

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
apply the filter so if you move this to

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.109 
apply the filter so if you move this to
the<00:01:39.259> right<00:01:39.380> will<00:01:39.859> increase<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.700> effect<00:01:40.999> of

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
the right will increase the effect of

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.270 
the right will increase the effect of
the<00:01:41.210> filter<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:42.079> if<00:01:42.530> we<00:01:42.649> move<00:01:42.799> it<00:01:42.889> to<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.100> left

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
the filter and if we move it to the left

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.149 
the filter and if we move it to the left
will<00:01:43.579> decrease<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.270> effect<00:01:44.710> for<00:01:45.710> this<00:01:45.829> image

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
will decrease the effect for this image

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.489 
will decrease the effect for this image
I<00:01:46.249> think<00:01:46.280> I<00:01:46.549> like<00:01:46.909> it<00:01:46.939> just<00:01:47.119> a<00:01:47.359> little<00:01:47.689> bit<00:01:47.840> more

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499 
I think I like it just a little bit more

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:51.190 
I think I like it just a little bit more
intense<00:01:48.889> than<00:01:49.100> it<00:01:49.249> started<00:01:49.700> I<00:01:49.819> think<00:01:50.329> 61%

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
intense than it started I think 61%

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.649 
intense than it started I think 61%
looks<00:01:51.380> really<00:01:51.950> nice<00:01:52.219> so<00:01:52.939> I<00:01:52.969> think<00:01:53.119> this<00:01:53.479> would

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
looks really nice so I think this would

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.949 
looks really nice so I think this would
look<00:01:53.689> really<00:01:54.139> great<00:01:54.979> if<00:01:55.249> the<00:01:55.579> grass<00:01:56.119> was<00:01:56.689> all

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:56.959 
look really great if the grass was all

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.139 
look really great if the grass was all
still<00:01:57.350> green<00:01:57.829> and<00:01:57.859> only<00:01:58.429> the<00:01:58.579> leaves<00:01:58.850> were

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
still green and only the leaves were

so<00:02:45.380> we'll<00:02:45.590> start<00:02:45.860> painting<00:02:47.709> I'm<00:02:48.709> using<00:02:48.980> a

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
so we'll start painting I'm using a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.750 
so we'll start painting I'm using a
mouse<00:02:49.310> some<00:02:49.700> people<00:02:49.970> have<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.360> tablet<00:02:50.840> and

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
mouse some people have a tablet and

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.240 
mouse some people have a tablet and
those<00:02:52.760> were<00:02:52.910> really<00:02:53.090> great<00:02:53.269> either<00:02:53.510> way

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
those were really great either way

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.130 
those were really great either way
it's<00:02:55.250> very<00:02:55.640> easy<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.120> do<00:02:56.390> especially<00:02:56.690> with

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
it's very easy to do especially with

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.870 
it's very easy to do especially with
this<00:02:57.440> filter<00:02:57.829> since<00:02:58.160> it's<00:02:58.370> really<00:02:58.579> only

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
this filter since it's really only

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.199 
this filter since it's really only
affecting<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.540> green<00:03:00.489> it's<00:03:01.489> not<00:03:01.610> really

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
affecting the green it's not really

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.470 
affecting the green it's not really
affecting<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.690> background<00:03:03.170> at<00:03:03.829> all<00:03:04.269> so<00:03:05.269> it's

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
affecting the background at all so it's

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.370 
affecting the background at all so it's
coming<00:03:05.690> in<00:03:05.870> really<00:03:06.140> nicely<00:03:06.530> as<00:03:06.829> you<00:03:06.860> can<00:03:07.099> see

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690
