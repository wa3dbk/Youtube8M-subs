Phillips screw and your screwdriver it's
easiest<00:00:26.189> if<00:00:26.520> we<00:00:26.849> hold<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.300> drive<00:00:27.630> case<00:00:28.110> upside

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
easiest if we hold the drive case upside

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.819 
easiest if we hold the drive case upside
down<00:00:29.009> at<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.460> point<00:00:30.050> otherwise<00:00:31.050> it's<00:00:31.619> hard

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:31.829 
down at this point otherwise it's hard

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.320 
down at this point otherwise it's hard
to<00:00:32.099> get<00:00:32.430> your<00:00:32.640> fingers<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.120> there<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.780> hold<00:00:35.330> the

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 
to get your fingers in there to hold the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
Phillips screw itself turn on the case

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.500 
Phillips screw itself turn on the case
upside<00:00:39.570> down<00:00:39.809> allows<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.589> to<00:00:40.830> simply<00:00:41.760> balance

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
upside down allows you to simply balance

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.960 
upside down allows you to simply balance
the<00:00:42.870> screw<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.710> end<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.280> screwdriver

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
the screw on the end of the screwdriver

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.200 
the screw on the end of the screwdriver
and<00:00:45.480> then<00:00:46.410> start<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.309> hole<00:00:47.640> once<00:00:48.030> it

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
and then start it in the hole once it

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.180 
and then start it in the hole once it
started<00:00:48.809> then<00:00:49.049> you<00:00:49.229> can<00:00:49.440> turn<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.040> a

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
started then you can turn it in a

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.810 
started then you can turn it in a
direction<00:00:51.170> tighten<00:00:52.170> them<00:00:52.350> down<00:00:52.379> securely<00:00:53.220> but

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
direction tighten them down securely but

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.149 
direction tighten them down securely but
do<00:00:54.239> not<00:00:54.420> over<00:00:54.809> tighten<00:00:54.869> you<00:00:55.650> don't<00:00:55.860> want<00:00:56.070> to

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
do not over tighten you don't want to

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:04.049 
do not over tighten you don't want to
crack<00:00:56.400> the<00:00:56.640> circuit<00:00:57.089> board

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.840 

that<00:01:05.059> step<00:01:05.479> is<00:01:05.960> to<00:01:06.350> insulate<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.340> hard<00:01:07.580> drive

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
that step is to insulate the hard drive

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.990 
that step is to insulate the hard drive
from<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.299> case<00:01:08.570> itself<00:01:09.080> in<00:01:09.979> order<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:10.549> do<00:01:10.760> that

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
from the case itself in order to do that

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.260 
from the case itself in order to do that
I<00:01:11.330> am<00:01:11.720> going<00:01:11.900> to<00:01:12.380> use<00:01:12.409> a<00:01:12.619> piece<00:01:13.010> of<00:01:13.460> my<00:01:13.850> sticky

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
I am going to use a piece of my sticky

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.130 
I am going to use a piece of my sticky
notepad<00:01:14.659> I<00:01:15.759> believe<00:01:16.759> it<00:01:16.940> to<00:01:17.060> be<00:01:17.090> about<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.509> three

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
notepad I believe it to be about a three

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.710 
notepad I believe it to be about a three
by<00:01:18.170> five<00:01:18.380> pieces<00:01:19.040> sticking<00:01:19.520> up<00:01:19.850> in<00:01:20.150> here<00:01:20.390> but<00:01:20.600> I

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
by five pieces sticking up in here but I

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.410 
by five pieces sticking up in here but I
haven't<00:01:20.930> taken<00:01:21.259> exact<00:01:21.920> measurements<00:01:22.700> but<00:01:23.270> in

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
haven't taken exact measurements but in

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.380 
haven't taken exact measurements but in
this<00:01:23.600> case<00:01:23.869> as<00:01:24.200> you<00:01:24.229> can<00:01:24.380> see<00:01:24.800> it<00:01:25.159> is<00:01:25.550> the<00:01:25.790> exact

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
this case as you can see it is the exact

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.590 
this case as you can see it is the exact
width<00:01:26.780> of<00:01:27.050> the<00:01:27.619> drug<00:01:27.890> which<00:01:28.520> is<00:01:28.820> very

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
width of the drug which is very

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.840 
width of the drug which is very
convenient<00:01:30.200> for<00:01:30.740> me<00:01:30.890> I<00:01:31.570> simply<00:01:33.820> slide<00:01:34.820> the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
convenient for me I simply slide the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.050 
convenient for me I simply slide the
paper<00:01:35.289> up<00:01:36.289> to<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.920> connector<00:01:39.460> push<00:01:40.460> down<00:01:40.789> on

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
paper up to the connector push down on

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.660 
paper up to the connector push down on
the<00:01:41.390> sticky<00:01:41.750> portion<00:01:42.410> so<00:01:43.190> then<00:01:43.399> they<00:01:43.520> will

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
the sticky portion so then they will

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.290 
the sticky portion so then they will
remain<00:01:44.119> in<00:01:44.450> place<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:45.520> now<00:01:46.520> it's<00:01:46.550> time<00:01:47.030> with

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
remain in place and now it's time with

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.419 
remain in place and now it's time with
slide<00:01:47.600> you're<00:01:47.869> driving<00:01:50.890> when<00:01:51.890> you<00:01:52.009> do<00:01:52.220> that

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
slide you're driving when you do that

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.270 
slide you're driving when you do that
make<00:01:52.759> sure<00:01:52.789> you<00:01:53.060> keep<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.479> wire<00:01:53.720> for<00:01:54.410> the<00:01:54.440> LED

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
make sure you keep the wire for the LED

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.540 
make sure you keep the wire for the LED
and<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:56.179> little<00:01:56.360> circular<00:01:56.840> cut<00:01:57.470> out<00:01:57.679> here<00:01:57.979> so

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
and the little circular cut out here so

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.419 
and the little circular cut out here so
that<00:01:58.759> it<00:01:58.940> doesn't<00:01:59.210> get<00:01:59.600> caught<00:01:59.990> or<00:02:00.280> crimped<00:02:01.280> in
