00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
AI is actually pretty difficult I kind

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.490 
AI is actually pretty difficult I kind
of<00:01:02.589> find<00:01:02.769> it<00:01:02.949> hard<00:01:03.789> to<00:01:04.390> to<00:01:04.960> beat<00:01:05.140> him<00:01:05.290> although

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
that one play now what's kind of cool

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.450 
that one play now what's kind of cool
you<00:01:09.250> see<00:01:09.430> if<00:01:09.490> I<00:01:09.610> flip<00:01:09.880> it<00:01:09.939> around<00:01:10.090> here<00:01:11.460> really

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
you see if I flip it around here really

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.300 
you see if I flip it around here really
screen<00:01:12.880> so<00:01:13.540> you<00:01:13.899> can<00:01:14.110> do<00:01:14.380> this<00:01:14.530> one<00:01:14.979> player

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
screen so you can do this one player

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.179 
screen so you can do this one player
against<00:01:15.969> the<00:01:16.149> computer<00:01:16.570> or<00:01:17.079> you<00:01:17.409> can<00:01:17.680> do<00:01:17.890> two

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
against the computer or you can do two

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:19.980 
against the computer or you can do two
players<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.909> latest<00:01:19.270> say<00:01:19.420> flat<00:01:19.750> on<00:01:19.869> a<00:01:19.960> table

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
players the latest say flat on a table

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.440 
players the latest say flat on a table
and<00:01:20.590> probably<00:01:21.399> would<00:01:21.520> want<00:01:21.729> to<00:01:21.850> have<00:01:22.210> someone

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
and probably would want to have someone

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.209 
and probably would want to have someone
hold<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.750> phone<00:01:22.930> as<00:01:23.110> you<00:01:23.200> do<00:01:23.320> it<00:01:23.469> yeah<00:01:23.890> you<00:01:23.950> can

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
hold the phone as you do it yeah you can

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.670 
hold the phone as you do it yeah you can
play<00:01:24.340> two<00:01:24.700> against<00:01:25.180> each<00:01:25.270> other<00:01:25.509> I<00:01:25.960> think<00:01:26.560> it's

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
play two against each other I think it's

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.889 
play two against each other I think it's
kind<00:01:26.860> of<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:26.979> cool<00:01:27.159> idea<00:01:27.369> it's<00:01:28.060> sort<00:01:28.329> of<00:01:28.420> logical

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
kind of a cool idea it's sort of logical

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.109 
kind of a cool idea it's sort of logical
you'd<00:01:29.079> hope<00:01:29.259> they<00:01:29.469> would<00:01:29.740> have<00:01:29.829> done<00:01:29.950> that<00:01:30.119> but

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
you'd hope they would have done that but

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.660 
you'd hope they would have done that but
someone<00:01:32.079> else<00:01:32.140> can<00:01:32.259> jump<00:01:32.590> in<00:01:32.770> you'll<00:01:33.250> see<00:01:33.460> back

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
someone else can jump in you'll see back

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.529 
someone else can jump in you'll see back
here<00:01:34.140> has<00:01:35.140> two<00:01:35.439> player<00:01:35.680> option<00:01:35.979> or<00:01:36.609> just<00:01:37.359> the

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
any disabled sound effects you can also

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.279 
any disabled sound effects you can also
do<00:01:40.329> the<00:01:40.509> game<00:01:40.689> speed<00:01:41.020> slow<00:01:41.320> down<00:01:41.530> speed<00:01:41.950> up

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
do the game speed slow down speed up

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.139 
do the game speed slow down speed up
fairly<00:01:44.289> simplistic<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:45.009> the<00:01:45.159> point<00:01:45.429> i<00:01:45.670> love<00:01:45.700> it

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149
