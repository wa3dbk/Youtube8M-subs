for<00:02:26.960> Florida<00:02:27.320> State<00:02:27.350> I<00:02:27.830> think<00:02:28.550> that's<00:02:28.670> why<00:02:28.880> the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
for Florida State I think that's why the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.240 
for Florida State I think that's why the
line<00:02:29.240> is<00:02:29.480> in<00:02:29.720> decent<00:02:30.140> shape<00:02:30.380> right<00:02:30.680> now<00:02:30.710> 34<00:02:31.190> and

line is in decent shape right now 34 and

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.100 
line is in decent shape right now 34 and
a<00:02:31.370> half<00:02:31.490> 35<00:02:31.910> because<00:02:32.390> people<00:02:32.690> expect<00:02:32.720> the

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
a half 35 because people expect the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.680 
a half 35 because people expect the
letdown<00:02:33.320> but<00:02:34.130> keep<00:02:34.310> in<00:02:34.460> mind<00:02:34.490> as<00:02:35.000> we're

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
letdown but keep in mind as we're

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.140

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
is not a very good team right now so

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.990 
is not a very good team right now so
they're<00:02:52.010> not<00:02:52.100> going<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.310> be<00:02:52.430> gaining<00:02:52.670> any

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.070 
what did I have to do they have thrown
up<00:02:57.530> scores<00:02:57.880> especially<00:02:58.880> if<00:02:59.030> Oregon<00:02:59.600> wins<00:02:59.840> if

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
up scores especially if Oregon wins if

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.660 
up scores especially if Oregon wins if
oregon<00:03:00.440> loses<00:03:00.560> maybe<00:03:01.310> it's<00:03:01.520> a<00:03:01.550> different

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
oregon loses maybe it's a different

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.150 
oregon loses maybe it's a different
story<00:03:01.940> but<00:03:02.810> if<00:03:03.020> oregon<00:03:03.470> continues<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:03.980> win

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
story but if oregon continues to win

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.500 
story but if oregon continues to win
they're<00:03:04.610> going<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:04.790> have<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:04.970> blow<00:03:05.120> people<00:03:05.270> up

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
they're going to have to blow people up

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.560 
they're going to have to blow people up
so<00:03:06.470> basically<00:03:06.980> you<00:03:07.190> definitely<00:03:07.970> agree<00:03:08.270> that

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
so basically you definitely agree that

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.440 
so basically you definitely agree that
if<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:09.020> to<00:03:09.230> run<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.620> table<00:03:09.910> oregon<00:03:10.910> schedule

no<00:03:13.520> question<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:14.180> pac-12<00:03:14.540> so<00:03:15.410> much<00:03:15.590> stronger

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
no question the pac-12 so much stronger

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.949 
no question the pac-12 so much stronger

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
than the acc again we're still wondering

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.020 
than the acc again we're still wondering
how<00:03:18.230> good<00:03:18.500> clemson<00:03:18.980> is<00:03:19.130> because<00:03:19.670> we<00:03:19.820> see
