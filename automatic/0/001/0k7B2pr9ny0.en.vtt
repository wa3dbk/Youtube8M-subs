00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
just how our slide rooms are made now

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.739 
just how our slide rooms are made now
it's<00:03:46.519> really<00:03:46.730> important<00:03:47.120> to<00:03:47.180> understand<00:03:47.629> that

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:47.749 
it's really important to understand that

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:50.140 
it's really important to understand that
when<00:03:47.900> you<00:03:47.989> take<00:03:48.170> a<00:03:48.230> slide<00:03:48.590> room<00:03:48.889> and<00:03:49.760> you<00:03:49.879> push

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
when you take a slide room and you push

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.670 
when you take a slide room and you push
the<00:03:50.299> slide<00:03:50.540> room<00:03:50.810> out<00:03:50.930> that<00:03:51.230> insulation

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
the slide room out that insulation

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.339 
the slide room out that insulation
becomes<00:03:52.310> an<00:03:52.819> issue<00:03:52.999> so<00:03:53.689> something<00:03:53.989> that<00:03:54.019> we<00:03:54.200> do

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
becomes an issue so something that we do

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:55.629 
becomes an issue so something that we do
that<00:03:54.469> is<00:03:54.620> different<00:03:54.799> is<00:03:55.129> that<00:03:55.159> we<00:03:55.370> fully

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
that is different is that we fully

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.509 
that is different is that we fully
insulate<00:03:56.239> and<00:03:56.420> laminate<00:03:56.930> from<00:03:57.409> our<00:03:57.620> floor<00:03:57.980> so

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
insulate and laminate from our floor so

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.599 
insulate and laminate from our floor so
underneath<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.939> carpet<00:03:59.359> here<00:03:59.599> is<00:04:00.049> a<00:04:00.109> fully

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
underneath the carpet here is a fully

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.500 
underneath the carpet here is a fully
laminated<00:04:01.609> about<00:04:02.599> an<00:04:02.750> inch<00:04:02.930> floor<00:04:03.769> that's

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
laminated about an inch floor that's

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.849 
laminated about an inch floor that's
completely<00:04:05.510> insulated<00:04:06.139> so<00:04:06.409> therefore<00:04:06.769> you

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
completely insulated so therefore you

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:08.679 
completely insulated so therefore you
don't<00:04:07.010> have<00:04:07.099> any<00:04:07.250> cold<00:04:07.489> transmitting<00:04:08.239> once

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:08.689 
don't have any cold transmitting once

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:10.629 
don't have any cold transmitting once
you<00:04:08.810> put<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.079> slide<00:04:09.349> room<00:04:09.590> out<00:04:09.739> you'll<00:04:10.489> also

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
you put the slide room out you'll also

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.080 
you put the slide room out you'll also
notice<00:04:10.999> that<00:04:11.150> it's<00:04:11.810> all<00:04:12.019> aluminum<00:04:12.260> frame<00:04:13.090> all

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
notice that it's all aluminum frame all

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.060 
notice that it's all aluminum frame all
the<00:04:14.180> way<00:04:14.209> around<00:04:14.629> you<00:04:15.169> can<00:04:15.200> see<00:04:15.469> the<00:04:15.590> a<00:04:15.620> scale

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
the way around you can see the a scale

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.189 
the way around you can see the a scale
that's<00:04:16.310> going<00:04:16.639> on<00:04:16.729> the<00:04:16.880> outside<00:04:16.910> in<00:04:17.840> between

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
that's going on the outside in between

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.949 
that's going on the outside in between
the<00:04:18.320> underlayment<00:04:18.739> or<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.639> outside

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
the underlayment or the outside

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.270 
the underlayment or the outside
fiberglass<00:04:20.959> I<00:04:21.139> should<00:04:21.380> say<00:04:21.590> and<00:04:21.799> then<00:04:22.160> the

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
fiberglass I should say and then the

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.430 
fiberglass I should say and then the
underlayment<00:04:22.669> with<00:04:22.970> your<00:04:23.180> as<00:04:23.330> Dale<00:04:23.690> so<00:04:24.320> the

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
underlayment with your as Dale so the

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.110 
underlayment with your as Dale so the
room<00:04:24.620> is<00:04:24.800> really<00:04:24.979> really<00:04:25.250> strong<00:04:25.580> it's<00:04:25.880> built

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
room is really really strong it's built

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.730 
room is really really strong it's built
identical<00:04:26.750> to<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.020> way<00:04:27.139> that<00:04:27.320> we<00:04:27.380> would<00:04:27.620> build

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
identical to the way that we would build

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.480 
identical to the way that we would build
a<00:04:27.949> trailer

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
a trailer

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.400 
a trailer
everything<00:04:29.060> is<00:04:29.180> set<00:04:29.509> and<00:04:29.750> then<00:04:30.080> screwed

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
everything is set and then screwed

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.830 
everything is set and then screwed
together<00:04:30.650> so<00:04:31.340> it's<00:04:31.490> really<00:04:31.789> strong<00:04:32.060> but<00:04:32.690> the

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
together so it's really strong but the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.960 
together so it's really strong but the
neat<00:04:33.080> thing<00:04:33.110> that<00:04:33.349> we<00:04:33.620> do<00:04:33.800> again<00:04:34.370> gets<00:04:34.669> into

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
neat thing that we do again gets into

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.850 
neat thing that we do again gets into
the<00:04:35.060> details<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:36.169> I'll<00:04:36.289> just<00:04:36.440> show<00:04:36.590> you<00:04:36.650> here

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
the details and I'll just show you here

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.249 
the details and I'll just show you here
on<00:04:36.979> it<00:04:37.160> on<00:04:37.370> a<00:04:37.430> drawer<00:04:37.910> as<00:04:38.030> an<00:04:38.210> example<00:04:38.570> you<00:04:39.229> can

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
on it on a drawer as an example you can

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:41.260 
on it on a drawer as an example you can
see<00:04:39.530> here<00:04:39.710> that<00:04:39.830> we<00:04:39.949> actually<00:04:40.099> dovetail<00:04:40.820> all

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
see here that we actually dovetail all

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.230 
see here that we actually dovetail all
of<00:04:41.479> our<00:04:41.599> full<00:04:41.840> extension<00:04:42.199> wide<00:04:42.770> drawers<00:04:43.430> this

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
of our full extension wide drawers this

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.670 
of our full extension wide drawers this
is<00:04:44.449> something<00:04:44.810> that<00:04:44.840> basically<00:04:45.380> gives<00:04:45.560> you<00:04:45.650> a

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
is something that basically gives you a

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.439 
is something that basically gives you a
lot<00:04:45.830> of<00:04:45.860> strength<00:04:46.280> so<00:04:46.759> when<00:04:46.880> you<00:04:46.940> put<00:04:47.090> a<00:04:47.120> lot<00:04:47.270> of

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
lot of strength so when you put a lot of

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.240 
lot of strength so when you put a lot of
items<00:04:47.599> inside<00:04:48.139> of<00:04:48.259> the<00:04:48.349> drawer<00:04:48.650> it<00:04:49.130> will

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
items inside of the drawer it will

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.700 
items inside of the drawer it will
actually<00:04:49.430> take<00:04:49.789> to<00:04:50.030> weight<00:04:50.409> now<00:04:51.409> I'm<00:04:51.500> going<00:04:51.650> to

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
actually take to weight now I'm going to

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.469 
actually take to weight now I'm going to
show<00:04:51.830> you<00:04:51.889> exactly<00:04:52.280> how<00:04:52.580> these<00:04:52.759> are<00:04:53.030> built<00:04:53.240> and

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
show you exactly how these are built and

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.960 
show you exactly how these are built and
how<00:04:53.570> they're<00:04:53.780> set<00:04:54.020> here<00:04:54.380> just<00:04:55.220> in<00:04:55.370> one<00:04:55.490> second

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
how they're set here just in one second

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.850 
how they're set here just in one second
let's<00:04:56.360> walk<00:04:56.599> over<00:04:56.750> here

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.110 

I'm<00:05:00.860> going<00:05:00.980> to<00:05:01.040> show<00:05:01.160> you<00:05:01.220> here<00:05:01.460> some<00:05:01.880> of<00:05:02.000> our

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
I'm going to show you here some of our

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.390 
I'm going to show you here some of our
cabinets<00:05:02.600> construction<00:05:03.560> and<00:05:03.770> you<00:05:04.100> can<00:05:04.220> see

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
cabinets construction and you can see

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.490 
cabinets construction and you can see
here<00:05:04.580> that<00:05:04.700> this<00:05:04.880> here<00:05:05.180> how<00:05:05.720> light<00:05:05.960> this<00:05:06.200> is

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
here that this here how light this is

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.800 
here that this here how light this is
it's<00:05:07.100> very<00:05:07.400> very<00:05:07.640> light<00:05:07.940> by<00:05:08.420> using<00:05:08.450> our

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
it's very very light by using our

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.030 
it's very very light by using our
lifelike<00:05:09.290> plywood

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
lifelike plywood

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.410 
lifelike plywood
we're<00:05:10.280> able<00:05:10.370> to<00:05:10.580> build<00:05:10.790> a<00:05:10.910> really<00:05:11.180> really

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
we're able to build a really really

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.770 
we're able to build a really really
strong<00:05:11.720> solid<00:05:12.470> wood<00:05:12.710> solid<00:05:13.700> five<00:05:13.940> ply<00:05:14.210> ply

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
strong solid wood solid five ply ply

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.740 
strong solid wood solid five ply ply
wood<00:05:15.170> cabinet<00:05:16.010> structure<00:05:16.490> and<00:05:16.670> seat<00:05:16.910> base<00:05:17.150> it

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
wood cabinet structure and seat base it

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.050 
wood cabinet structure and seat base it
allows<00:05:18.020> for<00:05:18.380> basically<00:05:19.250> reducing<00:05:19.970> your

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
allows for basically reducing your

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.910 
allows for basically reducing your
weight<00:05:20.330> but<00:05:20.900> also<00:05:20.990> giving<00:05:21.440> you<00:05:21.530> a<00:05:21.560> lot<00:05:21.710> of

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
weight but also giving you a lot of

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.190 
weight but also giving you a lot of
strength<00:05:22.520> and<00:05:22.670> a<00:05:22.760> lot<00:05:22.940> of<00:05:22.970> quality<00:05:23.570> so<00:05:24.050> this

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
strength and a lot of quality so this

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.580 
strength and a lot of quality so this
cabinet<00:05:24.800> now<00:05:24.980> is<00:05:25.310> going<00:05:25.820> to<00:05:25.910> be<00:05:26.320> basically<00:05:27.320> set

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
cabinet now is going to be basically set

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.480 
cabinet now is going to be basically set
in<00:05:27.770> your<00:05:27.890> finished<00:05:28.280> product<00:05:28.730> so<00:05:30.160> as<00:05:31.160> we<00:05:31.280> set

in your finished product so as we set

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.700 
in your finished product so as we set
the<00:05:31.610> cabinets<00:05:32.120> in<00:05:32.300> you'll<00:05:33.200> see<00:05:33.410> here<00:05:33.590> that

the cabinets in you'll see here that

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.170 
the cabinets in you'll see here that
this<00:05:33.860> room<00:05:34.130> even<00:05:34.400> though<00:05:34.460> it's<00:05:34.610> not<00:05:34.730> installed

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
this room even though it's not installed

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.470 
this room even though it's not installed
everything<00:05:35.840> is<00:05:36.200> fully<00:05:36.410> functional<00:05:37.300> on<00:05:38.300> the

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
everything is fully functional on the

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.650 
everything is fully functional on the
slide<00:05:38.750> room<00:05:39.020> before<00:05:39.380> it<00:05:39.470> gets<00:05:39.650> installed<00:05:39.950> so

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
slide room before it gets installed so

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.940 
slide room before it gets installed so
quality<00:05:41.660> is<00:05:41.690> really<00:05:42.080> important<00:05:42.620> and<00:05:42.740> this<00:05:42.890> is

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
quality is really important and this is

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.400 
quality is really important and this is
built<00:05:43.310> there's<00:05:43.550> one<00:05:43.760> separate<00:05:44.210> entity<00:05:44.660> so

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
built there's one separate entity so

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.680 
built there's one separate entity so
therefore<00:05:45.860> we<00:05:46.640> complete<00:05:47.090> the<00:05:47.540> whole

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
therefore we complete the whole

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.540 
therefore we complete the whole
structure<00:05:48.080> here<00:05:48.590> and<00:05:48.770> then<00:05:49.250> it's<00:05:49.400> actually

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
structure here and then it's actually

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.760 
structure here and then it's actually
slid<00:05:50.060> inside<00:05:50.210> of<00:05:50.540> the<00:05:50.600> whole<00:05:50.780> of<00:05:51.170> the<00:05:51.440> trailer

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
slid inside of the whole of the trailer

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.340 
slid inside of the whole of the trailer
of<00:05:51.860> the<00:05:51.950> campus<00:05:52.840> now<00:05:53.840> that<00:05:53.990> we<00:05:54.080> thought<00:05:54.290> about

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
of the campus now that we thought about

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.650 
of the campus now that we thought about

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
it's really important to understand that

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.940
