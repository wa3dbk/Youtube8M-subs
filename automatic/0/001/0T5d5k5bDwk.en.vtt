00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.920 
composition process in this video I'm
always<00:00:16.260> interested<00:00:16.770> in<00:00:17.930> composers

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
always interested in composers

always interested in composers
compositional<00:00:19.830> process<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:20.670> endlessly

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
compositional process it's endlessly

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.820 
compositional process it's endlessly
fascinating<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.199> me<00:00:22.230> because<00:00:22.350> different

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
fascinating to me because different

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.609 
fascinating to me because different
composers<00:00:23.330> have<00:00:24.330> different<00:00:25.080> ways<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
composers have different ways that the

approach writing their music some are

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.710 
approach writing their music some are
very<00:00:28.080> orally<00:00:29.060> minded<00:00:30.060> they<00:00:30.179> process

very orally minded they process

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.420 
very orally minded they process
information<00:00:30.900> very<00:00:31.529> orally<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.130> they<00:00:32.250> may

information very orally and they may

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.130 
information very orally and they may
start<00:00:32.669> with<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.090> MIDI<00:00:33.329> sequence<00:00:33.840> because

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
start with the MIDI sequence because

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.229 
start with the MIDI sequence because
they<00:00:34.320> hear<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.430> have<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.700> hear<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.000> before

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
they hear it you have to hear it before

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.200 
they hear it you have to hear it before
they<00:00:36.570> ride<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.380> out<00:00:37.500> others<00:00:38.340> or<00:00:38.640> maybe<00:00:38.969> more

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
they ride it out others or maybe more

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.200 
they ride it out others or maybe more
visually<00:00:39.750> oriented<00:00:40.730> others<00:00:41.730> will<00:00:41.910> sit<00:00:42.090> down

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
visually oriented others will sit down

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.729 
visually oriented others will sit down
at<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.450> piano<00:00:42.480> work<00:00:43.140> things<00:00:43.350> out<00:00:43.469> at<00:00:43.620> the

piano others will just right straight in

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.270 
piano others will just right straight in
the<00:00:45.870> notation<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:49.530> just<00:00:49.649> different<00:00:49.950> it

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the notation so it's just different it

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.630 
the notation so it's just different it
depends<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.149> your<00:00:52.110> particular<00:00:52.640> strengths

so<00:00:58.250> for<00:00:59.250> me<00:00:59.340> as<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.489> composer<00:01:00.469> when<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.500> work<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:02.010> a

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
so for me as a composer when I work on a

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.090 
so for me as a composer when I work on a
piece<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.340> music<00:01:02.719> it<00:01:03.719> almost<00:01:03.870> always<00:01:04.290> starts

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
piece of music it almost always starts

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.960 
piece of music it almost always starts
with<00:01:05.659> some<00:01:06.659> sort<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.020> concept<00:01:07.680> or<00:01:08.430> an<00:01:08.580> idea

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
with some sort of concept or an idea

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.500 
with some sort of concept or an idea
about<00:01:09.390> what<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.740> piece<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.040> about<00:01:11.510> because

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
about what the piece is about because

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.810 
about what the piece is about because
without<00:01:12.689> an<00:01:13.290> idea<00:01:13.979> without<00:01:14.220> some<00:01:14.549> kind<00:01:14.700> of

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
without an idea without some kind of

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.550 
without an idea without some kind of
concept<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:15.479> very<00:01:15.659> difficult<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.229> come<00:01:16.530> up

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
concept it's very difficult to come up

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.920 
concept it's very difficult to come up
with<00:01:17.840> musical<00:01:18.840> material<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:21.330> first<00:01:21.659> stage

with musical material on the first stage

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.929 
with musical material on the first stage
of<00:01:22.140> composition<00:01:23.070> when<00:01:23.340> you're<00:01:23.490> faced<00:01:23.729> with

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
of composition when you're faced with

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.109 
of composition when you're faced with
that<00:01:24.240> blank<00:01:25.200> page<00:01:25.640> it<00:01:26.640> can<00:01:26.820> be<00:01:26.909> very

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
that blank page it can be very

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.580 
that blank page it can be very
intimidating<00:01:28.070> because<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:31.140> world

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
intimidating because you have in a world

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.830 
intimidating because you have in a world
of<00:01:31.770> infinite<00:01:32.280> possibilities<00:01:32.780> that<00:01:33.780> are

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
of infinite possibilities that are

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.230 
of infinite possibilities that are
available<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.729> you've<00:01:35.880> got<00:01:35.909> to

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
available to you and so you've got to

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.120 
available to you and so you've got to
narrow<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.960> down<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.650> some<00:01:38.460> way<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:39.950> for<00:01:40.950> me<00:01:41.100> a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
narrow that down in some way so for me a

down by hand these days we have computer

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.910 
down by hand these days we have computer
software<00:03:29.870> for<00:03:30.050> doing<00:03:30.230> that<00:03:30.380> and<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:30.680> used

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
software for doing that and I used

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.720 
software for doing that and I used
Sebelius<00:03:31.459> and<00:03:31.670> in<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.840> past<00:03:33.160> before<00:03:34.160> I<00:03:34.430> used

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
Sebelius and in the past before I used

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.060 
Sebelius and in the past before I used
to<00:03:34.850> baileys<00:03:35.209> I<00:03:35.450> would<00:03:35.630> write<00:03:36.170> it<00:03:36.350> out<00:03:36.500> by<00:03:36.800> hand

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
to baileys I would write it out by hand

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.760 
to baileys I would write it out by hand
and<00:03:37.310> then<00:03:37.370> go<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.270> finale<00:03:39.020> that<00:03:39.290> was<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.560> last

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
and then go to finale that was the last

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.400 
and then go to finale that was the last
step<00:03:40.070> of<00:03:40.130> of<00:03:40.880> composing<00:03:41.420> was<00:03:41.690> was<00:03:41.930> taking<00:03:42.290> what

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
step of of composing was was taking what

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.110 
step of of composing was was taking what
I'd<00:03:42.500> written<00:03:42.709> and<00:03:42.890> going<00:03:43.070> to<00:03:43.190> finale<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:43.820> then

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
I'd written and going to finale and then

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.630 
I'd written and going to finale and then
engraving<00:03:44.810> it<00:03:44.930> but<00:03:45.620> when<00:03:45.769> Sebelius<00:03:46.310> came<00:03:46.519> out

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
engraving it but when Sebelius came out

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.150 
engraving it but when Sebelius came out
all<00:03:46.820> set<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:47.150> leap<00:03:47.450> over<00:03:47.750> finale<00:03:48.680> it<00:03:48.860> was<00:03:48.950> so

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
all set to leap over finale it was so

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.880 
all set to leap over finale it was so
much<00:03:49.310> easier<00:03:49.550> so<00:03:49.940> much<00:03:50.090> faster<00:03:50.330> to<00:03:50.630> use<00:03:50.870> I<00:03:51.140> got

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
much easier so much faster to use I got

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.620 
much easier so much faster to use I got
used<00:03:52.130> to<00:03:52.250> just<00:03:52.459> riding<00:03:52.970> straight<00:03:53.330> into

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
used to just riding straight into

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.780 
used to just riding straight into
Sebelius<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:54.830> for<00:03:55.220> me<00:03:55.310> that's<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.580> most

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
Sebelius and for me that's the most

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.180 
Sebelius and for me that's the most
comfortable<00:03:56.300> way<00:03:57.140> to<00:03:57.200> compose<00:03:57.620> because<00:03:58.040> when

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
comfortable way to compose because when

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.910 
comfortable way to compose because when
i<00:03:58.220> get<00:03:58.400> an<00:03:58.519> idea<00:03:58.910> i<00:03:59.300> want<00:03:59.989> to<00:04:00.200> write<00:04:00.530> it<00:04:00.560> down

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
composer that does that kind of thing

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.630 
composer that does that kind of thing
but<00:04:29.910> for<00:04:29.940> me<00:04:30.210> I'm<00:04:31.020> a<00:04:31.080> visual<00:04:31.440> person<00:04:31.620> I've<00:04:32.340> got

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
but for me I'm a visual person I've got

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.220 
but for me I'm a visual person I've got
to<00:04:32.760> see<00:04:32.910> it<00:04:33.060> for<00:04:33.240> me<00:04:33.300> that's<00:04:33.540> what<00:04:33.660> locks<00:04:34.020> it

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
to see it for me that's what locks it

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.440 
to see it for me that's what locks it
into<00:04:34.350> place<00:04:34.680> is<00:04:34.950> seeing<00:04:35.220> it<00:04:35.400> in<00:04:35.610> notated<00:04:36.180> form

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
into place is seeing it in notated form

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.840 
into place is seeing it in notated form
and<00:04:36.750> then<00:04:37.380> from<00:04:37.620> there<00:04:37.680> it's<00:04:38.490> just<00:04:38.700> a<00:04:38.820> matter

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
and then from there it's just a matter

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.490 
and then from there it's just a matter
of<00:04:39.120> playing<00:04:39.600> with<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.110> melodic<00:04:40.770> material<00:04:41.390> and

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
of playing with the melodic material and

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.250 
of playing with the melodic material and
seeing<00:04:43.500> what<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.770> wants<00:04:44.010> to<00:04:44.130> do<00:04:44.720> the<00:04:45.720> structure

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
seeing what it wants to do the structure

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.730 
seeing what it wants to do the structure
is<00:04:46.470> something<00:04:47.010> that<00:04:47.490> I<00:04:47.550> think<00:04:47.700> about<00:04:48.030> early<00:04:48.540> on

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
is something that I think about early on

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.160 
is something that I think about early on
as<00:04:49.740> part<00:04:50.250> of<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.580> concept<00:04:51.150> but<00:04:51.330> I<00:04:51.390> don't<00:04:51.630> let

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
as part of the concept but I don't let

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.130 
as part of the concept but I don't let
the<00:04:52.350> I'm<00:04:52.680> not<00:04:52.920> very<00:04:53.130> rigid<00:04:53.820> about<00:04:54.330> the

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
the I'm not very rigid about the

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.900 
the I'm not very rigid about the
structure<00:04:55.530> i'm<00:04:56.070> not<00:04:57.680> i'm<00:04:58.680> not<00:04:58.710> a<00:04:58.950> structure<00:04:59.700> of

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
structure i'm not i'm not a structure of

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.180 
structure i'm not i'm not a structure of
form<00:05:00.210> based<00:05:00.450> composer<00:05:00.930> a<00:05:01.260> lot<00:05:01.680> of<00:05:01.800> times<00:05:01.980> my

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
form based composer a lot of times my

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.540 
form based composer a lot of times my
music<00:05:02.640> will<00:05:02.790> develop<00:05:03.210> very<00:05:03.530> organically<00:05:04.550> and

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
music will develop very organically and

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.040 
music will develop very organically and
used<00:05:05.880> to<00:05:05.970> i<00:05:06.000> want<00:05:06.180> you<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:06.330> think<00:05:06.390> about<00:05:06.660> form

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
used to i want you to think about form

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.630 
used to i want you to think about form
but<00:05:07.230> i'm<00:05:07.320> thinking<00:05:07.620> about<00:05:07.740> form<00:05:08.100> a<00:05:08.220> lot<00:05:08.400> more

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
but i'm thinking about form a lot more

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.000 
but i'm thinking about form a lot more
these<00:05:08.850> days<00:05:08.910> but<00:05:09.900> i'm<00:05:10.080> still<00:05:10.380> allowing<00:05:10.740> the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
these days but i'm still allowing the

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.000 
these days but i'm still allowing the
music<00:05:11.400> to<00:05:11.550> suggest<00:05:12.090> where<00:05:12.360> it<00:05:12.450> wants<00:05:12.690> to<00:05:12.720> go

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
music to suggest where it wants to go

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.520 
music to suggest where it wants to go
without<00:05:14.010> forcing<00:05:14.880> it<00:05:15.150> into<00:05:15.300> a<00:05:15.990> predefined

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
without forcing it into a predefined

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.710 
without forcing it into a predefined
form<00:05:17.130> but<00:05:17.610> forms<00:05:17.940> are<00:05:18.060> very<00:05:18.210> important

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
form but forms are very important

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.230 
form but forms are very important
because<00:05:19.140> it<00:05:19.500> helps<00:05:19.530> give<00:05:20.040> music<00:05:20.460> unity<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:21.120> it

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
because it helps give music unity and it

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.909 
because it helps give music unity and it
helps<00:05:21.450> give<00:05:21.630> it<00:05:21.780> enough<00:05:22.020> diversity<00:05:22.200> it<00:05:22.710> helps

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
helps give it enough diversity it helps

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.620 
helps give it enough diversity it helps
you<00:05:22.980> to<00:05:23.100> provide<00:05:23.460> that<00:05:23.490> that<00:05:24.060> right<00:05:24.300> kind<00:05:24.480> of

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
you to provide that that right kind of

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.970 
you to provide that that right kind of
balance<00:05:25.050> and<00:05:25.230> keep<00:05:25.590> a<00:05:25.740> piece<00:05:25.980> well<00:05:26.580> balanced

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
balance and keep a piece well balanced

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.909 
balance and keep a piece well balanced
so<00:05:28.980> that's<00:05:29.160> just<00:05:29.280> a<00:05:29.580> little<00:05:29.850> bit<00:05:29.940> about<00:05:30.150> my

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
so that's just a little bit about my

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.440 
so that's just a little bit about my
compositional<00:05:31.919> process<00:05:31.950> if<00:05:32.700> I<00:05:33.120> were<00:05:33.240> writing

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
compositional process if I were writing

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.780 
compositional process if I were writing
a<00:05:33.690> choral<00:05:34.260> piece<00:05:34.410> it's<00:05:35.220> a<00:05:35.340> bit<00:05:35.520> different

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
a choral piece it's a bit different

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.810 
a choral piece it's a bit different
because<00:05:36.560> for<00:05:37.560> example<00:05:37.620> i'm<00:05:37.980> also<00:05:38.130> working<00:05:38.490> on

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
because for example i'm also working on

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.760 
because for example i'm also working on
a<00:05:39.540> credo<00:05:40.260> the<00:05:40.650> Nicene<00:05:41.070> Creed<00:05:41.100> in<00:05:41.580> latin<00:05:42.000> for

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
a credo the Nicene Creed in latin for

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.670 
a credo the Nicene Creed in latin for
satb<00:05:43.770> choir<00:05:43.890> plus<00:05:44.790> brass<00:05:45.150> quintet<00:05:45.680> percussion

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
satb choir plus brass quintet percussion

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.570 
satb choir plus brass quintet percussion
and<00:05:46.830> organ<00:05:47.220> and<00:05:47.720> for<00:05:48.720> that<00:05:48.840> piece<00:05:49.140> it's<00:05:50.130> really

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
and organ and for that piece it's really

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.280 
and organ and for that piece it's really
about<00:05:50.669> the<00:05:50.940> text<00:05:51.479> it's<00:05:51.960> the<00:05:52.229> text<00:05:53.060> suggesting

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
about the text it's the text suggesting

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:59.210 
about the text it's the text suggesting
melodic<00:05:55.290> material<00:05:55.440> and<00:05:56.100> so<00:05:57.830> that's<00:05:58.830> really

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
melodic material and so that's really

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.890 
melodic material and so that's really
what<00:05:59.370> a<00:05:59.400> dig<00:05:59.640> into<00:05:59.790> a<00:05:59.910> dig<00:06:00.180> into<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:00.510> text<00:06:00.810> i

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
what a dig into a dig into the text i

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.600 
what a dig into a dig into the text i
dig<00:06:01.080> into<00:06:01.229> the<00:06:01.410> meaning<00:06:01.650> i<00:06:01.890> dig<00:06:02.100> into<00:06:02.250> where

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
dig into the meaning i dig into where

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.640 
dig into the meaning i dig into where
those<00:06:02.850> stresses<00:06:03.630> really<00:06:04.110> are<00:06:04.290> on<00:06:04.500> those

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
those stresses really are on those

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.930 
those stresses really are on those
syllables<00:06:05.010> so<00:06:05.729> that<00:06:05.940> i<00:06:05.970> can<00:06:06.180> write<00:06:06.479> music<00:06:06.800> for

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
syllables so that i can write music for

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.480 
syllables so that i can write music for
those<00:06:08.940> words<00:06:09.780> that<00:06:10.320> that<00:06:10.740> make<00:06:11.040> sense<00:06:11.280> and

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
those words that that make sense and

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.040 
those words that that make sense and
really<00:06:11.700> bring<00:06:12.030> out<00:06:12.240> the<00:06:12.479> meaning<00:06:12.810> in<00:06:12.930> those

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
really bring out the meaning in those

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.560 
really bring out the meaning in those
words<00:06:13.370> the<00:06:14.370> interesting<00:06:14.820> thing<00:06:14.880> about<00:06:15.120> the

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
words the interesting thing about the

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.710 
words the interesting thing about the
creative<00:06:16.260> process<00:06:16.700> is<00:06:17.700> that<00:06:17.970> initial<00:06:18.390> spark

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
creative process is that initial spark

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.920 
creative process is that initial spark
that<00:06:19.020> that<00:06:19.320> initial<00:06:19.770> idea<00:06:20.760> it's<00:06:21.210> a<00:06:21.330> leap<00:06:21.600> it's

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
that that initial idea it's a leap it's

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.110 
that that initial idea it's a leap it's
really<00:06:22.200> a<00:06:22.229> quantum<00:06:22.800> leap<00:06:22.979> from<00:06:23.280> from<00:06:23.790> having

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
really a quantum leap from from having

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.790 
really a quantum leap from from having
nothing<00:06:24.270> or<00:06:24.660> knowing<00:06:24.930> nothing<00:06:25.260> to<00:06:25.380> suddenly

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
nothing or knowing nothing to suddenly

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.010 
nothing or knowing nothing to suddenly
you've<00:06:25.950> got<00:06:26.130> an<00:06:26.280> idea<00:06:26.660> it's<00:06:27.660> one<00:06:27.870> of<00:06:27.960> those

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
you've got an idea it's one of those

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.480 
you've got an idea it's one of those
things<00:06:28.080> that<00:06:28.350> even<00:06:28.500> scientists<00:06:29.100> like<00:06:29.280> to

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
things that even scientists like to

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.060 
things that even scientists like to
explore<00:06:29.910> and<00:06:30.020> describe<00:06:31.020> and<00:06:31.290> it's<00:06:31.560> a<00:06:31.680> mystery

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
explore and describe and it's a mystery

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.790 
explore and describe and it's a mystery
how<00:06:32.310> that<00:06:32.970> happens<00:06:33.479> how<00:06:33.690> that<00:06:33.900> initial<00:06:34.470> idea

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
how that happens how that initial idea

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.029 
how that happens how that initial idea
that<00:06:35.039> initial<00:06:35.460> spark<00:06:35.810> happens<00:06:36.810> that<00:06:37.680> initial

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 
that initial spark happens that initial

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:41.030 
that initial spark happens that initial
spark<00:06:38.370> is<00:06:38.580> so<00:06:38.760> critical<00:06:39.419> to

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040 
spark is so critical to

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.190 
spark is so critical to
the<00:06:41.760> piece<00:06:42.000> started<00:06:42.420> for<00:06:42.600> getting<00:06:42.810> off<00:06:42.990> the

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200 
the piece started for getting off the

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.960 
the piece started for getting off the
ground<00:06:43.230> with<00:06:43.680> working<00:06:44.010> on<00:06:44.070> a<00:06:44.130> piece<00:06:44.400> and<00:06:44.640> of

ground with working on a piece and of

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.420 
ground with working on a piece and of
course<00:06:45.180> from<00:06:45.360> there<00:06:45.980> it's<00:06:46.980> a<00:06:47.130> matter<00:06:47.280> of

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
course from there it's a matter of

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.190 
course from there it's a matter of
working<00:06:47.820> with<00:06:48.180> the<00:06:48.300> material<00:06:48.810> from<00:06:48.930> their<00:06:49.080> law

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.200 
working with the material from their law

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.290 
working with the material from their law
does<00:06:49.350> this<00:06:49.470> work<00:06:49.740> you<00:06:50.280> know<00:06:50.400> it's<00:06:50.880> just<00:06:51.000> work

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
does this work you know it's just work

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.230 
does this work you know it's just work
and<00:06:51.870> there's<00:06:52.430> and<00:06:53.430> there's<00:06:53.670> also<00:06:53.820> you<00:06:54.090> know

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
and there's and there's also you know

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.610 
and there's and there's also you know
these<00:06:54.390> creative<00:06:54.810> leaps<00:06:55.050> that<00:06:55.230> happen

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
these creative leaps that happen

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.050 
these creative leaps that happen
periodically<00:06:56.040> as<00:06:56.490> you're<00:06:56.610> working<00:06:56.910> on<00:06:57.030> a

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060 
periodically as you're working on a

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.030 
periodically as you're working on a
piece<00:06:57.330> but<00:06:57.870> a<00:06:57.930> lot<00:06:58.110> of<00:06:58.140> it<00:06:58.290> is<00:06:58.380> work<00:06:58.560> and<00:06:58.800> all<00:06:58.920> of

00:06:59.030 --> 00:06:59.040 
piece but a lot of it is work and all of

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.480 
piece but a lot of it is work and all of
the<00:06:59.130> art<00:06:59.310> of<00:06:59.460> composition<00:07:00.120> is<00:07:00.500> in<00:07:01.500> what<00:07:02.100> you<00:07:02.220> do

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
the art of composition is in what you do

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.790 
the art of composition is in what you do
with<00:07:03.450> that<00:07:03.480> initial<00:07:04.110> spark<00:07:04.410> with<00:07:04.650> that

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
with that initial spark with that

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.910 
with that initial spark with that
initial<00:07:05.190> idea<00:07:05.550> how<00:07:05.910> you<00:07:06.440> develop<00:07:07.440> that<00:07:07.620> how

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:07.920 
initial idea how you develop that how

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.800 
initial idea how you develop that how
you<00:07:07.980> put<00:07:08.340> that<00:07:08.550> together<00:07:08.760> into<00:07:09.390> a<00:07:09.420> unified

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:09.810 
you put that together into a unified

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.740 
you put that together into a unified
composition<00:07:11.090> that's<00:07:12.090> really<00:07:12.360> where<00:07:12.480> the<00:07:12.600> art

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:12.750 
composition that's really where the art

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.630 
composition that's really where the art
of<00:07:12.840> composition<00:07:13.440> is<00:07:13.620> at<00:07:13.800> its<00:07:14.040> not<00:07:14.190> so<00:07:14.340> much<00:07:14.490> in

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:14.640 
of composition is at its not so much in

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.580 
of composition is at its not so much in
getting<00:07:14.910> ideas<00:07:15.240> many<00:07:15.510> people<00:07:15.810> get<00:07:15.930> ideas<00:07:16.260> many

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:16.590 
getting ideas many people get ideas many

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.800 
getting ideas many people get ideas many
people<00:07:16.860> have<00:07:17.040> great<00:07:17.340> ideas<00:07:17.730> for<00:07:17.760> textures<00:07:18.450> or

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:18.810 
people have great ideas for textures or

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.860 
people have great ideas for textures or
grooves<00:07:19.110> or<00:07:19.530> or<00:07:19.770> melodies<00:07:20.730> or<00:07:20.760> whatever<00:07:21.720> the

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:21.870 
grooves or or melodies or whatever the

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.170 
grooves or or melodies or whatever the
case<00:07:21.900> may<00:07:22.230> be<00:07:22.260> but<00:07:22.620> it's<00:07:23.340> how<00:07:23.490> you<00:07:23.550> take<00:07:24.150> that

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.180 
case may be but it's how you take that

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.540 
case may be but it's how you take that
melody<00:07:24.780> it's<00:07:24.930> how<00:07:25.080> you<00:07:25.140> take<00:07:25.560> that<00:07:25.590> groove<00:07:26.220> or

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:26.550 
melody it's how you take that groove or

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.390 
melody it's how you take that groove or
that<00:07:26.730> that<00:07:26.940> texture<00:07:27.690> and<00:07:28.160> incorporate<00:07:29.160> that

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400 
that that texture and incorporate that

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.150 
that that texture and incorporate that
into<00:07:29.700> a<00:07:30.210> musical<00:07:30.720> work<00:07:30.870> of<00:07:31.080> art<00:07:31.260> that<00:07:31.500> that

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 
into a musical work of art that that

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.070 
into a musical work of art that that
really<00:07:32.520> is<00:07:32.760> what<00:07:32.790> what<00:07:33.210> composition<00:07:33.810> is<00:07:33.960> all

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 
really is what what composition is all

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.240 
really is what what composition is all
