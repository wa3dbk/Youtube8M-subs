this<00:00:46.949> and<00:00:47.220> that<00:00:47.519> whole<00:00:47.729> process<00:00:48.269> of<00:00:48.449> making<00:00:48.750> it

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
this and that whole process of making it

from start to finish

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.479 
from start to finish
helps<00:00:50.820> me<00:00:51.360> build<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.229> stronger<00:00:52.650> connection<00:00:53.010> to

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
helps me build a stronger connection to

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.320 
helps me build a stronger connection to
the<00:00:53.580> animal<00:00:55.159> maybe<00:00:56.159> it's<00:00:56.339> that<00:00:56.489> building<00:00:56.850> it

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
the animal maybe it's that building it

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.229 
the animal maybe it's that building it
with<00:00:57.629> with<00:00:58.530> these<00:00:58.710> cut<00:00:59.010> pieces<00:00:59.519> and<00:00:59.790> it's<00:01:00.000> more

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
with with these cut pieces and it's more

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.829 
with with these cut pieces and it's more
sculptural<00:01:00.839> and<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.790> hasn't<00:01:03.269> had<00:01:03.600> more

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
sculptural and that it hasn't had more

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.140 
sculptural and that it hasn't had more
dimension<00:01:04.440> like<00:01:04.710> an<00:01:05.040> actual<00:01:05.430> dimension<00:01:05.670> with

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
dimension like an actual dimension with

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.969 
dimension like an actual dimension with
the<00:01:06.180> layers<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.840> paper<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.770> can't

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the layers of a paper that you can't

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.690 
the layers of a paper that you can't
achieve<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.520> with<00:01:08.969> just<00:01:09.329> paint<00:01:09.680> it'll<00:01:10.700> be

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
achieve with with just paint it'll be

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.670 
achieve with with just paint it'll be
special<00:01:12.149> and<00:01:12.359> unique<00:01:12.630> from<00:01:12.899> what<00:01:13.289> might

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
special and unique from what might

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.260 
special and unique from what might
typically<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.490> out<00:01:14.579> there<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.210> think

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
typically be out there and I think

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.260 
typically be out there and I think
that's<00:01:15.600> something<00:01:16.469> that<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:17.159> exhibit<00:01:18.090> has

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
that's something that this exhibit has

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.440 
that's something that this exhibit has
focused<00:01:19.079> on<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.799> lot<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:21.030> finding

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
focused on a lot is it's finding

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.419 
focused on a lot is it's finding
different<00:01:21.929> ways<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.530> connect<00:01:22.920> people<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
different ways to connect people and

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:26.950 
different ways to connect people and
doing<00:01:23.579> something<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.149> little<00:01:24.479> bit<00:01:24.600> more<00:01:24.630> unique

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
doing something a little bit more unique

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.020 
doing something a little bit more unique
someone<00:01:27.960> can<00:01:28.140> learn<00:01:28.350> about<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:29.490> animal<00:01:29.909> or

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
someone can learn about the animal or

are<00:02:01.030> under<00:02:01.329> the<00:02:01.450> water<00:02:01.570> because<00:02:02.049> it's<00:02:02.229> easy<00:02:02.439> to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
are under the water because it's easy to

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.499 
are under the water because it's easy to
forget<00:02:02.890> what<00:02:03.100> you<00:02:03.280> don't<00:02:03.460> see<00:02:03.729> and<00:02:04.000> that's

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.050 
I'm hoping that when the guests come and
see<00:02:26.440> this<00:02:26.650> they're<00:02:26.950> they're<00:02:27.250> blown<00:02:27.549> away<00:02:27.819> by

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
all that lives under the water and next

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.699

time<00:02:31.480> they<00:02:31.599> go<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.930> beach<00:02:32.140> still<00:02:32.440> think

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
time they go to the beach still think

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.620 
time they go to the beach still think
well<00:02:32.890> yeah<00:02:33.190> there's<00:02:33.459> probably<00:02:33.700> shark<00:02:34.450> in

well yeah there's probably shark in

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.509 
well yeah there's probably shark in
there<00:02:34.810> or<00:02:34.989> there's<00:02:35.260> probably<00:02:35.650> jellies<00:02:36.370> and

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
there or there's probably jellies and

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.500 
there or there's probably jellies and
the<00:02:36.910> school<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.390> this<00:02:37.989> and<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.440> school<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.799> that

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
the school of this and a school of that

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.160 
the school of this and a school of that
these<00:02:40.510> these<00:02:41.640> experiences<00:02:42.640> do<00:02:42.910> last<00:02:43.690> for<00:02:44.140> a

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
these these experiences do last for a

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.559 
these these experiences do last for a
lifetime<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.739> people<00:02:45.489> do<00:02:45.610> have<00:02:45.790> memories<00:02:46.030> and

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
lifetime and people do have memories and

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.350 
lifetime and people do have memories and
really<00:02:47.230> do<00:02:47.410> hold<00:02:47.860> on<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.340> their<00:02:48.730> experience

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
really do hold on to their experience

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.530 
really do hold on to their experience
here<00:02:50.049> so<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.920> do<00:02:51.340> think<00:02:51.700> that<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:52.060> can<00:02:52.269> be

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
here so I do think that it can be

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.809 
here so I do think that it can be
something<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:53.379> they<00:02:53.709> carry<00:02:53.980> with<00:02:54.280> them

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
something that they carry with them

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:29.280 
something that they carry with them
forever

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.349
