just<00:02:22.290> like<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.830> front<00:02:23.100> so<00:02:23.250> we've<00:02:23.370> got<00:02:23.490> a<00:02:23.520> whole

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
just like the front so we've got a whole

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.690 
just like the front so we've got a whole
new<00:02:24.030> design<00:02:24.180> going<00:02:24.690> on<00:02:24.810> obviously<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.920> new

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
new design going on obviously the new

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.160 
new design going on obviously the new
placement<00:02:26.970> for<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.390> exhaust<00:02:27.600> tips<00:02:27.930> or<00:02:28.140> the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
placement for the exhaust tips or the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.050 
placement for the exhaust tips or the
new<00:02:28.380> exhaust<00:02:28.680> tips<00:02:28.950> around<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.430> pipes<00:02:29.640> inside

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
new exhaust tips around the pipes inside

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.290 
new exhaust tips around the pipes inside
there<00:02:30.360> presumably<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.230> car<00:02:31.410> also<00:02:31.620> has<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.950> new

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
there presumably the car also has a new

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.480 
there presumably the car also has a new
exhaust<00:02:33.300> system<00:02:33.390> itself<00:02:34.050> but<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.160> rear<00:02:35.310> is

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
exhaust system itself but the rear is

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.070 
exhaust system itself but the rear is
just<00:02:35.670> slightly<00:02:35.880> more<00:02:35.970> aggressive<00:02:36.180> more<00:02:36.780> fins

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
just slightly more aggressive more fins
