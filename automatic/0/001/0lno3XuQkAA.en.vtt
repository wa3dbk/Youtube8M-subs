00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
over here and then what you guys are

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.830 
over here and then what you guys are
going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.520> want<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.700> do<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.059> pretty<00:00:45.390> much<00:00:45.480> stand

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
going to want to do is pretty much stand

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.010 
going to want to do is pretty much stand
in<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> middle<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.530> dirt<00:00:47.190> hill<00:00:47.460> and

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
in the middle of this dirt hill and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.790 
in the middle of this dirt hill and
place<00:00:49.020> your<00:00:49.230> tack<00:00:49.469> right<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> middle<00:00:50.340> and

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
place your tack right in the middle and

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.450 
place your tack right in the middle and
then<00:00:52.800> get<00:00:53.129> killed<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.820> drop<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.390> flag<00:00:54.690> and

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
then get killed so you drop the flag and

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.770 
then get killed so you drop the flag and
then<00:00:56.460> right<00:00:56.760> when<00:00:56.910> your<00:00:57.090> spawn<00:00:57.420> you're<00:00:57.660> going

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
then right when your spawn you're going

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.510 
then right when your spawn you're going
to<00:00:57.840> want<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.020> get<00:00:58.170> your<00:00:58.260> enemy<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.859> run<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.309> top

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
to want to get your enemy to run on top

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.040 
to want to get your enemy to run on top
of<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.730> flag<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.420> stops<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.989> from

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
of the flag so that it stops you from

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.619 
of the flag so that it stops you from
capturing<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.859> call<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.760> Osprey<00:01:03.149> gunner<00:01:03.329> and

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
capturing it call the Osprey gunner and

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.469 
capturing it call the Osprey gunner and
pretty<00:01:03.960> much<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.170> same<00:01:04.350> spot<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.830> do<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.479> then

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
pretty much the same spot I do and then

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.700 
pretty much the same spot I do and then
you're<00:01:06.600> gonna<00:01:06.689> want<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.900> wait<00:01:07.049> till<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.439> flies

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
you're gonna want to wait till it flies

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.920 
you're gonna want to wait till it flies
over<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.220> spot<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.549> stops<00:01:09.180> moving<00:01:09.780> and

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
over to this spot and stops moving and

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.179 
over to this spot and stops moving and
then<00:01:10.470> you're<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.650> going<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.920> tell<00:01:11.100> your

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
then you're just going to tell your

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.090 
then you're just going to tell your
friend<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.610> run<00:01:12.090> off<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.540> flag<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.560> if<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.010> do

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
friend to run off the flag and if you do

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.530 
friend to run off the flag and if you do
this<00:01:14.189> correctly<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.729> will<00:01:14.820> capture<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.270> flag

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
this correctly you will capture the flag

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.480 
this correctly you will capture the flag
and<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.930> will<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.200> standing<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.310> will

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
and you will be standing but you will

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.429 
and you will be standing but you will
still<00:01:17.610> be<00:01:17.759> being<00:01:18.210> controlled<00:01:18.659> by<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> Osprey

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
still be being controlled by the Osprey

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.859 
still be being controlled by the Osprey
so<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.460> how<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.640> do<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> UFO<00:01:21.330> mode<00:01:21.600> and

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
so this is how you do the UFO mode and

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.050 
so this is how you do the UFO mode and
flying<00:01:22.290> glitch<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.950> you're<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:23.970> to

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
flying glitch and you're just going to

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.700 
flying glitch and you're just going to
want<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.240> wait<00:01:24.390> until<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.990> Osprey<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.650> to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
want to wait until the Osprey going to

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.200 
want to wait until the Osprey going to
