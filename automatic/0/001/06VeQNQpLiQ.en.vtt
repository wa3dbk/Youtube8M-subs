welcome<00:00:00.570> to<00:00:00.719> the<00:00:00.810> necklace<00:00:01.170> 11x<00:00:01.620> full<00:00:01.770> of

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
welcome to the necklace 11x full of

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.710 
welcome to the necklace 11x full of
technology<00:00:02.399> today<00:00:02.730> I'd<00:00:02.970> like<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.240> compare<00:00:03.570> the

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
technology today I'd like to compare the

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.220 
technology today I'd like to compare the
AMD<00:00:04.200> r9<00:00:04.350> 290<00:00:05.130> with<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.700> NVIDIA<00:00:06.270> GTX<00:00:06.629> 780

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
AMD r9 290 with the NVIDIA GTX 780

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.570 
AMD r9 290 with the NVIDIA GTX 780
graphics<00:00:07.740> card<00:00:12.620> first<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.799> all<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:13.950> have<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.340> say

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
graphics card first of all I have to say

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.279 
graphics card first of all I have to say
it's<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.089> bit<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.330> an<00:00:15.450> unfair<00:00:15.870> comparison

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
it's a bit of an unfair comparison

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.040 
it's a bit of an unfair comparison
because<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.890> r9<00:00:17.220> 290<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:18.050> significantly

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
because the r9 290 is significantly

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.620 
because the r9 290 is significantly
cheaper<00:00:19.170> than<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:20.189> GTX<00:00:20.369> 780<00:00:21.000> but<00:00:21.539> the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
cheaper than the GTX 780 but the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.480 
cheaper than the GTX 780 but the
performance<00:00:22.230> should<00:00:22.350> be<00:00:22.410> comparable<00:00:23.340> and

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
performance should be comparable and

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.240 
performance should be comparable and
besides<00:00:24.300> many<00:00:25.080> people<00:00:25.410> have<00:00:25.529> requested<00:00:25.859> this

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
besides many people have requested this

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.000 
besides many people have requested this
video<00:00:26.550> also<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.420> should<00:00:27.599> let<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.900> know<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.500> only

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
video also I should let you know I only

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.800 
video also I should let you know I only
had<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.460> possibility<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:30.269> test<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
had the possibility to test the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.380 
had the possibility to test the
reference<00:00:31.289> designs<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.949> these<00:00:32.399> cards<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
reference designs of these cards so the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.970 
reference designs of these cards so the
performance<00:00:33.750> would<00:00:34.110> turn<00:00:34.350> out<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.649> be<00:00:34.680> better

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
performance would turn out to be better

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.580 
performance would turn out to be better
on<00:00:35.340> aftermarket<00:00:35.880> designs<00:00:36.450> keep<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.230> mind

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
on aftermarket designs keep that in mind

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.860 
on aftermarket designs keep that in mind
but<00:00:38.040> enough<00:00:38.309> talking<00:00:38.640> onto<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.390> benchmarks

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
but enough talking onto the benchmarks

00:00:39.870 --> 00:01:22.740 
but enough talking onto the benchmarks
now

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.590 

all<00:01:23.830> right<00:01:24.830> these<00:01:25.340> two<00:01:25.400> cards<00:01:25.820> are<00:01:26.030> pretty

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
all right these two cards are pretty

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.020 
all right these two cards are pretty
amazing<00:01:27.350> I<00:01:27.410> have<00:01:27.560> to<00:01:27.710> say<00:01:27.860> however<00:01:28.490> this<00:01:28.760> time

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
amazing I have to say however this time

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.330 
amazing I have to say however this time
it's<00:01:29.210> very<00:01:29.600> very<00:01:30.080> easy<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.500> pick<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.740> winner

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
it's very very easy to pick a winner

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.810 
it's very very easy to pick a winner
definitely<00:01:32.150> it's<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:32.510> AMD<00:01:32.990> r9<00:01:33.170> 290<00:01:33.920> it<00:01:34.370> costs

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
definitely it's the AMD r9 290 it costs

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.600 
definitely it's the AMD r9 290 it costs
less<00:01:35.000> than<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.360> nvidia<00:01:35.810> gtx<00:01:36.050> 780<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:36.950> still

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
less than the nvidia gtx 780 and still

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.660 
less than the nvidia gtx 780 and still
performs<00:01:38.210> as<00:01:38.390> good<00:01:38.900> or<00:01:39.140> even<00:01:39.620> better<00:01:39.860> in<00:01:40.430> some

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
performs as good or even better in some

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.790 
performs as good or even better in some
cases<00:01:40.700> even<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.930> power<00:01:42.110> consumption<00:01:42.530> is

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
cases even the power consumption is

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.310 
cases even the power consumption is
significantly<00:01:42.950> lower<00:01:43.940> on<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.510> r9<00:01:44.660> 290

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
significantly lower on the r9 290

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.770 
significantly lower on the r9 290
compared<00:01:45.680> to<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.890> gtx<00:01:46.310> 780<00:01:46.670> there's<00:01:47.300> only<00:01:47.510> one

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
compared to the gtx 780 there's only one

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.170 
compared to the gtx 780 there's only one
test<00:01:48.140> for<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.440> nvidia<00:01:48.860> card<00:01:49.190> 1<00:01:49.460> and<00:01:49.729> that's

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
test for the nvidia card 1 and that's

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.230 
test for the nvidia card 1 and that's
the<00:01:50.390> temperature<00:01:50.900> test<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.619> AMD<00:01:52.040> r9<00:01:52.160> 290<00:01:52.910> just

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
the temperature test the AMD r9 290 just

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.960 
the temperature test the AMD r9 290 just
like<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.479> 290x<00:01:54.020> maxes<00:01:54.560> out<00:01:54.680> with<00:01:54.890> 95<00:01:55.520> degrees

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
like the 290x maxes out with 95 degrees

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.170 
like the 290x maxes out with 95 degrees
Celsius<00:01:56.479> the<00:01:56.899> GTX<00:01:57.350> 780<00:01:57.680> maxes<00:01:58.310> out<00:01:58.399> at<00:01:58.460> 83

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
Celsius the GTX 780 maxes out at 83

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.150 
Celsius the GTX 780 maxes out at 83
degrees<00:01:59.210> instead<00:01:59.810> however<00:02:00.560> keep<00:02:01.009> in<00:02:01.100> mind

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
degrees instead however keep in mind

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.639 
degrees instead however keep in mind
this<00:02:01.970> problem<00:02:02.600> is<00:02:02.750> fixed<00:02:02.990> with<00:02:03.229> aftermarket

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
this problem is fixed with aftermarket

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.550 
this problem is fixed with aftermarket
designs<00:02:04.190> so<00:02:04.910> clearly<00:02:05.240> if<00:02:05.690> you<00:02:05.990> can't<00:02:06.320> decide

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
designs so clearly if you can't decide

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.010 
designs so clearly if you can't decide
on<00:02:06.619> which<00:02:06.890> card<00:02:07.190> to<00:02:07.280> go<00:02:07.430> for<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:08.179> r9<00:02:08.479> 290<00:02:08.989> or

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
on which card to go for the r9 290 or

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.699 
on which card to go for the r9 290 or
GTX<00:02:09.709> 780<00:02:10.040> you<00:02:10.610> have<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.209> go<00:02:11.360> with<00:02:11.570> the<00:02:11.720> r9<00:02:11.900> 290

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
GTX 780 you have to go with the r9 290

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.500 
GTX 780 you have to go with the r9 290
if<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.370> care<00:02:13.640> about<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.030> price<00:02:14.270> performance

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
if you care about the price performance

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.290 
if you care about the price performance
ratio<00:02:14.840> which<00:02:15.590> obviously<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.370> much<00:02:16.700> better<00:02:16.970> on

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
ratio which obviously is much better on

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.170 
ratio which obviously is much better on
AMD's<00:02:17.750> r9<00:02:18.110> 290<00:02:18.560> here<00:02:18.830> still<00:02:19.550> in<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.850> end<00:02:20.000> it's

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
AMD's r9 290 here still in the end it's

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.240 
AMD's r9 290 here still in the end it's
your<00:02:20.239> decision<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.050> not<00:02:21.260> mine<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:21.860> hope<00:02:22.130> I
