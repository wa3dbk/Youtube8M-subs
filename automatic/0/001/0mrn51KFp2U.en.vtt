00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
my quilting plan for this is I noticed

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.120 
my quilting plan for this is I noticed
that<00:00:30.000> these<00:00:30.269> fabrics<00:00:31.050> have<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.619> really<00:00:31.920> cute

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
that these fabrics have this really cute

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.760 
that these fabrics have this really cute
little<00:00:32.309> flower<00:00:32.669> inside<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> square<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.620> have

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
little flower inside a square and I have

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.410 
little flower inside a square and I have
a<00:00:34.800> really<00:00:35.130> big<00:00:35.309> square<00:00:35.610> here<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.180> thought

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
a really big square here so I thought

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.790 
a really big square here so I thought
that<00:00:36.600> would<00:00:36.719> be<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.840> perfect<00:00:37.230> place<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.410> put<00:00:37.739> a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
that would be a perfect place to put a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.270 
that would be a perfect place to put a
flower<00:00:38.390> and<00:00:39.390> then<00:00:39.719> when<00:00:40.590> I'm<00:00:40.710> quilting<00:00:41.129> this

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
flower and then when I'm quilting this

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.200 
flower and then when I'm quilting this
block<00:00:41.520> for<00:00:41.550> real

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
block for real

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.119 
block for real
I<00:00:42.239> would<00:00:42.480> probably<00:00:42.660> quilt<00:00:43.050> wavy<00:00:43.320> lines<00:00:43.770> in

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
I would probably quilt wavy lines in

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.490 
I would probably quilt wavy lines in
these<00:00:44.280> darker<00:00:44.760> bits<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.210> hold<00:00:45.420> them<00:00:45.600> down<00:00:45.840> but

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
these darker bits to hold them down but

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.810 
these darker bits to hold them down but

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
I'm going to stop here and trim my

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.180 
I'm going to stop here and trim my
threads<00:02:02.540> so<00:02:03.229> they<00:02:03.320> don't<00:02:03.500> get<00:02:03.650> in<00:02:03.740> my<00:02:03.770> way<00:02:03.860> once

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
threads so they don't get in my way once

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.010 
threads so they don't get in my way once
I<00:02:04.340> machine<00:02:04.850> quilting<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.360> then<00:02:05.479> I<00:02:05.600> can<00:02:05.780> just

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
I machine quilting and then I can just

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.419 
I machine quilting and then I can just
go<00:02:06.830> to<00:02:06.860> town<00:02:07.010> with<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.850> machine<00:02:08.149> quilting<00:02:08.600> so

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
go to town with the machine quilting so

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.270 
go to town with the machine quilting so
here<00:02:10.429> we<00:02:10.580> go<00:02:10.729> just<00:02:11.110> hit<00:02:12.110> go<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:13.510> notice<00:02:14.510> that

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
here we go just hit go and notice that

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.440 
here we go just hit go and notice that
as<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:17.480> move<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.110> fabric<00:02:18.319> slow<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:20.060> machine

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
as I move the fabric slow the machine

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.690 
as I move the fabric slow the machine
moves<00:02:20.780> slow<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.500> as<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:21.709> move<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.100> fast<00:02:22.340> it

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
moves slow and as I move it fast it

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.949 
moves slow and as I move it fast it
moves<00:02:22.940> fast<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.300> that's<00:02:23.510> how<00:02:23.750> it's

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
moves fast and that's how it's

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.900 
moves fast and that's how it's
regulating<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.739> stitches<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:25.459> I'm<00:02:25.610> just

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
regulating the stitches so I'm just

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.520 
regulating the stitches so I'm just
going<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.090> do<00:02:26.270> this<00:02:26.450> big<00:02:26.780> spiral<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:32.450> now<00:02:33.350> I'm

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
going to do this big spiral and now I'm

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:49.470 
going to do this big spiral and now I'm
going<00:02:33.769> to<00:02:33.830> do<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.040> petal

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.750 

and<00:02:50.480> these<00:02:50.720> are<00:02:50.930> really<00:02:51.140> freeform<00:02:51.980> petals<00:02:52.430> so

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
and these are really freeform petals so

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.540 
and these are really freeform petals so
I'm<00:02:52.910> not<00:02:53.060> trying<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.780> be<00:02:53.959> super<00:02:54.770> fussy<00:02:55.250> about

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
I'm not trying to be super fussy about

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.420

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
them if I were trying to be really

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.460 
them if I were trying to be really
precise<00:02:58.849> I<00:02:59.150> would<00:02:59.300> have<00:02:59.420> marked<00:02:59.750> that<00:03:00.050> but

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
precise I would have marked that but

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.220 
precise I would have marked that but
