00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.019
 hello my name is anastasia i 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.269
 teaching web design courses in st. 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.130
 Petersburg school TV my course 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.890
 consists of four stages the first stage 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.130
 this is graphic design the next stage 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.560
 this is adobe illustrator the next stage is 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.990
 adobe photoshop and last it 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.060
 directly web design building 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.699
 sites a little I will talk about the first 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.630
 the occupation that we will have in 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.730
 school television 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.140
 this graphic design is an introductory lesson with 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.640
 what usually begins the whole design 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.370
 of course from simple geometric 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.680
 figures we change them all day to watch 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.079
 can, too, everywhere of these figures is built 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.120
 literally all any items also 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.980
 interface elements by the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.360
 common figure in web design 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.640
 this is a rectangle 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.500
 why because we use it 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.980
 everywhere vertical menu or 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.210
 horizontal this object is static it 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.219
 it contains a lot of information 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.799
 also we can sleep use 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.450
 rectangle when we draw the sliders with 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.260
 photos for customer 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.020
 one of the favorite classic figures for 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.150
 web designer that's square why square 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.549
 because we use it for for 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.110
 pressing various buttons she is very 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.939
 convenient for positioning photos 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.770
 inside the gallery the same contact 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.950
 facebook or some other ghali 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.640
 gallery circle form non-standard 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.920
 closed and she most likely 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.869
 used for decorative items 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.119
 maybe for beautiful frames 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.759
 photos or individual blocks that 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.310
 located on the side of the sites which 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.009
 figures do not get along on the site it is such 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.899
 figures like a triangle do not use it 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.880
 very often because a lot 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.500
 images do not fit into this figure 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.210
 triangle is often used or as 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.240
 background or as some kind of decorative 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.850
 items or fit most often 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.200
 logo ellipse can't sleep either 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.479
 fits into the design 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.430
 it is used extremely rarely and also 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.479
 despite being correct 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.850
 hexagon 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.099
 which we can observe a lot of where in 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.360
 nature does not look harmonious in 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.190
 compositional plan for the site 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.650
 It is very difficult to build a composition with 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.750
 such a lot of coal forms when 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.880
 drafting any prototypes or any 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.950
 site structures we still draw 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.410
 these forms to illustrate 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.600
 to the customer where and what will be located 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.900
 which buttons which pictures and so on 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.460
 and then already when we used everything 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.920
 geometric shapes that us 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.990
 like we can already increase the design 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.040
 on top of these geometric shapes quickly 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.110
 his website design 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.320
 if you want more information 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.970
 about building websites and using 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.550
 geometric shapes on the site and 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.459
 composition building within 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.840
 interfaces then come 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:54.390
 St. Petersburg School of Television on 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.390
 Course in city design and thank you very much
