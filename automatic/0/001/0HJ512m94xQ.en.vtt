00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.420
 the appearance of the opel astra does not have 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.980
 nothing special or different from the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.880
 other hotels in the city â€‹â€‹of yokohama 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.550
 in japan 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.430
 in fact its appearance is equal to that of 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.350
 any other building in the city 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.619
 but the big difference is that his people 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.520
 they are corpses that spend cold nights 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.520
 bedrooms 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.949
 inside the employees of the place 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.590
 prepare to receive guests 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:34.820
 like any other hotel 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.640
 they clean and sweep they put flowers and even 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.770
 accommodate the coffins to give them a 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.079
 comfortable welcome to your hygiene and not of 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.510
 tonight 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.859
 the hotel you are so common in your 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.649
 appearance that many young people 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:51.199
 unsuspecting attend the place in search 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.809
 of a night to stay before 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.340
 realize that the hotel is only for 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.040
 corpses 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.590
 the strange place is not just for facer 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.450
 the morbid but that is the reflection of a 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.520
 much deeper crisis than in front 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.100
 to gabon 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.460
 the high mortality rates in your 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.460
 population 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.570
 Japan is one of the countries with more 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.450
 elderly so death is something 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.670
 usual in the cities so much is this way 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.260
 that the incineration companies do not give 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.860
 supply to burn the amount of 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.470
 corpses that arrive every day was like this 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.420
 what did I do if you fall in love with the 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.150
 extreme saturation suffered by the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.250
 crematories of the land of the rising sun are 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.430
 decided to create the first hotel to 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.370
 dead people based in yokohama for a 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.500
 price of 12,000 yen per day 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.240
 equivalent to 100 euros relatives 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.670
 they can leave the corpse of their beings 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.100
 loved ones in some of the thousand 58 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.140
 heated rooms that counts 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.170
 the hotel 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.750
 the rooms in addition to refrigerated 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.090
 they have a mechanical system that 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.870
 remove the coffin and send them to 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.720
 crematorium once the deadline 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.360
 also in the place impossible to access 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.270
 more services such as selling flowers and 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.850
 Japanese crematorium ornaments if the 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.340
 rooms are full coffins of 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.070
 pranes will see in the hallway until 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.370
 his turn which may take up 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.680
 four days the cult of the deceased in 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.080
 Japanese is so ingrained that many 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.540
 family members assume an outlay that 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.730
 It can cost ten thousand euros in 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.010
 flowers for each 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.880
 what generates a business of 12 thousand 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.090
 million euros per year 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.310
 the strange but crowded place until 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.960
 now they only have a few courses at the 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.470
 in the suburbs of the city of 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:49.320
 yokohama the second most populated in the country 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.900
 this dreary get Japanese offers a 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.110
 room with cream a refrigerator by 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.630
 12,000 yen the entrance to the place is 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.480
 free so that each family member and friend 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.270
 can visit at any time 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.650
 deceased but the same creator he admits 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.810
 that does not allow to face the 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.030
 saturation of the morgues since in 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.820
 camon it is very complicated to obtain 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.770
 permission to open more 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.140
 crematoriums 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.140
 but to open entered as the star we 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.390
 requires corroborating procedures but that 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.970
 ensures that I believe the hotel as a 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.910
 alternative so that families do not 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.560
 they are forced to keep bodies of their 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.930
 relatives in the south domiciles 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.390
 so he already sees it in friends while 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.200
 decide whether to wait for eternal rest in 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:43.000
 a luxurious hotel I invite you to click 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.000
 in I like and subscribe 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.920
 ah
