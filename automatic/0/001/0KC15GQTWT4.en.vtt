00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:28.230
 and you went a lot to the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.670
 concentrations of soccer teams and 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.130
 even from the Chilean national team many 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.230
 previous times routine or not and when only 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.510
 we are very lucky that as 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.730
 we make a pretty popular mood we are 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.309
 a humor liked by the players 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.850
 so many times he is moved to paint 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.000
 durÃ¡n 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.879
 to different different selections 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.530
 processes and I have an experience well 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.360
 pretty me with regard to that good all 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.170
 we have nice press but someone 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.010
 happened that we went to do a show and 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.510
 ending the show we always 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.250
 we are doing the fools and so that 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.339
 gives us a shirt that more silver 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.899
 wins and those that less 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.880
 and we as the pagans as the 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.229
 we pay, we stay doing 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.069
 a place to give us t-shirts 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:19.700
 and Pelao Acosta got out and sent 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:22.610
 look for the shirts he took it as he 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.090
 called the one who arrived now I wish the 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.939
 front chalkboard and told me idol and 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.649
 for me that was bro and being the idol 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.270
 that you are then we have spent a 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.270
 very nice moment of the selection 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.470
 this year 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:56.829
 last year after chile because 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.829
 they left us champions 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.810
 and the colon give more and the chili came out and 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.370
 this was the most bad show he did 6 that 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.370
 it's not professional it's handsome 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.670
 I grabbed all this maybe not me in that 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.360
 in that aspect I am well responsible 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.360
 lie lie 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.360
 do not 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.330
 no no the wolves 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:51.700
 and in that aspect 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:54.129
 I was good in jest and a few would be 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.659
 this one is going to work and like the 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.659
 clown with grief joy 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.370
 I also do not know, but I 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.319
 I want clear occasions that I'm from the choir 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.840
 but I'm not a fanatic with you the father 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.969
 you like to go to the stadiums the one who cries 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.400
 who suffers when he pours the equipment I do not 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:14.260
 I for pure Chilean when playing chile 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.970
 I threw myself to the legs and I go to 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.970
 chili but not when this fanatic 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.920
 it came out to me 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:52.260
 the reception you have of the 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:57.840
 Good wave footballers all the time is 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:04:01.019
 well now impossible everywhere we 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.280
 missing the person who throws one or two was 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.280
 and already dies
