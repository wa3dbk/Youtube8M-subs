like<00:03:19.040> that<00:03:19.250> they<00:03:19.430> become<00:03:19.730> like<00:03:19.910> almost<00:03:20.150> like<00:03:20.270> a

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360

site I mean I I'm confident about the
installation<00:05:39.450> and<00:05:39.600> the<00:05:39.690> work<00:05:40.140> itself<00:05:40.350> but

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
installation and the work itself but

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.780 
installation and the work itself but
just<00:05:42.030> to<00:05:42.150> insert<00:05:42.570> one<00:05:42.960> small<00:05:43.620> gesture<00:05:44.130> of<00:05:44.160> like

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
just to insert one small gesture of like

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.000 
just to insert one small gesture of like
this<00:05:45.030> performative<00:05:45.810> element<00:05:46.290> in<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.560> show<00:05:46.770> I

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
this performative element in the show I

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.220 
this performative element in the show I
think<00:05:47.250> is<00:05:47.340> important<00:05:47.850> so<00:05:48.780> it's<00:05:48.960> just<00:05:49.080> is

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
think is important so it's just is

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.370 
think is important so it's just is
really<00:05:49.410> simple<00:05:49.710> like<00:05:49.980> half<00:05:50.190> hour<00:05:51.380> performance

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
really simple like half hour performance

00:05:52.380 --> 00:06:00.940 
really simple like half hour performance
I<00:05:52.860> think<00:05:52.890> so<00:05:53.520> that's<00:05:53.670> the<00:05:53.820> idea<00:05:57.020> mmhmm<00:05:58.020> yeah

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.460 

yeah<00:06:01.950> cool
