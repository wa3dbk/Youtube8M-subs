we want to animate it as sort of an

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.060 
we want to animate it as sort of an
exploded<00:00:21.480> video<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.380> I'll<00:00:22.470> also<00:00:22.680> take<00:00:22.949> you

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
exploded video and I'll also take you

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.679 
exploded video and I'll also take you
through<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.250> process<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.910> really<00:00:24.300> quickly

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
through the process of really quickly

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.320 
through the process of really quickly
exporting<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.619> video<00:00:25.949> as<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> gif<00:00:26.550> file<00:00:26.820> using

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
exporting a video as a gif file using

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.349 
exporting a video as a gif file using
Photoshop<00:00:28.609> so<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> first<00:00:29.910> thing<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.150> want<00:00:30.330> to

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
Photoshop so the first thing you want to

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.120 
Photoshop so the first thing you want to
do<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.750> exploit<00:00:31.199> out<00:00:31.349> these<00:00:31.500> layers<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.859> hide

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
do is exploit out these layers and hide

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.560 
do is exploit out these layers and hide
the<00:00:32.279> lake<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.730> we'll<00:00:32.969> do<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the lake and we'll do that in the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.450 
the lake and we'll do that in the
animation<00:00:33.989> environment<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.920> can<00:00:35.070> see<00:00:35.250> from

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
animation environment you can see from

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.400 
animation environment you can see from
the<00:00:35.550> top<00:00:35.730> here<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.200> environment

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
the top here and in this environment

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.260 
the top here and in this environment
you'll<00:00:37.890> see<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> new<00:00:38.280> set<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.520> tools<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
you'll see a new set of tools on the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.209 
you'll see a new set of tools on the
toolbar<00:00:39.320> feel<00:00:40.320> free<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.530> explore<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> little

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
toolbar feel free to explore it a little

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.889 
toolbar feel free to explore it a little
bit<00:00:41.399> but<00:00:41.969> for<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.239> video<00:00:42.480> we're<00:00:42.660> mostly

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
bit but for this video we're mostly

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.630 
bit but for this video we're mostly
going<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.170> go<00:00:43.260> over<00:00:43.530> transforming<00:00:44.250> them<00:00:44.430> as

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
going to go over transforming them as

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.470 
going to go over transforming them as
well<00:00:44.820> as<00:00:45.059> visibility<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.219> view<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.910> from<00:00:48.360> here

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
well as visibility and view so from here

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.850 
well as visibility and view so from here
you'll<00:00:48.600> see<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> few<00:00:48.960> storyboards<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.739> can

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
you'll see a few storyboards you can

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.290 
you'll see a few storyboards you can
have<00:00:49.950> multiple<00:00:50.100> profile<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.149> add

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
have multiple profile and you can add

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.330 
have multiple profile and you can add
them<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> plus<00:00:51.840> sign<00:00:51.870> here<00:00:52.350> but<00:00:52.980> basically

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
them with a plus sign here but basically

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.189 
them with a plus sign here but basically
each<00:00:53.550> storyboard<00:00:54.090> works<00:00:54.329> by<00:00:54.629> having<00:00:55.050> a

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
each storyboard works by having a

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.529 
each storyboard works by having a
certain<00:00:55.350> point<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.739> time<00:00:55.829> where<00:00:56.760> your<00:00:57.270> model

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
certain point of time where your model

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.330 
certain point of time where your model
changes<00:00:57.870> somehow<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.469> at<00:00:58.590> any<00:00:58.739> given<00:00:58.829> point

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
changes somehow so at any given point

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.040 
changes somehow so at any given point
there's<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.640> state<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.059> model<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.930> will

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
there's a state of the model and it will

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.450 
there's a state of the model and it will
go<00:01:01.140> through<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.469> animate<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.770> for<00:01:02.129> you

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
go through to animate that for you

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.039 
go through to animate that for you
we're<00:01:02.969> at<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.090> beginning<00:01:03.449> here<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:03.809> I'm<00:01:03.899> just

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
we're at the beginning here so I'm just

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.450 
we're at the beginning here so I'm just
gonna<00:01:04.170> set<00:01:04.409> up<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.650> want<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.070> look<00:01:05.220> at<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
gonna set up I want it to look at the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.710 
gonna set up I want it to look at the
start<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.820> video<00:01:06.060> by<00:01:06.240> zooming<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.659> a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
start of the video by zooming in a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.570 
start of the video by zooming in a
little<00:01:06.750> bit<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.260> next<00:01:08.130> I'll<00:01:08.220> pick<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.430> certain

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
little bit and next I'll pick a certain

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.730 
little bit and next I'll pick a certain
point<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.000> time<00:01:09.030> let's<00:01:09.479> say<00:01:09.659> 6<00:01:10.170> seconds<00:01:10.560> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
point in time let's say 6 seconds and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.830 
point in time let's say 6 seconds and
from<00:01:11.520> there<00:01:11.729> I'll<00:01:12.000> change<00:01:12.330> where<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.630> want<00:01:12.810> it

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
from there I'll change where I want it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.690 
from there I'll change where I want it
to<00:01:12.930> be<00:01:13.049> at<00:01:13.229> 6<00:01:13.530> seconds<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.250> I'll<00:01:14.340> put<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
to be at 6 seconds so I'll put it the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.219 
to be at 6 seconds so I'll put it the
home<00:01:14.880> view<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.330> you'll<00:01:15.509> see<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.810> change<00:01:15.869> is

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
home view and you'll see that change is

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.859 
home view and you'll see that change is
shown<00:01:16.439> up<00:01:16.619> as<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.860> little<00:01:17.700> icon<00:01:18.180> there<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.600> a

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
shown up as a little icon there of a

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.810 
shown up as a little icon there of a
camera<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:19.920> they<00:01:20.040> go<00:01:20.130> through<00:01:20.310> time<00:01:20.549> it'll

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
camera and so they go through time it'll

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.700 
camera and so they go through time it'll
move<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.509> point<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.960> set<00:01:22.229> at<00:01:22.439> 6

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
move it to that point that I set at 6

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.679 
move it to that point that I set at 6
seconds<00:01:23.070> but<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.000> didn't<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.540> can

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
seconds but if I didn't like that I can

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.359 
seconds but if I didn't like that I can
always<00:01:24.869> go<00:01:25.140> through<00:01:25.320> her<00:01:25.500> find<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.950> changed<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
always go through her find and changed a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.770 
always go through her find and changed a
little<00:01:26.460> bit<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.060> change<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.479> then<00:01:27.630> gonna

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
little bit and that change is then gonna

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.410 
little bit and that change is then gonna
propagate<00:01:28.290> back<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.829> still<00:01:29.729> at<00:01:29.850> 6<00:01:30.090> seconds

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
propagate back and still at 6 seconds

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.120 
propagate back and still at 6 seconds
it's<00:01:30.600> gonna<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.960> whatever<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.320> had<00:01:31.590> most

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
it's gonna be whatever I had most

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.880 
it's gonna be whatever I had most
recently<00:01:32.340> updated<00:01:32.700> at<00:01:33.000> 6<00:01:33.270> seconds<00:01:33.829> next<00:01:34.829> I

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
recently updated at 6 seconds next I

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.050 
recently updated at 6 seconds next I
want<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.100> hide<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.460> lake<00:01:35.670> that's<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
want to hide this lake that's in the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.370 
want to hide this lake that's in the
middle<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.869> would<00:01:36.990> do<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.200> by

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
middle here and you would do this by

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.660 
middle here and you would do this by
clicking<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.979> know<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> light<00:01:38.280> bulb<00:01:38.430> say

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
clicking on you know a light bulb say

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.940 
clicking on you know a light bulb say
for<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.299> resin<00:01:39.630> component<00:01:40.140> but<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.560> want<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.860> do

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
for the resin component but I want to do

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.530 
for the resin component but I want to do
it<00:01:41.040> at<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.159> certain<00:01:41.310> point<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.729> time<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.210> 3

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
it at a certain point in time so 3

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.719 
it at a certain point in time so 3
seconds<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.140> go<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.770> hide<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.460> resin

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
seconds I can go in and hide the resin

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.639 
seconds I can go in and hide the resin
and<00:01:45.210> you'll<00:01:45.479> see<00:01:45.630> here<00:01:45.810> now<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.200> gone<00:01:46.380> off<00:01:46.500> of

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
and you'll see here now it's gone off of

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.260 
and you'll see here now it's gone off of
the<00:01:46.740> model<00:01:47.070> if<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.369> go<00:01:47.490> back<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.700> forth<00:01:47.939> you'll

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the model if I go back and forth you'll

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.850 
the model if I go back and forth you'll
see<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.689> sort<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.079> stark<00:01:49.350> change<00:01:49.680> from

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
see it have sort of a stark change from

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.850 
see it have sort of a stark change from
being<00:01:50.009> on<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.579> then<00:01:50.729> off<00:01:51.380> but<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.409> wanted<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.710> be

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
being on and then off but I wanted to be

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.170 
being on and then off but I wanted to be
a<00:01:52.890> little<00:01:53.159> bit<00:01:53.280> smoother<00:01:53.790> more<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.119> a

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
a little bit smoother more of a

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.270 
a little bit smoother more of a
transition<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.990> fading<00:01:55.380> out<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.219> I

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
transition like a fading out and so I

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.800 
transition like a fading out and so I
can<00:01:56.460> take<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:56.759> action<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.299> actually<00:01:57.450> spread

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
can take this action and actually spread

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.209 
can take this action and actually spread
it<00:01:57.990> out<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.110> certain<00:01:58.439> amount<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.680> time<00:01:58.950> let's

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
it out a certain amount of time let's

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.429 
it out a certain amount of time let's
say<00:01:59.280> from<00:01:59.520> 1<00:01:59.670> seconds<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.090> 3<00:02:00.240> seconds<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.869> now

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
say from 1 seconds to 3 seconds and now

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.899 
say from 1 seconds to 3 seconds and now
if<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.680> go<00:02:01.799> back<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:02.189> can<00:02:02.310> see<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.729> lake

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
if you go back you can see that the lake

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.550 
if you go back you can see that the lake
is<00:02:02.939> slowly<00:02:03.329> fading<00:02:03.780> away<00:02:03.869> out<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.320> model

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
is slowly fading away out of the model

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.160 
is slowly fading away out of the model
as<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:05.009> go<00:02:05.100> through<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.460> timeline<00:02:06.079> so<00:02:07.079> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
as we go through the timeline so the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.570 
as we go through the timeline so the
final<00:02:07.439> thing<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.619> want<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.829> do<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.039> explode<00:02:08.369> this

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
final thing I want to do is explode this

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.760 
final thing I want to do is explode this
model<00:02:08.879> out<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.599> can<00:02:09.750> do<00:02:09.840> an<00:02:09.929> auto<00:02:10.110> explode<00:02:10.590> but

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
model out you can do an auto explode but

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.460 
model out you can do an auto explode but
I'm<00:02:10.920> just<00:02:11.129> using

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
I'm just using

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.290 
I'm just using
transform<00:02:11.980> components'<00:02:12.490> tool<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.850> go<00:02:12.970> through

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
transform components' tool to go through

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.210 
transform components' tool to go through
and<00:02:13.510> move<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.170> tops<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.560> bottoms<00:02:14.620> up<00:02:15.070> and

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
and move the tops and bottoms up and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.710 
and move the tops and bottoms up and
down<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.640> then<00:02:15.730> move<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.090> middle<00:02:16.300> layers<00:02:16.480> up

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
down and then move the middle layers up

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.780 
down and then move the middle layers up
and<00:02:16.900> down<00:02:17.020> as<00:02:17.170> well<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:18.400> can<00:02:18.550> do<00:02:18.640> this

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
and down as well you can do this

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.040 
and down as well you can do this
different<00:02:19.060> ways<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:19.450> kind<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:19.720> feel<00:02:19.870> free<00:02:19.960> to

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
different ways so kind of feel free to

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.960 
different ways so kind of feel free to
explore<00:02:20.410> with<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.620> little<00:02:20.860> bits<00:02:21.040> this<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:21.910> a

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
explore with a little bits this is a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.730 
explore with a little bits this is a
pretty<00:02:22.120> simple<00:02:22.450> model<00:02:22.690> it's<00:02:22.780> four<00:02:22.990> pieces<00:02:23.200> and

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
pretty simple model it's four pieces and

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.110 
pretty simple model it's four pieces and
I<00:02:24.010> can<00:02:24.160> explode<00:02:24.460> them<00:02:24.640> relatively<00:02:25.000> quickly

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
I can explode them relatively quickly

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.600 
I can explode them relatively quickly
manually<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.080> I<00:02:26.620> can<00:02:27.280> have<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.430> bit<00:02:27.580> more

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
manually and I can have a bit more

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.910 
manually and I can have a bit more
control<00:02:28.180> there<00:02:28.600> as<00:02:28.720> well<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:28.930> I'm<00:02:29.680> going<00:02:29.830> to

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
control there as well so I'm going to

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.100 
control there as well so I'm going to
explode<00:02:30.160> these<00:02:30.310> outs<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.970> as<00:02:31.510> they<00:02:31.690> go<00:02:31.870> you'll

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
explode these outs and as they go you'll

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.170 
explode these outs and as they go you'll
see<00:02:32.320> in<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.530> end<00:02:32.650> we<00:02:32.920> have<00:02:33.070> sort<00:02:33.310> of<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.520> pretty

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
see in the end we have sort of a pretty

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.600 
see in the end we have sort of a pretty
good<00:02:34.360> video<00:02:34.510> shaping<00:02:35.110> up<00:02:35.230> here<00:02:35.470> we<00:02:36.250> can<00:02:36.370> start

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
good video shaping up here we can start

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.220 
good video shaping up here we can start
the<00:02:36.670> beginning<00:02:36.850> kind<00:02:37.300> of<00:02:37.360> go<00:02:37.510> through<00:02:37.540> but

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
the beginning kind of go through but

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.750 
the beginning kind of go through but
let's<00:02:38.470> say<00:02:38.680> at<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.890> end<00:02:38.980> of<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.160> day<00:02:39.340> I<00:02:39.370> want

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
let's say at the end of the day I want

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.310 
let's say at the end of the day I want
to<00:02:39.820> just<00:02:40.030> sort<00:02:40.180> of<00:02:40.300> edit<00:02:40.720> or<00:02:40.870> tweak<00:02:41.110> those

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
to just sort of edit or tweak those

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.110 
to just sort of edit or tweak those
changes<00:02:41.740> that<00:02:41.770> I<00:02:41.950> made<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.400> can<00:02:42.700> always<00:02:42.880> go

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
changes that I made I can always go

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.910 
changes that I made I can always go
through<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.360> any<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.630> these<00:02:43.720> points<00:02:44.140> move<00:02:44.740> them

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
through to any of these points move them

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.290 
through to any of these points move them
in<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.160> out<00:02:45.220> change<00:02:45.610> them<00:02:45.790> in<00:02:45.910> relation<00:02:46.270> to

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
in and out change them in relation to

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.610 
in and out change them in relation to
you<00:02:46.630> know<00:02:46.750> where<00:02:46.959> things<00:02:47.140> are<00:02:47.320> showing

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
you know where things are showing

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.170 
you know where things are showing
whether<00:02:47.800> or<00:02:47.920> not<00:02:48.010> how<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.340> view<00:02:48.610> is<00:02:48.700> changing

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
whether or not how the view is changing

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.790 
whether or not how the view is changing
maybe<00:02:49.570> add<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:49.870> little<00:02:49.959> bit<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.350> second<00:02:50.709> on

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
maybe add a little bit of a second on

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.260 
maybe add a little bit of a second on
the<00:02:50.890> end<00:02:51.070> here<00:02:51.250> where<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.700> view<00:02:51.910> stops

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
the end here where the view stops

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.910 
the end here where the view stops
changing<00:02:52.600> so<00:02:52.900> we<00:02:52.930> can<00:02:53.110> see<00:02:53.230> them<00:02:53.320> explode<00:02:53.680> more

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
changing so we can see them explode more

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.740 
changing so we can see them explode more
and<00:02:54.190> then<00:02:54.760> we<00:02:54.880> end<00:02:55.000> up<00:02:55.060> with<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.209> final<00:02:55.480> video

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
and then we end up with a final video

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.980 
and then we end up with a final video
that<00:02:56.110> we<00:02:56.200> like<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:56.620> that's<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.630> so<00:02:58.630> once<00:02:58.810> it's

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
that we like and that's it so once it's

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.660 
that we like and that's it so once it's
at<00:02:59.080> this<00:02:59.170> point<00:02:59.230> we<00:02:59.590> can<00:02:59.740> export<00:03:00.100> it<00:03:00.250> out<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:00.580> I

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
at this point we can export it out so I

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.880 
at this point we can export it out so I
can<00:03:00.910> save<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:01.150> as<00:03:01.420> an<00:03:01.510> mp4<00:03:01.870> video<00:03:02.380> using<00:03:02.800> the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
can save it as an mp4 video using the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.710 
can save it as an mp4 video using the
