00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.080
 it was very good I am Tuesday and in this 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.479
 tutorials I have brought the masters 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.400
 and the garen moons is a character that 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.380
 it has caught my attention and I 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.470
 I'm going to show you a little about the way 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.270
 masters 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:23.360
 to be fine they should be like this 14 4 1 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:26.570
 3 1 1 1 4 3 1 1 1 the finished ones 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.779
 because I'm not 30 to 1 but more or less and 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.260
 raising some damage to the defense 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:35.329
 more or less here in the same I got him 5 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.370
 points in attack but good that more or 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.880
 less has to be like this let's see 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.750
 now you ruminate 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.750
 what has to be 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.420
 in buy brand 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.550
 here not moment 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:05.850
 attack damage to buy you are nine 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:10.290
 after going seriously in defense and 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:13.100
 buy 141 of armor you're here then 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.100
 go in glyph 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.450
 attack and buy attack speed or 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.680
 critical impact that this will go very 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:31.560
 well and then in quintessence 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.210
 in life buy these 26 life 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.399
 and then let's see a bit how it is 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.640
 the champion only his skills and everything 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.640
 that 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.020
 they have a lot of attack power but it's a 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.020
 booth 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.650
 you at speed also makes a vote 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.650
 pretty strong 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:09.710
 this gives you an armor gives the mind 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:12.560
 the maker of the magic resistance 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.790
 it starts to spin that to kill me 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.400
 we are doing very well and to kill too 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.640
 characters 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.909
 and then your last one and it takes away a lot 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.909
 Of damage 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.190
