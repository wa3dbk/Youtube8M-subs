a little bit more done to them now so
you<00:00:14.190> can<00:00:14.280> see<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.490> put<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.849> headbands<00:00:15.389> I'm

you can see I put in the headbands I'm

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.689 
you can see I put in the headbands I'm
actually<00:00:15.660> coloring<00:00:16.199> each<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.560> them<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:17.609> know

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
actually coloring each of them you know

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.929 
actually coloring each of them you know
same<00:00:18.600> code<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.199> gives<00:00:20.160> fans<00:00:20.490> pants<00:00:20.760> man

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
same code that gives fans pants man

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.120 
same code that gives fans pants man
different<00:00:21.119> colored<00:00:21.449> pants<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.890> looks<00:00:23.039> like

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
different colored pants so it looks like

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.800 
different colored pants so it looks like
they<00:00:23.430> raided<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.880> kitchen<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.449> stole<00:00:24.779> a

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
they raided the kitchen and stole a

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.660 
they raided the kitchen and stole a
bunch<00:00:25.080> toothpicks<00:00:25.650> from<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.010> colored

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
bunch toothpicks from the colored

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.099 
bunch toothpicks from the colored
toothpick<00:00:27.119> box<00:00:29.119> but<00:00:30.119> I'm<00:00:30.269> definitely<00:00:30.720> like

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
toothpick box but I'm definitely like

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.030 
toothpick box but I'm definitely like
how<00:00:31.320> their<00:00:32.360> other<00:00:33.360> bandanas<00:00:33.960> look<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.410> might

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
how their other bandanas look I might

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.370 
how their other bandanas look I might
give<00:00:35.190> them<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.370> different<00:00:35.540> flyaway<00:00:36.540> clip<00:00:37.110> but

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
give them a different flyaway clip but

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.580 
give them a different flyaway clip but
we'll<00:00:37.500> say<00:00:38.270> for<00:00:39.270> now<00:00:39.300> let's<00:00:39.750> see<00:00:39.989> how<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> bunch

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
we'll say for now let's see how a bunch

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.389 
we'll say for now let's see how a bunch
of<00:00:40.680> them<00:00:40.800> look<00:00:41.010> oh<00:00:41.840> god<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:45.829> nice<00:00:46.829> handful<00:00:47.340> of

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
of them look oh god a nice handful of

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.570 
of them look oh god a nice handful of
ninja

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.240 

so<00:00:55.580> um<00:00:55.820> a<00:00:56.390> few<00:00:57.170> people<00:00:57.440> are<00:00:57.560> saying<00:00:57.830> whether

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
so um a few people are saying whether

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.320 
so um a few people are saying whether
the<00:00:58.490> aerial<00:00:59.450> that<00:01:00.230> attack<00:01:00.560> right<00:01:00.770> there<00:01:01.330> would

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
the aerial that attack right there would

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.240 
the aerial that attack right there would
be<00:01:02.360> a<00:01:02.480> bit<00:01:02.660> too<00:01:02.810> powerful<00:01:03.290> for<00:01:03.320> these<00:01:03.620> guys<00:01:03.830> and

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
be a bit too powerful for these guys and

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
be a bit too powerful for these guys and
it<00:01:04.640> actually<00:01:04.790> starts<00:01:05.300> to<00:01:05.920> lower<00:01:06.920> faster<00:01:07.700> the

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
it actually starts to lower faster the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.930 
it actually starts to lower faster the
more<00:01:08.300> you<00:01:08.600> hit<00:01:08.800> so<00:01:09.800> it<00:01:10.130> starts<00:01:10.280> to<00:01:10.490> get<00:01:10.580> harder

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
more you hit so it starts to get harder

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.510 
more you hit so it starts to get harder
to<00:01:11.060> keep<00:01:11.210> up<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:11.720> I'll<00:01:11.870> probably<00:01:12.460> make<00:01:13.460> it

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
to keep up and I'll probably make it

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.630 
to keep up and I'll probably make it
start<00:01:14.000> so<00:01:14.600> that<00:01:14.810> you<00:01:15.020> fly<00:01:15.530> sideways<00:01:15.860> more<00:01:16.400> if

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
start so that you fly sideways more if

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.800 
start so that you fly sideways more if
you<00:01:16.850> use<00:01:17.060> it<00:01:17.240> too<00:01:17.360> much<00:01:17.590> but<00:01:18.590> that'll<00:01:19.040> be

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
you use it too much but that'll be

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.060 
you use it too much but that'll be
mostly<00:01:20.810> I'll<00:01:20.990> add<00:01:21.140> that<00:01:21.170> bit<00:01:21.410> of<00:01:21.470> polish<00:01:21.830> later

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
mostly I'll add that bit of polish later

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.570 
mostly I'll add that bit of polish later
and<00:01:22.250> see<00:01:22.340> how<00:01:22.430> it<00:01:22.520> feels<00:01:22.760> but<00:01:23.060> um<00:01:24.400> what<00:01:25.400> do<00:01:25.490> you

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
and see how it feels but um what do you

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.499 
and see how it feels but um what do you
think<00:01:25.790> of<00:01:25.910> a<00:01:26.119> little<00:01:26.960> rainbow<00:01:27.200> of<00:01:27.380> ninjas<00:01:27.860> here

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
think of a little rainbow of ninjas here

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.910 
think of a little rainbow of ninjas here
still<00:01:29.509> like<00:01:29.690> when<00:01:30.110> there's<00:01:30.259> a<00:01:30.320> bunch<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:30.649> mole

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
still like when there's a bunch of mole

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.080 
still like when there's a bunch of mole
moving<00:01:31.280> at<00:01:31.340> once<00:01:31.520> think<00:01:31.790> it<00:01:31.880> looks<00:01:32.030> pretty

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
moving at once think it looks pretty

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.389 
moving at once think it looks pretty
cool<00:01:32.450> I<00:01:32.690> feel<00:01:33.410> like<00:01:33.470> other<00:01:33.680> bandanas<00:01:34.190> turned

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
cool I feel like other bandanas turned

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.240 
cool I feel like other bandanas turned
out<00:01:34.580> so<00:01:34.820> that<00:01:34.970> was<00:01:35.090> quite<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:35.750> bit<00:01:36.080> a<00:01:36.350> good<00:01:37.040> bit

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
out so that was quite a bit a good bit

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.040 
out so that was quite a bit a good bit
of<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.490> animating<00:01:38.180> there<00:01:39.460> and<00:01:40.810> these<00:01:41.810> guys

really<00:02:42.739> satisfying<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.459> hit<00:02:43.640> compared<00:02:44.570> to<00:02:44.660> the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
really satisfying to hit compared to the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.509 
really satisfying to hit compared to the
spiders<00:02:45.170> I<00:02:45.350> guess<00:02:45.500> they<00:02:45.709> uh<00:02:45.739> you<00:02:46.280> know<00:02:46.340> there's

spiders I guess they uh you know there's
just<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.670> lot<00:02:46.790> more<00:02:46.970> feedback<00:02:47.299> they<00:02:47.840> kind<00:02:48.049> of

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
just a lot more feedback they kind of

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.319 
just a lot more feedback they kind of
flow<00:02:48.530> backwards<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.370> they're<00:02:49.459> big<00:02:50.120> long

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
flow backwards and they're big long

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.270 
flow backwards and they're big long
goofy<00:02:50.750> legs<00:02:50.959> are<00:02:51.200> flying<00:02:51.500> everywhere<00:02:51.709> and

goofy legs are flying everywhere and

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.520 
goofy legs are flying everywhere and

gooey<00:03:00.680> in<00:03:00.890> real<00:03:01.070> life<00:03:01.280> since<00:03:02.150> do<00:03:02.299> they<00:03:02.419> land

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
gooey in real life since do they land

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.330 
gooey in real life since do they land
and<00:03:03.079> then

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
and then

going to be yeah say they so that you
can<00:03:43.890> actually<00:03:44.010> kill<00:03:44.340> them<00:03:44.519> with<00:03:45.019> one<00:03:46.019> light

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
can actually kill them with one light

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.199 
can actually kill them with one light
stomp<00:03:46.890> too<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:48.060> these<00:03:48.480> guys<00:03:50.030> get<00:03:51.030> all<00:03:51.180> over

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
stomp too and these guys get all over

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.839 
stomp too and these guys get all over
here<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:52.170> if<00:03:52.260> i<00:03:52.319> do<00:03:52.380> heavy<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:53.280> can't<00:03:53.670> do<00:03:53.730> heavy

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
here so if i do heavy I can't do heavy

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.240 
here so if i do heavy I can't do heavy
stop<00:03:54.090> this<00:03:54.269> in<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.420> air<00:03:54.769> get<00:03:55.769> out<00:03:55.860> of<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:55.980> way

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.860 

so<00:03:59.250> do<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.400> heavy<00:03:59.549> stomp<00:03:59.880> on<00:04:00.120> them<00:04:00.239> doesn't<00:04:00.780> die

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
so do a heavy stomp on them doesn't die

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.690 
so do a heavy stomp on them doesn't die
right<00:04:01.110> away<00:04:01.230> which<00:04:01.739> you<00:04:01.950> know<00:04:02.069> before<00:04:02.489> was<00:04:02.670> a

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
right away which you know before was a

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.970 
right away which you know before was a
bit<00:04:02.910> easier<00:04:03.319> so<00:04:04.319> you<00:04:04.410> could<00:04:04.530> actually<00:04:04.650> poke

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
bit easier so you could actually poke

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.080 
bit easier so you could actually poke
them<00:04:05.160> kick<00:04:05.370> him<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.579> they'd<00:04:05.640> be<00:04:05.700> dead<00:04:06.000> but<00:04:06.569> now

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
them kick him and they'd be dead but now

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.789 
them kick him and they'd be dead but now
if<00:04:09.090> i<00:04:09.239> do<00:04:09.299> that<00:04:09.389> to<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.780> frog<00:04:10.139> with<00:04:10.350> full<00:04:10.590> health

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
if i do that to a frog with full health

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.819 
if i do that to a frog with full health
he<00:04:11.430> just<00:04:11.850> gets<00:04:12.180> right<00:04:12.329> back<00:04:12.450> up<00:04:12.680> so<00:04:13.680> that

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
he just gets right back up so that

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.530 
he just gets right back up so that
should<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:14.280> know<00:04:14.400> change<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:14.910> game<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.090> bit<00:04:15.329> um

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
should you know change the game a bit um

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.259 
should you know change the game a bit um
i<00:04:16.079> think<00:04:16.889> before<00:04:17.459> it<00:04:17.519> was<00:04:17.609> really<00:04:17.910> just<00:04:17.940> too

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
i think before it was really just too

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.550 
i think before it was really just too
easy<00:04:18.450> so<00:04:18.630> i<00:04:18.780> don't<00:04:18.959> want<00:04:19.079> to<00:04:19.139> say<00:04:19.260> it's<00:04:19.380> really

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
easy so i don't want to say it's really

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.460 
easy so i don't want to say it's really
going<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:19.769> make<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.010> game<00:04:20.190> harder<00:04:21.260> but<00:04:22.260> it<00:04:22.380> is

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.980 
going to make the game harder but it is
