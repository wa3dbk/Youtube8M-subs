PlayStation<00:00:29.730> 3<00:00:32.390> I'm<00:00:33.390> running<00:00:33.750> 64-bit<00:00:34.200> windows

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
PlayStation 3 I'm running 64-bit windows

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.729 
PlayStation 3 I'm running 64-bit windows
so<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:36.300> patching<00:00:36.750> I'll<00:00:36.870> do<00:00:37.110> will<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.410> enough

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
so the patching I'll do will be enough

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.970 
so the patching I'll do will be enough
for<00:00:38.360> the<00:00:39.360> different<00:00:39.870> directors<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.469> 32-bit

finish there now I made a batch file

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.810 
finish there now I made a batch file
because<00:01:54.400> I'm<00:01:54.550> lazy<00:01:59.370> got<00:02:00.370> a<00:02:00.400> little<00:02:00.610> closer

they're going to be okay now I
understand<00:03:47.580> thin

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:00.570 

to<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.620> GRP<00:03:53.980> mapping<00:03:54.850> dll<00:03:57.120> stereo<00:03:58.680> stereo<00:03:59.680> now

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
to the GRP mapping dll stereo stereo now

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.310 
to the GRP mapping dll stereo stereo now
I<00:04:00.880> could<00:04:01.120> do<00:04:01.240> that<00:04:01.390> we<00:04:01.690> can<00:04:01.870> paste<00:04:02.140> those<00:04:02.500> files

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
I could do that we can paste those files

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:19.410 
I could do that we can paste those files
overwrite<00:04:05.320> them<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:12.900> there<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:14.020> is

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.270 

so<00:04:22.240> okay<00:04:23.240> I<00:04:23.270> think<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:24.230> problem<00:04:24.710> is<00:04:24.890> you<00:04:25.130> get
