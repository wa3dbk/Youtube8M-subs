00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
sweaty but um yeah considering i got

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.080 
sweaty but um yeah considering i got
this<00:03:31.810> early<00:03:32.230> I've<00:03:32.829> been<00:03:32.950> doing<00:03:33.220> okay<00:03:33.790> i<00:03:33.819> think

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
this early I've been doing okay i think

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.150 
this early I've been doing okay i think
my<00:03:34.299> katie<00:03:34.510> is<00:03:34.660> about<00:03:34.840> 1.5<00:03:35.560> at<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.799> moment

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
my katie is about 1.5 at the moment

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.800 
my katie is about 1.5 at the moment
which<00:03:36.250> isn't<00:03:36.579> great<00:03:36.700> consuming<00:03:37.480> my<00:03:37.569> black<00:03:37.780> ops

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
which isn't great consuming my black ops

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.370 
which isn't great consuming my black ops
one<00:03:38.109> was<00:03:38.230> about<00:03:38.579> 2.5<00:03:39.579> or<00:03:39.609> something<00:03:40.260> when<00:03:41.260> it

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
one was about 2.5 or something when it

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.410 
one was about 2.5 or something when it
first<00:03:41.530> came<00:03:41.709> out<00:03:41.889> but<00:03:42.160> i'm<00:03:42.850> guessing<00:03:43.060> that's

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
first came out but i'm guessing that's

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.449 
first came out but i'm guessing that's
because<00:03:43.590> all<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.709> other<00:03:44.829> people<00:03:45.130> that<00:03:45.160> got<00:03:45.370> an

because all the other people that got an

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.569 
because all the other people that got an
early<00:03:45.760> run<00:03:46.269> we're<00:03:46.600> pretty<00:03:46.750> good<00:03:46.840> at<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.579> going

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
early run we're pretty good at it going

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.539 
early run we're pretty good at it going
back<00:03:48.730> onto<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:49.000> gameplay<00:03:50.250> we<00:03:51.250> did<00:03:51.430> actually

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
to like power prestige even though you

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.830 
to like power prestige even though you
know<00:04:56.680> you<00:04:56.740> is<00:04:57.130> boring<00:04:57.610> you<00:04:58.330> see<00:04:58.509> it<00:04:58.599> in<00:04:58.660> black

ops<00:04:59.020> one<00:04:59.229> before<00:04:59.590> but<00:05:00.400> still<00:05:00.550> I<00:05:00.940> mean<00:05:01.150> it's

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
ops one before but still I mean it's

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.510 
ops one before but still I mean it's
like<00:05:02.080> five<00:05:02.349> minutes<00:05:02.560> a<00:05:02.740> game<00:05:02.919> and<00:05:03.250> you<00:05:03.310> can

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
like five minutes a game and you can

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.339 
like five minutes a game and you can
just<00:05:03.669> pump<00:05:03.909> out<00:05:04.090> kills<00:05:04.389> entire<00:05:04.900> time<00:05:05.110> I<00:05:05.139> think

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
just pump out kills entire time I think

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.500 
just pump out kills entire time I think
I've<00:05:05.560> got<00:05:05.590> about<00:05:05.970> 6,000<00:05:06.970> points<00:05:07.090> on<00:05:07.330> kill

minutes<00:05:10.389> which<00:05:10.630> is<00:05:10.659> ridiculous<00:05:10.900> anyway<00:05:11.530> you

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
minutes which is ridiculous anyway you

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.210 
minutes which is ridiculous anyway you
can<00:05:11.949> rack<00:05:12.159> up<00:05:12.190> so<00:05:12.550> quickly<00:05:13.860> so<00:05:14.860> those<00:05:15.039> are<00:05:15.159> my

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
can rack up so quickly so those are my

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
game if you disagree that I guess you

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:22.560

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.980 
guess nothing I wasn't saying gold camo
is<00:05:30.430> really<00:05:30.880> hard<00:05:31.060> to<00:05:31.120> get<00:05:31.360> in<00:05:31.690> one<00:05:31.960> more

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
is really hard to get in one more

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.430 
is really hard to get in one more
country<00:05:32.500> you<00:05:32.740> could<00:05:32.889> just<00:05:33.039> learn<00:05:33.280> you<00:05:34.030> just

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
country you could just learn you just

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.770 
country you could just learn you just
get<00:05:35.440> to<00:05:35.560> the<00:05:35.650> highest<00:05:35.860> level<00:05:36.280> on<00:05:36.520> the<00:05:36.699> gun<00:05:36.909> but

get to the highest level on the gun but
for<00:05:38.050> this<00:05:38.169> you<00:05:38.229> have<00:05:38.470> to<00:05:38.560> get<00:05:38.680> hundred<00:05:39.099> head

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
for this you have to get hundred head

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.830 
for this you have to get hundred head
shots<00:05:39.520> and<00:05:39.789> then<00:05:39.909> you<00:05:40.030> have<00:05:40.120> to<00:05:40.180> be<00:05:40.270> like<00:05:40.479> five

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840

shots and then you have to be like five
different<00:05:41.080> challenges<00:05:41.740> with<00:05:41.919> the<00:05:41.949> gun<00:05:42.190> so

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
it's pretty hard for the overall

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.879 
it's pretty hard for the overall

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
say in the hit detection it's quite a

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.499 
say in the hit detection it's quite a
bit<00:05:50.080> better<00:05:50.229> actually<00:05:50.500> and<00:05:51.270> there's<00:05:52.270> less

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:52.509 
bit better actually and there's less

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:53.770 
bit better actually and there's less
