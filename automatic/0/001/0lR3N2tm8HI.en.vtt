little to the level six to nine all
right<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.329> there's<00:00:42.899> no<00:00:43.050> really<00:00:43.500> like<00:00:43.649> any

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
right on so there's no really like any

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.290 
right on so there's no really like any
um<00:00:45.260> countdown<00:00:46.260> thing<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.920> screen<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.460> would

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
um countdown thing on the screen I would

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.750 
um countdown thing on the screen I would
think<00:00:48.329> it'd<00:00:48.539> be<00:00:48.570> like<00:00:48.809> 10<00:00:49.140> minutes<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.760> going

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
think it'd be like 10 minutes and going

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.900 
think it'd be like 10 minutes and going
down<00:00:50.940> or<00:00:50.969> whatever<00:00:52.160> but<00:00:53.160> let's<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.579> these<00:00:53.760> you

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
down or whatever but let's all these you

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:05.070 
down or whatever but let's all these you
love<00:00:56.719> pink<00:00:58.640> well<00:01:00.559> don't<00:01:01.559> drive<00:01:01.859> them<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.390> nah

so<00:01:05.710> these<00:01:06.430> prices<00:01:06.730> are<00:01:06.940> probably<00:01:07.390> dropping

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
so these prices are probably dropping

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.310 
so these prices are probably dropping
