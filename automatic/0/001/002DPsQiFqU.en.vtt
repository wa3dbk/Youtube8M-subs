have<00:02:00.439> been<00:02:00.560> some<00:02:00.709> improvements<00:02:01.189> to<00:02:01.249> the<00:02:01.310> video

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
have been some improvements to the video

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.029 
have been some improvements to the video
capabilities<00:02:02.179> as<00:02:02.329> well<00:02:02.359> yes<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.560> camera

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
capabilities as well yes the camera

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.830 
capabilities as well yes the camera
shoots<00:02:04.669> in<00:02:04.939> Full<00:02:05.209> HD<00:02:05.239> at<00:02:05.919> 30<00:02:06.919> frames<00:02:07.189> 25<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:08.390> 24

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
shoots in Full HD at 30 frames 25 and 24

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.690 
shoots in Full HD at 30 frames 25 and 24
frames<00:02:09.200> have<00:02:09.440> also<00:02:09.709> changed<00:02:09.920> made<00:02:10.520> some

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
frames have also changed made some

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.600 
frames have also changed made some
changes<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.680> formats<00:02:12.680> available<00:02:13.010> first

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
changes to the formats available first

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.760 
changes to the formats available first
those<00:02:13.819> that<00:02:14.060> shooting<00:02:14.390> video<00:02:14.630> so<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.560> first

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
those that shooting video so the first

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.160 
those that shooting video so the first
one<00:02:15.950> is<00:02:16.010> you've<00:02:16.250> got<00:02:16.460> the<00:02:16.610> FX<00:02:17.060> for<00:02:17.360> format<00:02:17.840> you

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
one is you've got the FX for format you

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.309 
one is you've got the FX for format you
then<00:02:18.320> have<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.530> DX<00:02:18.950> which<00:02:19.280> is<00:02:19.490> a<00:02:19.520> 1.5

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
then have a DX which is a 1.5

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.800 
then have a DX which is a 1.5
magnification<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:22.280> now<00:02:22.849> we<00:02:22.909> also<00:02:23.269> have<00:02:23.540> now<00:02:23.780> a

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
magnification and now we also have now a

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.059 
magnification and now we also have now a
pixel<00:02:24.379> matched<00:02:24.620> 1080<00:02:25.400> x<00:02:25.879> 1920<00:02:26.680> aspect<00:02:27.680> ratio

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
pixel matched 1080 x 1920 aspect ratio

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.869 
pixel matched 1080 x 1920 aspect ratio
and<00:02:28.340> that's<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.909> 2.7<00:02:29.719> magnification<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:31.340> you

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
and that's a 2.7 magnification so you

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.360 
and that's a 2.7 magnification so you
have<00:02:32.329> in<00:02:32.450> one<00:02:32.659> body<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.170> benefits<00:02:33.650> of<00:02:33.859> a<00:02:34.010> small

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
have in one body the benefits of a small

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.369 
have in one body the benefits of a small
image<00:02:34.819> sensor<00:02:35.269> should<00:02:35.540> you<00:02:35.689> choose<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:35.989> and

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
image sensor should you choose to and

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.500 
image sensor should you choose to and
the<00:02:36.829> benefits<00:02:37.249> of<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:37.519> large<00:02:37.670> image<00:02:37.969> sensor<00:02:38.329> and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
the benefits of a large image sensor and

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.030 
the benefits of a large image sensor and
you<00:02:38.689> have<00:02:38.810> an<00:02:38.900> option<00:02:39.019> in<00:02:39.260> between<00:02:39.560> so<00:02:39.920> this

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
you have an option in between so this

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.440 
you have an option in between so this
means<00:02:40.250> that<00:02:40.400> if<00:02:40.579> you<00:02:40.819> want<00:02:40.969> a<00:02:41.030> really<00:02:41.150> shallow

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
means that if you want a really shallow

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.410 
means that if you want a really shallow
depth<00:02:41.780> of<00:02:41.870> field<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:42.590> can<00:02:42.799> shoot<00:02:42.920> an<00:02:43.040> fx<00:02:43.430> or<00:02:43.700> if

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
depth of field you can shoot an fx or if

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.330 
depth of field you can shoot an fx or if
you're<00:02:44.719> moving<00:02:45.349> quite<00:02:45.530> quickly<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.189> need

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
you're moving quite quickly and you need

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.039 
you're moving quite quickly and you need
a<00:02:46.370> much<00:02:46.639> bigger<00:02:46.670> depth<00:02:47.209> of<00:02:47.359> field<00:02:47.629> then<00:02:48.019> you

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
a much bigger depth of field then you

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.869 
a much bigger depth of field then you
would<00:02:48.230> normally<00:02:48.379> use<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:49.040> go<00:02:49.370> down<00:02:49.549> to<00:02:49.579> the

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
would normally use you go down to the

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.399 
would normally use you go down to the
the<00:02:50.590> 1920<00:02:51.590> x<00:02:52.249> 1080<00:02:52.459> crop<00:02:52.969> mode<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.480> then<00:02:54.049> use<00:02:54.379> a

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 
the 1920 x 1080 crop mode and then use a

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.199 
the 1920 x 1080 crop mode and then use a
wide<00:02:54.680> angle<00:02:54.829> lens<00:02:55.189> to<00:02:55.400> get<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:55.579> same<00:02:55.730> angle<00:02:56.120> of

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
wide angle lens to get the same angle of

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.209 
wide angle lens to get the same angle of
view<00:02:56.419> but<00:02:56.719> you<00:02:56.930> get<00:02:57.049> a<00:02:57.079> much<00:02:57.500> bigger<00:02:57.799> depth<00:02:58.069> of

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:58.219 
view but you get a much bigger depth of

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.610 
view but you get a much bigger depth of
field<00:02:58.459> and<00:02:59.060> you're<00:02:59.629> not<00:02:59.750> having<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.049> increase

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
field and you're not having to increase

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.159 
field and you're not having to increase
your<00:03:00.889> aperture<00:03:01.549> value<00:03:02.389> and<00:03:02.629> you're<00:03:02.989> not

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:03.169 
your aperture value and you're not

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:04.809 
your aperture value and you're not
having<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.530> increase<00:03:03.919> your<00:03:03.949> eyesight<00:03:04.400> we've

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
having to increase your eyesight we've

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.309 
having to increase your eyesight we've
also<00:03:05.030> made<00:03:05.239> some<00:03:05.449> changes<00:03:05.629> to<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.989> camera

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
also made some changes to the camera

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.640 
also made some changes to the camera
