 6 days to enduro 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:18.620
 This 3 people from Junichiyama 10 days 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.920
 Because I am a member of three members 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:27.010
 Not a club team 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:28.789
 Is not the side I But six all such should be competing in the Trophy team as a team Japan 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.420
 By say that 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.870
 Three people 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.230
 Non-members 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:42.370
 It was at the end of last year, and the results we discussed 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.370
 And we have decided is that trying to compete towards the Italian club team 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.920
 I 'm preparing now, it is a king card 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.600
 There is a building 2 and is unveilable this year 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.170
 rent t 250 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:05.230
 This id will be adjusted without by 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:08.640
 It was the second time, but last time it was a Latin American festival in Mexico 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:12.810
 Though I thought that Izu 22 wanted to go from old days, 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.469
 Depending on the European tournament of that and if g this bar 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:21.490
 This time not leaving the company to the tournament of Pound 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:24.130
 Both are 100 events of isd 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:30.100
 Follow 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:36.020
 It says that the tournament which is held once a year is 100 times more than 100 years in general 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.070
 It's not such a big milestone , or maybe it's Mayno Hino 3 I want to go out to the tournament that day 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.479
 I wanted to 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.140
 It did not compete in the trophy e team because I want to be what round 3 this year 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.550
 But 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.850
 In club team 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:52.159
 I decided to go with something somehow 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.680
 It's a single board This year is the fifth time that ist has participated 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.030
 After all 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.909
 It is Okasan to Issho 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.799
 This say Zeropa run Dotte is 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.799

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.270
 Until it now 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.170
 Morning silver medal 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.390
 There is also the fact that you can not take anything, so rooting every time 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.540
 gold 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.330
 But to door

 If you have an Oze machine, you can use a mountain skin bradion 100 jf 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.000
 Currently I'm adjusting a little 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.690
 I say tentatively in dahlia 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.860

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.020

 From 4 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.870
 I think I will probably send it but I got used to it 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.220
 And that it is 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.170

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.470
 After all it is hard to prepare but many 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.560
 Another Concern 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.750

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:23.359
 That year is the same as two people 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.640
 The fact that I want to feel in the Well skin the flame dragon road of that home by say put Europe round 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.440
 so 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:33.400
 a upper decision 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:36.140
 Toka's Well that Marsha here. Well work because it is the same society with everyone's two people that was 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.510

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:58.270
 It's a feeling that I got in touch with the last one's back and push two people's back 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:04:02.280
 It became the decisive factor that made it the final decision again that it was received
