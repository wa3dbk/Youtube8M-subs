00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
zooming across the screen it goes too

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.149 
zooming across the screen it goes too
fast<00:01:39.050> for<00:01:39.380> me<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.400> what<00:01:40.550> I<00:01:40.580> want<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:40.940> do<00:01:41.210> is

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
fast for me so what I want to do is

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.440 
fast for me so what I want to do is
slow<00:01:44.159> down<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.490> acceleration<00:01:45.060> put<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.330> down

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
slow down the acceleration put it down

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.359 
slow down the acceleration put it down
to<00:01:45.479> here<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.170> I'm<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.920> make<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.190> a<00:01:47.250> bit

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
to here and I'm going to make it a bit

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.250 
to here and I'm going to make it a bit
slower<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.880> i<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.180> use<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.570> mouse<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
slower so i can use this mouse on the

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.560 
slower so i can use this mouse on the

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
picture of Max but I guess you probably

didn't come here to see that did you so
let's<00:04:36.280> test<00:04:36.639> these<00:04:36.910> things<00:04:37.210> out<00:04:37.449> know<00:04:37.690> what<00:04:37.840> I

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
let's test these things out know what I

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.390 
let's test these things out know what I
say<00:04:38.199> the<00:04:38.380> bottom<00:04:38.710> button<00:04:38.979> was<00:04:39.070> going<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:39.310> be

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
say the bottom button was going to be

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.250 
say the bottom button was going to be
the<00:04:39.490> space<00:04:39.760> key<00:04:40.030> right<00:04:40.389> and<00:04:40.630> it<00:04:40.780> is<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:41.050> space

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
the space key right and it is the space

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.900 
the space key right and it is the space
key<00:04:41.500> well<00:04:41.800> I<00:04:41.830> suppose<00:04:42.100> I<00:04:42.220> should<00:04:42.370> assume<00:04:42.610> a<00:04:42.729> bit

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
key well I suppose I should assume a bit

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.360 
key well I suppose I should assume a bit
in<00:04:43.000> on<00:04:43.120> Max<00:04:43.419> and<00:04:43.630> make<00:04:44.620> sure<00:04:44.650> that<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:45.130> space

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
in on Max and make sure that the space

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.680 
in on Max and make sure that the space
key<00:04:45.610> actually<00:04:45.970> does<00:04:46.120> what<00:04:46.240> it's<00:04:46.389> supposed<00:04:46.419> to

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
key actually does what it's supposed to

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.810
