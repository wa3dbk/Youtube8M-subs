00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.580
 he yonder with the move felt differently 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.199
 than 5 part 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.390
 landing on a planet you immediately 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.529
 meet hostile aliens 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.079
 Of course in the fifth parts were barbarians but 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.730
 here everything is perceived differently we 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.349
 big fans like science like 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.090
 science fiction so we like 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.800
 make sure the game starts in 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.540
 true place like that and then it will start 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.640
 in small steps 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.000
 fiction for this we expanded our 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.110
 sight 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.450
 especially with the help of scientific 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.100
 we have no fantastic literature 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:49.130
 lack of material from which you can 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:51.020
 scoop and day one of the things that us 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.770
 really enjoyed doing the selection 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.380
 actors for the characters bet while going to 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.210
 this way they took the current 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.620
 geopolitical situation on earth and 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.430
 added to this what we call 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.170
 great mistake result of this error 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.090
 began mixing and mass migration 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:14.179
 people so nation rethought themselves and 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.429
 got out of the dark ages at that moment 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:18.499
 when they were on their feet again 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:21.429
 the space ship game begins and 

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:21.429
 went to the new worlds 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.220
 leaders personify what happened 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.780
 mixing cultures 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.940
 so many of them speak 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.930
 combination of languages ​​eg corporations 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.930
 American progress 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.890
 their leader suzanne fielding speak on 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.370
 mixed Spanish and English 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.080
 moving from one to another is almost the same 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.180
 how everyone swears on the chinese series 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.310
 Glowworm 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:56.720
 it says a lot without further ado all 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.330
 technology is probably the most 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.450
 fundamental change in the game 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.180
 technology 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.400
 it is the driving force of civilization and in 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.770
 historical games of their development series what 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.660
 known by all means but in this part we 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.570
 moving into an unknown future in which 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.440
 invented technologies are waiting for us 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.970
 so we wanted to create a structure 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.500
 which would allow the player 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.510
 feel like an explorer 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.060
 learning what technology could be 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.310
 useful necessary or just interesting 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.010
 for them all the technology is so great 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.960
 that you will not discover everything in one game this 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.360
 another difference from historical parts 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.430
 but you can start over and finish 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.930
 completely different way it makes the game 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.870
 more open to research and 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.700
 passing the orbital level this 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.800
 exciting innovation in the earth series 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.510
 always orbital tack 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.750
 level is designed to support the situation 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.370
 happening down below by landing on 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.110
 the planet almost immediately you can 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.940
 return to orbit and place there 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.070
 tactical economic or 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.220
 research satellites that will 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.630
 influence the situation on the surface 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.519
 defend your lands rejection or 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.450
 make cities economic centers 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.800
 or spy on neighbors and rob and 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.580
 these are just a few new approaches 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.580
 passing game 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.390
 and after the announcement of the game it was very exciting 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.599
 sit in a room with seven hundred of ours 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.430
 loyal fans on pax east 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.890
 was especially nice as we ourselves 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.750
 fans of the series we grew up on these games we 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.519
 love them and not inspired by 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.170
 creating a new part is ours 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.150
 thanks to the fans for a long time 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:38.060
 asking the scheme to make such a game we and 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:39.920
 they themselves have long wanted to make it a video 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.049
 translated and voiced by the Russian language 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.049
