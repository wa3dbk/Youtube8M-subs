00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
hey youtube this is a new puzzle I made

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.010 
hey youtube this is a new puzzle I made
out<00:00:03.540> of<00:00:04.370> three<00:00:05.370> Rubik's<00:00:05.879> three<00:00:06.299> by<00:00:06.450> threes<00:00:06.779> I

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
out of three Rubik's three by threes I

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.860 
out of three Rubik's three by threes I
guess<00:00:07.770> it's<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.910> think<00:00:09.240> I<00:00:09.300> designed<00:00:09.690> it

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
guess it's a I I think I designed it

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.610 
guess it's a I I think I designed it
it's<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.410> QV<00:00:11.099> chaos<00:00:12.290> basically<00:00:13.290> what<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.500> is

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
it's a QV chaos basically what it is

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.750 
it's a QV chaos basically what it is
it's<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.980> siamese<00:00:14.519> cube<00:00:14.880> which<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.080> on<00:00:16.640> see<00:00:17.640> the

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
it's a siamese cube which is on see the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.880 
it's a siamese cube which is on see the
logo<00:00:17.940> that's<00:00:18.210> I'm<00:00:18.570> actually<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:19.199> real

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
logo that's I'm actually a real

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.849 
logo that's I'm actually a real
centerpiece<00:00:20.250> right<00:00:20.640> there<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.619> then<00:00:22.619> another

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
centerpiece right there and then another

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.269 
centerpiece right there and then another
siamese<00:00:23.400> cube<00:00:23.699> right<00:00:24.150> there<00:00:24.390> i<00:00:25.250> covered<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
siamese cube right there i covered the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.910 
siamese cube right there i covered the
logo<00:00:26.640> up<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.150> one<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:28.199> there's<00:00:28.500> not<00:00:28.740> two

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
logo up on this one so there's not two

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.630 
logo up on this one so there's not two
logos<00:00:29.720> but<00:00:30.720> that's<00:00:30.900> what<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:32.040> siamese

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
logos but that's what it is a siamese

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.979 
logos but that's what it is a siamese
key<00:00:32.910> with<00:00:33.210> um<00:00:34.370> these<00:00:35.370> layers<00:00:36.140> extended<00:00:38.989> like

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
key with um these layers extended like

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.710 
key with um these layers extended like
that

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.390 

it's<00:00:45.290> a<00:00:45.920> very<00:00:46.550> easy<00:00:46.700> build<00:00:47.710> so<00:00:48.710> this<00:00:48.860> is<00:00:48.890> this

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
it's a very easy build so this is this

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.900 
it's a very easy build so this is this
is<00:00:49.580> the<00:00:49.730> original<00:00:49.790> 3<00:00:50.300> x<00:00:50.480> 3<00:00:50.830> x<00:00:51.830> 3<00:00:51.980> x<00:00:52.190> 3<00:00:52.340> right<00:00:52.640> here

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
is the original 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 right here

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.600 
is the original 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 right here
so<00:00:53.510> you<00:00:53.600> like<00:00:53.720> that<00:00:53.990> then<00:00:54.620> I<00:00:54.650> just<00:00:54.920> on<00:00:55.430> each

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
so you like that then I just on each

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.930 
so you like that then I just on each
layer<00:00:55.850> I<00:00:56.180> glued<00:00:56.870> a<00:00:57.020> piece<00:00:57.050> on<00:00:57.550> to<00:00:58.550> each<00:00:58.700> of

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
layer I glued a piece on to each of

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.290 
layer I glued a piece on to each of
these<00:00:59.590> and<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:00.710> same<00:01:00.920> on<00:01:00.950> the<00:01:01.160> layer<00:01:01.310> layer

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
these and the same on the layer layer

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.530 
these and the same on the layer layer
below<00:01:02.630> it<00:01:02.780> and<00:01:03.490> on<00:01:04.490> Siamese<00:01:04.970> this<00:01:05.360> is<00:01:05.510> a

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
below it and on Siamese this is a

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.570 
below it and on Siamese this is a
Siamese<00:01:06.020> I'm<00:01:06.290> had<00:01:06.920> to<00:01:07.010> do<00:01:07.160> it<00:01:07.280> on<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:07.520> other

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
Siamese I'm had to do it on the other

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.170 
Siamese I'm had to do it on the other
side<00:01:07.940> on<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.180> bottom<00:01:08.510> like<00:01:08.960> that<00:01:09.760> it<00:01:10.760> is<00:01:10.970> a

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
side on the bottom like that it is a

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.270 
side on the bottom like that it is a
very<00:01:12.160> weird<00:01:13.160> puzzle<00:01:13.640> it<00:01:14.540> is<00:01:14.780> very

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
very weird puzzle it is very

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.410 
very weird puzzle it is very
shape-shifting<00:01:16.720> I'll<00:01:17.950> demonstrate<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:19.520> and

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.320 

yeah<00:01:23.420> it's<00:01:23.900> pretty<00:01:24.110> neat<00:01:24.610> so<00:01:25.610> I'll<00:01:25.940> scramble

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
yeah it's pretty neat so I'll scramble

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.230 
yeah it's pretty neat so I'll scramble
this<00:01:26.630> up<00:01:26.869> I've<00:01:27.229> solved<00:01:27.710> it<00:01:27.830> once<00:01:28.010> is<00:01:28.340> it<00:01:29.060> is

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
this up I've solved it once is it is

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.499 
this up I've solved it once is it is
very<00:01:29.600> hard<00:01:29.930> to<00:01:30.400> solve<00:01:32.440> so<00:01:33.550> y'all<00:01:34.550> go<00:01:35.180> ahead<00:01:35.210> and

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
very hard to solve so y'all go ahead and

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:54.610 
very hard to solve so y'all go ahead and
um<00:01:35.720> scramble<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:37.360> just<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.479> show<00:01:38.660> you

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.010 

so<00:01:55.220> I<00:01:55.580> guess<00:01:55.760> you<00:01:56.240> could<00:01:56.390> call<00:01:56.540> it<00:01:56.600> a<00:01:56.720> key<00:01:56.900> be

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
so I guess you could call it a key be

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.420 
so I guess you could call it a key be
chaos<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:57.350> three<00:01:57.830> batteries<00:01:59.050> but<00:02:00.050> um<00:02:00.530> when

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
chaos and three batteries but um when

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.880 
chaos and three batteries but um when
it's<00:02:01.610> all<00:02:01.790> bits<00:02:02.090> it<00:02:02.360> looks<00:02:02.660> like<00:02:02.750> a<00:02:02.840> three<00:02:03.740> by

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
it's all bits it looks like a three by

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.170 
it's all bits it looks like a three by
four<00:02:03.950> by<00:02:04.250> five<00:02:04.930> um<00:02:05.930> i<00:02:06.800> got<00:02:07.280> i<00:02:07.460> bought<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.820> cubes

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
four by five um i got i bought the cubes

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.260 
four by five um i got i bought the cubes
i<00:02:08.390> made<00:02:08.960> this<00:02:09.140> out<00:02:09.350> of<00:02:09.380> that<00:02:09.650> walmart<00:02:10.010> and

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
walmart cubes they're not very

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.120 
walmart cubes they're not very
consistent<00:02:16.840> lie<00:02:17.840> i<00:02:18.110> feel<00:02:18.170> like<00:02:18.620> i<00:02:18.770> could<00:02:18.890> buy

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
consistent lie i feel like i could buy

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.240 
consistent lie i feel like i could buy
one<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.580> like<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:21.020> on<00:02:21.290> color<00:02:21.620> is<00:02:21.920> brighter

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
one and like the on color is brighter

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.690 
one and like the on color is brighter
than<00:02:22.610> another<00:02:23.210> one<00:02:23.300> up<00:02:23.480> I<00:02:23.860> so<00:02:24.860> make<00:02:25.130> sure<00:02:25.160> when

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
than another one up I so make sure when

you buy your three by threes if you want

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.090 
you buy your three by threes if you want
to<00:02:29.690> do<00:02:29.750> this<00:02:29.960> that<00:02:30.770> um<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:33.290> look<00:02:33.470> at<00:02:33.650> them<00:02:33.770> and

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
to do this that um you look at them and

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.240 
to do this that um you look at them and
they're<00:02:34.220> all<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.490> same<00:02:34.520> colors<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:37.070> make

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
they're all the same colors and make

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.320 
they're all the same colors and make
sure<00:02:37.280> all<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.640> blues<00:02:37.850> I<00:02:38.030> like<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.240> same<00:02:38.480> tent

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330

so<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:41.510> is<00:02:41.660> my<00:02:41.980> QB<00:02:42.980> chaos<00:02:43.340> i<00:02:43.580> guess<00:02:43.790> and

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
so this is my QB chaos i guess and

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.230 
so this is my QB chaos i guess and
thanks<00:02:45.080> for<00:02:45.200> watching
