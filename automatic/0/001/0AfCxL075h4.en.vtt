going to begin with E and G all right
and<00:00:42.500> G<00:00:42.710> these<00:00:43.070> are<00:00:43.129> two<00:00:43.489> different<00:00:43.820> guitar

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
and G these are two different guitar

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:51.619 
has one five one three okay

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:53.950 
has one five one three okay
doesn't<00:00:51.949> matter<00:00:52.100> if<00:00:52.369> you<00:00:53.000> know<00:00:53.180> theory<00:00:53.570> or<00:00:53.750> not

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
doesn't matter if you know theory or not

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.410 
doesn't matter if you know theory or not
this<00:00:54.799> is<00:00:54.920> just<00:00:55.190> very<00:00:55.250> technical<00:00:55.940> we're<00:00:56.180> gonna

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
this is just very technical we're gonna

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.109 
this is just very technical we're gonna
look<00:00:56.720> at<00:00:56.869> the<00:00:56.989> guitar<00:00:57.350> chord<00:00:57.710> shapes<00:00:58.129> you

00:00:59.109 --> 00:00:59.119 
look at the guitar chord shapes you

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:02.140 
look at the guitar chord shapes you
don't<00:00:59.330> need<00:00:59.510> to<00:00:59.629> know<00:00:59.750> the<00:00:59.900> notes<00:01:00.049> and<00:01:00.430> G<00:01:01.430> which

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
don't need to know the notes and G which

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.820 
don't need to know the notes and G which
is<00:01:02.540> arranged<00:01:03.500> in<00:01:03.710> one<00:01:04.129> three<00:01:04.610> five<00:01:05.000> one<00:01:05.830> okay

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
is arranged in one three five one okay

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.380 
is arranged in one three five one okay
so<00:01:06.860> that's<00:01:07.400> two<00:01:07.820> different<00:01:07.850> voicings<00:01:08.780> E<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.650> G

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
so that's two different voicings E and G

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.300 
so that's two different voicings E and G
okay<00:01:11.390> that's<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.469> first<00:01:12.679> thing<00:01:12.859> we<00:01:13.130> need<00:01:13.280> to

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
okay that's the first thing we need to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.039 
okay that's the first thing we need to
know<00:01:13.609> now<00:01:13.909> the<00:01:13.969> second<00:01:14.570> thing<00:01:14.600> we<00:01:14.869> need<00:01:14.929> to

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
know now the second thing we need to

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.539 
know now the second thing we need to
know<00:01:15.229> is<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.500> way<00:01:15.619> that<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:15.890> guitar<00:01:16.159> is<00:01:16.280> tuned

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
know is the way that the guitar is tuned

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.330 
know is the way that the guitar is tuned
the<00:01:16.729> guitar<00:01:16.759> is<00:01:17.090> tuned<00:01:17.359> in<00:01:17.600> fourths<00:01:18.340> meaning

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
the guitar is tuned in fourths meaning

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.429 
the guitar is tuned in fourths meaning
that<00:01:20.000> again<00:01:20.570> you<00:01:20.719> don't<00:01:20.840> need<00:01:21.049> to<00:01:21.170> know<00:01:21.289> the

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
that again you don't need to know the

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.550 
that again you don't need to know the
theory<00:01:21.710> um<00:01:22.359> let's<00:01:23.359> say<00:01:23.600> we<00:01:23.749> take<00:01:23.899> the<00:01:24.109> E<00:01:24.140> major

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
theory um let's say we take the E major

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.989 
theory um let's say we take the E major
scale<00:01:25.749> okay<00:01:26.749> then<00:01:27.439> the<00:01:27.590> fourth<00:01:27.859> note<00:01:28.189> is<00:01:28.429> our

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:28.999 
scale okay then the fourth note is our

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:34.480 
scale okay then the fourth note is our
next<00:01:29.240> string<00:01:30.640> this<00:01:31.640> is<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:31.969> a<00:01:32.679> and<00:01:33.679> again<00:01:33.829> the

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
next string this is a a and again the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.290 
next string this is a a and again the
next<00:01:34.729> string<00:01:35.409> d<00:01:37.840> G

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
next string d G

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.420 
next string d G
and<00:01:40.390> it's<00:01:40.810> also<00:01:41.050> true<00:01:41.230> for<00:01:41.470> Strings<00:01:42.010> one<00:01:42.220> and

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
and it's also true for Strings one and

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.640 
and it's also true for Strings one and
two<00:01:42.580> e<00:01:45.000> but<00:01:46.000> it's<00:01:46.330> not<00:01:46.600> true<00:01:46.870> for<00:01:47.110> strengths

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
two e but it's not true for strengths

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:54.110 
two e but it's not true for strengths
two<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.070> three<00:01:48.370> two<00:01:48.670> and<00:01:48.790> three<00:01:49.120> are<00:01:49.330> a<00:01:49.390> third

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.470 

okay<00:01:55.150> it's<00:01:55.480> the<00:01:55.660> third<00:01:55.990> note<00:01:56.260> of<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.880> G<00:01:57.910> Major

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
okay it's the third note of the G Major

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.610 
okay it's the third note of the G Major
scale<00:01:58.830> why<00:01:59.830> is<00:01:59.890> that<00:02:00.150> just<00:02:01.150> very<00:02:01.750> short<00:02:02.050> very

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
scale why is that just very short very

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.430 
scale why is that just very short very
concise<00:02:03.040> it's<00:02:03.480> so<00:02:04.480> you<00:02:04.540> can<00:02:04.660> play<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.350> guitar

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
concise it's so you can play the guitar

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
concise it's so you can play the guitar
with<00:02:05.980> four<00:02:06.550> fingers<00:02:07.420> and<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:09.070> can<00:02:09.250> play

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
with four fingers and that you can play

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.660 
with four fingers and that you can play
chords<00:02:10.360> otherwise<00:02:11.320> the<00:02:12.100> guitar<00:02:12.370> would<00:02:12.520> be

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
chords otherwise the guitar would be

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.500 
chords otherwise the guitar would be
uncomfortable<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.510> play<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:16.030> wouldn't<00:02:16.390> be

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
uncomfortable to play and it wouldn't be

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.410 
uncomfortable to play and it wouldn't be
as<00:02:16.740> diverse<00:02:17.740> as<00:02:17.950> it<00:02:18.250> is<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.850> standard<00:02:19.240> tuning

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
as diverse as it is the standard tuning

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.000 
as diverse as it is the standard tuning
is<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.720> pretty<00:02:20.080> ingenious<00:02:20.800> tuning<00:02:21.370> now<00:02:23.010> having

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
is a pretty ingenious tuning now having

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.590 
is a pretty ingenious tuning now having
said<00:02:24.220> that<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.920> only<00:02:27.100> difference<00:02:27.430> in<00:02:28.000> tuning

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
said that the only difference in tuning

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.220 
said that the only difference in tuning
is<00:02:28.810> between<00:02:29.260> Springs<00:02:29.620> two<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.190> three<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.810> in

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
is between Springs two and three so in

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.140 
is between Springs two and three so in
order<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.620> make<00:02:32.980> strengths<00:02:33.550> two<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:33.880> three<00:02:34.120> a

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
order to make strengths two and three a

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.440 
order to make strengths two and three a
fourth<00:02:34.570> you<00:02:34.840> need<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.380> compensate<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.880> play

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
fourth you need to compensate and play

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.660 
fourth you need to compensate and play
one<00:02:37.870> on<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.500> second<00:02:38.890> string<00:02:39.070> and<00:02:39.130> then<00:02:39.430> it's<00:02:39.550> a

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
one on the second string and then it's a

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.220 
one on the second string and then it's a
fourth<00:02:41.190> okay<00:02:42.190> so<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:43.300> compensation<00:02:44.020> is

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
fourth okay so the compensation is

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.370 
fourth okay so the compensation is
always<00:02:44.739> on<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.040> second<00:02:45.400> string<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.780> if<00:02:47.140> we

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
always on the second string so if we

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.240 
always on the second string so if we
take<00:02:47.530> E<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:49.450> we<00:02:49.600> take<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:49.900> up<00:02:50.080> to<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.680> we<00:02:50.980> take<00:02:51.100> it

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
take E and we take it up to a we take it

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.010 
take E and we take it up to a we take it
up<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.760> fourth<00:02:52.890> then<00:02:53.890> we<00:02:54.280> go<00:02:54.520> down<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.420> strength

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
up a fourth then we go down a strength

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.380 
up a fourth then we go down a strength
physically<00:02:56.770> but<00:02:57.130> we<00:02:57.310> need<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:57.550> compensate<00:02:58.150> for

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
physically but we need to compensate for

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.260 
physically but we need to compensate for
the<00:02:58.570> second<00:02:58.989> strength<00:02:59.290> so<00:02:59.590> we<00:02:59.739> raise<00:03:00.070> one<00:03:00.760> to

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
the second strength so we raise one to

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.500 
the second strength so we raise one to
two<00:03:01.660> on<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.590> second<00:03:03.310> string<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.820> we<00:03:04.480> get<00:03:04.660> a

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
two on the second string and we get a

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.720 
two on the second string and we get a
same<00:03:07.510> thing<00:03:07.780> for<00:03:08.020> a<00:03:08.050> and<00:03:08.200> D<00:03:08.590> we<00:03:08.980> take<00:03:09.220> it<00:03:09.400> down

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
same thing for a and D we take it down

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.350 
same thing for a and D we take it down
down<00:03:10.540> physically<00:03:11.110> up<00:03:11.380> musically<00:03:11.980> up<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:13.060> fourth

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
down physically up musically up a fourth

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.840 
down physically up musically up a fourth
we<00:03:14.230> need<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.410> compensate<00:03:14.770> on<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.459> second

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
we need to compensate on the second

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.979 
we need to compensate on the second
string<00:03:16.120> so<00:03:16.630> two<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:18.070> three<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.930> we<00:03:20.140> get<00:03:20.700> D<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:22.750> e

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
string so two to three and we get D so e

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.240 
string so two to three and we get D so e
a<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:23.980> D<00:03:24.430> are<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.870> same<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.530> same<00:03:26.739> chords

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
a and D are the same the same chords

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.840 
a and D are the same the same chords
just<00:03:27.760> up<00:03:28.000> fourth<00:03:28.980> let's<00:03:29.980> look<00:03:30.520> at<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.730> like

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
just up fourth let's look at it like

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.230 
just up fourth let's look at it like
this<00:03:31.120> E

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
this E

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.940 
this E
Apple<00:03:33.960> fourth<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.860> five<00:03:36.170> is<00:03:37.170> exactly<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.740> same

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
Apple fourth to five is exactly the same

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.440 
Apple fourth to five is exactly the same
as<00:03:38.990> this<00:03:41.810> same<00:03:42.810> cord<00:03:43.170> if<00:03:43.680> we<00:03:43.890> take<00:03:44.070> a<00:03:44.220> Appa<00:03:44.880> four

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
as this same cord if we take a Appa four

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:53.390 
as this same cord if we take a Appa four
to<00:03:46.260> ten<00:03:48.860> we<00:03:49.860> get<00:03:50.040> this<00:03:50.280> deep<00:03:51.240> sea<00:03:52.020> so<00:03:53.010> it's<00:03:53.220> the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
to ten we get this deep sea so it's the

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.620 
to ten we get this deep sea so it's the
same<00:03:53.640> chord<00:03:54.510> moving<00:03:55.080> around<00:03:55.320> and<00:03:55.680> pitch<00:03:56.630> same

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
same chord moving around and pitch same

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.180 
same chord moving around and pitch same
thing<00:03:57.900> for<00:03:58.110> G<00:03:58.590> C<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.340> D<00:03:59.700> G<00:04:00.240> you<00:04:01.230> take<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.680> down

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
thing for G C and D G you take it down

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.840 
thing for G C and D G you take it down
or<00:04:02.640> up<00:04:03.090> musically<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:04.070> you<00:04:05.070> compensate<00:04:05.670> on

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
or up musically and you compensate on

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.900 
or up musically and you compensate on
the<00:04:06.090> second<00:04:06.450> string<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:06.930> take<00:04:07.140> G<00:04:07.470> down<00:04:08.340> string

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
the second string you take G down string

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.090 
the second string you take G down string
you<00:04:09.480> lose<00:04:09.690> this<00:04:09.960> finger<00:04:10.410> here<00:04:10.680> because

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
you lose this finger here because

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.120 
you lose this finger here because
there's<00:04:11.280> no<00:04:11.460> string<00:04:11.760> below<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.300> E<00:04:12.330> string<00:04:12.720> and

there's no string below the E string and

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.320 
there's no string below the E string and
you<00:04:14.130> raise<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.640> second<00:04:15.030> string<00:04:15.300> by<00:04:15.570> one<00:04:15.900> fret

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
you raise the second string by one fret

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.020 
you raise the second string by one fret
same<00:04:18.330> thing<00:04:18.570> for<00:04:18.780> F<00:04:18.989> you<00:04:19.470> take<00:04:19.710> it<00:04:19.830> down<00:04:20.030> you

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
same thing for F you take it down you

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.670 
same thing for F you take it down you
raise<00:04:21.480> the<00:04:22.170> second<00:04:22.500> string<00:04:22.680> from<00:04:22.860> 0<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.490> 1<00:04:24.680> and

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
raise the second string from 0 to 1 and

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.270 
raise the second string from 0 to 1 and
you<00:04:25.860> get<00:04:26.100> F<00:04:26.910> so<00:04:27.840> C<00:04:28.170> a<00:04:28.530> G<00:04:29.250> C<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.390> F<00:04:30.810> are<00:04:31.380> all<00:04:31.410> the

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
you get F so C a G C and F are all the

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.820 
you get F so C a G C and F are all the
same<00:04:32.580> chord<00:04:33.000> voicing<00:04:33.540> going<00:04:33.930> up<00:04:34.140> and<00:04:34.350> pitch<00:04:34.580> G

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
same chord voicing going up and pitch G

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.749 
same chord voicing going up and pitch G
C<00:04:38.630> ok<00:04:39.630> so

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:49.920 

and<00:04:46.620> see<00:04:47.620> or<00:04:47.949> we<00:04:48.219> can<00:04:48.400> take<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.610> seat<00:04:48.909> boy<00:04:49.150> okay

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
and see or we can take the seat boy okay

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.809 
and see or we can take the seat boy okay
we<00:04:49.960> can<00:04:50.169> take<00:04:50.349> the<00:04:50.469> C<00:04:50.620> chord<00:04:50.919> a<00:04:51.189> fourth<00:04:53.610> and<00:04:54.610> we

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:54.819 
we can take the C chord a fourth and we

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:58.909 
we can take the C chord a fourth and we
get<00:04:55.029> F<00:04:55.830> same<00:04:56.830> chord<00:04:57.370> moving<00:04:57.759> around<00:04:57.999> in<00:04:58.240> pitch

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
get F same chord moving around in pitch

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.700 
get F same chord moving around in pitch
so<00:04:59.919> that<00:05:00.699> also<00:05:01.029> apply<00:05:01.449> for<00:05:01.839> the<00:05:02.110> minors

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
so that also apply for the minors

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.089 
so that also apply for the minors
II<00:05:02.740> might<00:05:03.539> take<00:05:04.539> it<00:05:04.659> down<00:05:04.949> compensate<00:05:05.949> the

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
II might take it down compensate the

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.999 
II might take it down compensate the
second<00:05:06.490> spring<00:05:06.669> you<00:05:06.879> get<00:05:07.029> a<00:05:07.240> minor<00:05:07.860> take<00:05:08.860> it

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:09.009 
second spring you get a minor take it

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:09.450 
second spring you get a minor take it
down

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
down

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.700 
down
compensate<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:10.599> second<00:05:10.960> spring<00:05:11.169> from<00:05:11.379> two<00:05:11.559> to

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
compensate the second spring from two to

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.659 
compensate the second spring from two to
three<00:05:11.740> you<00:05:12.069> get<00:05:12.309> D<00:05:13.300> minor<00:05:13.539> so<00:05:14.379> that's<00:05:15.339> what<00:05:15.639> I

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
three you get D minor so that's what I

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.659 
three you get D minor so that's what I
mean<00:05:15.969> by<00:05:16.300> the<00:05:16.360> same<00:05:16.870> chord<00:05:17.199> voicing<00:05:17.740> moving

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
mean by the same chord voicing moving

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.749 
mean by the same chord voicing moving
around<00:05:18.879> it's<00:05:19.210> all<00:05:19.449> the<00:05:19.629> same<00:05:19.899> chord<00:05:20.759> changing

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
around it's all the same chord changing

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:29.070 
around it's all the same chord changing
pitch<00:05:23.249> at<00:05:24.249> the<00:05:24.370> height<00:05:24.639> of<00:05:24.849> the<00:05:25.389> sound<00:05:27.120> now<00:05:28.120> how

00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:34.749 
do you connect all of it a if you take

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:42.179 
do you connect all of it a if you take
it<00:05:34.899> two<00:05:35.050> frets<00:05:35.349> down<00:05:35.620> its<00:05:35.949> G<00:05:40.050> okay<00:05:41.050> because<00:05:41.259> a<00:05:41.680> a

the way that it applies to playing is

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:23.329 
the way that it applies to playing is
that<00:07:19.870> if<00:07:20.110> for<00:07:20.439> example<00:07:20.499> you<00:07:21.249> have<00:07:21.430> this<00:07:21.729> chord

00:07:23.329 --> 00:07:23.339 
that if for example you have this chord

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:25.230 
that if for example you have this chord
okay<00:07:24.339> just

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 
okay just

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.749 
okay just
d<00:07:25.449> sharp<00:07:25.809> sharp<00:07:26.770> 9<00:07:27.149> and<00:07:28.169> you<00:07:29.169> want<00:07:29.379> to<00:07:29.469> find<00:07:29.800> the

00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:30.759 
d sharp sharp 9 and you want to find the

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:34.170 
d sharp sharp 9 and you want to find the
chord<00:07:31.089> a<00:07:31.620> string<00:07:32.620> down<00:07:32.860> you<00:07:33.639> just<00:07:33.879> take<00:07:34.029> it

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:34.180 
chord a string down you just take it

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.409 
chord a string down you just take it
down<00:07:34.949> compensate<00:07:35.949> on<00:07:36.219> the<00:07:36.550> second<00:07:36.939> string<00:07:37.149> and

down compensate on the second string and

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:42.510 
down compensate on the second string and
you<00:07:37.719> get<00:07:37.930> this<00:07:39.659> the<00:07:40.659> same<00:07:40.930> chord<00:07:41.319> a<00:07:41.529> fourth<00:07:42.279> up

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520 
you get this the same chord a fourth up

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.519 
you get this the same chord a fourth up
you<00:07:43.449> can<00:07:43.689> of<00:07:43.779> course<00:07:44.020> do<00:07:44.199> this<00:07:44.499> a<00:07:46.289> fourth<00:07:47.289> up

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:47.529 
you can of course do this a fourth up

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:50.189 
you can of course do this a fourth up
five<00:07:47.830> frets<00:07:48.099> up<00:07:48.459> but<00:07:49.120> if<00:07:49.360> you<00:07:49.539> don't<00:07:49.779> want<00:07:50.020> to
