the only thing you'll need for this
project<00:00:04.190> is<00:00:04.730> some<00:00:05.149> popsicle<00:00:05.690> sticks<00:00:06.069> so<00:00:07.069> I'm

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.130 
project is some popsicle sticks so I'm

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.750 
project is some popsicle sticks so I'm
staying<00:00:07.549> a<00:00:08.320> glue<00:00:09.320> gun<00:00:09.350> and<00:00:09.860> some<00:00:09.950> glue<00:00:10.400> and

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:10.760 
staying a glue gun and some glue and

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.080 
staying a glue gun and some glue and
some<00:00:11.510> scissors<00:00:12.369> so<00:00:13.369> the<00:00:13.459> first<00:00:13.670> thing<00:00:13.820> we<00:00:13.910> want

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
some scissors so the first thing we want

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.720 
some scissors so the first thing we want
to<00:00:14.119> do<00:00:14.330> is<00:00:14.600> cut<00:00:14.869> off<00:00:15.080> all<00:00:15.379> the<00:00:15.619> surround<00:00:16.129> part

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
to do is cut off all the surround part

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.839 
to do is cut off all the surround part
of<00:00:16.940> the<00:00:17.210> ends<00:00:17.539> on<00:00:17.720> the<00:00:18.110> popsicle<00:00:18.529> sticks

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:18.849 
of the ends on the popsicle sticks

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:20.859 
of the ends on the popsicle sticks
doesn't<00:00:19.849> really<00:00:19.970> matter<00:00:20.210> if<00:00:20.390> they're<00:00:20.599> jagged

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
doesn't really matter if they're jagged

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.710 
doesn't really matter if they're jagged
or<00:00:21.140> uneven<00:00:22.039> is<00:00:22.250> make<00:00:22.460> them<00:00:22.640> about<00:00:23.300> the<00:00:23.509> same

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
or uneven is make them about the same

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.880 
or uneven is make them about the same
size<00:00:23.960> because<00:00:24.259> you<00:00:24.470> don't<00:00:24.619> want<00:00:24.740> them

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
size because you don't want them

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.370 
size because you don't want them
sticking<00:00:25.220> out<00:00:25.640> on<00:00:25.939> the<00:00:26.210> ends<00:00:26.630> if<00:00:27.199> you<00:00:27.259> get

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
sticking out on the ends if you get

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.189 
sticking out on the ends if you get
little<00:00:27.619> shards<00:00:28.130> of<00:00:28.359> wood<00:00:29.359> that<00:00:29.390> sticks<00:00:29.929> up<00:00:30.079> do

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
little shards of wood that sticks up do

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.380 
little shards of wood that sticks up do
you<00:00:30.289> just<00:00:30.470> kind<00:00:30.589> of<00:00:30.710> brush<00:00:30.890> that<00:00:30.919> on<00:00:31.270> or<00:00:32.270> you

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
you just kind of brush that on or you

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.850 
you just kind of brush that on or you
can<00:00:32.419> take<00:00:32.689> the<00:00:32.810> end<00:00:32.960> and<00:00:33.290> just<00:00:33.320> sort<00:00:33.710> of<00:00:33.740> go

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
can take the end and just sort of go

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.740 
can take the end and just sort of go
like<00:00:33.890> this<00:00:34.100> with<00:00:34.310> it

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
like this with it

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.260 
like this with it
the<00:00:35.750> next<00:00:36.050> step<00:00:36.199> is<00:00:36.350> to<00:00:36.649> start<00:00:36.710> staining<00:00:37.699> the

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
the next step is to start staining the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.599 
the next step is to start staining the
popsicle<00:00:38.719> sticks<00:00:39.039> the<00:00:40.039> idea<00:00:40.309> is<00:00:40.430> you<00:00:40.579> don't

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
popsicle sticks the idea is you don't

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:43.779 
popsicle sticks the idea is you don't
want<00:00:41.149> to<00:00:41.480> necessarily<00:00:42.260> paint<00:00:43.250> them<00:00:43.460> like<00:00:43.640> see

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
want to necessarily paint them like see

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.330 
want to necessarily paint them like see
how<00:00:43.850> dark<00:00:44.090> that<00:00:44.270> got<00:00:44.649> we<00:00:45.649> don't<00:00:45.800> want<00:00:46.100> to<00:00:46.219> make

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
how dark that got we don't want to make

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.029 
how dark that got we don't want to make
them<00:00:46.600> painted<00:00:47.600> we<00:00:48.019> just<00:00:48.230> want<00:00:48.410> to<00:00:48.500> stain<00:00:48.769> them

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
them painted we just want to stain them

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.740 
them painted we just want to stain them
so<00:00:49.190> they're<00:00:49.340> not<00:00:49.489> that<00:00:49.609> nice<00:00:49.910> beautiful

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
so they're not that nice beautiful

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.569 
so they're not that nice beautiful
bright<00:00:51.410> color<00:00:51.890> so<00:00:52.100> you're<00:00:52.190> just<00:00:52.309> going<00:00:52.430> to<00:00:52.460> go

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
bright color so you're just going to go

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.459 
bright color so you're just going to go
through<00:00:52.820> and<00:00:53.000> just<00:00:53.149> do<00:00:53.480> all<00:00:53.510> these<00:00:53.989> I've

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
through and just do all these I've

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.040 
through and just do all these I've
started<00:00:54.800> putting<00:00:55.160> them<00:00:55.280> together<00:00:55.519> and<00:00:55.910> I<00:00:56.809> have

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
started putting them together and I have

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.520 
started putting them together and I have
two<00:00:57.620> on<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:58.039> bottom<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:58.960> two<00:00:59.960> placed<00:01:00.230> on<00:01:00.410> the

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
two on the bottom and two placed on the

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.950 
two on the bottom and two placed on the
top<00:01:00.739> I'm<00:01:01.699> going<00:01:01.850> to<00:01:01.940> place<00:01:02.089> a<00:01:02.120> third<00:01:02.510> beam<00:01:02.750> in

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
top I'm going to place a third beam in

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.280 
top I'm going to place a third beam in
the<00:01:03.050> middle<00:01:03.379> for<00:01:03.890> extra<00:01:04.190> support<00:01:05.110> well<00:01:06.110> now<00:01:06.260> I

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
the middle for extra support well now I

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.140 
the middle for extra support well now I
want<00:01:06.530> to<00:01:06.620> just<00:01:06.830> simply<00:01:07.430> take<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.670> popsicle

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
want to just simply take the popsicle

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.970 
want to just simply take the popsicle
sticks<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.540> lie<00:01:08.720> them<00:01:08.900> across<00:01:09.080> so<00:01:09.620> I'm<00:01:09.800> going

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
sticks and lie them across so I'm going

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.540 
sticks and lie them across so I'm going
to<00:01:10.010> place<00:01:10.250> some<00:01:10.300> crazy<00:01:11.300> glue<00:01:11.540> right<00:01:11.840> here<00:01:12.550> and

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
to place some crazy glue right here and

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.210 
to place some crazy glue right here and
right<00:01:13.850> here<00:01:13.880> and<00:01:14.620> then<00:01:15.620> I'm<00:01:15.710> going<00:01:15.860> to<00:01:15.920> place

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
right here and then I'm going to place

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.800 
right here and then I'm going to place
it<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:16.910> you<00:01:17.030> just<00:01:17.210> need<00:01:17.390> to<00:01:17.480> make<00:01:17.600> sure<00:01:17.720> you

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
it and you just need to make sure you

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.110 
it and you just need to make sure you
space<00:01:18.140> them<00:01:18.410> about<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:19.070> same<00:01:19.340> it<00:01:19.730> doesn't

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
space them about the same it doesn't

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.610 
space them about the same it doesn't
need<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.270> be<00:01:20.360> perfect<00:01:20.510> because<00:01:21.050> honestly

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
need to be perfect because honestly

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.550 
need to be perfect because honestly
pallets<00:01:22.070> are<00:01:22.190> not<00:01:22.340> perfect<00:01:23.080> so<00:01:24.080> just<00:01:24.140> put<00:01:24.530> a

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
pallets are not perfect so just put a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.890 
pallets are not perfect so just put a
little<00:01:24.740> pressure<00:01:24.980> and<00:01:25.430> then<00:01:25.790> it<00:01:25.820> will<00:01:26.300> sit

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
little pressure and then it will sit

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.530 
little pressure and then it will sit
there<00:01:27.050> and<00:01:27.110> dry<00:01:27.440> here<00:01:28.280> I<00:01:28.340> have<00:01:28.790> two<00:01:29.150> of<00:01:29.330> them

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
there and dry here I have two of them

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.500 
there and dry here I have two of them
finished<00:01:30.310> this<00:01:31.310> one<00:01:31.580> was<00:01:31.790> done<00:01:32.000> with<00:01:32.240> a<00:01:32.270> hot

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
finished this one was done with a hot

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.690 
finished this one was done with a hot
glue<00:01:32.810> gun<00:01:32.840> as<00:01:33.290> you<00:01:33.920> can<00:01:34.040> see<00:01:34.220> it's<00:01:34.370> a<00:01:34.430> little

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
glue gun as you can see it's a little

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.880 
glue gun as you can see it's a little
bit<00:01:34.940> more<00:01:35.150> messy<00:01:35.410> although<00:01:36.410> that<00:01:36.650> could<00:01:36.770> have

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
bit more messy although that could have

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.340 
bit more messy although that could have
been<00:01:36.980> my<00:01:37.160> fault<00:01:37.370> as<00:01:37.550> well<00:01:37.750> but<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:38.840> can<00:01:39.050> see

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
been my fault as well but you can see

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.860 
been my fault as well but you can see
the<00:01:39.530> glue<00:01:39.770> underneath<00:01:40.430> a<00:01:40.640> little<00:01:40.760> bit<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:41.720> if

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
the glue underneath a little bit so if

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.900 
the glue underneath a little bit so if
you<00:01:42.020> do<00:01:42.350> if<00:01:42.620> you<00:01:42.710> go<00:01:42.830> a<00:01:42.860> little<00:01:43.040> bit<00:01:43.280> slower<00:01:43.580> I

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
you do if you go a little bit slower I

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:44.890 
you do if you go a little bit slower I
guess<00:01:44.120> I<00:01:44.210> was<00:01:44.330> gonna<00:01:44.450> probably<00:01:44.720> going<00:01:44.840> a

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
guess I was gonna probably going a

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.410 
guess I was gonna probably going a
little<00:01:44.990> fast<00:01:45.290> maybe<00:01:45.710> make<00:01:45.920> these<00:01:46.100> not<00:01:46.790> as<00:01:47.030> big
