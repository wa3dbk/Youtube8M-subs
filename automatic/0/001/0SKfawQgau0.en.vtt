think that smokey eye is the most

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.540 
think that smokey eye is the most
universal<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.560> easiest<00:00:08.040> but<00:00:08.160> also<00:00:08.340> the

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
wear it's the most universal because you

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.379 
wear it's the most universal because you
can<00:00:12.420> totally<00:00:12.900> use<00:00:13.019> any<00:00:13.380> shade<00:00:14.309> any<00:00:14.730> color<00:00:15.210> that

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
I get to decrease I'm just going to go

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.110 
I get to decrease I'm just going to go
back<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.670> forth<00:02:38.940> in<00:02:39.769> swirling<00:02:40.769> motions<00:02:41.280> and

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
back and forth in swirling motions and

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.540 
back and forth in swirling motions and
then<00:02:43.110> just<00:02:43.319> going<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.680> take<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.069> higher<00:02:44.310> and

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
then just going to take it higher and

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.809 
then just going to take it higher and
higher<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:47.450> just<00:02:48.450> blend<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.170> out<00:02:49.319> and<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:50.640> key

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
higher and just blend it out and the key

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.930 
higher and just blend it out and the key
is<00:02:50.880> blending<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.650> actually<00:02:53.220> just<00:02:53.370> want<00:02:53.670> to

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
is blending so you actually just want to

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.960 
is blending so you actually just want to
get<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.480> most<00:02:54.780> of<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.050> color<00:02:55.290> onto<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.760> lid

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
get the most of the color onto the lid

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.020 
get the most of the color onto the lid
and<00:02:57.300> really<00:02:57.540> pack<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.019> color<00:02:58.230> on<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.950> then<00:02:59.880> as

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
you get less and less product on your

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.949 
you get less and less product on your
brush<00:03:02.130> left<00:03:02.670> on<00:03:02.790> your<00:03:02.880> brush<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.420> just<00:03:03.510> want

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
brush left on your brush you just want

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.830 
brush left on your brush you just want
to<00:03:04.080> take<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:04.650> out<00:03:04.920> words<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.000> upwards<00:03:06.540> and

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
to take it out words and upwards and

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.120 
to take it out words and upwards and
blend<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.769> so<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.880> color<00:03:09.060> kind<00:03:09.360> of<00:03:09.480> fades<00:03:10.130> from

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
blend it so the color kind of fades from

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.009 
blend it so the color kind of fades from
the<00:03:11.280> most<00:03:11.489> intensity<00:03:12.120> right<00:03:12.299> here<00:03:12.540> on<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.810> lid

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
the most intensity right here on the lid

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.300 
the most intensity right here on the lid
and<00:03:13.590> up<00:03:14.549> to<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.880> brow<00:03:15.090> bone<00:03:15.890> it<00:03:16.890> will<00:03:17.130> just

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
and up to the brow bone it will just

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.150 
and up to the brow bone it will just
fade<00:03:17.670> into<00:03:17.700> nothing<00:03:18.590> you<00:03:19.590> can<00:03:19.739> also<00:03:19.860> take<00:03:20.100> a

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
fade into nothing you can also take a

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.349 
fade into nothing you can also take a
little<00:03:20.489> bit<00:03:20.640> more<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.209> pack<00:03:21.570> it<00:03:21.810> on<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.260> lid

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
little bit more and pack it on the lid

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.550 
little bit more and pack it on the lid
if<00:03:24.359> you<00:03:24.540> feel<00:03:24.720> that's<00:03:24.900> not<00:03:25.140> enough<00:03:25.410> and

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
if you feel that's not enough and

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.590 
if you feel that's not enough and
because<00:03:28.560> this<00:03:28.980> is<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.519> duochrome<00:03:29.880> color<00:03:30.299> it

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
because this is a duochrome color it

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.870 
because this is a duochrome color it
actually<00:03:30.750> creates<00:03:31.530> an<00:03:31.739> effect<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.459> illusion

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
actually creates an effect and illusion

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.180 
actually creates an effect and illusion
like<00:03:32.910> you're<00:03:33.150> wearing<00:03:33.359> multiple<00:03:33.690> colors<00:03:34.320> like

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
you can see it looks kind of brownish

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.280 
you can see it looks kind of brownish
teal<00:03:37.290> on<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.560> lid<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:38.100> then<00:03:38.160> kind<00:03:38.549> of<00:03:38.579> reddish

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
teal on the lid and then kind of reddish

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.380 
teal on the lid and then kind of reddish
increase<00:03:40.670> so<00:03:41.670> that's<00:03:41.850> really<00:03:42.239> really<00:03:42.540> nice<00:03:42.900> so

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
increase so that's really really nice so

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.729 
increase so that's really really nice so
when<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.480> see<00:03:45.660> you<00:03:45.750> don't<00:03:45.870> have<00:03:46.109> any<00:03:46.350> harsh

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739
