build guides here in YouTube it's my
aunt<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.179> interruption<00:00:15.719> built<00:00:15.929> with<00:00:16.080> some

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
aunt of interruption built with some

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.460 
aunt of interruption built with some
minor<00:00:16.650> changes<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.990> that's<00:00:18.990> how<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.439> now

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
minor changes and that's how it is now

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.929 
minor changes and that's how it is now
I'm<00:00:20.340> still<00:00:20.820> using<00:00:20.970> Holbrook<00:00:21.840> rooms<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.939> i

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
I'm still using Holbrook rooms and i

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.060 
I'm still using Holbrook rooms and i
went<00:00:24.570> with<00:00:24.840> sword<00:00:25.500> sword<00:00:26.510> some<00:00:27.510> people<00:00:27.810> have

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
went with sword sword some people have

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.580 
went with sword sword some people have
told<00:00:29.070> me<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.340> like<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.300> focus<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> lot

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
told me that like the focus is a lot

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.270 
told me that like the focus is a lot
better<00:00:31.800> from<00:00:32.099> massive<00:00:32.910> interrupts<00:00:33.450> but<00:00:33.780> i

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
better from massive interrupts but i

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.040 
better from massive interrupts but i
think<00:00:35.280> first<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.120> all<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> coolants<00:00:36.899> are

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
think first of all the coolants are

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.740 
think first of all the coolants are
pretty<00:00:37.620> high<00:00:38.180> because<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.329> don't<00:00:39.450> have<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
pretty high because you don't have the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.190 
pretty high because you don't have the
cool<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.110> react<00:00:40.320> reduction<00:00:41.280> like<00:00:42.210> with<00:00:43.050> you

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
cool and react reduction like with you

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.000 
cool and react reduction like with you
like<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.430> with<00:00:44.460> sword<00:00:44.910> sorry<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:46.010> so

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
like you have with sword sorry and so

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.010 
like you have with sword sorry and so
it's<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.899> 12<00:00:48.899> seconds<00:00:49.350> which<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.710> nice<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
it's just 12 seconds which is nice and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.350 
it's just 12 seconds which is nice and
also<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.170> phantasm<00:00:52.770> does<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.610> much<00:00:53.879> damage<00:00:54.120> is

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
also the phantasm does so much damage is

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.840 
also the phantasm does so much damage is
that<00:00:54.539> if<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.350> creates<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.670> most

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
that if it creates is this the most

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.160 
that if it creates is this the most
damage<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:59.100> highest<00:00:59.430> damage<00:00:59.550> story<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.329> all

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
damage the highest damage story of all

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.590 
damage the highest damage story of all
phantoms<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.039> game<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:03.090> yes<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.480> will

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
phantoms in the game so yes I will

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.230 
phantoms in the game so yes I will
definitely<00:01:03.750> go<00:01:04.229> with<00:01:04.260> sword<00:01:05.030> then<00:01:06.030> i<00:01:06.060> went

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
definitely go with sword then i went

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.320 
definitely go with sword then i went
with<00:01:06.420> great<00:01:06.689> sword<00:01:06.960> because<00:01:07.460> it's<00:01:08.460> hominoids

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
with great sword because it's hominoids

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.380 
with great sword because it's hominoids
a<00:01:09.510> lot<00:01:09.720> better<00:01:09.930> with<00:01:10.200> blinked<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.890> stuff<00:01:11.390> also

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
a lot better with blinked and stuff also

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.830 
a lot better with blinked and stuff also
you<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:12.799> a<00:01:13.799> better<00:01:14.369> interrupt<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.450> rely

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
you have a better interrupt you can rely

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.310 
you have a better interrupt you can rely
more<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.500> because<00:01:17.750> if<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.930> time<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.170> right

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
more on it because if you time it right

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.039 
more on it because if you time it right
it<00:01:19.650> can<00:01:19.950> really<00:01:20.159> interrupt<00:01:20.549> people<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.479> you

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
it can really interrupt people and you

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.140 
it can really interrupt people and you
interrupt<00:01:22.470> something<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.430> won't<00:01:23.640> interrupt

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
interrupt something you won't interrupt

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.210 
interrupt something you won't interrupt
because<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.840> stuff<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.650> chance

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
because of stuff you have a chance

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.429 
because of stuff you have a chance
interrupt<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.750> not<00:01:27.869> hundred<00:01:28.140> percent

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
interrupt but it's not hundred percent

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.980 
interrupt but it's not hundred percent
sure<00:01:28.970> also<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> phantasm<00:01:30.540> does<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> lot<00:01:30.930> of

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
sure also the phantasm does a lot of

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.140 
sure also the phantasm does a lot of
damage<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.470> can<00:01:31.680> like<00:01:32.159> one<00:01:32.430> shot<00:01:32.640> or<00:01:32.790> almost

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
damage you can like one shot or almost

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.460 
damage you can like one shot or almost
lunch<00:01:33.420> at<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.659> feet<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.140> have<00:01:34.229> enough

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
lunch at the feet if you have enough

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.039 
lunch at the feet if you have enough
nightsticks<00:01:35.180> then<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.570> another<00:01:36.600> boom

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
nightsticks then you have another boom

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.719 
nightsticks then you have another boom
remove<00:01:37.439> which<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.799> nice<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.460> enemy<00:01:38.700> has

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
remove which is nice if the enemy has

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.010 
remove which is nice if the enemy has
stability<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:40.970> then<00:01:41.970> here<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.450> another

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
stability and then here you have another

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.260 
stability and then here you have another
mites<00:01:43.290> like<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.770> vulnerability<00:01:44.430> stacks<00:01:44.700> so

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
mites like and vulnerability stacks so

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.480 
mites like and vulnerability stacks so
actually<00:01:45.869> three<00:01:46.350> miles<00:01:46.530> legs<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.920> actually

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
actually three miles legs and actually

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.440 
actually three miles legs and actually
6-6<00:01:48.329> if<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.540> bounces<00:01:48.689> twice<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.939> so<00:01:50.939> i

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
6-6 if it bounces twice to you so i

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.440 
6-6 if it bounces twice to you so i
think<00:01:52.320> great<00:01:53.220> sword<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.640> overall<00:01:54.030> better<00:01:54.060> than

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
think great sword is overall better than

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.490 
think great sword is overall better than
stuff<00:01:55.009> let's<00:01:56.009> move<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.369> with<00:01:56.549> traits<00:01:56.909> with<00:01:57.869> me

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
stuff let's move on with traits with me

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.120 
stuff let's move on with traits with me
up<00:01:58.590> amulet<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.670> still<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> same<00:02:00.030> actually<00:02:01.130> so

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
up amulet is still the same actually so

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.770 
up amulet is still the same actually so
we<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.610> interrupt<00:02:03.299> mhm<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.869> great<00:02:04.740> sword

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
we have interrupt mhm and great sword

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.630 
we have interrupt mhm and great sword
cool<00:02:06.780> down<00:02:06.960> reduce<00:02:07.290> which<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.770> pretty<00:02:08.220> nice<00:02:08.429> we

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
cool down reduce which is pretty nice we

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.540 
cool down reduce which is pretty nice we
can<00:02:08.700> interrupt<00:02:09.090> much<00:02:09.360> more<00:02:09.599> often<00:02:10.400> then<00:02:11.400> we

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
can interrupt much more often then we

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.830 
can interrupt much more often then we
have<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.910> cooler<00:02:12.360> reduce<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.840> sword

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
have the cooler reduce on sword

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.809 
have the cooler reduce on sword
like<00:02:14.170> because<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:15.010> don't<00:02:15.190> have<00:02:15.280> illusion

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
like because you don't have illusion

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.809 
like because you don't have illusion
illusionists<00:02:16.540> celerity<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.980> have<00:02:18.220> both

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
illusionists celerity you have both

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.729 
illusionists celerity you have both
cooler<00:02:19.239> reduction<00:02:19.750> on<00:02:19.900> gray<00:02:20.230> sword<00:02:20.530> &amp;

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
cooler reduction on gray sword &amp;

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.880 
cooler reduction on gray sword &amp;
Sworcery<00:02:21.489> with<00:02:22.030> these<00:02:22.569> two<00:02:22.870> traits<00:02:23.200> which<00:02:23.860> is

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
Sworcery with these two traits which is

awesome then you have deceptive ovation
for<00:02:27.430> so<00:02:27.879> you<00:02:27.970> can<00:02:28.120> shatter<00:02:29.610> distortion<00:02:30.610> or

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
for so you can shatter distortion or

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.280 
for so you can shatter distortion or
diversion<00:02:31.840> or<00:02:32.200> mon<00:02:32.890> track<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:34.269> are<00:02:34.720> most

diversion or mon track you are most

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.770 
diversion or mon track you are most

likely not to shatter crowd frustration

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.170 
likely not to shatter crowd frustration
because<00:02:38.590> it's<00:02:39.220> just<00:02:39.340> not<00:02:39.640> good<00:02:39.910> for<00:02:40.090> your

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
because it's just not good for your

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.900 
because it's just not good for your
build<00:02:40.390> because<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:40.989> would<00:02:41.170> waste<00:02:41.410> clones

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
build because you would waste clones

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.789 
build because you would waste clones
then<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:43.060> we<00:02:43.209> have<00:02:43.390> mastered<00:02:44.170> manipulation

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
then you we have mastered manipulation

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.580 
then you we have mastered manipulation
because<00:02:45.160> we<00:02:45.519> have<00:02:45.700> blink<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:46.590> arcane

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
because we have blink and arcane

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
because we have blink and arcane
thievery<00:02:47.980> which<00:02:48.489> is<00:02:48.640> really<00:02:49.090> really<00:02:49.360> nice<00:02:49.540> and

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
thievery which is really really nice and

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.210 
thievery which is really really nice and
correspond<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.670> for<00:02:51.819> interruption<00:02:52.299> and

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
correspond to for interruption and

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.449 
correspond to for interruption and
chaotic<00:02:54.220> interruption<00:02:55.049> well<00:02:56.049> some<00:02:56.799> people

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
chaotic interruption well some people

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.100 
chaotic interruption well some people
have<00:02:57.579> told<00:02:57.790> me<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.120> kill<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.599> interruption

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
have told me to kill the interruption

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.589 
have told me to kill the interruption
sucks<00:02:59.590> because<00:03:00.090> sometimes<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.269> get<00:03:01.390> the

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
sucks because sometimes you get the

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.330 
sucks because sometimes you get the
immobilized<00:03:01.989> on<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.200> target<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:02.650> end<00:03:03.069> the

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
immobilized on the target and end the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:13.199 
immobilized on the target and end the
cripple<00:03:04.379> which<00:03:05.379> is<00:03:06.180> useless<00:03:07.860> but<00:03:12.209> sometimes

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
cripple which is useless but sometimes

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.619 
cripple which is useless but sometimes
you're<00:03:13.750> lucky<00:03:14.079> and<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.670> have<00:03:15.670> twenty<00:03:16.450> percent

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
you're lucky and you have twenty percent

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.780 
you're lucky and you have twenty percent
conditioned<00:03:17.140> duration<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.620> you<00:03:17.950> get<00:03:18.280> the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
conditioned duration and you get the

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.090 
conditioned duration and you get the
blind<00:03:19.180> for<00:03:19.450> example<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.019> immobilize<00:03:20.530> which

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
blind for example and immobilize which

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.770 
blind for example and immobilize which
is<00:03:21.280> like<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.519> same<00:03:21.940> as<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:23.079> stun<00:03:24.120> also<00:03:25.120> if<00:03:25.600> you

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
is like the same as a stun also if you

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.449 
is like the same as a stun also if you
have<00:03:25.930> to<00:03:26.079> chill<00:03:26.350> that<00:03:26.590> she'll<00:03:26.799> last<00:03:27.130> a<00:03:27.310> little

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
have to chill that she'll last a little

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.330 
have to chill that she'll last a little
bit<00:03:27.579> longer<00:03:27.790> as<00:03:28.560> far<00:03:29.560> as<00:03:29.590> I<00:03:29.799> have<00:03:29.920> tested<00:03:30.250> it

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
bit longer as far as I have tested it

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.629 
bit longer as far as I have tested it
and<00:03:30.549> then<00:03:31.480> it's<00:03:32.319> like<00:03:32.440> he<00:03:33.099> is<00:03:33.280> more<00:03:33.549> blessed

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
and then it's like he is more blessed

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.339 
and then it's like he is more blessed
and<00:03:34.000> then<00:03:34.090> he's<00:03:34.239> chilled<00:03:34.660> a<00:03:34.780> little<00:03:35.019> bit<00:03:35.139> so

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
and then he's chilled a little bit so

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.410 
and then he's chilled a little bit so
like<00:03:36.099> you<00:03:36.340> can't<00:03:36.370> move<00:03:36.760> which<00:03:37.030> is<00:03:37.180> awesome

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
like you can't move which is awesome

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.830 
like you can't move which is awesome
against<00:03:38.380> warriors<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:39.340> against<00:03:40.090> closet<00:03:40.630> have

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
have to get close to the target also why

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.259 
have to get close to the target also why
I<00:03:47.079> picked<00:03:47.349> this<00:03:47.500> one<00:03:47.739> is<00:03:47.980> because<00:03:48.370> you<00:03:49.000> just

duration<00:03:51.940> it's<00:03:52.120> ten<00:03:52.419> percent<00:03:52.780> poon<00:03:52.900> duration

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
duration it's ten percent poon duration

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.610 
duration it's ten percent poon duration
that's<00:03:53.440> so<00:03:53.980> awesome<00:03:54.130> it's<00:03:54.970> like<00:03:55.090> taking<00:03:55.450> um<00:03:55.900> I

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
that's so awesome it's like taking um I

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.199 
that's so awesome it's like taking um I
guess<00:03:57.480> this<00:03:58.480> signature<00:03:59.400> it's<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.549> Pacific

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209

guess this signature it's the Pacific
this<00:04:01.359> ten<00:04:01.630> percent<00:04:01.959> boon<00:04:02.139> duration<00:04:02.620> and<00:04:02.950> you

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
this ten percent boon duration and you

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.270 
this ten percent boon duration and you
you<00:04:03.760> just<00:04:04.000> get<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.239> with<00:04:04.419> this<00:04:04.720> that's<00:04:05.709> just<00:04:06.010> so

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
awesome and you will ck out the

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.920 
awesome and you will ck out the
interruptions<00:04:09.819> worth<00:04:10.209> taking<00:04:10.599> it<00:04:10.690> because

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
interruptions worth taking it because

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.509 
interruptions worth taking it because
sometimes<00:04:11.590> you<00:04:11.680> interrupt<00:04:12.010> somebody<00:04:12.310> or

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
sometimes you interrupt somebody or

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.129 
sometimes you interrupt somebody or
noxon<00:04:13.180> knock<00:04:13.359> somebody<00:04:13.660> down<00:04:13.780> with

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
noxon knock somebody down with

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.110 
noxon knock somebody down with
illusionary<00:04:14.950> wave<00:04:15.220> out<00:04:15.489> of<00:04:15.609> the<00:04:15.700> point<00:04:15.910> and

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
illusionary wave out of the point and

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.509 
illusionary wave out of the point and
then<00:04:16.450> he<00:04:16.539> gets<00:04:16.720> immobilized<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.410> then<00:04:18.400> you

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
then he gets immobilized and then you

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.300 
then he gets immobilized and then you
have<00:04:18.669> two<00:04:19.120> choices<00:04:19.150> he<00:04:19.889> first<00:04:20.889> of<00:04:21.010> all<00:04:21.130> you

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
have two choices he first of all you

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.459 
have two choices he first of all you
could<00:04:21.519> just<00:04:22.000> wait<00:04:22.479> and<00:04:22.810> D<00:04:23.020> keep<00:04:23.169> the<00:04:23.289> point

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:23.469 
could just wait and D keep the point

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:25.560 
could just wait and D keep the point
while<00:04:23.770> he's<00:04:23.890> mobilized<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:24.580> maybe<00:04:25.090> then<00:04:25.330> he's

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
while he's mobilized and maybe then he's

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.900 
while he's mobilized and maybe then he's
even<00:04:25.870> chilled<00:04:26.110> or

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
even chilled or

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.170 
even chilled or
or<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:28.840> just<00:04:29.220> when<00:04:30.220> he's<00:04:30.400> immobilized<00:04:31.090> you

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
or you just when he's immobilized you

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.600 
or you just when he's immobilized you
can<00:04:31.330> use<00:04:31.570> dis<00:04:32.080> immobilize<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:33.220> mobilizing

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
can use dis immobilize to mobilizing

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.560 
can use dis immobilize to mobilizing
again<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:35.670> to<00:04:36.670> bring<00:04:36.970> your<00:04:37.150> purse<00:04:37.330> in<00:04:37.540> the

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
again and to bring your purse in the

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.830 
again and to bring your purse in the
target<00:04:37.840> with<00:04:37.990> one<00:04:38.200> hundred<00:04:38.410> percent<00:04:38.730> so

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
target with one hundred percent so

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.810 
target with one hundred percent so
that's<00:04:40.840> I<00:04:41.230> think<00:04:41.320> that's<00:04:41.770> awesome<00:04:41.950> but<00:04:42.370> maybe

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
that's I think that's awesome but maybe

contraption<00:05:01.420> is<00:05:01.480> just<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:01.780> best<00:05:01.930> thing<00:05:02.110> you

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
contraption is just the best thing you

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.850 
contraption is just the best thing you

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
could take and i would definitely go 30

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.040 
could take and i would definitely go 30
here<00:05:06.310> because<00:05:06.850> you<00:05:07.000> need<00:05:07.180> to<00:05:07.210> boone<00:05:07.480> the<00:05:07.660> ocean

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
here because you need to boone the ocean

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.490 
here because you need to boone the ocean
on<00:05:08.200> on<00:05:08.940> your<00:05:09.940> might<00:05:10.240> stacks<00:05:10.600> because

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
on on your might stacks because

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.680 
on on your might stacks because
otherwise<00:05:11.770> it's<00:05:12.490> not<00:05:12.610> worth<00:05:12.760> spreading<00:05:13.270> down

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
otherwise it's not worth spreading down

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:20.190 
otherwise it's not worth spreading down
to<00:05:13.900> your<00:05:14.020> team<00:05:15.390> so<00:05:16.590> i'm<00:05:17.700> using<00:05:18.700> i<00:05:19.180> think<00:05:20.110> the

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
to your team so i'm using i think the

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.230 
to your team so i'm using i think the
same<00:05:20.380> utilities<00:05:20.950> and<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:22.780> same<00:05:23.730> ultimate<00:05:24.730> so

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
same utilities and the same ultimate so

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.880 
same utilities and the same ultimate so
there<00:05:25.960> will<00:05:26.080> be<00:05:26.110> everything<00:05:26.680> I<00:05:26.920> guess<00:05:27.220> and<00:05:28.890> if

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890
