start<00:02:00.119> up<00:02:00.860> but<00:02:01.860> hey<00:02:02.100> let's<00:02:02.310> get<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.520> boxes<00:02:02.820> out

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
start up but hey let's get the boxes out

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:28.479 
start up but hey let's get the boxes out
of<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.150> way<00:02:03.860> get<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:05.040> good<00:02:05.190> spot

wanted one for one with the HDMI port so
I<00:03:58.650> could<00:03:58.890> um<00:03:59.480> plug<00:04:00.480> well<00:04:00.690> got<00:04:00.959> don't<00:04:01.200> do<00:04:01.320> it

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
I could um plug well got don't do it

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.770
