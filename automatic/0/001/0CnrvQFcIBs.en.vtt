00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.780 
everything so let's check if our device
is<00:01:57.780> being<00:01:57.990> recognized<00:01:58.619> fastboot<00:01:59.189> devices

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
is being recognized fastboot devices

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.899 
is being recognized fastboot devices
yeah<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.570> detects<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.740> device<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.430> fastboot

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
yeah it detects one device and fastboot

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.999 
yeah it detects one device and fastboot
mode<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.390> that's<00:02:03.630> our<00:02:03.869> device<00:02:04.259> that's<00:02:04.680> good

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
mode so that's our device that's good

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.900 
mode so that's our device that's good
now<00:02:05.969> we<00:02:06.030> need<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.570> flash<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.530> recovery<00:02:08.069> we<00:02:08.700> do

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
now we need to flash the recovery we do

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.460 
now we need to flash the recovery we do
this<00:02:09.090> by<00:02:09.390> M<00:02:09.780> entering<00:02:10.849> fastboot

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
this by M entering fastboot

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.310 
this by M entering fastboot
flash<00:02:12.980> recovery<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.830> now<00:02:15.830> we<00:02:15.890> type<00:02:16.220> recovery

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
flash recovery and now we type recovery

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
because it's really cool that everything

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.020 
because it's really cool that everything
is<00:03:24.440> not<00:03:24.590> dancing<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.130> you<00:03:25.220> can<00:03:25.430> better<00:03:25.700> keep

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
track of what is being output down there

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.190 
track of what is being output down there

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
because sometimes it can be really

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.110 
because sometimes it can be really
important<00:03:30.709> if<00:03:30.860> you're<00:03:31.489> testing<00:03:31.940> some

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
important if you're testing some

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.940 
important if you're testing some
flashable<00:03:32.630> zip<00:03:32.660> sore<00:03:33.019> something<00:03:33.350> like<00:03:33.560> that

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
flashable zip sore something like that

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.670 
flashable zip sore something like that
so<00:03:34.550> that<00:03:35.150> was<00:03:35.300> just<00:03:35.660> my<00:03:35.840> quick<00:03:36.080> video<00:03:36.410> on<00:03:36.470> how

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
so that was just my quick video on how

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.580
