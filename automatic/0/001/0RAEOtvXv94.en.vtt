dang I thought that was gonna be easier
than<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:20.990> looked<00:02:23.560> I'm<00:02:24.560> not<00:02:24.680> one<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:24.890> those

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
than it looked I'm not one of those

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.250 
than it looked I'm not one of those
YouTube<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.550> that<00:02:25.730> just<00:02:25.940> like<00:02:26.000> gets<00:02:26.840> rid<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.140> a

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
YouTube is that just like gets rid of a

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.620 
YouTube is that just like gets rid of a
video<00:02:27.590> if<00:02:27.830> I<00:02:27.920> lose<00:02:28.310> or<00:02:29.120> something<00:02:29.450> like<00:02:29.570> that

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
video if I lose or something like that

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.170 
video if I lose or something like that
cuz<00:02:30.620> that's<00:02:30.710> just<00:02:30.950> like<00:02:31.130> dumb<00:02:31.400> then<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.150> looks

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
cuz that's just like dumb then it looks

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.010 
cuz that's just like dumb then it looks
like<00:02:32.450> there's<00:02:32.630> experts<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.620> they<00:02:33.680> never<00:02:33.860> lose

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
like there's experts and they never lose

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.560 
like there's experts and they never lose
so<00:02:36.520> it's<00:02:37.520> probably<00:02:37.760> going<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.030> be<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.210> video

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
so it's probably going to be the video

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.540 
so it's probably going to be the video
