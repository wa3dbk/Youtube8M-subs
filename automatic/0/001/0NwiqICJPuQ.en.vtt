00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.940
 toyota etios started to be sold on 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.580
 Brazil at the end of last year and toyota 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.450
 he bet all his chips in that 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.490
 model 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.279
 so much has begun to produce the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.260
 hatch and the sedan at the same time both with 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.350
 1.3 or 1.5 motor 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.830
 arrived with salty prices over 30 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:32.000
 thousand reais to version 1.3 from 33 thousand 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:35.360
 and is a 50 most expensive point yet 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.640
 and look now in 2013 is already being 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.780
 sold for 30 thousand reais but why 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:46.129
 this discount is that edson liked 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.840
 is a car made in the Indian market in 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.449
 an Indian market do not have the same 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.010
 costs in the Brazilian market between 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.510
 Brazilian market does not have the same 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.390
 Indian tastes 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.830
 So the car did not please you. 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.170
 inside the car it has a panel 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.610
 horrible speed marker 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.470
 when we are in the center of the panel 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.560
 an ugly panel 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.960
 finally the finish also a wedding 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.560
 very mean 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.090
 the car to the back of the car strange 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.460
 to chip away 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.680
 the only good thing I can say the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.940
 ex is the mechanics had a mechanic to 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.740
 durable toyota 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.259
 although only time will really tell if 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.640
 she'll be as durable as corolla 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.040
 huh 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.860
 but taking out the mechanics and have another 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.640
 positive point he took four stars 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.970
 latin america that the collision test is 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.340
 one of the only popular networks we will 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.790
 say so he took four stars in the 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.280
 Brazil 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.400
 then a positive point of it and your 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.920
 mechanics and safety in parts is because 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.230
 he does not have berg laterally curtain 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.480
 nobody found stability but in the 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:05.220
 brazil car no popular thats it 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:08.369
 offers this kind of thing but toyota 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.220
 is now running after injury 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.640
 It's with more aggressive TV commercials. 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.980
 hired a band to make music 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.590
 trying to do everything by car plate 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.110
 then the car does not start and one of the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.180
 reasons for the car to take off and that 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.550
 the competition along with it 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.340
 hyundai has just released 20 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.280
 along with edson and I think promises now 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.490
 also launched the onyx 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.260
 the competition gave a 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.580
 toro leg and toyota is now trying 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.040
 to run after injury 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.080
 Let's see if she can do it with the 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.800
 marketing draws attention to this 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.130
 car 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.840
 the question is why toyota brought wets 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:57.930
 an Indian car Brazil and not the Yaris 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.120
 yaris is a car made european market o 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.160
 Brazilian was already getting used to the 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.440
 European taste as our automakers 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.140
 the big four always brought models 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.930
 European teams with the Brazilian already 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.460
 getting used to this design with this 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.160
 kind of 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.870
 market that this market likes 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.840
 So why did not Toyota bring the 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.130
 yaris because she decided to bring edson 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.860
 It's obvious, right? 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.700
 the cost is ethos gives much more margin 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.160
 of toyota profit all that the yaris 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.110
 would bring a car made to the country of 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.760
 third world and areas is done with 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.660
 first world country 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.520
 then and areas toyota sold thousands 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.280
 more or less the same price a little 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.120
 more expensive and would not have a margin of 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.790
 profit as great as the athletic is but 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.110
 now the toyota is correct have to 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.410
 behind the prejudice that the 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.490
 Brazilian did not like the car and the car. 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.860
 fm 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.860
 so this is personal until the next video
