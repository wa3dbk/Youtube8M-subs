00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.469

about<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.619> victory<00:01:29.130> getting<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> victory<00:01:30.390> I

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
about the victory getting a victory I

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.749 
about the victory getting a victory I
think<00:01:30.930> should<00:01:31.170> still<00:01:31.470> count<00:01:31.740> as<00:01:31.979> one<00:01:32.430> upgrade

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
think should still count as one upgrade

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.760 
think should still count as one upgrade
just<00:01:33.360> because<00:01:33.750> there<00:01:33.960> may<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.140> games<00:01:34.530> where

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
just because there may be games where

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.890 
just because there may be games where
Ronaldo<00:01:35.280> kind<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.610> falls<00:01:35.790> apart<00:01:35.939> but<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.750> rest

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
Ronaldo kind of falls apart but the rest

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.569 
Ronaldo kind of falls apart but the rest
of<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> team<00:01:37.439> carries<00:01:37.799> them<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.070> gets<00:01:38.250> us<00:01:38.400> win

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
of the team carries them and gets us win

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.280 
of the team carries them and gets us win
so<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:39.000> Ronaldo<00:01:39.479> had<00:01:39.630> nothing<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.049> do<00:01:40.140> with

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
so here Ronaldo had nothing to do with

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.630 
so here Ronaldo had nothing to do with
it<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.680> let<00:01:40.829> me<00:01:40.860> know<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.159> comments<00:01:41.549> below
