00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.660
 Red 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.600
 that red sign is that they can use it 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.830
 for the mission and already when the terminal 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.590

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.470
 what we are 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:42.210
 I will teach you how that reflection some 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:45.150
 videos says that 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.750
 they say a lot of things but sometimes they do not say 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:53.150
 what should be done 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:57.290
 in a normal way with whoever wants and 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:01.120
 look then your partner should not be 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.650
 in standing must be 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.129
 the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.390
 not very weak in normal or whatever they want 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.170
 I leave it in normal 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.110
 and good 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.910
 here they are going to choose a vegueta that goes to 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.250
 be with which they are going to do the merger 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.250
 also the ramrod choose the same 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:33.220

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.030
 I will explain to you how to do the 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.660
 merge with these two characters good 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.330
 there is a first requirement to do the 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.870
 merge with these two with these 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.120
 characters is that they must have at 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.940
 unlocked character 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.000
 to which they are going to do the fusion of laces 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.510
 bellido 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.460
 here merger disappears pose with beauty 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.460
 as it accompanies the street merges 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:08.610
 must do 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.610
 what's that 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:20.400
 well they must have all the 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.400
 they must have many bars here 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.939
 here they must have 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:35.059
 all the bars as they appear here or 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:38.900
 just the yellow ones and look they're going to tighten 

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:41.610
 from above and select and here it appeared 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:46.039

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.039
 who said whatever 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:58.470
 and to make shoelaces should have 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:05:00.240
 also the bars see the bars 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.800
 They must have them but only go to 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.800

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:14.479
 and the character of those who are going to do the 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.479
 fusion 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.820
 and since this one comes out, they can already 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:22.300
