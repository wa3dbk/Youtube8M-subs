library gap so what we do is twice a
week<00:01:04.570> we<00:01:05.080> pick<00:01:05.290> we'll<00:01:05.770> show<00:01:05.920> you<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.070> machines

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
week we pick we'll show you the machines

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.730 
week we pick we'll show you the machines
that<00:01:06.520> we<00:01:06.640> have<00:01:06.760> our<00:01:07.479> options<00:01:07.990> we<00:01:08.200> take<00:01:08.410> three

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
that we have our options we take three

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.950 
that we have our options we take three
of<00:01:08.830> those<00:01:09.010> and<00:01:09.369> be<00:01:09.850> three<00:01:10.180> there's<00:01:10.570> a<00:01:10.630> reason

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
of those and be three there's a reason

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.140 
of those and be three there's a reason
yeah<00:01:11.140> yeah<00:01:11.380> yeah<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:11.710> then<00:01:11.830> we<00:01:11.950> do<00:01:12.100> five<00:01:12.850> sets

had to explain it and we utilize the

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.110 
had to explain it and we utilize the
inclined<00:01:44.740> leg<00:01:45.040> press<00:01:45.310> for<00:01:46.120> casts<00:01:46.630> like<00:01:47.140> we<00:01:48.120> we

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
inclined leg press for casts like we we

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.790 
inclined leg press for casts like we we
sit<00:01:49.570> here<00:01:49.750> and<00:01:49.960> then<00:01:50.050> we<00:01:50.140> put<00:01:50.290> our<00:01:50.380> feet<00:01:50.590> there

sit here and then we put our feet there
and<00:01:51.370> we<00:01:51.520> just<00:01:51.700> do<00:01:51.790> calf<00:01:52.000> raises<00:01:52.150> that<00:01:52.540> way<00:01:52.720> it's

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
and we just do calf raises that way it's

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.960 
and we just do calf raises that way it's
almost<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.440> same<00:01:53.650> as<00:01:53.710> this<00:01:54.310> machine<00:01:54.610> right

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
almost the same as this machine right

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.070 
almost the same as this machine right
here<00:01:55.360> just<00:01:55.990> kind<00:01:56.470> of<00:01:56.560> upside<00:01:57.070> down<00:01:57.510> exactly<00:01:58.510> we

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
here just kind of upside down exactly we

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.399 
here just kind of upside down exactly we
have<00:01:59.250> an<00:02:00.250> a'<00:02:00.310> calf<00:02:00.640> raises<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.570> then<00:02:02.020> we<00:02:02.229> have

have an a' calf raises and then we have

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.950 
have an a' calf raises and then we have
a<00:02:02.710> donkey<00:02:03.520> calf<00:02:03.729> raise<00:02:03.970> machine<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:04.630> get<00:02:04.870> in

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
ridiculous but it's a different machine

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.650

than probably you have a normal gym and
Manda's<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.320> switch<00:02:23.590> up<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.830> workout<00:02:24.190> which

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
Manda's a switch up the workout which

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.920 
shocks the calves
exactly<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:26.880> we'll<00:02:27.880> record<00:02:28.269> a<00:02:28.420> few<00:02:28.600> sets<00:02:28.840> of

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
exactly so we'll record a few sets of

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.050 
exactly so we'll record a few sets of
this<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.410> it's<00:02:29.769> a<00:02:29.920> giant<00:02:30.130> set<00:02:30.519> so<00:02:30.700> we<00:02:30.790> just<00:02:30.970> go

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
this and it's a giant set so we just go

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.460 
this and it's a giant set so we just go
from<00:02:31.239> one<00:02:31.420> thing<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.780> next<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.230> net

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470
