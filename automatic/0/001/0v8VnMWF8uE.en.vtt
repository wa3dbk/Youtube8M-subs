00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.609 
recommend grinding it up as your mortar
and<00:01:28.619> pestle<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.570> lot<00:01:31.200> finer

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
and pestle just so that it's a lot finer

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.280 
and pestle just so that it's a lot finer
and<00:01:31.979> easier<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.880> dissolve<00:01:33.210> when<00:01:34.170> you're

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
and easier to dissolve when you're

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.770 
and easier to dissolve when you're
making<00:01:34.470> your<00:01:34.680> home<00:01:34.829> water<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:38.000> this<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.270> rose

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
making your home water and this is rose

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.080

water

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.139 

and<00:01:43.180> again<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:45.040> would<00:01:45.189> cleanse<00:01:45.729> it<00:01:45.909> of<00:01:46.000> all

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
and again you would cleanse it of all

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.630 
and again you would cleanse it of all
previous<00:01:46.390> energies<00:01:47.079> and<00:01:47.530> power<00:01:47.799> it<00:01:48.130> with<00:01:48.399> your

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
previous energies and power it with your

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.810 
previous energies and power it with your
intention<00:01:49.149> of<00:01:49.390> creating<00:01:49.659> holy<00:01:50.079> water<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:53.820> but

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
intention of creating holy water so but

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.429 
intention of creating holy water so but
because<00:01:54.939> I'm<00:01:55.390> making<00:01:55.750> a<00:01:55.840> smaller<00:01:56.110> version

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
because I'm making a smaller version

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:57.960 
because I'm making a smaller version
we're<00:01:56.860> just<00:01:57.039> kind<00:01:57.250> of<00:01:57.310> going<00:01:57.490> to<00:01:57.579> scale<00:01:57.939> it

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
we're just kind of going to scale it

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.669 
we're just kind of going to scale it
down<00:01:58.149> a<00:01:58.630> bit<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:01.149> what<00:02:01.330> I<00:02:01.360> would<00:02:01.630> do<00:02:01.840> is<00:02:02.140> I<00:02:02.560> would

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
down a bit so what I would do is I would

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.029 
down a bit so what I would do is I would
take<00:02:03.610> my<00:02:03.820> full<00:02:04.060> moon<00:02:04.299> water<00:02:04.509> or<00:02:05.229> whatever

to<00:02:17.080> make<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.470> little<00:02:17.590> simplified<00:02:18.160> version<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:21.850> I

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
to make a little simplified version so I

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.210 
to make a little simplified version so I
fill<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.600> up<00:02:22.690> about<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:24.760> know<00:02:24.910> maybe

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
fill it up about you know maybe

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:36.500 
fill it up about you know maybe
two-thirds<00:02:27.220> of<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.430> way

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.809 

and<00:02:36.959> again<00:02:37.349> you<00:02:37.620> know<00:02:37.739> like<00:02:37.769> visualize<00:02:38.519> when

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
and again you know like visualize when

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.880 
and again you know like visualize when
your<00:02:39.030> eclairs<00:02:39.989> ended<00:02:40.349> of<00:02:40.470> all<00:02:40.590> previous

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
your eclairs ended of all previous

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.570 
your eclairs ended of all previous
negative<00:02:41.790> energies<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.360> whatnot<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:43.290> know

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
negative energies and whatnot you know

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.610 
negative energies and whatnot you know
visualize<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:44.970> being<00:02:45.299> you<00:02:45.900> know<00:02:46.019> encompassed

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
visualize it being you know encompassed

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.860 
visualize it being you know encompassed
and<00:02:46.799> surrounded<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.519> penetrated<00:02:48.150> by<00:02:48.299> a<00:02:48.330> white

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
and surrounded and penetrated by a white

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.490 
and surrounded and penetrated by a white
light<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:50.000> all<00:02:51.000> negativity<00:02:51.599> you<00:02:52.140> know

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
light and all negativity you know

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.440 
light and all negativity you know
dissipating<00:02:53.280> from<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.849> whatnot

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
dissipating from it and whatnot

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.940 
dissipating from it and whatnot
so<00:02:55.819> say<00:02:56.819> you've<00:02:57.030> already<00:02:57.180> done<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.950> you've

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
so say you've already done that you've

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.280 
so say you've already done that you've
already<00:02:59.209> created<00:03:00.209> your<00:03:00.540> jar<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.049> cleanse

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
already created your jar and cleanse

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.350 
already created your jar and cleanse
your<00:03:01.530> jar<00:03:01.739> and<00:03:02.430> pour<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.879> water<00:03:03.090> into<00:03:03.269> your

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
your jar and pour the water into your

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:10.460 
your jar and pour the water into your
jar<00:03:04.519> then<00:03:05.519> I<00:03:06.260> would<00:03:07.260> add<00:03:09.079> again<00:03:10.079> like<00:03:10.440> a

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
jar then I would add again like a

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.520 
jar then I would add again like a
teaspoon<00:03:11.069> of<00:03:11.489> sea<00:03:12.180> salt<00:03:12.209> but<00:03:12.720> we're<00:03:13.230> scaling

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
teaspoon of sea salt but we're scaling

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.199 
teaspoon of sea salt but we're scaling
this<00:03:13.799> down<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:14.220> I'm<00:03:14.280> just<00:03:14.430> going<00:03:14.579> to<00:03:14.760> run<00:03:14.910> three

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
this down so I'm just going to run three

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:23.100 
this down so I'm just going to run three
pinches<00:03:15.450> okay

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.020 

three

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.450 

and<00:03:27.540> then<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:28.110> would<00:03:28.380> add<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:30.080> teaspoon<00:03:31.080> of

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
and then I would add a teaspoon of

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.900 
and then I would add a teaspoon of
rosewater<00:03:33.350> but<00:03:34.350> we're<00:03:34.680> scaling<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.310> down<00:03:35.340> so

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
rosewater but we're scaling it down so

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.850 
rosewater but we're scaling it down so
I'm<00:03:36.030> just<00:03:36.150> going<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.420> add<00:03:36.630> maybe<00:03:37.110> about<00:03:37.350> half<00:03:37.710> a

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
I'm just going to add maybe about half a

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:54.220 
I'm just going to add maybe about half a
capful<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:41.430> that

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.500 

I<00:03:54.260> would<00:03:54.920> then<00:03:55.360> empower<00:03:56.360> this<00:03:58.209> holy<00:03:59.209> water

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
I would then empower this holy water

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.220 
I would then empower this holy water
dedicated<00:04:00.380> to<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.650> gods<00:04:01.660> asked<00:04:02.660> divinity<00:04:03.200> to

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
dedicated to the gods asked divinity to

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.130 
dedicated to the gods asked divinity to
bless<00:04:04.010> it<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:04.310> then<00:04:04.670> power<00:04:04.940> it<00:04:05.180> with<00:04:05.390> its

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
bless it and then power it with its

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.089 
bless it and then power it with its
energy<00:04:06.650> and<00:04:08.020> you<00:04:09.020> know<00:04:09.050> to<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.739> Stoics

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
energy and you know to the Stoics

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.360 
energy and you know to the Stoics
blessings<00:04:10.520> upon<00:04:10.640> the<00:04:10.940> water<00:04:11.180> and<00:04:12.100> then<00:04:13.100> it

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
blessings upon the water and then it

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.870 
blessings upon the water and then it
would<00:04:13.580> be<00:04:13.610> ready<00:04:14.330> for<00:04:14.690> use<00:04:15.470> so<00:04:16.459> that's<00:04:16.700> pretty

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
would be ready for use so that's pretty

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.909 
would be ready for use so that's pretty
much<00:04:17.169> how<00:04:18.169> you<00:04:18.200> make<00:04:18.500> it

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
much how you make it

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.420 
much how you make it
label<00:04:19.760> and<00:04:19.910> date<00:04:20.090> it<00:04:20.299> so<00:04:21.169> you<00:04:21.230> know<00:04:22.100> what<00:04:22.280> it<00:04:22.370> is

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
label and date it so you know what it is

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.240 
label and date it so you know what it is
and<00:04:22.820> when<00:04:22.970> you<00:04:23.000> made<00:04:23.240> it<00:04:23.419> and<00:04:23.540> what<00:04:23.660> not<00:04:24.250> it's

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
and when you made it and what not it's

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.159 
and when you made it and what not it's
really<00:04:25.700> very<00:04:26.389> simple

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
really very simple

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.010 
really very simple
it<00:04:27.470> normally<00:04:28.190> obviously<00:04:29.180> takes<00:04:29.479> longer<00:04:29.990> than

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
it normally obviously takes longer than

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.719 
it normally obviously takes longer than
just<00:04:30.470> a<00:04:30.560> couple<00:04:30.800> minutes<00:04:31.040> I've<00:04:31.400> what<00:04:31.610> I've

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
just a couple minutes I've what I've

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.629 
just a couple minutes I've what I've
shown<00:04:31.970> on<00:04:32.240> here<00:04:32.270> because<00:04:33.169> I<00:04:33.200> mean<00:04:33.560> you<00:04:34.400> gotta

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.130 
that's fine I always go in a little bit
of<00:05:10.100> rose<00:05:10.220> water<00:05:10.460> so<00:05:10.910> that's<00:05:11.840> just<00:05:11.960> my

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
of rose water so that's just my

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.370 
of rose water so that's just my
preference<00:05:13.630> experiment<00:05:14.630> find<00:05:15.110> out<00:05:15.229> what

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
preference experiment find out what

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.650 
preference experiment find out what
works<00:05:15.560> for<00:05:15.680> you<00:05:15.800> and<00:05:16.220> take<00:05:17.030> it<00:05:17.150> from<00:05:17.270> there

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
works for you and take it from there

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.600 
works for you and take it from there
so<00:05:18.350> that<00:05:18.590> that's<00:05:18.770> pretty<00:05:18.979> much<00:05:19.100> it<00:05:19.370> some

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
so that that's pretty much it some

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.090 
so that that's pretty much it some
people<00:05:19.970> well<00:05:20.240> then<00:05:20.510> once<00:05:21.440> they<00:05:21.620> make<00:05:21.830> it<00:05:21.860> they

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
people well then once they make it they

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.380 
people well then once they make it they
might<00:05:22.250> leave<00:05:22.460> it<00:05:22.580> on<00:05:22.669> their<00:05:22.880> altar<00:05:23.030> to<00:05:23.360> the

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
might leave it on their altar to the

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.650 
might leave it on their altar to the
power<00:05:23.660> for<00:05:23.990> a<00:05:24.020> while<00:05:24.289> and<00:05:25.150> you<00:05:26.150> know<00:05:26.180> just<00:05:26.510> to

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
power for a while and you know just to

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.300 
power for a while and you know just to
let<00:05:26.840> it<00:05:27.100> they<00:05:28.100> have<00:05:28.250> steep<00:05:28.640> if<00:05:29.060> you<00:05:29.240> will<00:05:29.419> and

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
let it they have steep if you will and

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.590 
let it they have steep if you will and
yeah<00:05:31.310> but<00:05:31.610> it's<00:05:31.729> really<00:05:32.030> important<00:05:32.450> of<00:05:32.570> course

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
yeah but it's really important of course

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.550 
with its energy and with its protection
and<00:05:43.910> that<00:05:44.780> type<00:05:44.990> of<00:05:45.020> thing<00:05:45.320> so<00:05:47.200> there<00:05:48.200> you<00:05:48.380> go

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
and that type of thing so there you go

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.190

and I'm a strong believer and choosing

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.570 
and I'm a strong believer and choosing
your<00:05:51.380> own<00:05:51.530> words<00:05:51.830> you<00:05:52.820> know

your own words you know

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.180 
your own words you know
I've<00:05:55.580> always<00:05:55.759> said<00:05:56.120> I'll<00:05:56.360> never<00:05:56.600> ever<00:05:56.780> tell

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190

I've always said I'll never ever tell
anybody<00:05:58.930> how<00:05:59.930> to<00:05:59.990> pray<00:06:00.290> or<00:06:00.710> you<00:06:01.130> know<00:06:01.250> that

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
anybody how to pray or you know that

anybody how to pray or you know that
type<00:06:01.490> of<00:06:01.699> thing<00:06:01.820> I<00:06:02.090> think<00:06:02.509> that's<00:06:03.169> when<00:06:03.410> the

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
type of thing I think that's when the

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.180 
type of thing I think that's when the
onus<00:06:03.860> is<00:06:03.979> on<00:06:04.039> you<00:06:04.370> to<00:06:04.840> find<00:06:05.840> what<00:06:06.050> words<00:06:06.259> work

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
onus is on you to find what words work

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.050 
onus is on you to find what words work
for<00:06:07.460> you<00:06:07.580> and<00:06:08.680> yeah<00:06:09.680> so<00:06:10.280> that's<00:06:10.460> pretty<00:06:10.940> much

for you and yeah so that's pretty much
it<00:06:11.210> it's<00:06:11.840> pretty<00:06:12.440> simple<00:06:13.690> it<00:06:14.690> does<00:06:15.110> take<00:06:15.440> more

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
it it's pretty simple it does take more

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.129 
it it's pretty simple it does take more
time<00:06:15.889> than<00:06:15.949> this<00:06:16.280> like<00:06:16.550> I<00:06:16.669> said<00:06:16.699> before<00:06:17.090> I<00:06:17.600> like
