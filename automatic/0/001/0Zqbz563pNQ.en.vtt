00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Hello America 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 I am Pat Conel, and I am your friend 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Because I live in the UK and our two countries have a lot in common 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Far from the fact that everyone on this planet dislikes our courage 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 We speak the same language, we share the same culture, one way or the other 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 We worship the same God 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 One god, a conceited God, a god of fool 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 And his revenge is terrible to realize, especially if we have a relationship with him 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Praise the Lord 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Your president is a born Christian again, with the same feeling that Dracula was born again after he rose from the grave 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Or was it Jesus? 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Are we the ones who drink blood, who drinks our blood? I have always wondered 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Our prime minister is also a Christian, but I am not sure he was born again 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 In fact many people in my country are regretting that he was born from the ground up 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 But you have a special kind of Christianity in America that is unique and very creative 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 In it does not match and not at all similar to the message of the Prophet supposed to be informed 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 It is in fact a violation of every word he utters, without exception 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 So, if everything else, America, shows courage on your part 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 In Britain we have an accredited church, which means we are officially a Christian country 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 But, like you, we do not differentiate. We will sell all weapons 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 We do not really care about any mischief used for it 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Praise the Lord 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Because the Lord is beside us, we both know that when our country did evil 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 It is the evil of good, as opposed to the evil of evil 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 We know that the evil of good always prevails evil evil 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Except when evil is evil in a place that masquerades as good beings 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 He becomes a new baby. Then you have a whole new game 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 And your boss plays this game with distinction. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 We all know its history 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 We know how he was a useless drug addict, drunk driving, the spoiled boy of his rich father 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Until the day came, after talking to Billy Graham, he had seen a revelation 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 He was chosen by the Lord, to become a dangerous and hallucinatory fanatic 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 He was quick to catch up with the Texas government and finally found that he had a talent for something 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Signature of death warrants, thank God 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 From that time on, it was only a short step for George W. the Lionheart, the president of the Christian kingdom 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Because they say he has a lot of knowledge, your boss 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 This does not mean that he is supported by a strong public base - nothing so evil 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 It simply means that he has many corrupt and powerful friends 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Who will not stop for something in their way 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 With his own permission, he invaded Iraq because of one of his friends 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 And the name of the Lord, he referred to it. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Now I will not try and tell you that your boss George Dilibu Bush is crazy 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Because the way I see it should not be crazy if you're George W. Bush 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 If you are mocking, closed horizons, vile, new born, hypocritical and your hand is the Bible 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 So frankly, you're basically carrying trump cards, and you do not need any other papers 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Moreover, he is skillfully assisted in his efforts by our mad Christian Prime Minister 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 Another man and his hands are blood 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 He did not get the blood from the screws he had stitched on 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 Although I'm sure his media office wants us to believe it 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 We all know he participated in the invasion of Iraq 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 Because he felt the "hand of history" on his genital organs 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 And because he wants a cowboy hat 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 His way of walking when he is with Bush, as if on their way to the OK Corral 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Or any other abnormal club 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 But it is clear that some people in Iraq, inexplicably 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 They do not really want the freedom and democracy imposed on them from abroad 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 It is only to prove the truth in the old saying, America, that you can lead the horse to the water 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 But you can not force him to suck your penis 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 But do not worry, because we are here, and we love you, yes we love you 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 Let me just say that we do not feel at all that we are being exploited or delineated by you, America 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Well, maybe we feel a bit. In fact, maybe a little more 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 But it is worth the effort because of the privilege associated with you 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 Even if you insist on taking our fingerprints 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 Before you let us enter your country 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Because frankly, America, you saved our banner 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Without you, we would not be the developed country in which we are today in the world 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 With our loss of the empire, we were ready to throw away at the ends of history, and forget 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 But now, thanks to you, and thanks to your glorious mission of the Lord 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 We find that until now we have a role to play in the world 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 Nose our noses in places not desired by us 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 Stealing and draining all the precious resources that our greedy hands can get 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 He kicked the brown people, the way Jesus would have wanted them 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 So thanks for that, America 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 I can not tell you how much this makes me proud 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 I really, really can not 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 But it is the nature of man to live in hope 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 If I'm just invited to say in conclusion, America 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 As a friend to another 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 Improve you very soon 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 We all pray for you 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Peace
