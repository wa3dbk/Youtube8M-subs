00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 Hi everyone! Are you okay? Good morning, I 'm ... 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.490
 here again cocoa Thursday 9 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.110
 in the morning I'm going out to do 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.730
 Buy a grocery store, okay? 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.859
 I decided to turn the camera on and show it to 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.109
 You how I'm dressed since I 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.939
 I'm wearing the shirt I had 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.240
 last video of understanding where I 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.580
 I've shown that I love colors and 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.920
 I was going to give her some scissors 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.900
 give a change in the model that was well 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.059
 basicão're not going then I spoke 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.790
 show me how it was I thought 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.129
 It looks cute, people look at just a t-shirt. 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.620
 which was a basic tee shirt ended up 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.250
 becoming a much more wearable sweater 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.950
 most used on several other occasions 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.780
 basic, I took her little ball here 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.270
 which was a normal ball and ends up 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.850
 turning into a canoe collar I guess 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.160
 that's how it speaks canola collar is like this 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.829
 she's a child 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.170
 this opening broke the shoulder that 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.910
 As we walk, it ends up falling. 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.850
 here in the broad that is something that I 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.220
 I love to wear it in the summer, so I'm 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.930
 dressed with it that was thus in the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:17.040
 front and so behind I cut and 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.770
 I created some strips with the fabric itself 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.150
 grow in some strips that after 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.340
 we cut we give a stretched 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.100
 so they wind up naturally are 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.530
 so it was very cute luke me 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.630
 I thought it was good to show you 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.700
 I'm wearing those zara white pants that 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.890
 looks like a rubbery fabric 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.439
 I do not know what that material calls. 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.619
 all in this little toe sandal 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:45.960
 bahia many years ago from my sister 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:49.380
 I see my sister, my dear, I'm with 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.439
 accessory a very cheap watch from 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.720
 8 euros from the Italian queue this college 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.159
 the defense is already mid-afternoon 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.880
 I will not be able to use any more soon 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.420
 because it's starting yellow 39 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.009
 francs right 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.810
 but it's my fault that I should have 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.069
 perfume on top of it 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.890
 I'm going to wear this golden aib sunglasses 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.660
 which is my favorite brand of sunglasses and 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.850
 that fits in my pocket right because in favor 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.490
 and 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.460
 My mother does not fit in my pocket. 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:22.840
 I love it, the day is beautiful there. 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:25.750
 It's been a beautiful day out, and I'm happy because 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.110
 It's going to be sunny, it only promises the weekend. 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.110
 The whole bag that I'm going to use here 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.720
 that may seem to you a bundle 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.490
 but she is not a poche she does not have 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.010
 no lock to open here by 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:45.100
 waist a purse even though I use it 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.990
 I can cross it here in the neck 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.120
 I usually use this girl when I 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.860
 I'm going to travel so I 'm sure 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.340
 that my documents and my money are 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.500
 safe here with me but if not i use 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.550

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.390
 I usually hope you have 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:04.300

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.490
 to shop at the supermarket that I 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.980
 wanted to show because the shirt had 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:12.400
 Are you going to ask me for cocoa? 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:17.740

 It is a beautiful honor. It is very well lit. 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.880

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.610
 did not know how to use 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.740
 Then I learned that lipsticks so much. 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.440
 on hymn says 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:37.540
 they ask or they almost require a skin 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.940
 minimally prepared to use because 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.700
 otherwise it looks strange and I have 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.770
