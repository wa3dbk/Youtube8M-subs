00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.730
 well today we will analyze 20 in this case 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.420
 we talk about the sport hd 2 although here not 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.950
 it puts it is a printing defect of 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.619
 a series of concrete models but this 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.919
 is the hd 2 is a pretty camera 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.910
 powerful which good among other things 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:27.710
 has features like a zoom 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.189
 custom which not all 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.710
 cameras comes as well as two and a half hours 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.899
 recording with the monitor on 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.070
 because it comes with lcd screen like three 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.739
 hours with the monitor off 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.060
 also allows you to leave it ready and 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.100
 when it detects movement, it 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.120
 record and then another of the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.420
 characteristics that most calls the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.070
 attention of this camera is that it can 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.329
 record in loop about itself with what 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.910
 which you record all day 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.350
 waiting for a bite and nothing happens 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.080
 when it reaches the end of the card 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.629
 start to record on itself 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:04.980
 so it's a big advantage the camera is 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.840
 sees very powerful very hard and resistant 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.560
 It is made with a very special plastic 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.400
 and has large buttons which allows 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.530
 even with gloves for 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.600
 divers can access all their 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.600
 buttons directly correct way 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.220
 let's see what the box shows 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.080
 we leave behind 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.320
 a cedÃ© 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.770
 this is to take her 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.770
 and a pair of cables a cable 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.830
 and a cable 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.439
 good 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.280
 here they bring us all 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.719
 its complements is one of the houses that 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.759
 more add-ons right now in the 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.070
 market and all of them very economical 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.340
 then we will see some of them but they are 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:09.490
 very practical accessories 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.670
 that can be found on their website 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.610
 and here we find a quick access 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.980
 a movement guide in which we see 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.630
 how to operate each of the buttons and 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.050
 what is it used for between all of us? 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.069
 something better 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:29.090
 well the camera has 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.780
 engraved in the plastic what it is 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.780
 each of the buttons 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.660
 according to this first is the button 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.400
 that lights the second is the button that 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.569
 shoot and here we have to zoom in 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.780
 sound ok mode and menu with which then 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.780
 good 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.080
 we can move within the different 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.080
 fields that the camera has 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:01.400
 is one of the most powerful cameras that 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:05.200
 there is in terms of capacity 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:08.200
 use by the user quality 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.849
 motion detection resolution 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.110
 duration of the video playback of 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.650
 video 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.650
 turn 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.060
 mute digital effect and we can give 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.500
 effects at the time of recording we can 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.110
 record even in sepia or white and 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.040
 black to scene mode frequency 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.600
 sharp contrast and soft for more or less 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.520
 light this is very important for down 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.560
 of water white balance by itself 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.740
 we have a light tungsten a light 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.590
 too much red too cold value of 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.920
 exposure mode of measurement quality 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.590
 resolution in order is a camera with a 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.930
 spectacular amount of possibilities 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.600
 then if we open it that has this button 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.310
 which is strong but has an area 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.989
 quite comfortable to be able to lose 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.550
 finger you do not have nails things in 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.740
 other cameras does not exist 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.420
 and here inside we already have the output of 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.610
 tve 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.130
 we have the usb 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.740
 we have the card for the micro sd 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.150
 then we have a hole for the reset 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.830
 and then the buttons directly 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.990
 accessible by hand if we wanted this 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.910
 box is completely 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.800
 sealed with the camera with which the 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.700
 camera can not be taken out of the box 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.030
 it is something that must be taken into account 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.680
 simply to know what is right comes 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.570
 with a flat lens which is going to do it 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.250
 very practical to be able to wash under 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.560
 Water 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.830
 and now we will see its comparison with the 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.830
 others 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.650
 if we compare it with other cameras 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:42.869
 we'll see what good in front of the area 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.869
 more or less their size difference 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.240
 if we compare it with the mixture 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.240
 the x 13 400 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.710
 we see that optics more or less go 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.710
 equal in space 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.449
 if we compare it with the go profile 3 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.469
 plus 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.469
 we see what is your difference 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.350
 it's a little bit smaller 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.529
 then pro 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.119
 but nevertheless 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:23.119
 neither is it outrageous 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.409
 for example this is a piece to be able 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.039
 to put on 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:31.039
 on the chest 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.890
 and that has the advantage of using 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.460
 a pretty pretty handy popcorn 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:45.180
 and accessible with which diver or 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.490
 the fish can be put on the chest 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.960
 and fish with the camera recording I know 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.460
 same something similar to what I 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.539
 I'm doing right now just that I 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.539
 I wear it on my head 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.680
 this is also a piece of in toma 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:01.020
 original of them that is very practical 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:05.449
 for tripod and you can catch 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:10.909
 any circular element and it is also 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:10.909
 also original adaptation of into bar 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:17.060
 this is a very very practical piece is 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.060
 a piece that is used 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.120
 for spear fishing rifle 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:28.960
 and that adapts to fusion and allows you 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:31.389
 have the camera and be able 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.220
 record everything that is fired is very 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:37.199
 practice for scuba diving is in fact 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.199
 a camera very used in the world 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.000
 in fact it is a camera very used in 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:44.400
 the world of scuba diving 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 another piece that they have takes very 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.000
 interesting 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.260
 this great contraption that serves to put 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:57.070
 the camera 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:59.590
 to close it and to bring it closer 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.030
 well to fish and we are diving or 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:05.400
 well submersible below the water if 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.400
 we are on the ship and it has 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.220
 a minimum space 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:18.370
 and finally also very practical is 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.260
 the economic part is this windy nothing 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.470
 Bold is a simple suction cup 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.470
 practice 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.570
 and that will make us able to put the 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.010
 camera in the angle that we 

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.320
 we want in the place where we 

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.310
 interest and especially at a great price 

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.889
 which is one of the characteristics 

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:37.469
 fundamentals of the environment 

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:40.469
 which is quite economical and not for that 

00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:43.219
 low quality surprises how well 

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:43.219
 they record their images
