close<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.640> doing<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.540> luckily<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.500> found

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
close to doing that and luckily I found

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.740 
close to doing that and luckily I found
a<00:00:41.100> third<00:00:41.309> now<00:00:41.670> before<00:00:41.969> this<00:00:42.090> album<00:00:42.420> came<00:00:42.570> out

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
a third now before this album came out

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.119 
a third now before this album came out
everybody<00:00:43.079> thought<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.829> was<00:00:43.950> going<00:00:44.040> to

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
everybody thought that it was going to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.619 
everybody thought that it was going to
be<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> little<00:00:44.520> bit<00:00:44.700> more<00:00:44.850> dubstep<00:00:45.420> influence

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
be a little bit more dubstep influence

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.049 
be a little bit more dubstep influence
and<00:00:46.289> there's<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.950> hint<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.850> there

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and there's a hint of it here and there

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.060 
and there's a hint of it here and there
but<00:00:48.090> really<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.780> majority<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.469> album<00:00:49.920> is

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
but really the majority of this album is

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.470 
but really the majority of this album is
the<00:00:50.129> same<00:00:50.460> sound<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.940> you've<00:00:51.090> heard<00:00:51.270> from

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
the same sound that you've heard from

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.260 
the same sound that you've heard from
use<00:00:51.690> before<00:00:52.110> with<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.829> few<00:00:53.399> tiny<00:00:53.850> little

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
use before with a few tiny little

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.049 
use before with a few tiny little
sprinkles<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.230> different<00:00:56.070> diversity<00:00:56.550> in

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
sprinkles of different diversity in

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.689 
sprinkles of different diversity in
there<00:00:57.390> not<00:00:57.750> as<00:00:57.899> much<00:00:58.079> diversity<00:00:58.379> as<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.129> wanted

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
there not as much diversity as I wanted

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.930 
there not as much diversity as I wanted
but<00:01:00.260> it's<00:01:01.260> still<00:01:01.559> really<00:01:01.859> good<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.609> album

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
but it's still really good the album

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.539 
but it's still really good the album
opens<00:01:03.059> with<00:01:03.449> track<00:01:03.750> cult<00:01:04.019> supremacy<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.920> to

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
opens with track cult supremacy and to

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.730 
opens with track cult supremacy and to
me<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.939> sounds<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.630> song<00:01:06.900> should<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.320> in

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
me it sounds like this song should be in

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.370 
me it sounds like this song should be in
like<00:01:08.040> an<00:01:08.310> action<00:01:08.729> movie<00:01:08.790> or<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> spy<00:01:09.780> movie<00:01:10.020> or

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
like an action movie or a spy movie or

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.969 
like an action movie or a spy movie or
something<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.010> way<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.790> strings<00:01:12.119> and

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
something the way that the strings and

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.039 
something the way that the strings and
the<00:01:13.979> orchestra<00:01:14.670> sounding<00:01:15.090> effects<00:01:15.509> over<00:01:15.840> top

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
the orchestra sounding effects over top

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.940 
the orchestra sounding effects over top
of<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.619> sounds<00:01:17.250> really<00:01:18.210> epic<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
of it it just sounds really epic and

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.499 
of it it just sounds really epic and
that<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.070> one<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.340> highest<00:01:20.580> falsettos

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
that is one of the highest falsettos

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.890 
that is one of the highest falsettos
that<00:01:22.200> matt<00:01:22.380> has<00:01:22.409> ever<00:01:22.740> had<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.640> sort<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.090> thing

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.840 

the<00:01:27.900> next<00:01:28.200> song<00:01:28.320> madness<00:01:29.009> was<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> lead

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
the next song madness was the lead

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.609 
the next song madness was the lead
single<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.479> when<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.720> song<00:01:30.930> first<00:01:31.170> came<00:01:31.439> out

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
single and when the song first came out

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.160 
single and when the song first came out
I<00:01:31.680> had<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> really<00:01:32.729> hard<00:01:33.390> time<00:01:33.659> deciding

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
I had a really hard time deciding

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.440 
I had a really hard time deciding
whether<00:01:34.500> i<00:01:34.590> liked<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.280> or<00:01:35.579> didn't<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.119> this

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
whether i liked this or didn't like this

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.240 
whether i liked this or didn't like this
long<00:01:36.720> for<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.049> most<00:01:37.229> part<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.619> really<00:01:37.860> liked<00:01:38.070> it

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
long for the most part I really liked it

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.999 
long for the most part I really liked it
and<00:01:38.490> nowadays<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:39.030> love<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.140> song<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.650> think<00:01:40.890> it

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
and nowadays I love this song I think it

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.460 
and nowadays I love this song I think it
was<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.189> great<00:01:41.790> first<00:01:42.060> single<00:01:42.570> unless<00:01:43.290> you

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
was a great first single unless you

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.109 
was a great first single unless you
count<00:01:43.619> survival<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.549> first<00:01:44.909> single

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
count survival is the first single

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.270 
count survival is the first single
because<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.079> came<00:01:46.290> out<00:01:46.470> when<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.680> 2012

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
because that came out when the 2012

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
of my list is one that I actually like

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.250 
of my list is one that I actually like
now<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:07.159> next<00:03:07.400> song<00:03:07.519> follow<00:03:07.970> me<00:03:08.299> is<00:03:08.540> where

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
now the next song follow me is where

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.080 
now the next song follow me is where
that<00:03:09.409> dubstep<00:03:09.709> influence<00:03:10.129> comes<00:03:10.640> in<00:03:10.849> and<00:03:11.030> is

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
that dubstep influence comes in and is

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.729 
that dubstep influence comes in and is
probably<00:03:11.299> my<00:03:11.569> second<00:03:11.989> favorite<00:03:12.290> song<00:03:12.440> on<00:03:12.620> the

probably my second favorite song on the
album<00:03:12.769> there's<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:13.790> really<00:03:14.180> cool<00:03:14.540> dubstep<00:03:14.870> beat

wonderful song it's one of those it's

wonderful song it's one of those it's
one<00:03:41.510> of<00:03:41.599> those<00:03:41.720> deep<00:03:42.019> cuts<00:03:42.349> and<00:03:42.590> a<00:03:42.620> muse<00:03:42.859> album

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
one of those deep cuts and a muse album

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.159 
one of those deep cuts and a muse album
that<00:03:43.819> doesn't<00:03:44.629> get<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.750> whole<00:03:44.810> lot<00:03:44.959> of

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
that doesn't get a whole lot of

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:46.809 
that doesn't get a whole lot of
recognition<00:03:45.319> but<00:03:45.949> it's<00:03:46.069> a<00:03:46.129> really<00:03:46.430> good<00:03:46.519> song

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
recognition but it's a really good song

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.170 
recognition but it's a really good song
among<00:03:47.209> fans<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:47.930> me<00:03:48.079> anyway<00:03:48.500> I<00:03:48.790> love<00:03:49.790> this<00:03:49.970> song

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
among fans to me anyway I love this song

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.640 
among fans to me anyway I love this song
I<00:03:50.239> think<00:03:50.510> it's<00:03:50.629> great<00:03:50.810> this<00:03:51.199> is<00:03:51.349> the<00:03:51.470> point

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
I think it's great this is the point

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.619 
I think it's great this is the point
when<00:03:51.949> the<00:03:52.069> album's<00:03:52.459> start<00:03:52.579> slowing<00:03:53.030> down<00:03:53.389> for

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
when the album's start slowing down for

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.080 
when the album's start slowing down for
me<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:54.019> kind<00:03:54.290> of<00:03:54.470> losing<00:03:54.889> pace<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.879> song

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
me and kind of losing pace the song

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.330 
me and kind of losing pace the song
explorers<00:03:56.780> is<00:03:57.019> very<00:03:57.319> similar<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.889> that<00:03:58.280> of

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
explorers is very similar to that of

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.180 
explorers is very similar to that of
invincible<00:03:59.299> that<00:03:59.540> was<00:03:59.720> off<00:03:59.900> of<00:04:00.230> black<00:04:01.010> holes

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
invincible that was off of black holes

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.670 
invincible that was off of black holes
and<00:04:01.370> revelations<00:04:01.840> but<00:04:02.840> after<00:04:03.049> I<00:04:03.230> started

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
and revelations but after I started

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.589 
and revelations but after I started
listening<00:04:03.829> to<00:04:04.099> a<00:04:04.220> little<00:04:04.400> bit<00:04:04.609> more<00:04:04.849> I<00:04:04.910> started

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
listening to a little bit more I started

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.050 
listening to a little bit more I started
hearing<00:04:05.959> things<00:04:06.379> that<00:04:07.010> separated<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.030> two

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
hearing things that separated the two

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.849 
hearing things that separated the two
songs<00:04:08.419> when<00:04:08.720> I<00:04:08.750> first<00:04:08.989> heard<00:04:09.230> it<00:04:09.379> all<00:04:09.560> I<00:04:09.590> could

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
songs when I first heard it all I could

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.460 
songs when I first heard it all I could
hear<00:04:10.190> was<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.549> melody<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.269> invincible<00:04:11.900> but<00:04:12.319> as

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
hear was the melody to invincible but as

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.050 
hear was the melody to invincible but as
I<00:04:12.620> listen<00:04:12.919> to<00:04:13.040> it<00:04:13.069> now<00:04:13.190> I'm<00:04:13.549> hearing<00:04:13.879> more

I listen to it now I'm hearing more
things<00:04:14.419> that<00:04:14.780> kind<00:04:15.019> of<00:04:15.220> differentiate<00:04:16.220> the

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
things that kind of differentiate the

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.689 
things that kind of differentiate the
two<00:04:16.489> tracks<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.269> I'm<00:04:18.079> it's<00:04:18.979> growing<00:04:19.489> on<00:04:19.639> me

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
base of singing I'm pretty sure that it

some<00:06:12.820> people<00:06:13.060> might<00:06:13.180> think<00:06:13.240> it's<00:06:13.540> a<00:06:13.570> little

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
some people might think it's a little

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.870 
some people might think it's a little
bit<00:06:13.780> too<00:06:13.960> repetitive<00:06:14.230> but<00:06:14.770> I<00:06:14.980> love<00:06:15.520> the<00:06:15.670> dark

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
mysteriousness of it and I think it

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.070 
mysteriousness of it and I think it
closes<00:06:17.950> out<00:06:18.250> the<00:06:18.280> album<00:06:18.550> really<00:06:18.940> well<00:06:19.120> so<00:06:19.870> once

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.720 
one I I like it a whole lot it still
goes<00:06:26.290> down<00:06:26.530> that<00:06:26.740> route<00:06:26.980> of<00:06:27.190> being<00:06:27.430> a<00:06:27.520> muse

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:27.730 
goes down that route of being a muse

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.700 
goes down that route of being a muse
album<00:06:27.940> that<00:06:28.210> I<00:06:28.270> can't<00:06:28.540> say<00:06:28.780> is<00:06:29.020> absolutely

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
album that I can't say is absolutely

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.800 
album that I can't say is absolutely
perfect<00:06:29.950> but<00:06:30.460> no<00:06:30.640> muse<00:06:30.910> album<00:06:31.090> has<00:06:31.420> done<00:06:31.660> that

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
perfect but no muse album has done that

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.200 
perfect but no muse album has done that
for<00:06:32.020> me<00:06:32.080> yet<00:06:32.410> honestly<00:06:32.650> but<00:06:33.430> it<00:06:33.580> does<00:06:33.790> fall<00:06:34.060> in

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
for me yet honestly but it does fall in

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.910 
for me yet honestly but it does fall in
the<00:06:34.420> category<00:06:34.570> of<00:06:35.110> black<00:06:35.590> holes<00:06:35.770> of
