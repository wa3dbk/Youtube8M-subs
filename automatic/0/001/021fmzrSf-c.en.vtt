00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
when it comes to two preamps because you

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.340 
when it comes to two preamps because you
don't<00:00:48.340> know<00:00:48.460> how<00:00:48.790> well<00:00:49.210> or<00:00:49.420> bad<00:00:49.690> they<00:00:49.930> treated

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
decibels gain input over here that you

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.099 
decibels gain input over here that you
can<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.289> it<00:01:41.740> will<00:01:41.770> boost<00:01:42.130> your<00:01:42.459> single<00:01:43.240> on<00:01:43.509> 20

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
decibels higher you also have your

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.980 
decibels higher you also have your
phantom<00:01:48.039> power<00:01:48.249> right<00:01:48.999> over<00:01:49.209> here<00:01:49.630> for<00:01:49.959> a

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
phantom power right over here for a

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.859 
phantom power right over here for a
condensed<00:01:50.530> microphones<00:01:51.159> and<00:01:51.759> you<00:01:52.569> have<00:01:52.840> a

condensed microphones and you have a
face<00:01:53.740> reversed<00:01:54.609> right<00:01:54.880> over<00:01:55.090> here<00:01:55.299> so<00:01:55.479> if<00:01:55.600> you

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
face reversed right over here so if you

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.539 
face reversed right over here so if you
want<00:01:55.899> to<00:01:55.959> change<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.409> fur<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.920> face<00:01:57.249> you<00:01:57.520> can

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
want to change the fur the face you can

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.069 
want to change the fur the face you can
do<00:01:57.880> that<00:01:58.090> as<00:01:58.270> well<00:02:00.359> let<00:02:01.359> me<00:02:01.389> let<00:02:01.659> me<00:02:01.779> show<00:02:01.869> you

do that as well let me let me show you

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.289 
do that as well let me let me show you
that<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.560> inputs<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.310> outputs<00:02:03.459> it's<00:02:04.179> a

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
that the inputs and outputs it's a

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.309 
that the inputs and outputs it's a
really<00:02:04.659> simple<00:02:04.959> type<00:02:05.859> of<00:02:06.039> a<00:02:06.189> two<00:02:06.520> preamp<00:02:07.319> you

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
really simple type of a two preamp you

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.680 
really simple type of a two preamp you
so<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:08.679> have<00:02:08.920> your<00:02:09.039> instrument<00:02:09.610> input<00:02:09.789> you

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
so you have your instrument input you

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.190 
so you have your instrument input you
have<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:10.869> microphone<00:02:11.349> input<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:12.819> have

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
have a microphone input you have
