00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
it's pretty ballin map he was really

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.060 
it's pretty ballin map he was really
good<00:00:14.639> i<00:00:15.360> like<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.109> have<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.260> fight<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.470> lot<00:00:16.680> back

good i like to have a fight a lot back
in<00:00:17.100> halo<00:00:17.430> 3<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.789> very<00:00:18.029> asymmetrical<00:00:18.900> map<00:00:19.560> no

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
in halo 3 is a very asymmetrical map no

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.250 
in halo 3 is a very asymmetrical map no
it<00:00:20.039> was<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.220> very<00:00:20.400> symmetrical<00:00:20.910> map<00:00:21.119> yeah<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.020> say

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
it was a very symmetrical map yeah I say

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.269 
it was a very symmetrical map yeah I say
that<00:00:22.380> all<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.529> time<00:00:22.650> other<00:00:22.980> videos<00:00:23.250> for

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
that all the time other videos for

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.009 
that all the time other videos for
whatever<00:00:23.670> very<00:00:24.119> symmetrical<00:00:24.539> map<00:00:24.720> it's<00:00:24.930> a

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
whatever very symmetrical map it's a

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.220 
whatever very symmetrical map it's a
great<00:00:25.199> map<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:26.010> was<00:00:26.220> gone<00:00:26.460> MLG<00:00:27.420> on<00:00:27.599> halo<00:00:27.810> 3<00:00:28.080> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
great map it was gone MLG on halo 3 and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.980 
great map it was gone MLG on halo 3 and
I<00:00:28.289> think<00:00:28.500> it'd<00:00:28.590> be<00:00:28.619> pretty<00:00:28.859> good<00:00:29.130> for<00:00:29.310> reach<00:00:29.490> to

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
I think it'd be pretty good for reach to

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.350 
I think it'd be pretty good for reach to
it<00:00:30.990> plays<00:00:31.199> out<00:00:31.410> pretty<00:00:31.679> well<00:00:31.769> on<00:00:32.250> our<00:00:32.309> reach<00:00:33.059> as

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
it plays out pretty well on our reach as

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.139 
it plays out pretty well on our reach as
well<00:00:33.540> with<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.809> DMR's<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.910> it's<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.030> pretty

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
well with the DMR's so it's a pretty

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.760 
well with the DMR's so it's a pretty
good<00:00:36.390> map<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.140> i<00:00:37.230> recommend<00:00:37.469> like

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
good map and i recommend like

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.229 
good map and i recommend like
downloading<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.550> actually<00:00:38.640> playing<00:00:39.059> it

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
downloading this and actually playing it

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.360 
downloading this and actually playing it
with<00:00:39.420> like<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> bunch<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.680> people<00:00:40.739> i<00:00:41.100> was<00:00:41.219> like<00:00:41.340> a

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
with like a bunch of people i was like a

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.530 
with like a bunch of people i was like a
costume<00:00:41.790> game<00:00:41.910> or<00:00:42.059> something<00:00:42.329> because<00:00:42.420> i

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
costume game or something because i

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.119 
costume game or something because i
think<00:00:42.600> it'd<00:00:42.809> be<00:00:42.840> basically<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.710> same<00:00:43.800> as<00:00:43.860> hail

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
think it'd be basically the same as hail

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.770 
think it'd be basically the same as hail
through<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.550> i<00:00:44.850> think<00:00:45.300> i'm<00:00:45.420> gonna<00:00:45.510> give<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.719> a

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
through so i think i'm gonna give this a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.380 
through so i think i'm gonna give this a
5<00:00:46.050> out<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.230> 5<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.890> good<00:00:47.370> job<00:00:47.399> Ronnie<00:00:47.760> creeps<00:00:48.090> and

really good job I love narrows to is an
also<00:01:02.399> very<00:01:02.609> symmetrical<00:01:03.120> map<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:04.199> think<00:01:05.100> it's

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
also very symmetrical map I think it's

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.520 
also very symmetrical map I think it's
gonna<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.339> very<00:01:05.430> for<00:01:05.729> reach<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.350> sides<00:01:07.350> are

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
gonna be very for reach to the sides are

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.050 
gonna be very for reach to the sides are
switch<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:08.040> some<00:01:08.189> reason<00:01:08.460> man<00:01:08.610> cameras<00:01:08.970> on

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
switch for some reason man cameras on

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.910 
switch for some reason man cameras on
the<00:01:09.150> opposite<00:01:09.479> side<00:01:09.689> that's<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.710> only

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the opposite side that's the only

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.280 
the opposite side that's the only
difference<00:01:11.180> MLG<00:01:12.180> swans<00:01:12.450> are<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> same<00:01:12.900> flag

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
difference MLG swans are the same flag

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.649 
difference MLG swans are the same flag
flag<00:01:14.189> spawn<00:01:14.490> like<00:01:14.850> four<00:01:15.060> objectives<00:01:15.180> are<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
flag spawn like four objectives are the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.649 
flag spawn like four objectives are the
same<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:15.990> everything<00:01:16.460> so<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:18.030> map<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.240> also

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
same and everything so this map is also

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.219 
same and everything so this map is also
pretty<00:01:18.810> well<00:01:19.049> done<00:01:19.280> it's<00:01:20.280> pretty<00:01:20.549> good<00:01:20.729> for

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
pretty well done it's pretty good for

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.740 
pretty well done it's pretty good for
for<00:01:22.229> MLG<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:23.130> halo<00:01:23.430> 3<00:01:23.640> as<00:01:23.790> well<00:01:23.820> as<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.540> map

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
for MLG on halo 3 as well as on this map

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.380 
for MLG on halo 3 as well as on this map
so<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:24.990> want<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.290> be<00:01:25.380> surprised<00:01:25.740> if<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.390> play

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
so I want to be surprised if you play

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.580 
so I want to be surprised if you play
this<00:01:27.570> with<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.810> bunch<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.110> your<00:01:28.259> friend<00:01:28.470> and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
this with a bunch of your friend and

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.539 
this with a bunch of your friend and
have<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> good<00:01:28.979> time<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:31.220> everything<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.369> same

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
have a good time to everything the same

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.760 
have a good time to everything the same
the<00:01:32.850> spawns<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.329> same<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:34.290> map<00:01:34.470> comes

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
the spawns of the same this map comes

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.130 
the spawns of the same this map comes
with<00:01:34.920> MLG<00:01:35.340> spawns<00:01:35.610> oh<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> bottom<00:01:36.900> I

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
with MLG spawns oh it's on the bottom I

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.620 
with MLG spawns oh it's on the bottom I
think<00:01:37.829> that's<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.189> when<00:01:38.970> responding<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
think that's a when responding and

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.850 
think that's a when responding and
snipers<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.430> back<00:01:41.790> walls<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.680> bottom<00:01:43.680> it'd

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
snipers on the back walls on bottom it'd

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.170 
snipers on the back walls on bottom it'd
so<00:01:44.270> I'm<00:01:45.270> going<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.659> give<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:46.340> famous<00:01:47.340> five<00:01:47.970> out

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
so I'm going to give a famous five out

general<00:02:13.570> virility<00:02:14.320> I<00:02:14.890> don't<00:02:15.100> know<00:02:15.190> how<00:02:15.340> good

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550

general virility I don't know how good
it<00:02:15.610> be<00:02:15.820> four<00:02:16.060> reach<00:02:16.240> the<00:02:16.990> lifts<00:02:17.410> are<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.680> little

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
it be four reach the lifts are a little

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.700 
it be four reach the lifts are a little
um<00:02:18.220> little<00:02:19.000> janky<00:02:19.270> a<00:02:19.720> little<00:02:20.170> different<00:02:20.530> than

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
um little janky a little different than

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.850

they<00:02:20.860> were<00:02:20.890> in<00:02:21.220> Halo<00:02:22.150> 3<00:02:22.240> of<00:02:22.510> course<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.020> I<00:02:23.230> think

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
they were in Halo 3 of course so I think

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.680 
they were in Halo 3 of course so I think
this<00:02:23.920> would<00:02:24.070> be<00:02:24.100> more<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.550> mat<00:02:25.090> for<00:02:25.120> bungee

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
this would be more of a mat for bungee

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.390 
this would be more of a mat for bungee
to<00:02:25.810> come<00:02:26.050> back<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.410> remake<00:02:26.740> instead<00:02:27.100> of<00:02:27.220> a

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
to come back and remake instead of a

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.300
