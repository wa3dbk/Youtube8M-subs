00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.970 

okay<00:00:39.520> now<00:00:39.820> we've<00:00:40.030> got<00:00:40.239> our<00:00:40.390> solution<00:00:41.170> all<00:00:41.800> the

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
okay now we've got our solution all the

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.639 
okay now we've got our solution all the
pins<00:00:42.220> are<00:00:42.489> now<00:00:42.730> dissolved<00:00:43.300> in<00:00:43.450> there<00:00:43.690> as

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
pins are now dissolved in there as

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:45.750 
pins are now dissolved in there as
you'll<00:00:44.890> see<00:00:44.920> I've<00:00:45.129> moved<00:00:45.340> to<00:00:45.430> a<00:00:45.520> bigger

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
you'll see I've moved to a bigger

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.350 
you'll see I've moved to a bigger
container

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
container

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.500 
container
I<00:00:46.480> had<00:00:46.629> read<00:00:46.870> more<00:00:47.140> and<00:00:47.320> said<00:00:47.590> more<00:00:47.860> water<00:00:48.510> so

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
I had read more and said more water so

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.120 
I had read more and said more water so
I'm<00:00:49.690> gonna<00:00:49.989> update<00:00:50.170> all<00:00:50.559> of<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:50.829> metal<00:00:51.160> ions

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
I'm gonna update all of the metal ions

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.060 
I'm gonna update all of the metal ions
so<00:00:53.430> now<00:00:53.640> she's<00:00:53.970> consecutive<00:00:54.510> goal<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:55.020> there

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
so now she's consecutive goal in there

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.000 
so now she's consecutive goal in there
a<00:00:56.130> goal<00:00:56.730> test<00:00:57.120> eating

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
a goal test eating

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:11.300 
a goal test eating
Stanislaw<00:00:59.969> right<00:01:00.210> timber<00:01:01.820> if<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.000> works

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.760 

see<00:01:11.610> that

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
see that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.140 
see that
in<00:01:13.640> color

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:27.020 

different

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.870 

let's<00:01:28.030> see<00:01:28.360> it's<00:01:28.479> got<00:01:28.630> jet<00:01:29.470> black<00:01:29.790> there's<00:01:30.790> a

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
let's see it's got jet black there's a

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.090 
let's see it's got jet black there's a
lot<00:01:31.090> of<00:01:31.240> gold<00:01:31.390> in<00:01:31.540> there

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
lot of gold in there

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.530 
lot of gold in there
so<00:01:33.460> now<00:01:34.080> pass<00:01:35.080> to<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.620> final<00:01:36.070> stages<00:01:36.310> of

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
so now pass to the final stages of

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.490 
so now pass to the final stages of
separation<00:01:37.540> filtration

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
separation filtration

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.760 
separation filtration
was<00:01:39.800> it<00:01:39.950> a<00:01:40.100> path<00:01:40.280> ago

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.020 

I've<00:01:44.220> now<00:01:44.400> lettest<00:01:44.759> elation<00:01:45.299> cooldown<00:01:46.170> so

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
I've now lettest elation cooldown so

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.719 
I've now lettest elation cooldown so
what<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.060> can<00:01:48.299> do

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.910 

pour<00:01:52.299> onto<00:01:52.509> some<00:01:52.899> ice<00:01:53.079> cubes<00:01:53.289> which<00:01:53.740> will

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
pour onto some ice cubes which will

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.499 
pour onto some ice cubes which will
deserve<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.430> precipitate<00:01:54.969> out<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.270> silver

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
deserve to precipitate out the silver

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.510 
deserve to precipitate out the silver
any<00:01:56.110> silver<00:01:56.530> compound<00:01:56.920> in<00:01:57.130> there

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
any silver compound in there

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.710 
still too many nitrate ions in there
there<00:04:23.230> I'll<00:04:23.410> have<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:23.740> add<00:04:23.889> some<00:04:24.070> urea<00:04:24.460> but<00:04:24.729> see
