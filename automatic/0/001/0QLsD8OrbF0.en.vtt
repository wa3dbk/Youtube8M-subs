00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.240 
one Fuzz northern Norlin arrow maestro
fuzz<00:00:07.099> from<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.340> early<00:00:09.150> 70s<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:09.809> believe<00:00:10.190> on<00:00:11.190> the

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
fuzz from the early 70s I believe on the

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.070 
fuzz from the early 70s I believe on the
right<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.090> clone<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.509> I've<00:00:12.599> built<00:00:12.780> of

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
right is the clone that I've built of

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.320 
right is the clone that I've built of
this<00:00:13.349> pedal<00:00:13.820> basically<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:14.849> haven't<00:00:15.089> seen<00:00:15.210> many

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
this pedal basically I haven't seen many

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.120 
this pedal basically I haven't seen many
good<00:00:15.540> YouTube<00:00:15.929> demos<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.560> video<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.100> I

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
good YouTube demos of this video so I

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.090 
good YouTube demos of this video so I
thought<00:00:17.480> be<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> good<00:00:18.690> idea<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.230> do<00:00:19.410> one<00:00:19.650> just<00:00:19.890> so

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
thought be a good idea to do one just so

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.109 
thought be a good idea to do one just so
everybody<00:00:20.369> can<00:00:20.490> hear<00:00:20.580> what<00:00:20.760> these<00:00:20.850> things

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
everybody can hear what these things

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.689 
everybody can hear what these things
really<00:00:21.330> sound<00:00:21.570> like<00:00:22.100> I'm<00:00:23.100> just<00:00:23.369> doing<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.580> on

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
really sound like I'm just doing this on

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.130 
really sound like I'm just doing this on
two<00:00:23.820> digital<00:00:24.090> cameras<00:00:24.539> hopefully<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.900> sound

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
two digital cameras hopefully the sound

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.620 
two digital cameras hopefully the sound
turns<00:00:25.410> out<00:00:25.859> okay<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:27.180> I'll<00:00:27.300> just<00:00:27.449> go<00:00:27.599> through

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
turns out okay and I'll just go through

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.160 
turns out okay and I'll just go through
some<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.080> my<00:00:28.170> favorite<00:00:28.410> settings<00:00:29.720> my<00:00:30.720> pedal

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
some of my favorite settings my pedal

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.440 
some of my favorite settings my pedal
the<00:00:31.349> clone<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.710> I've<00:00:31.800> developed<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.489> true

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
the clone that I've developed is true

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.940 
the clone that I've developed is true
bypass<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.079> I'm<00:00:34.200> playing<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.559> through<00:00:34.800> it

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
bypass so I'm playing in through it

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.610 
bypass so I'm playing in through it
first<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.489> then<00:00:35.610> into<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.940> maestro<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:37.530> it

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
first and then into the maestro and it

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.080 
first and then into the maestro and it
does<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.010> added<00:00:38.309> feature<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.730> led

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
does have the added feature of the led

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.270 
does have the added feature of the led
of<00:00:39.239> course<00:00:39.510> over<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:39.989> original<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.559> as<00:00:41.100> you

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
of course over the original and as you

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.560 
of course over the original and as you
can<00:00:41.399> see<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:42.030> almost<00:00:42.149> half<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> size

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
can see it's it's almost half the size

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.709 
can see it's it's almost half the size
so<00:00:42.930> here's<00:00:43.110> my<00:00:43.260> my<00:00:43.590> hand<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:44.010> scale<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.520> is

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
so here's my my hand for scale this is

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.779 
so here's my my hand for scale this is
maestro<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.780> quite<00:00:46.050> large<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:47.219> entire<00:00:47.489> thing

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
maestro is quite large the entire thing

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.119 
maestro is quite large the entire thing
is<00:00:47.940> actually<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.390> switch<00:00:48.829> here<00:00:49.829> I've<00:00:49.950> just

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
is actually the switch here I've just

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.709 
is actually the switch here I've just
got<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> dpdt<00:00:51.270> switch<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:52.050> there<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:53.570> yeah<00:00:54.570> so

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
got a dpdt switch in there and yeah so

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.389 
got a dpdt switch in there and yeah so
we'll<00:00:54.840> take<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> listen<00:00:55.199> through<00:00:55.469> I'm<00:00:56.070> playing

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
we'll take a listen through I'm playing

Drive and volume the driver got set at

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.510 
Drive and volume the driver got set at
about<00:01:21.660> seven<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> volume<00:01:22.500> around<00:01:22.770> five<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.310> a

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
about seven the volume around five and a

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.610 
about seven the volume around five and a
half<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.850> only<00:01:23.970> goes<00:01:24.150> up<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.330> nine<00:01:24.630> for<00:01:25.530> some

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
half it only goes up to nine for some

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.690 
half it only goes up to nine for some
reason<00:01:25.860> they<00:01:25.920> made<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.160> one<00:01:26.310> only<00:01:26.490> go<00:01:26.580> up<00:01:26.610> to
