00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.130 
go ahead and do that on each of my nails
it<00:01:26.190> just<00:01:26.400> takes<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.940> couple<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.420> minutes<00:01:27.810> so

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
it just takes a couple of minutes so

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.210 
it just takes a couple of minutes so
bear<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.100> me<00:01:29.370> and<00:01:30.950> it's<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.010> a<00:01:32.280> nice<00:01:32.490> clear

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
bear with me and it's just a nice clear

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.830 
bear with me and it's just a nice clear
essentially<00:01:35.220> it's<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.520> your<00:01:35.670> base<00:01:35.880> coat<00:01:36.180> so

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
essentially it's like your base coat so

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.390 
essentially it's like your base coat so
think<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.260> way<00:01:39.890> I'm<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.040> applying

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
think of it that way I'm just applying

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
think of it that way I'm just applying
it<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:41.970> each<00:01:42.270> nail<00:01:42.540> I'm<00:01:42.750> almost<00:01:42.990> done<00:01:43.729> okay<00:01:44.729> so

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
it on each nail I'm almost done okay so

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.320 
it on each nail I'm almost done okay so
now<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.630> I've<00:01:45.960> done<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:47.280> next<00:01:47.310> step<00:01:47.790> is

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
now that I've done that the next step is

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.649 
now that I've done that the next step is
to<00:01:51.140> use<00:01:52.140> my<00:01:52.560> gel<00:01:52.830> color<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.400> they<00:01:54.060> say<00:01:54.479> it's

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
to use my gel color and they say it's

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.149 
to use my gel color and they say it's
really<00:01:54.869> important<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.260> use<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> thin<00:01:55.740> coat<00:01:55.979> so

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
really important to use a thin coat so

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.469 
really important to use a thin coat so
that's<00:01:56.340> what<00:01:56.610> I'm<00:01:56.729> going<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.909> do<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.210> they<00:01:57.299> say

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
that's what I'm going to do and they say

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.450 
that's what I'm going to do and they say
that<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:57.869> okay<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.979> looks<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.310> little

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
that it's okay if it looks a little

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.570 
that it's okay if it looks a little
streaky<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.420> right<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.780> top<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.049> that

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
streaky so just right on top of that

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.450 
streaky so just right on top of that
initial<00:02:02.580> activator<00:02:03.299> I'm<00:02:03.659> putting<00:02:04.020> on<00:02:04.460> the
