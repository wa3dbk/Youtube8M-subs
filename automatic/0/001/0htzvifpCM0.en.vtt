00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.340 
hi I'm dr. Ricardo Rodriguez and today
I'm<00:00:13.469> here<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.769> talk<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.219> about<00:00:14.309> stem<00:00:14.670> cells

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
I'm here to talk to you about stem cells

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.390 
I'm here to talk to you about stem cells
particularly<00:00:16.350> their<00:00:16.680> potential<00:00:17.220> in

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
particularly their potential in

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.099 
particularly their potential in
reconstructive<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.270> cosmetic<00:00:18.359> surgery

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
reconstructive and cosmetic surgery

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.980 
reconstructive and cosmetic surgery
while<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> relatively<00:00:21.090> well-known<00:00:21.390> fact

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
while it is a relatively well-known fact

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.540 
while it is a relatively well-known fact
that<00:00:22.230> stem<00:00:22.470> cells<00:00:22.740> can<00:00:22.920> be<00:00:23.010> derived<00:00:23.310> from

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
that stem cells can be derived from

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.910 
that stem cells can be derived from
human<00:00:23.730> embryos<00:00:24.000> what<00:00:24.990> plastic<00:00:25.230> surgeons<00:00:25.859> are

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
human embryos what plastic surgeons are

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.769 
human embryos what plastic surgeons are
discovering<00:00:26.430> now<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.359> we<00:00:27.449> don't<00:00:27.570> lose

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
discovering now is that we don't lose

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.019 
discovering now is that we don't lose
all<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.080> them<00:00:28.289> during<00:00:28.619> development<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:29.340> fact

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
all of them during development in fact

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.319 
all of them during development in fact
we<00:00:30.570> still<00:00:30.810> have<00:00:31.019> them<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.230> our<00:00:31.260> own<00:00:31.529> fat<00:00:31.859> tissue

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
we still have them in our own fat tissue

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.209 
we still have them in our own fat tissue
they<00:00:33.329> are<00:00:33.390> present<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.960> small<00:00:34.410> concentration

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
they are present in small concentration

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.069 
they are present in small concentration
within<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.880> blood<00:00:36.120> vessels<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.600> fat<00:00:36.809> tissue

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
within the blood vessels of fat tissue

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.709 
within the blood vessels of fat tissue
and<00:00:37.380> fat<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:38.430> be<00:00:38.550> found<00:00:38.790> almost<00:00:39.090> anywhere<00:00:39.390> in

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
and fat can be found almost anywhere in

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.500 
and fat can be found almost anywhere in
the<00:00:39.840> body<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.950> way<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.730> stem<00:00:42.030> cells<00:00:42.300> have

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the body this way the stem cells have

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.380 
the body this way the stem cells have

easy access to any potentially damaged
area<00:00:45.809> where<00:00:46.320> they<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.649> assist<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.340> repairing

mission of advancing the science of

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.060 
mission of advancing the science of
beauty<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.750> think<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.260> stem<00:00:58.530> cells<00:00:58.829> can

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
beauty and we think that stem cells can

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.060 
beauty and we think that stem cells can
help<00:00:59.280> us<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.609> just<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.559> whenever<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.859> take

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
help us do just that whenever we take

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.740 
help us do just that whenever we take

good fat which is rich in stem cells to
do<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.640> use<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.820> technique<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.479> involves

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
do this we use a technique that involves

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.770 
do this we use a technique that involves
centrifuging<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.979> tissue<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:30.060> separate<00:01:30.600> out

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
centrifuging the tissue to separate out
