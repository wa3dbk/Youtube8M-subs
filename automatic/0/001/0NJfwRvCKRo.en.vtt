it's at historic lows right now this is
a<00:01:03.739> desperate<00:01:04.400> attempt<00:01:04.970> by<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.540> government's

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
a desperate attempt by the government's

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.320 
a desperate attempt by the government's
to<00:01:07.100> keep<00:01:07.400> people<00:01:07.760> buying<00:01:08.330> homes<00:01:10.330> interest

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
rates are at zero percent this keeps

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.510 
rates are at zero percent this keeps
people<00:01:14.900> borrowing<00:01:15.530> more<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.130> more<00:01:16.280> money

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
people borrowing more and more money

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.080 
people borrowing more and more money
because<00:01:17.510> the<00:01:17.660> money<00:01:17.840> is<00:01:17.930> essentially<00:01:18.560> free

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
because the money is essentially free

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.600 
because the money is essentially free
this<00:01:20.090> reduces<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.990> incentive<00:01:21.220> for<00:01:22.220> people<00:01:22.280> to

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
this reduces the incentive for people to

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.520 
this reduces the incentive for people to
save<00:01:23.060> because<00:01:23.810> they're<00:01:23.960> not<00:01:24.110> going<00:01:24.290> to<00:01:24.380> get

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
save because they're not going to get

save because they're not going to get
any<00:01:24.770> return<00:01:25.070> on<00:01:25.100> their<00:01:25.340> money<00:01:25.630> now<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.690> stock
