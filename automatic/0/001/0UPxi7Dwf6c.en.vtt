red-tailed hawk the transmitter will

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.080 
red-tailed hawk the transmitter will
take<00:00:09.000> GPS<00:00:09.450> points<00:00:09.870> just<00:00:10.050> like<00:00:10.110> your<00:00:10.349> standard

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
take GPS points just like your standard

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.789 
take GPS points just like your standard
handheld<00:00:12.090> or<00:00:12.420> car<00:00:12.630> GPS<00:00:13.080> unit<00:00:13.349> does<00:00:13.500> and

effectively email those points to us

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.109 
effectively email those points to us
over<00:00:16.080> time<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:16.800> we<00:00:16.980> can<00:00:17.130> track<00:00:17.850> where

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
over time and so we can track where

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.090 
over time and so we can track where
birds<00:00:18.359> go<00:00:18.630> track<00:00:19.320> their<00:00:19.470> movements<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.010> their

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
birds go track their movements and their

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.950 
birds go track their movements and their
migration<00:00:20.550> patterns<00:00:20.910> one<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.539> most<00:00:21.750> fun

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
migration patterns one of the most fun

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.720 
migration patterns one of the most fun
things<00:00:21.990> about<00:00:22.500> these<00:00:22.710> transmitters<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.580> our

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
things about these transmitters is our

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.750 
things about these transmitters is our
ability<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.740> to<00:00:25.740> go<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.189> just<00:00:26.340> check<00:00:26.609> to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
ability to to go in and just check to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.400 
ability to to go in and just check to
see<00:00:26.910> where<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> bird<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.510> on<00:00:27.750> any<00:00:27.900> given<00:00:28.140> day

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
see where the bird is on any given day

see where the bird is on any given day
the<00:00:29.279> transmitters<00:00:29.849> give<00:00:30.179> us<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.599> ability<00:00:30.689> to

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
the transmitters give us the ability to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.959 
the transmitters give us the ability to
know<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.650> habitat<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.610> birds<00:00:32.790> are

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
know the habitat that the birds are

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.420 
know the habitat that the birds are
traveling<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.570> as<00:00:34.140> well<00:00:34.380> as<00:00:34.500> they<00:00:35.040> can<00:00:35.190> give<00:00:35.309> us

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
traveling in as well as they can give us

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.430 
traveling in as well as they can give us
some<00:00:35.579> idea<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.969> what<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.210> bird<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.660> doing<00:00:37.020> with

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
some idea of what the bird is doing with
