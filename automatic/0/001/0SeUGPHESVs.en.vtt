this<00:00:01.210> demo<00:00:01.479> for<00:00:01.599> the<00:00:01.930> lucre<00:00:02.200> chameleon<00:00:02.680> will

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:03.580 
this demo for the lucre chameleon will

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.600 
this demo for the lucre chameleon will
start<00:00:03.910> with<00:00:04.120> just<00:00:04.570> a<00:00:04.690> regular<00:00:04.810> fender<00:00:05.440> type<00:00:06.400> of

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:06.610 
start with just a regular fender type of

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:19.019 
start with just a regular fender type of
sound<00:00:06.970> just<00:00:07.420> set<00:00:07.690> for<00:00:07.990> blackface<00:00:08.980> fender<00:00:18.029> now

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
sound just set for blackface fender now

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.339 
sound just set for blackface fender now
we<00:00:19.090> can<00:00:19.300> tighten<00:00:19.509> things<00:00:19.779> up<00:00:19.990> just<00:00:20.050> a<00:00:20.320> little

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
we can tighten things up just a little

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:49.950 
we can tighten things up just a little
bit<00:00:20.589> by<00:00:21.250> changing<00:00:21.640> the<00:00:21.970> PF<00:00:22.300> capacitor<00:00:48.780> then<00:00:49.780> on

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
bit by changing the PF capacitor then on

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.560 
bit by changing the PF capacitor then on
down

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.170 

a<00:00:56.600> little<00:00:57.050> more<00:00:57.200> browner<00:00:57.470> yeah<00:00:58.460> and<00:00:58.550> brown<00:00:59.000> or

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
a little more browner yeah and brown or

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:26.450 
a little more browner yeah and brown or
yet

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.209 

mid-range<00:01:27.460> is<00:01:27.819> really<00:01:28.179> very<00:01:29.110> dynamic<00:01:29.740> so

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
mid-range is really very dynamic so

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:39.059 
mid-range is really very dynamic so
here's<00:01:30.759> like<00:01:30.939> totally<00:01:31.539> scooped<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:38.229> then<00:01:38.500> the

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
here's like totally scooped and then the

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:41.470 
here's like totally scooped and then the
control

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
control

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:55.280 
control
there's<00:01:42.480> like<00:01:43.159> quite<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.190> bit<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.400> mid-range<00:01:54.290> to

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
there's like quite a bit of mid-range to

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:03.860 
there's like quite a bit of mid-range to
more

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:12.260 

you<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:10.460> you<00:02:11.460> get<00:02:11.700> all<00:02:11.760> kinds<00:02:12.210> of

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
you can do this you get all kinds of

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.240 
you can do this you get all kinds of
combinations<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:13.080> tones<00:02:13.380> by<00:02:13.680> using<00:02:13.920> this

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
combinations of tones by using this

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.410 
combinations of tones by using this
control<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.750> control<00:02:16.970> all<00:02:17.970> kinds<00:02:18.390> of

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
control and this control all kinds of

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.330 
control and this control all kinds of
different<00:02:18.600> things

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:55.570 

and<00:02:26.600> this<00:02:27.600> control

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:06.870 

and<00:02:56.480> with<00:02:56.630> it<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:57.640> pickup's<00:02:58.640> out-of-phase

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.760 

then<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.000> base<00:03:08.150> control<00:03:08.540> is<00:03:08.750> standard<00:03:09.530> kind

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
then the base control is standard kind

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:25.850 
then the base control is standard kind
of<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:09.920> standard<00:03:10.250> base<00:03:10.400> control

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:56.840 

and<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:27.630> reverb<00:03:43.370> bright<00:03:44.370> reverb<00:03:44.990> a<00:03:55.850> dark

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
and the reverb bright reverb a dark

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:28.030 
and the reverb bright reverb a dark
reverb<00:04:23.390> from<00:04:24.390> here

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:37.110 

is<00:04:28.760> a<00:04:28.820> full<00:04:29.090> reason

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:44.110 

a<00:04:37.410> little<00:04:38.410> more<00:04:38.530> brighter

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:59.469 

I<00:04:47.440> do<00:04:48.440> a<00:04:48.560> tail<00:04:57.880> just<00:04:58.880> to<00:04:58.970> give<00:04:59.150> you<00:04:59.240> an<00:04:59.330> idea

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
I do a tail just to give you an idea

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:05.020 
I do a tail just to give you an idea
about<00:04:59.750> that<00:05:01.120> so<00:05:02.120> little<00:05:02.360> reverb<00:05:02.660> is<00:05:02.840> nice<00:05:04.030> and

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
about that so little reverb is nice and

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:35.469 
about that so little reverb is nice and
the<00:05:05.870> presence<00:05:06.199> control<00:05:33.940> especially<00:05:34.940> with<00:05:35.330> the

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
the presence control especially with the

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:52.060 
the presence control especially with the
out<00:05:36.080> of<00:05:36.260> phase<00:05:36.380> pickup<00:05:50.560> may<00:05:51.560> not<00:05:51.740> be<00:05:51.860> able<00:05:52.010> to

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
out of phase pickup may not be able to

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.800 
out of phase pickup may not be able to
hear<00:05:52.310> it<00:05:52.340> that<00:05:52.580> much<00:05:52.849> on<00:05:53.120> your<00:05:53.300> computer

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
hear it that much on your computer

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.210 
hear it that much on your computer
hopefully<00:05:54.410> you<00:05:54.530> have<00:05:54.650> some<00:05:54.680> good<00:05:54.979> headphones

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
on don't be listening to this with your

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.400 
on don't be listening to this with your
computer<00:05:58.789> speakers<00:05:59.270> it<00:05:59.660> just<00:05:59.900> doesn't<00:06:00.260> work

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
computer speakers it just doesn't work

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:11.469 
computer speakers it just doesn't work
and<00:06:01.270> the<00:06:02.270> high<00:06:02.419> cut<00:06:02.660> control<00:06:10.060> this<00:06:11.060> rolls<00:06:11.330> off

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
and the high cut control this rolls off

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:21.300 
and the high cut control this rolls off
some<00:06:11.720> of<00:06:11.750> the<00:06:11.870> highs<00:06:12.050> on<00:06:12.320> the<00:06:12.410> power<00:06:12.590> section

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:27.100 

effective<00:06:22.310> when<00:06:22.490> you<00:06:22.580> have<00:06:22.610> a<00:06:22.840> overdrive<00:06:26.110> so

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
effective when you have a overdrive so

effective when you have a overdrive so
here<00:06:27.950> we<00:06:28.070> are<00:06:28.690> just<00:06:29.690> a<00:06:29.840> nice<00:06:30.790> clean<00:06:31.790> tone

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.420
