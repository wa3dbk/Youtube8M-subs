00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.600
 who have climbed and called the 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:51.160
 TDP for other hunters there were so 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.330
 all animalists, however, this one 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.910
 it is our victory 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:58.510
 it happened to me in florence in milan in 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.020
 abruzzo of the hunters around no if not 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.440
 they go 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:10.390
 and now we will go under the region that 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:13.360
 with the evening gentleman we will pass to the suns 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.490
 and we will have a press conference there 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.890
 tract below the region 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.780
 we are here today under the Lazio region 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.300
 we asked for a meeting at 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.880
 Zingaretti governor, but he has us 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.770
 let it be known that other commitments 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.420
 but we deliver them hundreds of 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.520
 Casings we have this morning 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.290
 collected in the Roman countryside for 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.080
 show him that hunters do not 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.910
 they only kill animals but pollute 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.890
 because the casings are highly 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.509
 pollutants with lead hunters 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.780
 they should collect there after having 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.909
 killed years 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.619
 the living beings we continue the 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.070
 our battle that we give to zingaretti 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.479
 to respect the animals of no 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.970
 accept extensions to the season 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.390
 hunting that must be closed on the 30th 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.540
 January without exception without further 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.540
 extensions 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.490
 here the numbers are many we don't talk 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.100
 only of 800 thousand hunters rule 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.140
 800 thousand poachers that is not hunters 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.100
 in rule that they go in the fields has 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.950
 driven out of everything we also talk about 500 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.990
 millions of cartridges scattered in the environment 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.150
 us today with a walk in 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.220
 we collected the casings here 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.890
 we bring the gift back to ours 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.480
 president who is absent today 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:05.880
 we are talking about 55 dead and 87 injured and of 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:08.520
 these 78 injured 65 hunters and 13 not 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.489
 hunters because the victims of 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.959
 hunting is often also the kids who 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.350
 they are on the road waiting 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.420
 the bus to go to school and the 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.989
 lady looking out the window 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:25.230
 extending the clothes there are also civilians 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:28.020
 people that far against hunting that 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.260
 find themselves with the hunters inside 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.620
 home over 100 million animals between 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.549
 Mammal birds are killed in 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.769
 Italy 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:42.540
 quietly there are often also species 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:45.870
 protected and therefore wolves bears lynx cats 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.830
 wild are beasts they are 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.500
 they are the beasts they have been given 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.240
 from of a series of numbers 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.000
 how many animals are killed 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:02.170
 how many funds were allocated to 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.460
 hunting associations and the percentage 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.690
 of the Italian population that counts 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.250
 of the hunt 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.220
 and it is precisely here that the problem is one 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.770
 political and political issue 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.840
 political corruption with the lobbies of 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.640
 power in this case were b that 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.110
 the arms industry as they could 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.489
 be drug lobby etc. 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:22.360
 etc. and so on 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:25.270
 and this is unacceptable not that country 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.890
 ours is called democratic 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.810
 MPs not to represent the 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.400
 public opinion popular consent 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.960
 we are not talking about one 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.660
 we are talking about minimum percentage 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.090
 of the more than 80 percent of the people 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.760
 Italian that will control the hunting and the 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.410
 MPs are our employees 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.140
 salaried with our money 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.830
 they must represent us in this 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:53.590
 chance they don't represent us at this 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.180
 we no longer consider ourselves a country 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.750
 democratic 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.680
 if they trample with their abuses 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.470
 to our rights 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.620
 we must therefore make ourselves heard 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:09.000
 at this point we must take some 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.650
 stronger stronger initiatives said it 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.460
 perfectly the representative of the 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.920
 Italian animal rights activists in this case 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.770
 specific decide the calendar 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.240
 hunting at the gates of the very beginning 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.670
 of hunting when there is no more time 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.400
 to resort to tar and them those 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.740
 ten days they steal them and we do n't have them 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.930
 tools to try to block them not 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.270
 we manage to block ten in time 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.830
 more hunting days 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.260
 hundreds and perhaps hundreds of thousands 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.960
 we are unjustly killed animals 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.960
 against criminal actions see that 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.790
 which we ask is exactly the right one 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.400
 that is, saving lives 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.740
 sometimes it happened to searchers 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.200
 of mushrooms that are there or 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.630
 people doing picnics and 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:00.630
 they get hit or we even think 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:03.030
 in article 842 is an absurdity 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.900
 if you carry a rifle then the 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.150
 private property 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.710
 if you have a camera of 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.170
 report to you for property infringement 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:14.060
 private and absurd can get up 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.060
 100 150 meters from the house
