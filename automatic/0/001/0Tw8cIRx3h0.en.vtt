00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.499

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:14.409
 sting 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:17.409
 and comes to reach

 are known today for example due to the advance of the dollar 4 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.630
 there are in the hours after the show again I think I know 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.850
 and neither did most civilian deaths go out the door 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.530
 I have to leave with them 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.520
 that was nothing at all to do in the meantime, I am also sitting in the 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.520
 broadcast I actually did not admit it had nothing to do with overcoming 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.049
 it was a shooting gallery I call this and pay homage to the uefa 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.000
 are in education 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.320
 steel 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.380
 we wished I was til although the show was completely devastated 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.150
 I have 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.920
 the 0 signed 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.920
 unbelievable how are we going to put it 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.480
 but you acknowledge a whole self ing ing the figures that the ditch 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.800
 be brought 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.090
 the law sympathy for it 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.390
 it was at the same time funny but also very moving 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.759
 any world not 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.090
 touched one I can certainly 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.680
 My colleagues got the test why to make it to this 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.900
 to see a beautiful show 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.340
 especially 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.110
 literature 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.990
 marek street 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.610
 It is every time the mental handicap can do things and things 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.140
 very nice years calculated as a bonus 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.750
 received for the shows that was 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.870
 some moments very intense 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.870
 and it has too i think 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.429
 placing the rider's function in a nice perspective is also one 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:18.589

 topicality with the headscarf ban is 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:26.269
 And of course half of it is from a real to clear that they are still there 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.269
 a fine

 is this what changed this is it is beautifully made 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:38.659
