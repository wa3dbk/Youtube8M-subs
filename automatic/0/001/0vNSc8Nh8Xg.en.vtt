hey guys hope you guys had a great week
I<00:00:02.220> finally<00:00:02.879> got<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.060> do<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.389> drawing<00:00:03.720> of<00:00:03.929> Batman

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
I finally got to do a drawing of Batman

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.559 
I finally got to do a drawing of Batman
from<00:00:04.589> Arkham<00:00:04.980> City<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:05.430> just<00:00:06.210> loved<00:00:06.390> how<00:00:06.509> the

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
from Arkham City I just loved how the

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.059 
from Arkham City I just loved how the
characters<00:00:07.080> were<00:00:07.200> blown<00:00:07.410> out<00:00:07.620> when<00:00:07.830> they<00:00:07.980> were

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
characters were blown out when they were

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.370 
characters were blown out when they were
promoting<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.700> game<00:00:08.910> it<00:00:09.660> reminds<00:00:09.990> me<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.170> a

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
promoting the game it reminds me of a

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.990 
promoting the game it reminds me of a
rendering<00:00:10.679> without<00:00:10.830> any<00:00:11.130> shaders<00:00:11.580> assigned

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
rendering without any shaders assigned

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.820 
rendering without any shaders assigned
but<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.570> still<00:00:12.929> does<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.230> trick

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
but it still does the trick

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.890 
but it still does the trick
there's<00:00:14.309> so<00:00:14.490> much<00:00:14.610> contrast<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.450> it's<00:00:15.690> one<00:00:15.870> of

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
there's so much contrast and it's one of

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.250 
there's so much contrast and it's one of
many<00:00:16.109> reasons<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.680> why<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.859> like<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.220> game

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
many reasons of why I like this game

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.300 
many reasons of why I like this game
basically<00:00:19.260> there's<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.529> super<00:00:19.859> strong<00:00:20.070> light

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
basically there's a super strong light

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.400 
basically there's a super strong light
source<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.850> same<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.390> his<00:00:21.510> left<00:00:21.810> shoulder<00:00:21.869> so

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
source that same on his left shoulder so

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.230 
source that same on his left shoulder so
I'm<00:00:22.500> going<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.830> leave<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.400> area<00:00:23.550> alone<00:00:23.760> for

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
I'm going to leave that area alone for

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.450 
I'm going to leave that area alone for
the<00:00:24.390> most<00:00:24.600> part<00:00:24.869> I'm<00:00:25.800> trying<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.160> figure<00:00:26.369> out

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
the most part I'm trying to figure out

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.070 
the most part I'm trying to figure out
how<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.670> approach<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.240> drawing<00:00:27.539> because<00:00:27.750> I

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
how to approach this drawing because I

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.200 
how to approach this drawing because I
wasn't<00:00:28.289> quite<00:00:28.410> sure<00:00:28.710> about<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.189> values<00:00:29.730> so

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
wasn't quite sure about the values so

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.150 
wasn't quite sure about the values so
you're<00:00:30.929> going<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.080> see<00:00:31.289> me<00:00:31.439> jump<00:00:31.679> around<00:00:31.769> quite

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
you're going to see me jump around quite

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.819 
you're going to see me jump around quite
a<00:00:32.189> bit<00:00:32.430> throughout<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.910> drawing<00:00:33.530> and<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.620> just

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
a bit throughout the drawing and I just

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.740 
a bit throughout the drawing and I just
just<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.489> get<00:00:35.640> more<00:00:35.850> information<00:00:36.000> about

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
just like to get more information about

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.459 
just like to get more information about
the<00:00:37.020> range<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.320> values<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:39.170> blocked<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
the range of values I blocked in the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.560 
the range of values I blocked in the
side<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.890> cape<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.520> that's<00:00:42.300> more

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
side of this cape and that's more

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.000 
side of this cape and that's more
because<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:43.020> wanted<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.410> use<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.620> as<00:00:43.920> a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
because I wanted to use that as a

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.440 
because I wanted to use that as a
reference<00:00:44.430> when<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.640> start<00:00:44.969> working<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.329> his

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
reference when I start working on his

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.139 
reference when I start working on his
right<00:00:45.690> leg<00:00:46.370> here<00:00:47.370> I'm<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.760> trying<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.000> add

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
right leg here I'm just trying to add

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.060 
right leg here I'm just trying to add
the<00:00:48.300> subtle<00:00:48.570> surface<00:00:48.989> changes<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.739> try<00:00:50.010> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the subtle surface changes and try to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.619 
the subtle surface changes and try to
add<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.430> dark<00:00:50.640> values<00:00:51.000> where<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> light

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
add the dark values where the light

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.110 
add the dark values where the light
doesn't<00:00:52.020> hit<00:00:52.170> for<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.710> contrast<00:00:53.129> effect<00:00:53.460> it's

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
doesn't hit for the contrast effect it's

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.850 
doesn't hit for the contrast effect it's
pretty<00:00:54.480> dark<00:00:54.750> around<00:00:54.960> his<00:00:55.140> right<00:00:55.350> armpit<00:00:55.620> area

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
pretty dark around his right armpit area

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.010 
pretty dark around his right armpit area
which<00:00:56.370> actually<00:00:56.820> helps<00:00:57.149> pop<00:00:57.360> out<00:00:57.570> his<00:00:57.750> right

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
which actually helps pop out his right

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.430 
which actually helps pop out his right
glove<00:00:58.320> I'm<00:00:59.010> just<00:00:59.430> constantly<00:01:00.109> evaluating<00:01:01.109> his

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
glove I'm just constantly evaluating his

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.189 
glove I'm just constantly evaluating his
neck<00:01:02.070> area<00:01:02.399> because<00:01:02.969> just<00:01:03.660> wasn't<00:01:03.989> popping

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
neck area because just wasn't popping

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.950 
neck area because just wasn't popping
enough<00:01:04.619> for<00:01:04.830> me<00:01:04.949> I'm<00:01:05.220> also<00:01:05.610> adding<00:01:06.000> more<00:01:06.420> value

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
enough for me I'm also adding more value

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.380 
enough for me I'm also adding more value
to<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.260> right<00:01:07.439> side<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.830> his<00:01:07.979> face<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.490> work

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
to the right side of his face and work

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.690 
to the right side of his face and work
inward<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.960> his<00:01:10.049> facial<00:01:10.229> features<00:01:10.700> now

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
inward to his facial features now

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.670 
inward to his facial features now
luckily<00:01:12.060> for<00:01:12.360> me<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.720> lot<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.200> his<00:01:13.320> features

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
luckily for me a lot of his features

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.380 
luckily for me a lot of his features
were<00:01:13.710> blocked<00:01:14.189> out<00:01:14.430> by<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.700> shadow<00:01:15.119> created

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
were blocked out by the shadow created

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.870 
were blocked out by the shadow created
by<00:01:15.630> his<00:01:15.750> mask<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.189> focused<00:01:17.670> more<00:01:17.820> on

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
by his mask so I focused more on

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.550 
by his mask so I focused more on
creating<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.450> negative<00:01:18.810> shape<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.380> would

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
creating the negative shape that would

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.910 
creating the negative shape that would
allow<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.860> features<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.640> recognizable<00:01:21.119> I

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
allow the features to be recognizable I

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.140 
allow the features to be recognizable I
actually<00:01:22.920> kept<00:01:23.400> fudging<00:01:23.729> around<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.060> this

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
actually kept fudging around in this

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.570 
actually kept fudging around in this
area<00:01:24.330> because<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.590> kind<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.159> small

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
area because this is kind of a small

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.609 
area because this is kind of a small
area<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.970> work<00:01:27.150> with<00:01:27.210> but<00:01:28.080> once<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.530> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
area to work with but once I have to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.740 
area to work with but once I have to
filled<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.340> start<00:01:29.939> working<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.240> his<00:01:30.390> patios

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
filled in I start working on his patios

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.289 
filled in I start working on his patios
ends<00:01:31.079> like<00:01:31.979> grooves<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.700> are<00:01:32.759> created<00:01:33.180> by

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
ends like grooves that are created by

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.050 
ends like grooves that are created by
his<00:01:33.540> expression<00:01:34.250> once<00:01:35.250> I'm<00:01:35.430> done<00:01:35.579> working<00:01:35.820> on

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
his expression once I'm done working on

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.090 
his expression once I'm done working on
his<00:01:36.210> mask<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.840> move<00:01:37.110> on<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.290> his<00:01:37.530> gloves<00:01:37.770> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
his mask I move on to his gloves and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.640 
his mask I move on to his gloves and
there's<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.820> lot<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.119> surface<00:01:39.420> details<00:01:39.840> for

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
there's a lot of surface details for

there's a lot of surface details for
example<00:01:41.070> there<00:01:41.280> are<00:01:41.310> these<00:01:41.549> extruded<00:01:42.180> over

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
example there are these extruded over

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.389 
example there are these extruded over
shapes<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:43.110> rest<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.680> top<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:44.009> his<00:01:44.130> knuckles

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.940 
shapes that rest on top of his knuckles
and<00:01:44.880> since<00:01:45.810> they're<00:01:45.990> extruded<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.770> just

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and since they're extruded that just

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.950 
and since they're extruded that just
means<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.399> one<00:01:47.790> side<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:48.030> going<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.450> be

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
means that one side is going to be

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.160

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
and little screw holes that aid in the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.230 
and little screw holes that aid in the
mechanical<00:02:03.630> feel<00:02:03.840> but<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.619> not<00:02:05.100> neck<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:05.880> I

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
mechanical feel but it's not neck like I

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.260 
mechanical feel but it's not neck like I
just<00:02:07.110> stopped<00:02:07.560> after<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.459> drew<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.940> shin

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
and finished drawing the rest of the
cape

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
cape

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.449 
cape
and<00:02:12.299> I<00:02:12.689> was<00:02:12.930> thinking<00:02:13.140> about<00:02:13.439> adding<00:02:13.950> carers

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
and I was thinking about adding carers

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.509 
and I was thinking about adding carers
like<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.909> game<00:02:15.120> but<00:02:15.629> I<00:02:15.930> opted<00:02:16.590> not<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.769> because

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
like the game but I opted not to because

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.699 
like the game but I opted not to because
then<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.510> would<00:02:18.629> have<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.870> add<00:02:19.019> some<00:02:19.260> scratches

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
then I would have to add some scratches

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.800 
then I would have to add some scratches
throughout<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.189> whole<00:02:20.400> suit<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.569> didn't

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
throughout the whole suit and I didn't

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.569 
throughout the whole suit and I didn't
want<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.019> do<00:02:22.109> that<00:02:22.290> because<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.920> wanted<00:02:23.129> to<00:02:23.189> keep

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
want to do that because I wanted to keep

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.690 
want to do that because I wanted to keep

this image clean once the cape is done I

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.970 
this image clean once the cape is done I
go<00:02:27.090> back<00:02:27.269> to<00:02:27.420> finish<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.959> details<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.709> his

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.160 
go back to finish the details of his
boot<00:02:29.219> and<00:02:29.430> start<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.269> finish<00:02:30.450> off<00:02:30.719> his<00:02:30.840> core

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
boot and start to finish off his core

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.069 
boot and start to finish off his core
area<00:02:31.579> his<00:02:32.579> abs<00:02:32.790> are<00:02:32.969> going<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.359> be<00:02:33.540> diagonal

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
area his abs are going to be diagonal

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.619 
area his abs are going to be diagonal
obviously<00:02:34.950> because<00:02:35.340> he's<00:02:35.519> tilting<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.180> then

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629
