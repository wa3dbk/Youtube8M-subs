00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.010
 curb on the bot I did 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.800

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.800
 quickly now 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.770

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.610
 the next three points 101% he goes 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.959
 die 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.910
 he died he died rather in 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.910
 the other sense of the stroke this time yeah 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:58.890

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.890
 not the timer am sorry 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.530
 they have to take minor who 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:13.750
 told me when it's guys from the 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.180
 area as 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.609
 ten seconds before the corruption the 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.560
 sacking of eight seconds 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.840
 we're going to put it for it's not too much 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:31.669
 place five seconds in ska icac 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:32.320
 malÃ©kite clears an art month and its 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.130
 wide 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.690
 there we tried to awaken 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.850
 take damage only from the layman and 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.840
 so do not fall in fact is that they 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.120
 accept by the way I take a 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.950
 purple taxi is at max distance from the boss 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.690
 you do not take the milk of 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.690
 areas of the times that I do not think they 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.590
 can but it's not even moving 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.900
 toque takes still yet 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.220
 okay tube time you on time 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.540
 that I think is natural that pragmatic 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.830
 10 seconds before eliminating corruption 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.570
 80 to jump away depart 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.919
 the mines and harvest what they want 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.919
 ask 2 1 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.210
 you can flu is the time that this 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.740
 moment the fishermen 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.740

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.060
 veneman his copy on the cac 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.330
 it's franck the epec which has not taken over 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.170
 ten seconds before the next 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.550
 you can take a little more space 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.200
 now together inquiry that has 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.760
 denounced the five seconds in this case 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:49.440

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:50.240

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.040
 yeah but that's all it will do them 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.040
 a I think anyway 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.240
 I owe their membership to this game pressure 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.100
 15 seconds it's tomorrow that we're going 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.560
 from the premise that it makes you 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.110
 will not need to move to 9 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:22.740
 seconds 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:22.740
