older<00:02:52.430> one<00:02:52.580> right<00:02:52.760> here<00:02:53.090> which<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:53.870> have<00:02:53.930> with

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
older one right here which I have with

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.160 
older one right here which I have with
my<00:02:54.380> x-men<00:02:54.740> color<00:02:54.980> Deadpool<00:02:55.340> but<00:02:55.490> it<00:02:55.550> has<00:02:55.670> gold

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
my x-men color Deadpool but it has gold

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.260 
my x-men color Deadpool but it has gold
right<00:02:57.170> there<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.800> handle<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:58.760> stuff<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.180> I

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
right there the handle and stuff and I

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.700 
right there the handle and stuff and I
guess<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.540> paint<00:02:59.750> on<00:02:59.900> the<00:02:59.990> blade<00:03:00.200> itself<00:03:00.500> is

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
guess the paint on the blade itself is

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.890 
guess the paint on the blade itself is
just<00:03:00.980> about<00:03:01.220> equally<00:03:01.610> as<00:03:01.730> shiny<00:03:01.940> so<00:03:02.540> very

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
just about equally as shiny so very

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.510 
just about equally as shiny so very
similar<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.410> lot<00:03:03.710> of<00:03:03.830> parts<00:03:04.070> on<00:03:04.190> this<00:03:04.310> figure

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
similar a lot of parts on this figure

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.120 
similar a lot of parts on this figure
are<00:03:04.790> removable<00:03:05.420> you<00:03:05.750> can<00:03:05.780> take<00:03:06.320> these<00:03:06.650> two

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
are removable you can take these two

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.000 
are removable you can take these two
pieces<00:03:07.460> off<00:03:07.820> right<00:03:08.060> here<00:03:08.330> so<00:03:08.720> they<00:03:08.990> have<00:03:09.020> these

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
pieces off right here so they have these

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.550 
pieces off right here so they have these
notches<00:03:10.280> in<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.670> back<00:03:10.850> in<00:03:11.180> this<00:03:11.690> peg<00:03:12.260> thing

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
notches in the back in this peg thing

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
notches in the back in this peg thing
sticking<00:03:12.920> out<00:03:13.010> right<00:03:13.040> here<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:13.310> you<00:03:13.460> can

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
sticking out right here so you can

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.850 
sticking out right here so you can
remove<00:03:13.820> that<00:03:13.880> this<00:03:14.750> piece<00:03:15.080> right<00:03:15.290> here<00:03:15.350> even

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
remove that this piece right here even

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.410 
remove that this piece right here even
though<00:03:15.950> I<00:03:15.980> like<00:03:16.250> it<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.460> lot<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:16.880> does<00:03:17.090> come<00:03:17.390> off

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
though I like it a lot it does come off

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.510 
though I like it a lot it does come off
very<00:03:18.020> easily<00:03:18.320> a<00:03:18.560> little<00:03:18.800> bit<00:03:18.890> detail<00:03:19.100> on<00:03:19.490> that

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
very easily a little bit detail on that

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.690 
very easily a little bit detail on that
look<00:03:19.880> at<00:03:19.970> that<00:03:20.150> HD<00:03:20.660> serving<00:03:21.410> it<00:03:21.500> well<00:03:21.770> well

the end I think it came out really nice
on<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:02.959> eyes<00:04:03.140> I<00:04:03.410> like<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.709> red<00:04:03.890> painted<00:04:04.310> in

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
on the eyes I like the red painted in

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.759 
on the eyes I like the red painted in
there<00:04:04.610> and<00:04:04.820> the<00:04:05.360> color<00:04:05.570> gray<00:04:05.959> on<00:04:06.140> him<00:04:06.380> does

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
there and the color gray on him does

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.220 
there and the color gray on him does
match<00:04:07.100> the<00:04:07.130> Wolverine<00:04:08.000> from<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:08.600> 3-pack

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
match the Wolverine from the 3-pack

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.470 
match the Wolverine from the 3-pack
pretty<00:04:09.830> damn<00:04:10.010> well<00:04:10.040> so<00:04:10.760> it's<00:04:11.000> like<00:04:11.090> Wolverines

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
pretty damn well so it's like Wolverines

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.210 
pretty damn well so it's like Wolverines
kind<00:04:11.690> of<00:04:11.750> giving<00:04:11.959> Deadpool<00:04:12.320> a<00:04:12.590> headlock<00:04:13.160> or

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
kind of giving Deadpool a headlock or

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.310 
kind of giving Deadpool a headlock or
something<00:04:13.730> so<00:04:14.300> the<00:04:14.390> color<00:04:14.570> gray<00:04:14.810> is<00:04:14.959> slightly

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
something so the color gray is slightly

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.810 
something so the color gray is slightly
different<00:04:15.800> but<00:04:15.920> it's<00:04:16.070> more<00:04:16.190> or<00:04:16.250> less<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.609> same

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
different but it's more or less the same

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.909 
different but it's more or less the same
so<00:04:17.209> you<00:04:17.510> know<00:04:17.630> they<00:04:17.750> got<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:17.959> greys<00:04:18.200> down<00:04:18.530> for
