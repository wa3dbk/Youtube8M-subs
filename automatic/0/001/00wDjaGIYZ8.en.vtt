00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.840
 and very good to all the boys I am 

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:07.270
 exhibited and we are once again in this 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.220
 so cool that is called pizzas 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.460
 play made 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.840
 pepsi and well we are this is the second 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.450
 Once there were, yes, we are going to see them 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.610
 that remain for those who have not known 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.000
 this modality still consists of throwing 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.380
 people down like this one here has fallen and 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.119
 each one has three lives and you will say 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.730
 because you do not see anything now you have to give and 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.130
 Well, it's because there's always always 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.829
 he tried typical obsidian dances 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.090
 Obsidian Obsidian is me here 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.920
 and have a second here typical of this 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.320
 the obsidian the blind to all is the 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.350
 typical and events the screen in black and 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.710
 it's one in serious some cool nothing play 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.730
 so because it's a roll you play 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.730
 so you do not have a good time 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.910
 I followed quietly 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.310
 and it goes 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.850
 and something goes fast because he knows he's going 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.790
 we'll say it to the sea 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.670
 well to install it now let's go 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.670
 fast the typical redstone speed 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.350
 agree for an effective time the 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.570
 green as you can I could see you jump more 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.190
 but I want to chop the green for now 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:26.130
 have a second voucher and spades 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.750
 the wood high altitude if I do not remember 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.750
 bad I do not remember 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.970
 persson trolls 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.120
 anguish 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.410
 quickly and then if you give it that way left 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.870
 you throw people to them in leaks 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.850
 hey he's giving obsidian but 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.760
 it's bothering me a lot and I do not 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.500
 nominative the rusty when playing at 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:09.020
 gusto attended seriously is a project 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.020
 Uncle look that day and we record mark 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:19.070
 come come come come come 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.070
 u and it's worth the lack of a planet 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.690
 this falls 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:34.970
 is going to fall at some point because 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:34.970
 it is also more a hole 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.660
 let's see what we find this 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.140
 boy here we can get it easily 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.140
 good 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:58.239
 here is not worth 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.230
 I want to hurt you, good is that 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.230
 fear 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.840
 how did he do that 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.290
 bid today can go times I have this 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.819
 broken there are many left as you already 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.440
 I said people criticize obsidian and 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.519
 explain and I to fuck 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.239
 grace pour or the last moment that goes 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.239
 of travel have hit us 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.190
 it has escaped by strict hairs 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.800
 - We were three we were three come 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.820
 down 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.710
 let's see the one before that should be 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.190
 a life we like that has fallen only 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.810
 apparently this one is scared because he knows 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.690
 that the ocean goes against me does not have 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.370
 So much to do you get paid here that today is 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.730
 so you know you're going to die the same way better 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.440
 ending suffering is not worth picador 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.450
 syriana thought I think that is 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.710
 applying all the time I think this is 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.790
 so let's hit him a little bit 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.790
 to see if he likes it as much as 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.190

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.820
