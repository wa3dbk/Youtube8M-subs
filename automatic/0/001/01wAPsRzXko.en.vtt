wobbly<00:02:16.879> and<00:02:17.209> everything<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:18.280> ref<00:02:19.280> that<00:02:19.310> was

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
establish a little too early i don't

establish a little too early i don't
think<00:02:24.110> so<00:02:24.170> i<00:02:24.260> think<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.530> stoppage<00:02:24.920> was<00:02:25.129> right
