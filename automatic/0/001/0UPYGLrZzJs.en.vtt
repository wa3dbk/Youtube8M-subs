okay so this is me and my partner's
mousetrap<00:00:04.440> car<00:00:04.680> that<00:00:04.950> we<00:00:05.040> built<00:00:05.089> for<00:00:06.089> our

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
mousetrap car that we built for our

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.350 
mousetrap car that we built for our
physics<00:00:06.629> class<00:00:07.220> ours<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.400> made<00:00:08.580> mostly<00:00:08.940> out<00:00:09.240> of

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
physics class ours is made mostly out of

physics class ours is made mostly out of
plastic<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:11.040> exception<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.940> axles<00:00:12.509> which

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
plastic the exception of the axles which

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.740 
plastic the exception of the axles which
are<00:00:13.080> made<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.410> four<00:00:13.710> millimeter<00:00:14.450> steel<00:00:15.450> rod

are made of a four millimeter steel rod
and<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.139> mousetrap<00:00:16.560> itself<00:00:16.949> which<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.310> just

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
and the mousetrap itself which is just

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.650 
and the mousetrap itself which is just
wood<00:00:18.800> in<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.980> back<00:00:20.310> we<00:00:20.580> have<00:00:20.630> ball<00:00:21.630> bearings

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
wood in the back we have ball bearings

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.570 
wood in the back we have ball bearings
on<00:00:22.350> either<00:00:22.470> side<00:00:22.769> there's<00:00:22.949> one<00:00:23.130> there<00:00:23.369> and

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
on either side there's one there and

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.210 
on either side there's one there and
there's<00:00:23.910> one<00:00:23.970> on<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.600> other<00:00:24.630> side<00:00:25.099> and<00:00:26.099> you

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
there's one on the other side and you

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.830 
there's one on the other side and you
can<00:00:26.340> see<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.699> we<00:00:26.789> have<00:00:26.939> sandpaper<00:00:27.269> wrapped

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
can see that we have sandpaper wrapped

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.769 
can see that we have sandpaper wrapped
around<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.260> axle<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.300> when<00:00:30.539> we

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
around the axle that is so that when we

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.630 
around the axle that is so that when we
pull<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.560> string<00:00:31.830> back<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.430> load<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:34.640> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
pull the string back and load it the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.160 
pull the string back and load it the
string<00:00:35.910> gets<00:00:36.030> wrapped<00:00:36.300> around<00:00:36.450> there<00:00:36.870> and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
string gets wrapped around there and

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.880 
string gets wrapped around there and
when<00:00:37.380> we<00:00:37.559> release<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:39.059> sandpaper

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
when we release it the sandpaper

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.600 
when we release it the sandpaper
helps<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.850> string<00:00:42.120> grip<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.629> axle<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.610> allow

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
helps the string grip the axle and allow

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.630 
helps the string grip the axle and allow
it<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.789> spin<00:00:46.129> in<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> front

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it to spin in the front

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.990 
it to spin in the front
we<00:00:48.600> don't<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.530> ball<00:00:50.010> bearings<00:00:50.399> anymore<00:00:50.820> we

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
we don't have ball bearings anymore we

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.029 
we don't have ball bearings anymore we
used<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.539> if<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.739> find<00:00:52.980> them<00:00:53.360> right<00:00:54.360> here

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
used to if I can find them right here

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.209 
used to if I can find them right here
but<00:00:56.039> they<00:00:56.340> are<00:00:56.670> filled<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.660> grease<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.739> there

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
but they are filled with grease so there

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.420 
but they are filled with grease so there
they're<00:01:00.149> nice<00:01:00.629> bearings<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:01.530> they<00:01:01.920> don't

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
they're nice bearings but they don't

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.920 
they're nice bearings but they don't
have<00:01:02.640> low<00:01:02.850> enough<00:01:03.030> friction<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:03.690> what<00:01:03.809> we

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
have low enough friction for what we

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.170 
have low enough friction for what we
want<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.610> drilled<00:01:07.790> holes<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.030> were

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
want so we just drilled holes that were

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.120 
want so we just drilled holes that were
just<00:01:09.390> slightly<00:01:09.689> bigger<00:01:09.960> than<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> axle<00:01:10.770> in

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
just slightly bigger than the axle in

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.830 
just slightly bigger than the axle in
the<00:01:11.780> blocks<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:14.159> just<00:01:14.420> lubricated<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.630> with

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the blocks and just lubricated it with

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.480 
the blocks and just lubricated it with
some<00:01:16.220> spray<00:01:17.220> lubricant<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:19.770> save<00:01:20.100> on<00:01:20.280> weight

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
some spray lubricant to save on weight

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.490 
some spray lubricant to save on weight
we<00:01:20.729> cut<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> middle<00:01:21.390> section<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.140> black

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
we cut the middle section of this black

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.130 
we cut the middle section of this black
acrylic<00:01:22.890> out<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.580> are<00:01:23.970> using<00:01:24.240> them<00:01:24.960> using

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
acrylic out and are using them using

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.850 
acrylic out and are using them using
just<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:26.630> just<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.750> mousetrap<00:01:28.229> itself<00:01:28.650> is

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
just this just the mousetrap itself is

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.910 
just this just the mousetrap itself is
the<00:01:29.040> center<00:01:29.549> part<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.939> car<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.920> that

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the center part of the car and that

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.740 
the center part of the car and that
saves<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.400> weight<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.850> makes<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.420> look<00:01:33.540> really

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
saves on weight and makes it look really

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.690 
saves on weight and makes it look really
cool<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:35.700> wheels<00:01:36.060> are<00:01:36.540> CD's<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:38.130> back<00:01:38.310> are

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
cool the wheels are CD's the back are

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.200 
cool the wheels are CD's the back are
the<00:01:38.909> back<00:01:39.479> ones<00:01:39.750> are<00:01:40.400> where<00:01:41.400> originally<00:01:41.549> blank

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the back ones are where originally blank

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.069 
the back ones are where originally blank
DVDs<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:44.040> urgent<00:01:44.909> ones<00:01:45.119> were<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.329> mini

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
DVDs and the urgent ones were just mini

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.020 
DVDs and the urgent ones were just mini
CD<00:01:46.500> ROMs<00:01:48.229> they<00:01:49.229> were<00:01:49.290> painted<00:01:49.799> metallic<00:01:50.520> blue

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
CD ROMs they were painted metallic blue

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.080 
CD ROMs they were painted metallic blue
as<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.479> see<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:53.310> back<00:01:53.520> ones<00:01:53.790> have

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
as you can see and the back ones have

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.319 
as you can see and the back ones have
rubber<00:01:54.509> around<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.020> edge<00:01:55.579> to<00:01:56.579> provide<00:01:56.909> grip

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
rubber around the edge to provide grip

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.789 
rubber around the edge to provide grip
when<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.899> set<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.200> car<00:01:58.409> up<00:01:58.439> otherwise

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
when you set the car up otherwise

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.999 
when you set the car up otherwise
they'll<00:01:59.159> just<00:01:59.189> spin<00:01:59.610> on<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.820> ground<00:02:01.009> the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
they'll just spin on the ground the

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.260 
they'll just spin on the ground the
front<00:02:02.219> ones<00:02:02.399> don't<00:02:02.610> need<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.000> because

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
front ones don't need that because

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.630 
front ones don't need that because
they're<00:02:03.479> not<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.960> drive<00:02:04.350> wheels<00:02:05.509> as<00:02:06.509> for<00:02:07.640> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
they're not the drive wheels as for the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.430 
they're not the drive wheels as for the
r2d2<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.599> see<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:09.899> there<00:02:10.080> that's<00:02:10.289> our

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
r2d2 that you see in there that's our

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.480 

and<00:02:13.870> just<00:02:14.050> threw<00:02:14.230> him<00:02:14.440> on<00:02:14.620> there<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:14.860> little<00:02:15.280> at

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
and just threw him on there a little at

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.360 
and just threw him on there a little at
the<00:02:15.520> last<00:02:15.820> second<00:02:16.210> because<00:02:16.860> we<00:02:17.860> saw<00:02:18.130> him

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
the last second because we saw him

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.750 
the last second because we saw him
laying<00:02:20.310> on<00:02:21.390> my<00:02:22.390> desk<00:02:22.420> upstairs<00:02:23.080> so<00:02:23.580> threw<00:02:24.580> him

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
laying on my desk upstairs so threw him

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.020 
laying on my desk upstairs so threw him
on<00:02:24.910> there<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:26.410> is<00:02:26.970> our<00:02:27.970> mousetrap<00:02:28.780> car
