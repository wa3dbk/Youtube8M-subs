different<00:04:37.509> molds<00:04:37.830> casting<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:38.919> part<00:04:39.190> it's

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
different molds casting the part it's

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.820 
different molds casting the part it's
kind<00:04:40.479> of<00:04:40.570> a<00:04:40.660> two-step<00:04:41.080> process<00:04:41.110> we<00:04:41.710> have<00:04:41.800> a

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
kind of a two-step process we have a

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.909 
kind of a two-step process we have a
face<00:04:42.130> coat<00:04:42.430> and<00:04:42.639> the<00:04:42.870> backup<00:04:43.870> coach<00:04:44.289> so<00:04:44.740> what's

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
face coat and the backup coach so what's

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.520 
face coat and the backup coach so what's
in<00:04:45.039> that<00:04:45.160> base<00:04:45.400> coat<00:04:45.699> are<00:04:46.599> these<00:04:46.810> different

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
in that base coat are these different

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.620 
in that base coat are these different
kinds<00:04:47.830> of<00:04:47.889> glass<00:04:48.160> so<00:04:48.729> we<00:04:48.849> have<00:04:49.000> the<00:04:49.090> black<00:04:49.330> and

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
kinds of glass so we have the black and

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.460 
kinds of glass so we have the black and
in<00:04:50.250> clear<00:04:51.250> and<00:04:51.490> we<00:04:51.610> have<00:04:51.760> sameer<00:04:52.180> glass<00:04:52.470> that

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
in clear and we have sameer glass that

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.159 
in clear and we have sameer glass that
we<00:04:53.710> use<00:04:53.949> which<00:04:54.280> they<00:04:54.970> want<00:04:55.180> it<00:04:55.270> sparkle<00:04:55.810> give

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
we use which they want it sparkle give

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:57.810 
we use which they want it sparkle give
the<00:04:56.349> the<00:04:56.680> part<00:04:56.919> to<00:04:57.070> stand<00:04:57.340> out<00:04:57.520> and<00:04:57.699> make<00:04:57.789> it

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
the the part to stand out and make it

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.510 
the the part to stand out and make it
look<00:04:57.970> unique<00:04:58.300> then<00:04:59.169> we've<00:04:59.289> got<00:04:59.320> a<00:04:59.470> rebar<00:05:00.250> cage

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
look unique then we've got a rebar cage

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.430 
look unique then we've got a rebar cage
and<00:05:00.940> then<00:05:01.150> we<00:05:01.240> got<00:05:01.389> more<00:05:01.599> concrete<00:05:02.020> on<00:05:02.110> top<00:05:02.139> of

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
and then we got more concrete on top of

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.710 
and then we got more concrete on top of
that<00:05:02.580> that<00:05:03.580> gets<00:05:03.729> filled<00:05:04.060> in<00:05:04.210> that<00:05:04.419> you<00:05:04.690> know

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
that that gets filled in that you know

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.180 
that that gets filled in that you know
that<00:05:04.930> overall<00:05:05.169> process<00:05:05.650> takes<00:05:05.919> a<00:05:06.010> couple

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
that overall process takes a couple

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.820 
that overall process takes a couple
hours<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:06.849> then<00:05:07.229> basically<00:05:08.229> the<00:05:08.409> part<00:05:08.590> rest

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
hours and then basically the part rest

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.680 
hours and then basically the part rest
all<00:05:09.039> day<00:05:09.070> and<00:05:09.340> all<00:05:09.400> night<00:05:09.639> and<00:05:09.849> in<00:05:10.510> the<00:05:10.630> morning

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
all day and all night and in the morning

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.510 
all day and all night and in the morning
we<00:05:11.050> take<00:05:11.229> and<00:05:11.380> lift<00:05:11.650> the<00:05:11.740> part<00:05:11.949> out<00:05:12.070> but

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
we take and lift the part out but

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.250 
we take and lift the part out but
they'll<00:05:12.669> be<00:05:12.729> installed<00:05:13.240> surrounding<00:05:14.139> the

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
they'll be installed surrounding the

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.960 
they'll be installed surrounding the
reinforcing<00:05:14.770> cage<00:05:15.099> that<00:05:15.370> you<00:05:15.490> see<00:05:15.729> being

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
reinforcing cage that you see being

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.520 
reinforcing cage that you see being
installed<00:05:16.330> on<00:05:16.539> the<00:05:16.690> end<00:05:16.990> of<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.169> outrigger

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
installed on the end of the outrigger

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.460 
installed on the end of the outrigger
behind<00:05:18.009> us<00:05:18.250> and<00:05:18.430> that<00:05:19.210> work<00:05:19.419> is<00:05:19.630> expected<00:05:20.199> each

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
behind us and that work is expected each

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.560 
behind us and that work is expected each
basket<00:05:20.710> will<00:05:21.070> take<00:05:21.310> two<00:05:22.030> two<00:05:22.270> and<00:05:22.360> a<00:05:22.449> half

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
tasks that we have to do is the

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.129 
tasks that we have to do is the
construction<00:05:28.449> of

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
construction of

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:31.679 
construction of
retaining<00:05:29.439> walls<00:05:29.770> there<00:05:30.280> are<00:05:30.490> four<00:05:30.999> walls<00:05:31.300> to

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:31.689 
retaining walls there are four walls to

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:34.140 
retaining walls there are four walls to
at<00:05:31.810> each<00:05:31.930> end<00:05:32.169> of<00:05:32.289> the<00:05:32.379> bridge<00:05:32.789> then<00:05:33.789> they<00:05:33.969> will

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
at each end of the bridge then they will

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.270 
at each end of the bridge then they will
be<00:05:34.330> backfilled<00:05:35.289> with<00:05:35.499> earth<00:05:35.830> and<00:05:36.099> then

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
be backfilled with earth and then

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.519 
be backfilled with earth and then
they'll<00:05:36.430> provide<00:05:36.699> the<00:05:36.879> ramp<00:05:37.120> that<00:05:37.479> leads<00:05:37.719> up

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:38.529 
they'll provide the ramp that leads up

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:40.559 
they'll provide the ramp that leads up
to<00:05:38.560> the<00:05:38.949> top<00:05:39.099> of<00:05:39.340> the<00:05:39.400> bridge<00:05:39.610> there<00:05:40.389> will<00:05:40.539> be

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:40.569
