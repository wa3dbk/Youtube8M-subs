couple buttons that one almost looks

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.650 
couple buttons that one almost looks
silver<00:02:12.799> but<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:13.070> definitely<00:02:13.549> not<00:02:13.730> genes

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
silver but is definitely not genes

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.100

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
button so I'm a lemon over them and that

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.289 
button so I'm a lemon over them and that
could<00:02:18.440> be<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.650> no<00:02:19.280> that's<00:02:19.519> not<00:02:19.730> a<00:02:19.760> crushed<00:02:20.060> ring

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
it has threads on it and just the odd

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.130 
it has threads on it and just the odd
