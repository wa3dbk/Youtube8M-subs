can see this on the screen you know
these<00:00:36.300> clean<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.690> showing<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.010> more

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
these clean is showing that it is more

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.639 
these clean is showing that it is more
than<00:00:38.399> two<00:00:39.120> days<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.629> almost<00:00:39.899> nearly<00:00:40.230> T

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
than two days it is almost nearly T

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.240 
than two days it is almost nearly T
three<00:00:41.640> days<00:00:41.850> since<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:43.020> Basti<00:00:43.559> was<00:00:43.770> charged

lasting or up to three to
three-and-a-half<00:01:09.420> days<00:01:10.020> go<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:12.030> one

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
three-and-a-half days go on the one

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
three-and-a-half days go on the one
charge<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.680> with<00:01:14.520> excess<00:01:15.270> tensive<00:01:16.259> use<00:01:16.500> with

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
charge and with excess tensive use with

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.580 
charge and with excess tensive use with
extreme<00:01:17.580> use<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.150> battery<00:01:18.420> will<00:01:18.990> last<00:01:19.020> you

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
extreme use this battery will last you

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.520 
extreme use this battery will last you
almost<00:01:20.549> three<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.150> half<00:01:21.330> days<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.320> you

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
almost three and a half days but if you

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.859 
almost three and a half days but if you
are<00:01:22.650> using<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.220> continuously<00:01:23.880> all<00:01:24.119> day<00:01:24.360> now

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
are using it continuously all day now

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.719 
are using it continuously all day now
then<00:01:25.140> definitely<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.650> will<00:01:25.799> last<00:01:26.070> less<00:01:26.400> time

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
then definitely it will last less time

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.910 
then definitely it will last less time
if<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.360> play<00:01:27.630> games<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.110> will<00:01:28.200> last<00:01:28.439> less<00:01:28.619> time

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
if you play games it will last less time

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.210 
if you play games it will last less time
