then<00:03:35.449> again<00:03:35.840> with<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.139> stability<00:03:36.909> it's<00:03:37.909> like

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
then again with the stability it's like

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.649 
then again with the stability it's like
it'll<00:03:39.829> rot<00:03:40.099> but<00:03:40.579> that's<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.940> dock<00:03:41.150> itself<00:03:41.359> the
