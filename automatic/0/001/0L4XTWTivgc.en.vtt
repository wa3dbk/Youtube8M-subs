00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.400
 welcome to a new one 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.960
 edition of the terminal building block lyric and 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.870
 so also welcome to 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.180
 big fight with the witches king viking 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.260
 metal is the name of the whole and that 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.300
 is now here in this 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.880
 small pack that is the cheapest 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.430
 and smallest set of the new oppitz 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.560
 which have now appeared in late 2014 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.470
 even just 100 a part in it 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.150
 but still costs about 15 euros 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.010
 and if we see how they try 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.480
 to open the pack I have somehow that 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.160
 feeling the cap was earlier too 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.000
 more stable or I have power 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.649
 increased 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.420
 I will again in the next 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.760
 Follow it to find out if they are there 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.460
 what has changed does not matter we do not buy 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.320
 because of the pack well the collector 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.629
 maybe then but also because of that 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.780
 what's in it and we'll take a look 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.149
 right next to it are two little bags and 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.120
 a guide and there is certainly 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.190
 one of the highlights of the whole that just 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.989
 especially a figure 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.240
 bushes lit that we see then 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.100
 even more accurate for the first time 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.130
 that's our three minifigures 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.480
 galadriel left beside then elrond the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.759
 we still know of his wheel and 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.909
 right of the witches king and behind that 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.930
 there is still the fortress dol guldur below 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.250
 be of the wonderful tree 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.140
 Well, I have somehow bigger 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.329
 presented but nothing we look 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.920
 Galadriel and the 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.090
 she actually finds it in her face 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.250
 bit like they also 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.780
 movie already knows from the lord of the rings 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.000
 there it was already like that 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.770
 nice glitter around hankel that fits 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.259
 if necessary, even for a 70 years 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.070
 party and of course the hair nice 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.049
 knotted and that's what you have 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.600
 you also recognize the excursion straight away 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.869
 is known to be an 11 or the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.159
 mens of lorien and what they are there 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.350
 By the way, one hand does not have that right 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.539
 your last douglas shopping but that 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.180
 is like her luminosity that 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.170
 light race deals and we recognize here 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.240
 she already has the two again 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.860
 faces and this face too 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.369
 one knows yes still from the film the gentleman 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.560
 The Rings 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.180
 she'll look right someday 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.950
 really scary fitting to 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.100
 halloween we would rather watch again 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.020
 in the nice face exactly good that is then 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.630
 her mate, I would have said at one 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.940
 elron, who is already with Herr der 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.020
 rings and has first 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.450
 Naturally 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.570
 golden in the hand that is a kind 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.580
 golden sword and also with him the 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.110
 cape a bit woven but not 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.490
 glittering that might still have 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.760
 not ready for the hair also beautiful 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.980
 and he can look strict and also one 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.900
 not nice that is nice too 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.490
 and since we have a nice podcast today 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.320
 Let's just do the nice 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.380
 side forward also nice around in the 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.670
 han still sees this gold braided 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.230
 nice and of course he too 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.640
 sharp ears there we have now 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.100
 witch king that's actually the true one 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.980
 hero of this set though he of course one 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.400
 is evil and his witches king crown 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.650
 has on and only one face has that 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.560
 Let's just say a little bit 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.420
 Otherwise, the lips are presented in the same way 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.800
 Cape has seen better days since 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.410
 are already a few holes in it 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.930
 but still has a sword and how 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.700
 he says it shines and that will become us 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.400
 Now when we look at the whole hold 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.920
 into the light make light and there look 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.140
 So, if that does not somehow 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.090
 fear does not know that either 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.620
 looks really nice so you have to 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.750
 but you have to say pay 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.100
 complete light hold the first time 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.770
 then he turns so brightly 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.890
 lit but it works and gives 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.170
 the set certainly still a certain 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.390
 that now here as I said there writes 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.220
 now it would be him 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.740
 fortress of gold culture and nine 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.480
 haunted tree no, that is 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.320
 kind of a little bit smaller 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.700
 small clip 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.370
 at least there is little down there 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.890
 window where our rattle you there 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.920
 forgot his hand and then 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.970
 next to it, it is a bit a bit emblazoned 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.650
 there is a smaller one here 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.060
 functions that will look at us right away 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.250
 Here we see you in the back 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.650
 the right is a catapult and left 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.050
 that it is a turntable according to the 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.900
 description gets the witches 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.880
 royal power because he listed so yes they 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.430
 can also put on it and let me 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.610
 sometimes rotating mutant human is the 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.230
 powerful we see from here yes 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.580
 good sometime in the summer ending with 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.489
 So do not turn around here right now 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.020
 on the sideboard so then we look 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.940
 but rather in the back times that too 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.770
 funny you designed this rattling man 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.120
 the head is to the right of him 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.169
 you also put it back on then 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.580
 therefore again a complete one 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.110
 skeleton 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.900
 but we can do it for the first time 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.720
 use to shoot down our catapult 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.129
 there come back one to two 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.919
 Fireballs so hot are so easy 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:42.599
 only orange transparent lego small 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.780
 and if we are on top of it 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:48.719
 press cut intent book this 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.979
 but then fits a guide here 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:52.319
 We'll see how the scenarios 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.289
 should be designed 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:56.699
 and there we also see a well endowed one 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.259
 not at the back he may fly 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.020
 then we need if stands on catapult 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.759
 so did king build decades 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.870
 that is nothing complicated now 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.129
 maybe a quarter of an hour if 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.960
 you look at the parts and how 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:07.860
 For me, for example, a head 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.419
 had fallen down 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.250
 but those are fate about the individual 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.110
 It should not be here but that 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.669
 you certainly do not expect this 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.500
 set that for hours of construction fun 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.090
 turn has perhaps we would still 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.150
 rather with this here have the lonely 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.190
 mountain cost but also just under 130 euros for it 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.349
 The dragon I had last 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.469
 already mentioned we will come 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:30.689
 fix to the conclusion nice set price say now 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:33.270
 Everybody has to know himself and nothing 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:34.680
 but three nice wind minifigures 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.300
 especially witches king with the 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.610
 brilliant that did to me 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.590
 good the turntable okay but also that 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.539
 eg in the skeletons with find that 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.150
 catapult was installed a few nice 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.879
 Ideas in there so something 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:51.449
 you like I do as if it were in 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:54.210
 can put a cupboard and then too 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.069
 for today with the crème building block for me 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.110
 rotate a little bit to see how 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:59.550
 the strength I then still collect for the 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.320
 Next follow if you are constantly on 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.800
 clamp on the above and available 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.800
 and now
