00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.550 
lot it's pretty much like foolproof and
everything<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.049> managers<00:01:25.439> over

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
everything so and I have managers over

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.719 
everything so and I have managers over
there<00:01:25.710> with<00:01:25.830> my<00:01:25.890> diamond<00:01:26.070> sword<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.520> I'm<00:01:26.580> gonna

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
there with my diamond sword so I'm gonna

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.100 
there with my diamond sword so I'm gonna
place<00:01:26.880> another<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.330> over<00:01:27.720> here

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
place another one over here

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.380 
place another one over here
and<00:01:28.350> open<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.159> up<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.579> voila<00:01:29.880> there's<00:01:30.210> my

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
and open that up and voila there's my

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.569 
and open that up and voila there's my
diamond<00:01:30.780> sword<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> chests<00:01:32.430> are

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
diamond sword so that in the chests are

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.490 
diamond sword so that in the chests are
actually<00:01:33.060> linked<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:34.140> think<00:01:34.350> that's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
actually linked and I think that's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.469 
actually linked and I think that's
amazing<00:01:34.740> because<00:01:35.220> let's<00:01:35.460> say<00:01:35.640> if<00:01:35.909> you're

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
amazing because let's say if you're

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.920 
amazing because let's say if you're
somewhere<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.970> Minecraft<00:01:38.970> City<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.810> have

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
somewhere in Minecraft City and you have

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.810 
somewhere in Minecraft City and you have
a<00:01:39.960> chest<00:01:40.290> with<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> bunch<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.189> tools<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.700> it

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
a chest with like a bunch of tools in it

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.330 
a chest with like a bunch of tools in it
and<00:01:41.970> then<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.450> go<00:01:42.630> over<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.500> know<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.920> don't

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and then you go over to you know I don't

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.460 
and then you go over to you know I don't
know<00:01:44.460> Enderman<00:01:44.970> town<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.899> have<00:01:46.079> another
