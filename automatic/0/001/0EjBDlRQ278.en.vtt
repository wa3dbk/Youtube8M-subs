00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.830
 Hello, what's up, well, here I bring you 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.830
 as the second part of the tournament 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.070
 silver 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.660
 we were in the semifinals and we 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.570
 play with a team there are players 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.820
 nationality of England after the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.150
 league 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.830
 I think it's the second division of then 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:31.140
 of the barclays and the power 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:34.410
 and then a match 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.850
 a little complicated there we see a good 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.660
 slice of 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.750
 Rabbit Perez and then that slice 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.820
 comes a very bad defense error 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.390
 mark and that then it gains in the jump and 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.460
 put a goal to put it 1 to 0 and 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.980
 here comes another very good slice of the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.649
 rabbit 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.020
 and here I come with the japo rodríguez in 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.410
 a free shot and that heals it very well 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.320
 but then he manages to get out there with him with 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.720
 his defense and he failed to get the goal and 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.180
 here I come with arellano and in the second 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.940
 time there I do a great lack and 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.150
 with the goalkeeper there was like two laps 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.610
 to the player 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.260
 and then here do not charge it with omar 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.570
 arellano that makes a very good 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.650
 definition there by putting it in the 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.890
 unattainable angle for the goalkeeper 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.070
 and we put the 1-1 draw in the second 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.650
 time and then already here I come with 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.140
 Arellano a good center for polished alan 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.940
 that this polished alan player defines very 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.520
 good head 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.580
 they have scored many goals there in the head 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.890
 and here comes here again arellano with 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.390
 Alan polished head again and 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.220
 we support the three to one there in the minute 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.380
 73 and the party was shortly 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.220
 will finish and here a very good slice 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.780
 the rabbit pérez and here an error of the 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.060
 defense scoring very badly and he puts the 3 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.860
 to 2 in the 80th minute then here a shot 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.920
 from outside the area from which 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.560
 fortunately he crashed into the well and so 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.670
 was going to finish this game that 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:19.910
 ended 3 to 12 and then we were 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.910
 classified there to the final 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.810
 there we see the omar party player 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:29.360
 Arellano was a big factor for 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.420
 we went there to the final that they have marked 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.800
 many many goals because this cup of 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:42.470
 silver and here we have the rival of the 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:46.060
 final a team of silver Germans and 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:50.239
 that the truth then the first minutes 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:54.350
 it was very complicated there to pass his defense 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:58.010
 because he defended very well and because neither he nor 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.130
 I managed to score a goal here and here 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.070
 is a play with bad polishing that then 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.100
 It ends badly to go head to head 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.630
 watching him kick and then here I come 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.510
 well removing the rabbit pérez that after 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.330
 he gets the ball and defining very well and 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.390
 then maybe you see the rabbit pérez and 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.590
 then it marks us and the 2 to 0 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:24.010
 here a good slice 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.830
 of the rabbit pérez and badly the mark of 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.379
 there again of the defense that then 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.170
 the German player's feet are there and 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:35.050
 define very well here again to 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:39.069
 marking a stroke similar to the second 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.970
 goal that the note and then then there I do 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:45.640
 some modifications in the alignment 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.459
 putting the players there 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.910
 they attacked a little more and they did more 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.849
 pressure up since we're going down by 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:59.420
 four goals and then we needed to put 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:03.130
 five goals then to win the final 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.190
 after the silver tournament 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.100
 in which I put pause again because no 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.750
 is over 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.960
 after modifying there the 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.560
 players to attack more 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.350
 that the truth is this month 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.830
 This method helped us because 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.960
 the players pressed more had the 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.180
 ball above here we see the one 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.280
 arrival of villalobos there that defines 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.139
 terrible and with the right 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.330
 and then that a shot from outside the area 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:38.290
 which stage very well the goalkeeper and here 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.740
 comes villalobos again there with a very 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:44.110
 good goal and here with polished alan 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.780
 you can luck me and the ball of 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.940
 new in the bounce here a center for 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.650
 the polished and finishing very well there is 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.290
 head 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.570
 we already put the 4 to 3 and it seemed that then 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.020
 we were going to tie the game but it's 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.480
 there a big jump and the forward that 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:06.180
 it can be Rabbit Perez can not get to 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:09.820
 the ball and here 11 for this vaseline 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.960
 very good from him what good if it goes 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:17.980
 by finishing the game we lose the cup 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.250
