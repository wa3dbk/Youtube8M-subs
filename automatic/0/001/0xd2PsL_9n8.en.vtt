00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.540
 Hello 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.220
 now we are going to learn how one 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.380
 long stuffed pork 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.849
 shortly after a very dry meat and 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:20.070
 filling will help to leave even more 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:21.900
 succulent meat is here and it is 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.090
 quite dry so it comes with a 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.010
 layer of fat on top and to leave 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.050
 even tastier make a 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.750
 special seasoning for her and the people 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.309
 begins with the blend of three ingredients 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:37.739
 the carrot celery and onion 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.730
 This mix in the kitchen we call 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.280
 Looks 4 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.440
 we'll put 1 to 2 cloves of garlic 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.079
 and I just give him a break so 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.700
 even since bark and all 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.440
 I 'll get it later, I will not eat it 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.079
 so I can put it that way anyway 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.149
 I'll put oil totti soy oil 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.280
 even if you want you can use 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.539
 Also olive oil 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.539
 I put white wine 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:06.830
 and I will try it with pepper salt 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.390
 kingdom ground at last and last I go 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.600
 put some lines in my case I 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.580
 I put thyme and sage and one 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.230
 Italian seasoning I have here that 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.000
 call the mornings 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.460
 if you do not have this Italian seasoning 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.730
 You can use rosemary in his place. 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.990
 I'll mix it all up so the moose 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.760
 or go inside 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.030
 and this salt will also start to suck 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.160
 meat and make it even more delicious and 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.770
 to end this seasoning I usually 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.510
 put some water because if not 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.910
 have to put a lot of wine and taste 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.290
 to see and get very strong and now I'm going 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.270
 put this seasoning out of a box 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.270
 and I'm going to put meat inside 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.790
 I'll leave this charge from 12 to 24 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.930
 hours within the whole time and always 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.670
 inside the refrigerator 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.190
 The man then stayed 24 hours in the 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.770
 I'll get him out of the fridge. 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.110
 and do the hardest part 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.540
 to work this long that is cut 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.970
 it to fit the filling inside 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.460
 His and hers is such a great trick that I want 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.050
 teach you soon have this layer of 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.209
 fat that is thin but we have 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.010
 than keeping it on top of the rack for 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.870
 keep the moisture slightly 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.760
 it is a very dry face that if 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.220
 People take this and get even more 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.080
 I'll cut in half or open another one 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.390
 bit and cut mall medium so that 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.959
 stuff fill up after the flash and I tied 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.959
 all 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.530
 here the first part so I open a 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.080
 but I did not unwind it whole and 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.880
 now I'm going to double it I'm going to leave it 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.620
 fall back and will open one more time 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.180
 so I created a surface to be able to 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.180
 close it even larger 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.710
 it's ready, see that it 's wide open 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.110
 if I turn it, we can see 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.090
 still that fat cover he has 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.540
 and this cover will stand over him for 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.980
 I turned it over and I'll close 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.140
 In that case, I'll leave it with tomato. 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.940
 dry chopped apricot and walnuts 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.650
 but if at home you want to close some 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.620
 something else can also be at ease 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.620
 A good filling here is chopped prune 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.700
 now after the filling is placed 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.950
 It is important that we also see that 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.900
 it is well closed at the edges but not 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.030
 too much because when it's time to roll it goes 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.470
 push it all the way to the side and I'll 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.470
 curl to close it 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.200
 it is already stuffed and already wrapped 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.909
 on the spot for the power to now tie 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.709
 If I put it on so it goes. 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.720
 open it can it runs risk of 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.299
 drawing or I'll get a string 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.129
 and he 'll roll it in and tie it for 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.049
 he does not develop and does not lose 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.609
 form at the end whenever it is 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.390
 presented for serving the 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.040
 invited 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.879
 I'm going to take the string away so I can 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.879
 cut him cute 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.530
 You 're already tied up, we're people. 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.630
 will put on the chair 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.670
 remembering that to put it not to 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.890
 stick the bottom I'll get some 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.990
 those vegetables that were in the 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.540
 I'll put it in the bottom of it 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.800
 want to know more or less the size 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.040
 himself 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.660
 I'll put it right up there for 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.610
 he keep the unit make a 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.770
 little steam inside the roast 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.870
 I will also put that water together with 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.510
 the wine with the seasonings so that it 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.260
 it is even more tasty and finally I 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.260
 I'll cover with foil 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.300
 this long has around 2 kilos I 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.700
 I'm going to release it for more or less 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.640
 hour and a half or one hour and 45 when 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.070
 I'm close to the delay and 20 to roast myself 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.440
 I'll take that paper off the top and leave it 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.890
 he gilded about 25 minutes 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.890
 half an hour 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.430
 the trl cut ready to serve in the 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.040
 time to cut does not cut too thin 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:29.360
 because if not stuffing falls everything and so 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.360
 that make a long reign 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:40.710

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.039
 taking advantage of the low in the comments 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:45.840
