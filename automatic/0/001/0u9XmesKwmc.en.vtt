00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 good afternoon dear friends to all of us on 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.310
 unpacking and on the review will 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.410
 speaker on the mixer and more simply 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.110
 crane nozzle which allows us 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.200
 save water consumption from 50 to 70 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.240
 percent and maybe even up to 80 than 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.240
 a little bit we can earn 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.809
 products online store so people 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.629
 always want us to save this miracle 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.610
 where your online store costs about 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.220
 2500 rubles well, you can take allegedly 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.079
 shares for 1,400 rubles but I went on and 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.640
 I ordered myself the exact same nozzle with 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.589
 aliexpress for 80 rubles and so i am 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.019
 proceed to unpacking the package in which 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.640
 is a miracle attachment to your 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.470
 you can find usual goods in 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.450
 description under the video whether you can 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.320
 read it in more detail 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:16.080
 the store is just a package wrapped with us 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:19.680
 open all wrapped us still such here 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:27.740
 insulation and here it is our miracle nozzle 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.740
 which makes me pissed off joke 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.740
 joke as we can see we have come from 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.990
 fully original packaging fellow 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.640
 country we have a short description on her 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:44.190
 installation and use 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.190
 Well, I get it, of course, soup . 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.360
 let us now consider nasadochku 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.430
 closer and in more detail the nozzle itself 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.560
 of course you made it completely 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:08.380
 from plastic inside there is such a 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:12.370
 mesh head rotates 360 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.200
 degrees at just such an angle that 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.250
 allows us to send a jet to 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.280
 different sides 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.020
 the adapter for internal is included in the package 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.030
 threading but if we have on the mixer 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.550
 external rhythm and just and unscrew 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.890
 and twist without him the kit includes 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.900
 silicone stick which stands in it 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:35.380
 inside there are two positions on the head 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.390
 the first and second one of the provisions we have 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.070
 switch on the type of tropical shower and 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.900
 the second position of this is our jet 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.000
 but I stay creates check this box 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.100
 the ability to wind on the mixer and 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.650
 then of course share your 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.390
 impressed installation of the nozzle on the crane 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.620
 let's just unscrew to start 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.060
 old nozzle and wind the new in 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.660
 This case was used without 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.310
 adapter 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.519
 so on the tap I have here outside 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.519
 thread just wind it to the end 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.680
 good to delay so that there are no 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.680
 smudges 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.349
 and that's how the nozzle looks at us on to 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.329
 it did not think that it does not spoil 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.579
 design she gates give it some 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:29.469
 zest and so demonstration of the flow of water 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:31.799
 at the first position of the head the second 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:31.799
 position 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:13.290
 at night someone even before the mixer 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.549
 this is a small fixture 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.340
 installed on our spout screen and 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.530
 serving to restrict the flow of water without 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.930
 a noticeable decrease in jet intensity 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.820
 Simply put when use technical 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.500
 arrange a beyaza speaker water intake 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.419
 we will increase just to shocking 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.400
 the numbers are not necessarily what exactly is this 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.600
 here's an aerator saves us water this 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.180
 aviator saves water 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.770
 this operator saves water even those 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.139
 speakers who stand on your screens 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.820
 also saves water 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:42.340
 psychiatrist save water just principle 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.810
 so let's go straight to the test 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.330
 and check how much it goes down or 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.240
 increase the water pressure with the speaker and 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.900
 without him is not so the first test kronos without 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.759
 aerator 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.740
 open the valve at full capacity 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.740
 for 10 seconds let's go 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:12.680
 and the second test of valves with aerator 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.680
 also full pressure than 10 seconds go 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.200
 so we have the test results on the right 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.660
 we have it without a speaker on the left is us 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.300
 which we see that the senator typed 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:38.470
 water a little less savings amounted to 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:41.290
 somewhere around the glass I do not know you noticed 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.860
 or not a nose in the morning was a pressure much 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.510
 stronger water flowed out a little less 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.010
 let's go to the big current as usual 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.620
 that the operator does not reduce your consumption 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.780
 water by 30 percent and promised us 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.360
 online stores and even that seller 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.400
 Aliexpress which this nozzle ordered 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.450
 but in his conscience the most speaker 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.390
 pretty good 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.220
 and easy to use and of course 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.230
 this speaker is not worth the money that 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.840
 ask for it in the online store it 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.980
 one and a half and even 3000 rubles 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.680
 acceptable price of it 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.970
 This is 80 rubles with aliexpress as I have already 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.830
 burned a reference to this product you 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.510
 find in the description under the video also I gave 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.250
 throwing a link to that online store 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.990
 which sells the exact same nozzle 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.020
 but for a lot of money just for 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.360
 comparisons and you do not forget with the flag 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.610
 life course rate this video and 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.220
 write comments what do you think it is 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.990
 nozzles of this video and of course the channel in 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.310
 particular i say goodbye to new 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.510
 meetings and a new parcel bye bye 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.920
 for today we will assume nothing 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:42.340
 I will just tell them 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:44.020
 today we reduce the bracelet to start with 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.820
 we need to do this of course you need 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.370
 decide how much link we need 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.830
 remove in my case it will be four 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:55.170
 links to four links of course will 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.170
 not from one side but 2 from each
