it just out it's not a force effects
lightsaber<00:00:15.660> it's<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.160> Hasbro<00:00:17.160> electronic

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
lightsaber it's the Hasbro electronic

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.170 
lightsaber it's the Hasbro electronic
lightsaber<00:00:19.010> fortunately<00:00:20.010> unfortunately<00:00:20.520> I

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
lightsaber fortunately unfortunately I

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.150 
lightsaber fortunately unfortunately I
don't<00:00:21.359> have<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.600> box<00:00:22.310> so<00:00:23.449> yep<00:00:24.449> I'll<00:00:24.779> begin<00:00:25.160> so

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
don't have the box so yep I'll begin so

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.519 
don't have the box so yep I'll begin so
for<00:00:26.369> starters<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:27.060> guess<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:27.990> lightsabers

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
for starters I guess this lightsabers

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.349 
for starters I guess this lightsabers
pretty<00:00:28.710> good

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
pretty good

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.569 
pretty good
that's<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.660> mr.<00:00:31.320> Hill<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:32.189> looks<00:00:32.430> exactly

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
that's the mr. Hill it looks exactly

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.790 
that's the mr. Hill it looks exactly
like<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.270> ones<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.780> movie<00:00:35.450> mmm<00:00:36.649> it's<00:00:37.649> just

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
like the ones in a movie mmm it's just

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.410 
like the ones in a movie mmm it's just
good<00:00:38.040> thing<00:00:38.250> over<00:00:38.460> here<00:00:38.730> which<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.000> don't<00:00:39.059> know

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
good thing over here which I don't know

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.139 
good thing over here which I don't know
what<00:00:39.620> it<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:42.590> I<00:00:43.590> think<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:44.700> there

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
what it is I think that it is just there

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.639 
what it is I think that it is just there
for<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.559> design<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.590> guess<00:00:47.870> and<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
for the design I guess and you have the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.560 
for the design I guess and you have the
button<00:00:49.890> over<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:51.059> activate<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
button over here to activate the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.119 
button over here to activate the
lightsaber<00:00:52.110> which<00:00:52.379> I'll<00:00:52.530> be<00:00:52.620> doing<00:00:52.980> that

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
lightsaber which I'll be doing that

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:53.889 
lightsaber which I'll be doing that
later

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
later

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.189 
later
now<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.410> knob<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:57.059> switch<00:00:57.510> just<00:00:57.780> nothing

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
now that is knob to switch just nothing

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.090 
now that is knob to switch just nothing
in<00:00:58.289> another<00:00:58.559> designer<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.579> super

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
in another designer it's like super

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.950 
in another designer it's like super
Anakin's<00:01:02.100> lightsaber<00:01:02.480> isn't<00:01:03.480> won-ho

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
Anakin's lightsaber isn't won-ho

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.550 
Anakin's lightsaber isn't won-ho
straight<00:01:04.820> circle<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.180> mean<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:07.020> know<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.260> top

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
straight circle I mean you know the top

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.770 
straight circle I mean you know the top
up<00:01:07.740> here<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.460> circle<00:01:08.939> okay<00:01:09.510> this

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
up here is in this circle okay this

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.010 
up here is in this circle okay this
circle<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.409> part<00:01:10.680> but<00:01:11.060> this<00:01:12.060> part<00:01:12.360> not

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
circle this part but this part not

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.160 
circle this part but this part not
really<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.530> circle<00:01:14.060> like<00:01:15.060> obi-wan<00:01:15.450> Yoda

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
really the circle like obi-wan Yoda

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.980 
really the circle like obi-wan Yoda
sokka's<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.970> all<00:01:18.210> some<00:01:18.420> knowledge<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.840> tight

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
sokka's and all some knowledge a tight

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.620 
sokka's and all some knowledge a tight
lightsaber<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.299> lights<00:01:21.509> a

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
lightsaber so I like this lights a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.380 
lightsaber so I like this lights a
pretty<00:01:21.869> much<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.670> didn't<00:01:23.670> get<00:01:23.880> Obi<00:01:24.210> Wan's

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
pretty much I didn't get Obi Wan's

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.370 
pretty much I didn't get Obi Wan's
lightsabers<00:01:25.110> because<00:01:25.530> his<00:01:26.490> handles<00:01:26.939> too

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
lightsabers because his handles too

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.120 
lightsabers because his handles too
spiky<00:01:30.020> it'll<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.140> much<00:01:31.380> more<00:01:31.650> difficult<00:01:31.829> to

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
spiky it'll be much more difficult to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.990 
spiky it'll be much more difficult to
hold<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.549> when<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.970> are<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:34.170> see<00:01:34.380> module

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
hold it when you are in like see module

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.149 
hold it when you are in like see module
so<00:01:36.000> I'm<00:01:36.840> gonna<00:01:37.079> be<00:01:37.259> doing<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> lightsaber

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
so I'm gonna be doing the lightsaber

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.520 
so I'm gonna be doing the lightsaber
down<00:01:38.390> so<00:01:39.390> these<00:01:39.630> buttons<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.020> activate<00:01:40.170> it

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530
