editor<00:00:15.790> because<00:00:16.150> it<00:00:16.480> was<00:00:16.600> still<00:00:16.750> erratic<00:00:17.289> it

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
editor because it was still erratic it

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.529 
editor because it was still erratic it
was<00:00:17.769> still<00:00:17.920> rendering<00:00:18.250> in<00:00:18.400> 43<00:00:19.060> which<00:00:19.330> it

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:19.539 
was still rendering in 43 which it

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.960 
was still rendering in 43 which it
should<00:00:19.750> be<00:00:19.930> doing<00:00:20.769> something<00:00:21.279> in<00:00:21.550> widescreen

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
should be doing something in widescreen

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.540 
should be doing something in widescreen
which<00:00:22.269> is<00:00:22.449> 16<00:00:22.930> 9<00:00:23.199> however<00:00:23.679> I<00:00:23.859> realized<00:00:24.250> that<00:00:24.400> my

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
which is 16 9 however I realized that my

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.150 
which is 16 9 however I realized that my
monitor<00:00:24.970> has<00:00:25.119> an<00:00:25.269> access<00:00:25.630> for<00:00:25.810> a<00:00:25.840> CEO<00:00:26.109> of<00:00:26.349> 16<00:00:26.859> 11

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
monitor has an access for a CEO of 16 11

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.620 
monitor has an access for a CEO of 16 11
which<00:00:27.550> is<00:00:27.580> kind<00:00:28.150> of<00:00:28.210> strange<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:30.210> yeah<00:00:31.210> solely

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
which is kind of strange so yeah solely

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.180 
which is kind of strange so yeah solely
to<00:00:31.660> mess<00:00:32.020> around<00:00:32.170> of<00:00:32.470> that<00:00:32.619> and<00:00:32.770> stuff<00:00:32.920> to<00:00:33.070> get

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
to mess around of that and stuff to get

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.250 
to mess around of that and stuff to get
things<00:00:33.430> perfect<00:00:33.910> so<00:00:34.120> this<00:00:34.629> is<00:00:34.780> going<00:00:34.930> to<00:00:35.020> be<00:00:35.140> in

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
things perfect so this is going to be in

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.650 
things perfect so this is going to be in
16<00:00:35.920> 9<00:00:36.219> which<00:00:36.579> I<00:00:36.820> don't<00:00:36.879> think<00:00:37.360> should<00:00:37.540> be<00:00:37.629> a

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
16 9 which I don't think should be a

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.360 
16 9 which I don't think should be a
problem<00:00:37.899> because<00:00:38.110> most<00:00:38.440> widescreen<00:00:38.920> monitors

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
problem because most widescreen monitors

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.729 
problem because most widescreen monitors
are<00:00:39.730> you<00:00:40.570> know<00:00:40.690> actually<00:00:41.050> have<00:00:41.320> an<00:00:41.410> aspect

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
are you know actually have an aspect

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.610 
are you know actually have an aspect
ratio<00:00:41.800> of<00:00:42.070> 69<00:00:42.610> so<00:00:42.910> it<00:00:43.000> should<00:00:43.300> look<00:00:43.450> fine<00:00:43.809> but

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
ratio of 69 so it should look fine but

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.350 
ratio of 69 so it should look fine but
I'm<00:00:45.340> not<00:00:45.430> sure<00:00:45.579> and<00:00:45.820> then<00:00:45.910> obviously<00:00:46.030> if<00:00:46.270> you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
I'm not sure and then obviously if you

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.000 
I'm not sure and then obviously if you
have<00:00:46.449> a<00:00:46.480> smaller<00:00:46.809> monitor<00:00:47.260> you<00:00:47.379> off<00:00:47.590> you<00:00:47.890> know

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
have a smaller monitor you off you know

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.500 
have a smaller monitor you off you know
you'll<00:00:48.190> see<00:00:48.309> those<00:00:48.460> square<00:00:48.760> things<00:00:49.090> as<00:00:49.300> well

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
know could be worse I don't know the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.000 
know could be worse I don't know the
screen<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.090> really<00:02:45.300> weird<00:02:45.770> obviously<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:46.830> have

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
screen is really weird obviously I have

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.700 
screen is really weird obviously I have
a<00:02:47.040> couple<00:02:47.370> other<00:02:47.580> ways<00:02:47.820> of<00:02:48.210> you<00:02:49.050> know<00:02:49.170> forcing

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
a couple other ways of you know forcing

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.050 
a couple other ways of you know forcing
it<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:49.950> record<00:02:50.340> in<00:02:50.520> decent<00:02:50.970> formats<00:02:51.390> one<00:02:52.380> being

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
it to record in decent formats one being

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.210 
it to record in decent formats one being
write<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.090> little<00:02:54.540> script<00:02:54.630> thing<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.680> forces

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
write a little script thing that forces

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.330 
write a little script thing that forces
the<00:02:56.400> window<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.820> run<00:02:57.270> at<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:58.340> youtubes

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
the window to run at the youtubes

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.370 
the window to run at the youtubes
default<00:02:59.940> frame<00:03:00.300> which<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:00.990> believe<00:03:01.020> like

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
default frame which is I believe like

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.190 
default frame which is I believe like
720<00:03:02.040> x<00:03:02.250> 480<00:03:02.880> or<00:03:03.060> something<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.870> could<00:03:04.050> have

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
720 x 480 or something and I could have

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.620 
720 x 480 or something and I could have
the<00:03:04.350> window<00:03:04.680> no<00:03:05.370> by<00:03:05.550> default<00:03:05.910> run<00:03:06.210> at<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.420> so

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
the window no by default run at that so

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.620 
the window no by default run at that so
it'd<00:03:06.750> be<00:03:06.780> full<00:03:07.020> screen<00:03:08.180> that<00:03:09.180> kind<00:03:09.420> of<00:03:09.450> take<00:03:09.600> a

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
it'd be full screen that kind of take a

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.050 
it'd be full screen that kind of take a
little<00:03:09.900> bit<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.140> work<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.680> do<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.700> know<00:03:11.850> I
