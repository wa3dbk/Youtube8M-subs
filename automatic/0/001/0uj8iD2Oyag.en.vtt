here we go okay so my triple step so
we're<00:00:03.090> talking<00:00:03.210> about<00:00:03.449> standing<00:00:03.929> on<00:00:04.020> your

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
sideways you'll see a rock step boom a

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.450 
sideways you'll see a rock step boom a
wash<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.080> contained<00:00:25.590> hey<00:00:25.920> someone's<00:00:26.310> the

that way and ever talk about connecting

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.400 
that way and ever talk about connecting
just<00:00:36.000> using<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.450> leaders<00:00:36.690> way<00:00:36.840> out<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
just using the leaders way out on the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.979 
just using the leaders way out on the
followers<00:00:37.860> lower<00:00:38.160> body<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.090> now<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:39.300> have<00:00:39.660> a

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
followers lower body so now we have a

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.470 
followers lower body so now we have a
center<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.739> center<00:00:41.040> connection<00:00:41.579> our<00:00:41.730> feet<00:00:42.270> are

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
center to center connection our feet are

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.510 
center to center connection our feet are
offset<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.440> leader<00:00:43.620> does<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.040> by<00:00:44.190> standing

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
offset the leader does that by standing

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.670 
offset the leader does that by standing
and<00:00:45.000> then<00:00:45.149> moving<00:00:45.300> their<00:00:45.510> arm<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.050> side<00:00:46.289> so

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
and then moving their arm to the side so

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.709 
and then moving their arm to the side so
I<00:00:46.710> walk<00:00:47.039> up<00:00:47.190> my<00:00:47.370> partner<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.239> arm<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
I walk up my partner the arm is on the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.049 
I walk up my partner the arm is on the
side<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.050> connected<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.770> connect<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.730> side

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
side is connected I connect on the side

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.779 
side is connected I connect on the side
of<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.390> by<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.899> then<00:00:52.050> drape<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.559> arm<00:00:53.039> from

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
of the by and then drape the arm from

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.060 
of the by and then drape the arm from
here<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.780> had<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> simple<00:00:55.230> side<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.800> side

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
here we just had a simple side to side

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.590 
here we just had a simple side to side
but<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.520> course<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:56.969> pull<00:00:57.180> sit<00:00:57.420> and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
but of course you can pull sit and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.450 
but of course you can pull sit and
bounce<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:58.020> then<00:00:58.649> when<00:00:58.800> that's<00:00:58.890> feeling<00:00:59.280> good

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
bounce it then when that's feeling good

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.150 
bounce it then when that's feeling good
you<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.329> go<00:01:00.480> through<00:01:00.809> or<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.590> triple<00:01:01.920> step

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
you can go through or the triple step

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.460 
you can go through or the triple step
when<00:01:02.489> through<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> floor<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.960> going<00:01:04.170> down

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
when through the floor and going down

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.789 
when through the floor and going down
good<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.820> without<00:01:06.030> feeling<00:01:06.390> good<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.650> can

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
good and without feeling good you can

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.320 
good and without feeling good you can
use<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.950> little<00:01:08.189> inward<00:01:08.610> motion<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.240> then

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
use a little inward motion and then

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.960 
use a little inward motion and then
release<00:01:09.930> into<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.590> rock<00:01:10.860> step<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.880> have

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
release into the rock step and you have

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.640 
release into the rock step and you have
weight<00:01:12.210> shift<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.750> every<00:01:13.170> motion<00:01:13.380> we

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
weight shift you have every motion we

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.700 
weight shift you have every motion we
have<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.220> rock<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:15.240> step<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.409> side

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
have the rock to step and the side

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.679 
have the rock to step and the side
motion<00:01:17.070> let's<00:01:17.670> really<00:01:17.850> important<00:01:18.240> all<00:01:18.450> those

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
motion let's really important all those

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.320 
motion let's really important all those
ingredients<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.619> elements<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.490> then<00:01:21.180> be

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
ingredients and elements of this then be

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.700 
ingredients and elements of this then be
sure<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.509> put<00:01:21.840> together<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.409> different

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
sure to put together a different

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.710 
sure to put together a different
combination<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.670> can<00:01:23.939> just<00:01:24.060> triple<00:01:24.509> all<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
combination so I can just triple all the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.080 
combination so I can just triple all the
time<00:01:24.930> if<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.170> wanted<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.430> rock<00:01:26.759> step

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
time if I wanted to I can just rock step

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.270 
time if I wanted to I can just rock step
all<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.299> time<00:01:27.600> if<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.840> wanted<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.290> or<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.040> can

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
all the time if I wanted to or I can

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.640 
all the time if I wanted to or I can
stop<00:01:29.670> at<00:01:29.909> any<00:01:29.970> moment<00:01:30.420> if<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.659> wanted<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.990> so

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
stop at any moment if I wanted to so

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.399 
stop at any moment if I wanted to so
again<00:01:31.799> we've<00:01:32.280> evolved<00:01:32.780> we<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:34.020> moment<00:01:34.350> to

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
again we've evolved we just moment to

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.710 
again we've evolved we just moment to
moment<00:01:34.530> dancing<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:35.970> then<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> second<00:01:36.540> class

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
moment dancing so then the second class

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.390 
moment dancing so then the second class
we<00:01:36.930> incorporated<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.439> hands<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.189> talked

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
we incorporated the hands we talked

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.580 
we incorporated the hands we talked

about using the leaders left hand and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.679 
about using the leaders left hand and
lead<00:01:40.829> hand<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.220> follow<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.610> right<00:01:41.790> hand<00:01:42.030> doing

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
lead hand to follow the right hand doing

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.980

the finger strong fingers mean flexible

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.639 
the finger strong fingers mean flexible
arms<00:01:46.579> so<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:48.000> right<00:01:48.420> hand<00:01:48.450> drops<00:01:48.990> on<00:01:49.200> top<00:01:49.439> and

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
arms so the right hand drops on top and

there we go so we have this bracket hole

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.609 
there we go so we have this bracket hole
we<00:02:05.000> talked<00:02:05.210> about<00:02:05.329> I<00:02:05.450> have<00:02:05.750> your<00:02:05.899> lash<00:02:06.110> army<00:02:06.530> to

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
follows keeping the wrist frame and then

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.790 
follows keeping the wrist frame and then
leaders<00:02:11.569> can<00:02:11.720> push<00:02:11.989> it<00:02:12.170> so<00:02:12.560> there's<00:02:12.739> some

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
leaders can push it so there's some

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.320 
leaders can push it so there's some
compression<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.670> then<00:02:14.000> there's<00:02:14.180> some

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
compression and then there's some

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.670 
compression and then there's some
tension<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.840> slit<00:02:15.140> looks<00:02:15.319> like<00:02:15.470> from<00:02:15.560> the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
tension the slit looks like from the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.400 
tension the slit looks like from the
front<00:02:15.970> compression<00:02:16.970> some<00:02:17.450> tension<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:18.290> can

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
front compression some tension you can

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.240 
front compression some tension you can
see<00:02:18.530> down<00:02:18.650> my<00:02:18.860> shirt

positions<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.709> ones<00:02:36.920> we<00:02:37.099> tend<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.430> use<00:02:37.610> most

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
positions the ones we tend to use most

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.720 
positions the ones we tend to use most
often<00:02:38.239> than<00:02:38.870> our<00:02:38.989> arms<00:02:39.290> are<00:02:39.380> relaxed<00:02:39.860> and<00:02:40.010> from

often than our arms are relaxed and from
this<00:02:40.849> position<00:02:41.060> we<00:02:41.420> have<00:02:41.510> four<00:02:41.780> we<00:02:42.019> can<00:02:42.170> do

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
this position we have four we can do

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.559 
this position we have four we can do
what<00:02:42.860> we<00:02:42.980> actually<00:02:43.489> wait<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:44.000> four<00:02:44.150> positions

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
what we actually wait the four positions

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.180 
what we actually wait the four positions
we<00:02:44.660> talked<00:02:44.870> about<00:02:45.049> is<00:02:45.349> doing<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.739> front<00:02:46.040> line

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
we talked about is doing a front line

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.309 
we talked about is doing a front line
often<00:02:47.030> using<00:02:47.299> valve<00:02:47.480> all<00:02:47.630> Alijah<00:02:47.900> used<00:02:48.200> to

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
often using valve all Alijah used to

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.990 
often using valve all Alijah used to
bubble<00:02:48.620> or<00:02:48.709> quite<00:02:48.860> a<00:02:48.890> bit<00:02:49.160> we're<00:02:49.549> in<00:02:49.610> center

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
bubble or quite a bit we're in center

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.820 
bubble or quite a bit we're in center
body<00:02:50.180> betting<00:02:50.599> means<00:02:50.810> slightly<00:02:51.260> than<00:02:51.470> having

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
body betting means slightly than having

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
then we have our counterbalance we

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.400 
then we have our counterbalance we
actually<00:02:55.790> have<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:56.030> help<00:02:56.420> partner<00:02:56.959> to<00:02:57.320> have

the counter mallinger we should actually

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.520 
the counter mallinger we should actually
share<00:02:58.970> center<00:02:59.450> so<00:03:00.079> then<00:03:00.230> when<00:03:00.320> we<00:03:00.350> were<00:03:00.500> a

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
share center so then when we were a

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.410 
share center so then when we were a
closed<00:03:00.829> position<00:03:01.010> we're<00:03:01.640> primarily<00:03:01.880> only<00:03:02.209> did

the<00:03:06.530> way<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.650> counter<00:03:06.890> balance<00:03:07.160> you<00:03:07.850> can<00:03:07.970> see

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
the way to counter balance you can see

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.789 
the way to counter balance you can see
all<00:03:08.329> three<00:03:08.510> of<00:03:08.600> those<00:03:08.720> positions<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.560> then<00:03:09.709> we

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
all three of those positions and then we

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.059 
all three of those positions and then we
incorporate<00:03:10.250> all<00:03:10.519> the<00:03:10.730> rostov's<00:03:11.209> and<00:03:11.390> triples

weight change I'm waiting to match it

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.599 
weight change I'm waiting to match it
it's<00:03:23.150> equal<00:03:23.630> and<00:03:23.900> opposite<00:03:24.470> again<00:03:25.160> not<00:03:25.430> using

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
it's equal and opposite again not using

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.270 
it's equal and opposite again not using
music<00:03:26.239> not<00:03:26.660> using<00:03:27.049> verbal<00:03:27.410> cues<00:03:27.680> not<00:03:27.950> using

physical like arm like counter off cues

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.550 
physical like arm like counter off cues
just<00:03:32.120> having<00:03:32.389> the<00:03:32.480> leader<00:03:32.690> connect<00:03:33.170> with<00:03:33.530> a

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
just having the leader connect with a

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.580 
just having the leader connect with a
follow<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.310> then<00:03:34.760> deciding<00:03:35.359> by<00:03:35.690> moving<00:03:36.019> their

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
follow and then deciding by moving their

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.039 
follow and then deciding by moving their
body<00:03:36.859> when<00:03:37.489> they<00:03:37.670> want<00:03:37.880> something<00:03:38.209> to<00:03:38.840> happen

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
body when they want something to happen

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.590 
body when they want something to happen
so<00:03:39.859> I<00:03:40.130> can<00:03:40.370> pulse<00:03:40.609> my<00:03:40.790> body<00:03:41.000> I<00:03:41.150> can<00:03:41.359> move<00:03:41.480> it

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
so I can pulse my body I can move it

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.660 
so I can pulse my body I can move it
side<00:03:41.780> to<00:03:41.810> side<00:03:42.109> and<00:03:42.410> then<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.100> can<00:03:43.130> leave<00:03:43.519> these

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
side to side and then I can leave these

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.839 
side to side and then I can leave these
figures<00:03:44.180> in<00:03:44.359> any<00:03:44.630> combination<00:03:45.049> then<00:03:45.560> we

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
figures in any combination then we

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.920 
figures in any combination then we

patterns same footwork of course you

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.309 
patterns same footwork of course you
change<00:03:54.310> out<00:03:54.549> these<00:03:54.730> patterns<00:03:55.319> because

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
change out these patterns because

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.780 
change out these patterns because
they're<00:03:56.560> just<00:03:56.739> elements<00:03:57.340> you're<00:03:57.519> just

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
they're just elements you're just

they're just elements you're just
leaving<00:03:58.030> these<00:03:58.299> elements<00:03:58.840> mulch<00:03:59.079> moment

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
leaving these elements mulch moment

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.039 
leaving these elements mulch moment
right<00:04:00.129> so<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.849> leader<00:04:01.030> goes<00:04:01.209> in<00:04:01.389> from<00:04:01.629> home

right so the leader goes in from home

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.360 
right so the leader goes in from home
don't<00:04:03.040> play<00:04:04.030> with<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.209> ideas<00:04:05.040> awesome
