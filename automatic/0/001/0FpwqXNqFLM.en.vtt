00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.590
 hello all guys are peligna seats 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.920
 in this new video tutorial I want 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.619
 show you a farm of my invention 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.420
 this part is not complete missing a 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.670
 piece 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.910
 let's say it's optional I don't have now 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.689
 wanted to put it for because I want to make you 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.270
 to see 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.120
 the pharma 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.530
 in a more compact way because I have to 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.220
 to say that I really managed a lot 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:47.360
 small and that piece then optional 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.690
 landra a lava a little larger but later 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.879
 I'll explain well let's see in the meantime 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.239
 how it works then they operate all 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:01:00.200
 the era eggs will be prepared and 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.670
 they will occasionally leave their cousins ​​here 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.530
 can as you see 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:09.080
 now we have to wait for it to cook 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:11.060
 they get the boys back here now 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.610
 they have grown however as you can see 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:18.979
 they are both large and small and the 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:22.160
 problem of certain farms is that if we find 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.259
 we are chicks big and small 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.869
 forced to kill them both that is both 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.450
 But those small and big ones 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.090
 this is a huge waste because 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.770
 expect the little chick to grow 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:41.420
 we will have more meat and later when there 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.490
 we kill for this there is but not 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.810
 worry because I also thought 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.520
 to this and I assure you that they will not come 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.319
 killed 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:53.390
 then by clicking this button we see 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:56.690
 water invades the space where where 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.560
 we shot the chickens and now we have to 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:05.660
 wait for software chickens to choke 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:07.420
 drowned by water here they are and how 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.150
 see only the big ones died 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.990
 the little ones are not dead because if 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.260
 you see they are in lauper and i am given 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.300
 that they are small just occupy 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.640
 the dock space for instead with i 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.230
 large or also occupy the space of the 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.770
 block above it for and then will come 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.800
 killed by water and drop day to day 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.560
 all grown hens will all end up 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.280
 inside the box for boys I have you 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.280
 explained how it works now I would say of 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.940
 see how well girls are built 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.600
 here we go again I would say to see to go to 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.430
 see what materials we need then 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.340
 as for the rest it will come 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.890
 a red stone torch a button 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:00.320
 one goes of the red stone and 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:04.220
 repeaters a hopper of self and gods 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.470
 then excuse me for glass dispensers 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.220
 a block we want in this 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.990
 In case I give the clay a crate or bucket 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.000
 of water 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.910
 then we start by placing with col 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.050
 place the crate at a point that 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.280
 we want us here for example after that 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.740
 break that there is little space 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.750
 in the inventory after which we take the 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.670
 hopper and holding down the button 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.910
 We apply capital letters on the back of the 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:35.030
 cash so we then take the block of 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:40.070
 block at random and we must position it at 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:42.590
 cash data and in this way then 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.350
 behind the blocks we are four 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.720
 block this way and let's break those 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:52.250
 below and finally we are a block here 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.180
 liked a moment to see 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.950
 ok now we have to place the dispensers 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.260
 then who knows a block here and there 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.780
 we put a dispenser and break a 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.760
 block below then allow that other 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.890
 we must hold the key down 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.670
 uppercase while a block here and one here 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.180
 and then one here and then clicking on the block 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.699
 we'll place it upside down, say 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.690
 we break the blocks in excess and then 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.250
 let's take the glass 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.850
 holding down the lower case key 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.720
 we put it on the crate and here and we have 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.190
 game and now the part 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.740
 the skeleton of our farm is 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.720
 complete now instead we go to see i 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.050
 direct mechanisms then here we put 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.500
 a lever with a repeater behind and then 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.540
 we connect the reston to the dispenser 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.610
 holding down the uppercase key 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:48.430
 we manage to position the rectum above 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:52.160
 spencers and will work perfectly 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:56.060
 then we take a button which we put 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:05:00.710
 of the rest here behind a lever and here 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:03.220
 above a lever and inside a dispenser 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.220
 bucket of water 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:09.290
 in this way a little kiss is ok 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.230
 bug of this pharma is that if we 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.270
 we have activated line and water 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.190
 outside we can no longer pull in 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.930
 the water 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.320
 we have to deactivate the rest here and then 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:24.020
 we can pull it in now instead of you 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.480
 show the optional part of the 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.190
 car that is a chicken coop above the 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.070
 car that will allow us to have one 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:34.430
 stock up on eggs here in here 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.590
 I recommend you occupy more space but 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.540
 I advise you to do it we have to 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.210
 moment to change the direct circuit 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.490
 let's split the rest here and here here 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.070
 we add block behind the dispenser 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:50.390
 a repeater and put it this way 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:52.100
 razon and then after that holding 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:55.430
 the uppercase key we put one 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:58.370
 hopper over the repeater and the 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.870
 we must hold the key down 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.440
 upper case we put a pack of glass a 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:07.690
 side and in this way we owe it 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.690
 completely surround the glass 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.620
 we pass the corners for a more reason 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.380
 that other aesthetic others by way of a 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.780
 block and now we must spur the 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.510
 then you have to use eggs 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.669
 normal and playing a chick and then 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.600
 wait for one to grow more obviously 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:25.640
 puccini 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:31.880
 I instead use the eggs available in 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:34.090
 creative I shoot 4 then block pitch 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.190
 press pack the corners 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.330
 here it is this way the hens 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.850
 they will make the eggs that go 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:42.010
 directly in the distributor and this one 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:45.820
 what I recommend it because a lot 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:47.770
 practice anyway the tutorial ends here 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.600
 I hope you have been helpful dates 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.000
 take a look at the channel you like 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.110
 if you liked the video and would say a 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.110
 greeting from cariglia
