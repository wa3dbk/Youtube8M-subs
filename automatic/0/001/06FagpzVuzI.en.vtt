problems on the back of the box here you

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.020 
problems on the back of the box here you
can<00:00:49.469> kind<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.680> see<00:00:49.770> something<00:00:50.219> funny<00:00:50.430> as<00:00:50.700> this

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030

can kind of see something funny as this
image<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.809> back<00:00:52.020> looks<00:00:52.440> much<00:00:52.770> different

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
image on the back looks much different

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.150 
image on the back looks much different
from<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.550> toy<00:00:53.750> possibly<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> early<00:00:55.469> prototype

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
from the toy possibly a early prototype

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.950 
from the toy possibly a early prototype
and<00:00:56.370> why<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:56.940> took<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.239> long<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:57.629> us<00:00:57.899> to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
and why it took so long for us to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.529 
and why it took so long for us to
finally<00:00:58.320> see<00:00:58.710> him<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.160> shelves<00:00:59.609> even<00:01:00.329> on

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
finally see him on the shelves even on

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.090 
finally see him on the shelves even on
the<00:01:00.690> bottom<00:01:01.020> here<00:01:01.199> he<00:01:01.320> was<00:01:01.410> always<00:01:01.620> displayed

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the bottom here he was always displayed

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.700 
the bottom here he was always displayed
like<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.699> missing<00:01:03.570> his<00:01:03.780> writing<00:01:04.260> saddle

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
like this missing his writing saddle

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.280 
like this missing his writing saddle
maybe<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.100> different<00:01:05.460> wings<00:01:06.080> looks<00:01:07.080> like

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
maybe a different wings looks like

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.010 
maybe a different wings looks like
different<00:01:08.070> projectile<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.420> there<00:01:09.630> are<00:01:09.810> some

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
different projectile so there are some

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.380 
different projectile so there are some
differences<00:01:10.409> from<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.520> image<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.030> what<00:01:12.270> we

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
differences from the image and what we

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.270 
differences from the image and what we
finally<00:01:12.840> get<00:01:13.049> but<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.650> looks<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:13.979> what<00:01:14.159> we

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
finally get but it looks like what we

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.429 
finally get but it looks like what we
finally<00:01:14.729> get<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.150> way<00:01:15.360> finally<00:01:15.869> cooler<00:01:16.140> than

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
finally get is way finally cooler than

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.280 
finally get is way finally cooler than
what<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.920> finally<00:01:17.430> could<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.759> got

sorts<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.099> things<00:04:02.250> are<00:04:02.430> going<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:02.639> happen<00:04:03.200> he

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
sorts of things are going to happen he

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.780 
sorts of things are going to happen he
fires<00:04:04.500> that<00:04:04.739> projectile<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.489> you<00:04:05.549> can<00:04:05.670> kind

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
fires that projectile and you can kind

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.339 
fires that projectile and you can kind
of<00:04:05.879> see<00:04:06.060> there's<00:04:06.239> a<00:04:06.299> little<00:04:06.359> bit<00:04:06.720> of<00:04:06.780> ramming

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
of see there's a little bit of ramming

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.379 
of see there's a little bit of ramming
action<00:04:07.739> with<00:04:07.889> this<00:04:08.069> head<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.639> process<00:04:09.150> so

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
action with this head in the process so

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.080 
action with this head in the process so
pretty<00:04:10.170> cool<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.680> powerful<00:04:10.889> punch<00:04:11.639> on<00:04:11.879> that

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
pretty cool and powerful punch on that

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.910 
pretty cool and powerful punch on that
and<00:04:12.389> i<00:04:12.569> would<00:04:12.750> say<00:04:12.930> that<00:04:12.959> projectile<00:04:13.650> flew

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
and i would say that projectile flew

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.699 
and i would say that projectile flew
about<00:04:14.159> 10<00:04:14.489> feet<00:04:15.169> articulation<00:04:16.169> getting<00:04:16.470> much

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
about 10 feet articulation getting much

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.860 
about 10 feet articulation getting much
better<00:04:16.949> as<00:04:17.220> these<00:04:17.430> dragons<00:04:17.970> advance<00:04:18.570> in<00:04:18.780> the

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
better as these dragons advance in the

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.710 
better as these dragons advance in the
toy<00:04:19.049> line<00:04:19.349> we<00:04:19.799> now<00:04:20.010> have<00:04:20.280> four<00:04:21.000> legs<00:04:21.329> with<00:04:21.690> a

but<00:04:53.940> I'm<00:04:54.270> kind<00:04:54.539> of<00:04:54.599> tired<00:04:54.870> of<00:04:55.199> trying<00:04:55.560> those

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
but I'm kind of tired of trying those

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.770 
but I'm kind of tired of trying those
they<00:04:55.979> just<00:04:56.159> never<00:04:56.370> work<00:04:56.729> so<00:04:57.180> I<00:04:57.210> just<00:04:57.510> kind<00:04:57.720> of

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
they just never work so I just kind of

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.580 
they just never work so I just kind of
sit<00:04:58.020> them<00:04:58.110> on<00:04:58.260> top<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:58.889> works<00:04:59.699> pretty<00:05:00.030> well

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
sit them on top and works pretty well

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.750 
sit them on top and works pretty well
unfortunately<00:05:01.590> i<00:05:01.770> believe<00:05:02.070> skull<00:05:02.340> crushers<00:05:02.729> a

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
unfortunately i believe skull crushers a

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.149 
unfortunately i believe skull crushers a
much<00:05:03.240> larger<00:05:03.750> dragon<00:05:04.229> and<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.530> scale<00:05:04.979> of<00:05:05.010> this

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:05.159 
much larger dragon and the scale of this

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:07.339 
much larger dragon and the scale of this
guy's<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:05.610> little<00:05:06.060> bit<00:05:06.240> small<00:05:06.750> and<00:05:07.020> I

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
guy's a little bit small and I

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.350 
guy's a little bit small and I
understand<00:05:07.919> the<00:05:08.130> toys<00:05:08.340> have<00:05:08.580> to<00:05:08.729> fit<00:05:09.090> in<00:05:09.240> these

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
understand the toys have to fit in these

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.750 
understand the toys have to fit in these
boxes<00:05:09.630> and<00:05:10.139> and<00:05:10.260> contain<00:05:10.919> a<00:05:10.949> proportional

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
boxes and and contain a proportional

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.879 
boxes and and contain a proportional
amount<00:05:12.150> of<00:05:12.330> plastic<00:05:12.570> to<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.139> selling<00:05:13.590> point

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
amount of plastic to the selling point

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.700 
amount of plastic to the selling point
so<00:05:14.490> that's<00:05:14.970> understandable<00:05:15.659> but<00:05:16.409> it<00:05:16.560> would<00:05:16.680> be

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
so that's understandable but it would be

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.620 
so that's understandable but it would be
really<00:05:17.039> cool<00:05:17.280> to<00:05:17.490> see<00:05:17.669> a<00:05:17.849> larger<00:05:18.360> skull

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
really cool to see a larger skull
