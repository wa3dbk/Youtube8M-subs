00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
they're gonna last as long as you take

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.790 
they're gonna last as long as you take
care<00:02:15.300> of<00:02:15.569> them<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:15.780> don't<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.170> know<00:02:16.260> drop<00:02:16.590> and

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
care of them you don't you know drop and

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.740 
care of them you don't you know drop and
break<00:02:16.980> them<00:02:17.280> they<00:02:17.880> last<00:02:18.090> quite<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.360> long<00:02:18.450> time

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
break them they last quite a long time

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.970 
break them they last quite a long time
so<00:02:19.140> it's<00:02:19.380> definitely<00:02:19.680> worth<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.860> investment

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
our humidity stays pretty high so we'd

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.770

year we want because honestly over
feeding<00:04:44.870> your<00:04:45.050> animals<00:04:45.229> it's<00:04:45.530> just<00:04:45.770> as<00:04:45.889> bad<00:04:46.039> as

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:46.159 
feeding your animals it's just as bad as

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:48.580 
feeding your animals it's just as bad as
under<00:04:46.460> feeding<00:04:46.789> them<00:04:46.909> if<00:04:47.840> you<00:04:47.930> overfeed<00:04:48.319> they

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
under feeding them if you overfeed they

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.640 
under feeding them if you overfeed they
can<00:04:48.710> get<00:04:48.830> fatty<00:04:49.129> liver<00:04:49.430> disease<00:04:49.520> they<00:04:50.240> start

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
can get fatty liver disease they start

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.499 
can get fatty liver disease they start
metabolizing<00:04:51.650> food<00:04:51.889> far<00:04:52.370> too<00:04:52.550> fast<00:04:52.849> and<00:04:53.270> they

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
metabolizing food far too fast and they

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.499 
metabolizing food far too fast and they
get<00:04:54.220> much<00:04:55.220> less<00:04:55.460> than<00:04:55.699> nutrition<00:04:56.150> and<00:04:56.300> more<00:04:56.419> of

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
get much less than nutrition and more of

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.170 
get much less than nutrition and more of
the<00:04:56.599> fat<00:04:56.900> and<00:04:57.169> the<00:04:57.319> bad<00:04:57.530> things<00:04:57.830> from<00:04:58.159> the<00:04:58.280> the

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
the fat and the bad things from the the

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.839 
the fat and the bad things from the the
rodents<00:04:59.509> and<00:04:59.810> so<00:05:00.560> they<00:05:00.680> start<00:05:00.889> keeping<00:05:01.430> more

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
rodents and so they start keeping more

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.839 
rodents and so they start keeping more
fat<00:05:02.210> and<00:05:02.569> less<00:05:02.659> nutrition<00:05:03.620> and<00:05:03.889> they<00:05:04.639> keep

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 
fat and less nutrition and they keep

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:06.369 
fat and less nutrition and they keep
wanting<00:05:05.150> more<00:05:05.479> and<00:05:05.539> more<00:05:05.780> food<00:05:06.050> because

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:06.379 
wanting more and more food because

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:10.119 
wanting more and more food because
they're<00:05:06.469> metabolizing<00:05:07.099> it<00:05:07.190> much<00:05:07.340> faster<00:05:09.129> we

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:10.129 
they're metabolizing it much faster we

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.629 
they're metabolizing it much faster we
just<00:05:10.340> stick<00:05:10.520> to<00:05:10.699> the<00:05:10.729> one<00:05:11.469> you<00:05:12.469> know<00:05:12.590> one<00:05:13.159> one

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
just stick to the one you know one one

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.230 
just stick to the one you know one one

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
their body we stick to that rule and we

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.550 
their body we stick to that rule and we
we<00:05:24.590> don't<00:05:24.710> really<00:05:24.889> sway<00:05:25.250> from<00:05:25.520> it<00:05:26.560> hatchlings

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
we don't really sway from it hatchlings

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.709 
we don't really sway from it hatchlings
on<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:27.770> other<00:05:27.949> hand<00:05:28.250> they<00:05:29.120> get<00:05:29.330> a<00:05:29.360> little<00:05:29.629> bit

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:29.719 
on the other hand they get a little bit

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:31.120 
on the other hand they get a little bit
different<00:05:30.020> schedule<00:05:30.380> sometimes<00:05:30.800> and<00:05:31.069> it

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
different schedule sometimes and it

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.200 
different schedule sometimes and it
might<00:05:31.310> get<00:05:31.460> a<00:05:31.520> little<00:05:31.550> bit<00:05:31.759> bigger<00:05:31.880> meal

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
might get a little bit bigger meal

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:27.289 
center of the newspaper so it would be

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:30.640 
center of the newspaper so it would be
about<00:06:27.469> that<00:06:27.620> size<00:06:29.289> you<00:06:30.289> know<00:06:30.379> absolutely
