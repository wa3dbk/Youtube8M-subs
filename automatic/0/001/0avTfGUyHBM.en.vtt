okay<00:00:00.210> here<00:00:00.329> we<00:00:00.420> are<00:00:00.450> the<00:00:00.659> first<00:00:00.780> day<00:00:01.050> of<00:00:01.170> summer

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:01.700 
okay here we are the first day of summer

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.210 
okay here we are the first day of summer
with<00:00:02.700> the<00:00:02.879> Princeton<00:00:03.659> hydro<00:00:04.049> we're<00:00:04.950> gonna<00:00:05.040> do

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
with the Princeton hydro we're gonna do

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.839 
with the Princeton hydro we're gonna do
some<00:00:05.490> water<00:00:05.970> sampling<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:07.220> show<00:00:08.220> you<00:00:08.280> how<00:00:08.730> we

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
some water sampling and show you how we

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.209 
some water sampling and show you how we
can<00:00:08.940> do<00:00:09.059> it<00:00:09.150> ourselves

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
can do it ourselves

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.919 
can do it ourselves
okay<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:12.210> first<00:00:12.450> thing<00:00:12.630> we're<00:00:12.750> going<00:00:12.870> to

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
okay the the first thing we're going to

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.060 
okay the the first thing we're going to
do<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.200> we're<00:00:13.380> going<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.530> take<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> sec<00:00:13.950> you

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
do is we're going to take a sec you

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.369 
do is we're going to take a sec you
depth<00:00:14.250> so<00:00:15.150> it's<00:00:15.389> basically<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:15.900> got<00:00:16.109> tell<00:00:16.320> you

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
depth so it's basically you got tell you

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.220 
depth so it's basically you got tell you
your<00:00:16.529> water<00:00:16.710> clarity<00:00:17.840> so<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:18.869> mean<00:00:19.080> it's<00:00:19.199> a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
your water clarity so I mean it's a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.109 
your water clarity so I mean it's a
pretty<00:00:19.380> simple<00:00:20.070> procedure<00:00:20.189> here's<00:00:21.000> your

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
pretty simple procedure here's your

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.480 
pretty simple procedure here's your
second<00:00:21.449> disc<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:22.710> grated<00:00:23.189> off<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
second disc and it's grated off the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.019 
second disc and it's grated off the
meter<00:00:23.730> meter<00:00:24.300> lines<00:00:25.490> so<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.550> pretty<00:00:26.939> much

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
meter meter lines so you pretty much

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:35.000 
meter meter lines so you pretty much
just<00:00:28.099> dip<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.189> off<00:00:29.310> side<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:32.630> and<00:00:33.680> you<00:00:34.680> want

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
just dip it off side of it and you want

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.100 
just dip it off side of it and you want
to<00:00:35.160> take<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.370> down<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:36.630> where<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.840> can't

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
to take it down just to where you can't

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.170 
to take it down just to where you can't
see<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.700> technically<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.790> want<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:38.969> take<00:00:39.059> it

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
see it technically you want to take it

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.610 
see it technically you want to take it
down<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:39.300> where<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.719> can't<00:00:39.930> see<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.260> pull<00:00:40.530> it

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
down just where you can't see it pull it

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.080 
down just where you can't see it pull it
off<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.829> where<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.040> see<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.309> again<00:00:41.520> average

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
off to where you see it again average

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.959 
off to where you see it again average
there's<00:00:42.300> two<00:00:42.540> taps<00:00:43.010> pretty<00:00:44.010> much<00:00:44.160> take<00:00:44.850> it

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
there's two taps pretty much take it

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:53.180 
there's two taps pretty much take it
down<00:00:45.149> there<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:45.750> can't

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.640 

so<00:00:53.460> there<00:00:53.700> she<00:00:53.910> is

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
so there she is

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.150 
so there she is
just<00:00:56.490> marked<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.940> off<00:00:57.120> with<00:00:57.270> your<00:00:57.390> finger<00:00:58.160> back

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
just marked it off with your finger back

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:07.880 
just marked it off with your finger back
up

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.130 

so<00:01:08.890> let's<00:01:09.160> about<00:01:09.370> let's<00:01:10.000> see<00:01:10.150> about<00:01:10.240> 1.85

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
so let's about let's see about 1.85

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.010 
so let's about let's see about 1.85
which<00:01:12.040> is<00:01:12.160> pretty<00:01:12.310> good<00:01:12.460> clarity<00:01:12.880> in<00:01:13.000> yes<00:01:13.210> is

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
which is pretty good clarity in yes is

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.230 
which is pretty good clarity in yes is
it<00:01:14.170> yeah<00:01:14.530> it's<00:01:14.710> not<00:01:14.890> bad<00:01:14.950> for<00:01:15.340> this<00:01:15.970> election

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
it yeah it's not bad for this election

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.810 
it yeah it's not bad for this election
yeah<00:01:17.050> John<00:01:17.290> Lee<00:01:17.440> recommends<00:01:17.979> anything<00:01:18.580> over<00:01:18.790> a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
yeah John Lee recommends anything over a

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.580 
yeah John Lee recommends anything over a
meter<00:01:19.060> you<00:01:19.150> know<00:01:19.420> it's<00:01:19.540> pretty<00:01:19.690> good<00:01:19.900> pretty

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
meter you know it's pretty good pretty

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.820 
meter you know it's pretty good pretty
decent<00:01:21.010> for<00:01:21.040> recreation

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
decent for recreation

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.760 
decent for recreation
so<00:01:23.830> just<00:01:24.610> mark<00:01:24.820> that<00:01:25.000> down<00:01:25.150> a<00:01:25.210> book<00:01:25.510> here<00:01:25.810> it's

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
so just mark that down a book here it's

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.600 
so just mark that down a book here it's
important<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.190> take<00:01:27.580> notes<00:01:27.910> of<00:01:28.000> everything<00:01:28.270> go

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.320 

so<00:01:32.270> just<00:01:32.570> 125<00:01:33.320> meters<00:01:33.880> we<00:01:34.880> also<00:01:35.000> have<00:01:35.210> our

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
so just 125 meters we also have our

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.240 
so just 125 meters we also have our
maximum<00:01:35.750> depth<00:01:35.990> which<00:01:36.320> we<00:01:36.500> just<00:01:36.650> recorded<00:01:37.100> off

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
maximum depth which we just recorded off

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.160 
maximum depth which we just recorded off
our<00:01:37.430> depth<00:01:37.610> finder<00:01:38.000> now<00:01:38.510> you<00:01:38.570> could<00:01:38.720> also<00:01:38.870> if

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
our depth finder now you could also if

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.350 
our depth finder now you could also if
you<00:01:39.290> need<00:01:39.440> to<00:01:39.590> just<00:01:39.830> lower<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.640> second<00:01:40.970> discus

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
you need to just lower the second discus

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.830 
you need to just lower the second discus
down<00:01:41.600> there<00:01:41.810> as<00:01:42.080> far<00:01:42.350> down<00:01:42.380> suppose<00:01:43.720> we<00:01:44.720> have<00:01:44.810> a

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
down there as far down suppose we have a

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.630 
down there as far down suppose we have a
handheld<00:01:45.140> GPS<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:45.890> we<00:01:45.950> took<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.190> coordinates

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
handheld GPS and we took the coordinates

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.470 
handheld GPS and we took the coordinates
of<00:01:46.760> the<00:01:46.850> sampling<00:01:47.210> location<00:01:48.010> just<00:01:49.010> for

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
of the sampling location just for

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.000 
of the sampling location just for
consistency's<00:01:50.480> sake<00:01:50.660> try<00:01:51.620> to<00:01:51.740> keep<00:01:51.890> your

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
consistency's sake try to keep your

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.090 
consistency's sake try to keep your
sampling<00:01:52.370> stations<00:01:52.900> generally<00:01:53.900> the<00:01:54.350> same<00:01:54.560> so

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
sampling stations generally the same so

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.320 
sampling stations generally the same so
when<00:01:55.220> you<00:01:55.310> come<00:01:55.460> back<00:01:55.610> which<00:01:55.850> will<00:01:56.000> do<00:01:56.210> the

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
when you come back which will do the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.510 
when you come back which will do the
center<00:01:56.570> spot<00:01:56.810> yep<00:01:57.410> yep<00:01:57.710> try<00:01:58.040> get<00:01:58.220> as<00:01:58.280> close<00:01:58.460> to

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
center spot yep yep try get as close to

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.040 
center spot yep yep try get as close to
cut<00:01:59.410> the<00:02:00.410> neck<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.770> next<00:02:01.040> thing<00:02:01.160> we<00:02:01.280> do<00:02:01.970> is<00:02:02.050> we

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
cut the neck the next thing we do is we

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.140 
cut the neck the next thing we do is we
move<00:02:03.200> on<00:02:03.410> to<00:02:03.590> our<00:02:03.620> water<00:02:04.160> quality<00:02:04.400> meter<00:02:04.820> says

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
move on to our water quality meter says

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.980 
move on to our water quality meter says

take<00:02:19.400> measurements<00:02:19.970> every<00:02:20.390> one<00:02:20.570> meter<00:02:20.840> going

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
take measurements every one meter going

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.110 
take measurements every one meter going
down<00:02:21.950> through<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.160> water<00:02:22.340> column<00:02:22.459> so<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:22.970> get

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
down through the water column so you get

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.190 
down through the water column so you get
a<00:02:23.150> nice<00:02:23.270> profile<00:02:23.870> of<00:02:24.020> everything<00:02:25.990> so<00:02:26.990> this

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
a nice profile of everything so this

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.900 
a nice profile of everything so this
actually<00:02:27.650> what's<00:02:28.010> nice<00:02:28.220> is<00:02:28.459> this<00:02:28.580> stores

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
actually what's nice is this stores

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.570 
actually what's nice is this stores
everything<00:02:29.270> on<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.600> PDA<00:02:29.930> for<00:02:30.080> us<00:02:30.459> so<00:02:31.459> we'll

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
everything on the PDA for us so we'll

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.080 
everything on the PDA for us so we'll
have<00:02:31.730> this<00:02:31.910> on

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:54.140 

basically<00:02:36.090> just<00:02:36.240> entered<00:02:37.140> in<00:02:37.260> my<00:02:37.670> location

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.350

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.850 
parameter has CERN for there's a little
circulator<00:03:00.930> there<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.319> keep<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.560> water<00:03:03.860> so

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
circulator there to keep the water so

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.880 
circulator there to keep the water so
you're<00:03:04.980> honest<00:03:05.269> measurements<00:03:06.269> are<00:03:06.390> accurate

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
you're honest measurements are accurate

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.229 
you're honest measurements are accurate
this<00:03:07.890> is<00:03:08.040> just<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.280> weighted<00:03:08.640> cuff<00:03:08.879> that<00:03:09.090> goes

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
this is just a weighted cuff that goes

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.500 
this is just a weighted cuff that goes
on<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.660> it's<00:03:09.959> got<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.140> protect<00:03:10.530> some<00:03:10.709> firms<00:03:14.510> the

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
on it it's got to protect some firms the

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.820 
on it it's got to protect some firms the
first<00:03:15.810> thing<00:03:15.959> I'd<00:03:16.080> like<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.230> do<00:03:16.470> this<00:03:16.620> from<00:03:16.769> the

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
first thing I'd like to do this from the

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.240 
first thing I'd like to do this from the
word<00:03:17.069> snaps<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.730> just<00:03:18.470> put<00:03:19.470> this<00:03:19.590> in<00:03:19.799> here<00:03:20.069> and

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
word snaps I just put this in here and

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.400 
word snaps I just put this in here and
check<00:03:20.580> my<00:03:20.730> death<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.209> make<00:03:21.360> sure<00:03:24.200> this<00:03:25.200> was

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
check my death to make sure this was

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.080 
check my death to make sure this was
calibrated<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:26.099> approval<00:03:26.489> for<00:03:26.700> each<00:03:26.730> brand

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
calibrated this approval for each brand

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:38.080 
calibrated this approval for each brand
to<00:03:28.019> do<00:03:28.470> that

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.990 

so<00:03:38.720> what<00:03:38.870> we'll<00:03:38.989> do<00:03:39.140> is<00:03:39.260> we'll<00:03:39.410> take<00:03:39.590> a<00:03:39.620> surface

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
so what we'll do is we'll take a surface

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.800 
so what we'll do is we'll take a surface
measurement<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:41.510> then<00:03:42.140> we'll<00:03:42.290> go<00:03:42.410> down<00:03:46.810> so

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
measurement and then we'll go down so

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.570 
measurement and then we'll go down so
yes<00:03:48.020> it's<00:03:48.260> tough<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.590> see<00:03:48.800> what<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.010> Sun<00:03:49.310> but

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
yes it's tough to see what the Sun but

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.199 
yes it's tough to see what the Sun but
you<00:03:49.849> can<00:03:50.030> see<00:03:50.239> her<00:03:50.300> kind<00:03:50.900> of<00:03:51.050> readings<00:03:51.470> there

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
you can see her kind of readings there

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.030 
you can see her kind of readings there
so<00:03:53.209> you<00:03:53.300> have<00:03:53.390> your<00:03:53.480> temperatures<00:03:54.050> specific

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
so you have your temperatures specific

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.820 
so you have your temperatures specific
conductivity<00:03:55.519> your<00:03:56.090> do<00:03:56.330> your<00:03:56.660> pH<00:03:56.989> your<00:03:57.290> depth

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
conductivity your do your pH your depth

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.380 
conductivity your do your pH your depth
no<00:03:58.130> ice<00:03:58.630> it's<00:03:59.630> also<00:03:59.810> does<00:04:00.110> salinity<00:04:01.239> which<00:04:02.239> we

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
no ice it's also does salinity which we

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.430 
no ice it's also does salinity which we
don't<00:04:02.540> really<00:04:02.720> use<00:04:02.959> your<00:04:03.560> depth<00:04:04.660> it's<00:04:05.660> no<00:04:05.780> pH<00:04:06.170> -

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
don't really use your depth it's no pH -

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:15.130 
don't really use your depth it's no pH -
yeah<00:04:13.030> so<00:04:14.030> I<00:04:14.060> just<00:04:14.299> lets<00:04:14.480> us<00:04:14.569> stabilize<00:04:15.080> a

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
yeah so I just lets us stabilize a

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:32.050 
yeah so I just lets us stabilize a
little<00:04:15.290> bit<00:04:15.620> and<00:04:15.799> just<00:04:16.780> lock<00:04:17.780> a<00:04:17.810> location<00:04:31.060> so

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
little bit and just lock a location so

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.840 
little bit and just lock a location so
it<00:04:32.180> sends<00:04:32.389> this<00:04:32.510> data<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:33.050> a<00:04:33.729> disk<00:04:34.729> or

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
it sends this data to a disk or

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.969 
it sends this data to a disk or
something<00:04:35.180> there<00:04:35.360> it<00:04:35.780> stores<00:04:36.320> it<00:04:36.500> internally

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
something there it stores it internally

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.100 
something there it stores it internally
on<00:04:37.100> the<00:04:37.190> PDA<00:04:37.490> and<00:04:38.210> then<00:04:38.389> we<00:04:38.479> just<00:04:38.630> go<00:04:38.780> back<00:04:38.960> to

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
on the PDA and then we just go back to

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.060 
on the PDA and then we just go back to
the<00:04:39.229> office<00:04:39.620> and<00:04:40.210> download<00:04:41.210> it<00:04:41.330> on<00:04:41.450> to<00:04:42.070> work

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
the office and download it on to work

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:52.710 
the office and download it on to work
appears<00:04:48.430> as<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.700> dissolved<00:04:50.210> oxygen<00:04:50.360> looking

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
appears as the dissolved oxygen looking

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.700 
appears as the dissolved oxygen looking
your<00:04:53.720> so<00:04:53.930> you're<00:04:54.110> at<00:04:54.169> eight<00:04:54.320> point<00:04:54.620> eight

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
your so you're at eight point eight

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.159 
your so you're at eight point eight
milligrams<00:04:55.460> per<00:04:55.820> liter<00:04:56.000> which<00:04:56.270> is<00:04:56.510> just<00:04:56.900> under

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
milligrams per liter which is just under

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:08.260 
milligrams per liter which is just under
100<00:04:57.470> percent<00:04:57.710> saturation<00:05:06.940> so<00:05:07.940> we're<00:05:08.060> on<00:05:08.150> the

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
100 percent saturation so we're on the

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.330 
100 percent saturation so we're on the
bottom<00:05:08.419> there<00:05:08.810> that's<00:05:09.560> eleven<00:05:10.010> point<00:05:10.250> eight

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
bottom there that's eleven point eight

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.940 
bottom there that's eleven point eight
years<00:05:10.720> so<00:05:11.720> we'll<00:05:11.870> see<00:05:12.020> if<00:05:12.139> we<00:05:12.169> can<00:05:12.380> get<00:05:12.530> reading

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
years so we'll see if we can get reading

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.610 
years so we'll see if we can get reading
just<00:05:13.190> off<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.520> sediments<00:05:14.090> say<00:05:14.840> around<00:05:15.080> eleven

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
just off the sediments say around eleven

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.120 
just off the sediments say around eleven
point<00:05:15.800> four<00:05:16.039> so<00:05:17.350> but<00:05:18.350> you're<00:05:18.650> looking<00:05:18.919> good<00:05:19.070> I

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
point four so but you're looking good I

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.740 
point four so but you're looking good I
mean<00:05:19.400> still<00:05:19.610> have<00:05:19.760> five<00:05:20.000> milligrams<00:05:20.389> for<00:05:20.539> your

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
mean still have five milligrams for your

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.329 
mean still have five milligrams for your
boxing<00:05:21.200> that's<00:05:21.410> excellent

00:05:23.329 --> 00:05:23.339 
boxing that's excellent

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:25.529 
boxing that's excellent
you<00:05:24.339> have<00:05:24.430> to<00:05:24.610> take<00:05:24.819> readings<00:05:24.999> shop<00:05:25.360> this

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
you have to take readings shop this

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.079 
you have to take readings shop this
summer<00:05:25.749> and<00:05:25.960> see<00:05:26.379> how<00:05:26.800> that<00:05:26.949> progresses<00:05:27.099> the

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:28.089 
summer and see how that progresses the

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:29.489 
summer and see how that progresses the
next<00:05:28.360> thing<00:05:28.539> we're<00:05:28.659> going<00:05:28.779> to<00:05:28.869> do<00:05:28.960> is<00:05:29.169> just<00:05:29.349> go

00:05:29.489 --> 00:05:29.499 
next thing we're going to do is just go

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:31.709 
next thing we're going to do is just go
take<00:05:29.740> the<00:05:29.919> discrete<00:05:30.430> samples<00:05:31.240> for<00:05:31.449> water

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:31.719 
take the discrete samples for water

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:34.799

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
coming from that data we can kind of

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.359 
coming from that data we can kind of
find<00:05:58.990> out<00:05:59.139> how<00:05:59.229> productive<00:05:59.529> the<00:05:59.800> lake<00:05:59.979> is<00:06:00.159> you

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:00.369 
find out how productive the lake is you

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:01.679 
find out how productive the lake is you
know<00:06:00.459> with<00:06:00.610> the<00:06:00.699> nutrient<00:06:01.089> concentrations

know with the nutrient concentrations

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:03.959 
know with the nutrient concentrations
are<00:06:01.839> if<00:06:02.680> you<00:06:02.770> develop<00:06:03.159> a<00:06:03.219> good<00:06:03.369> data<00:06:03.610> set<00:06:03.849> over

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:03.969 
are if you develop a good data set over

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:05.609 
are if you develop a good data set over
time<00:06:04.240> you<00:06:04.389> can<00:06:04.509> detect<00:06:04.869> changes<00:06:05.319> in<00:06:05.499> water

00:06:05.609 --> 00:06:05.619

you<00:06:07.839> know<00:06:07.930> from<00:06:08.139> measures<00:06:08.619> you<00:06:08.740> may<00:06:08.860> be<00:06:08.919> taking

00:06:09.299 --> 00:06:09.309 
you know from measures you may be taking

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:11.189 
you know from measures you may be taking
in<00:06:09.369> the<00:06:09.459> watershed<00:06:09.759> or<00:06:10.209> just<00:06:10.389> natural<00:06:11.110> and

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 
in the watershed or just natural and

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.459 
in the watershed or just natural and
changes<00:06:11.589> in<00:06:11.709> the<00:06:11.800> lake

00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:13.469 
changes in the lake

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:17.639 
changes in the lake
so<00:06:14.469> we'll<00:06:14.649> just<00:06:14.800> grab<00:06:14.889> surface<00:06:15.759> samples<00:06:16.649> just

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:17.649 
so we'll just grab surface samples just

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:19.769 
so we'll just grab surface samples just
generally<00:06:18.129> grab<00:06:18.309> those<00:06:18.520> at<00:06:18.669> arm<00:06:18.819> length<00:06:19.059> so<00:06:19.749> we

00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:19.779 
generally grab those at arm length so we

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:21.749 
generally grab those at arm length so we
have<00:06:19.990> this<00:06:20.139> it's<00:06:20.619> an<00:06:20.770> Amber<00:06:21.189> bottle<00:06:21.339> it's<00:06:21.610> for

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:21.759 
have this it's an Amber bottle it's for

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:23.429 
have this it's an Amber bottle it's for
chlorophyll<00:06:22.119> I<00:06:22.180> so<00:06:22.569> it<00:06:22.659> just<00:06:22.839> keeps<00:06:23.080> the<00:06:23.229> light

00:06:23.429 --> 00:06:23.439 
chlorophyll I so it just keeps the light

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:25.709 
chlorophyll I so it just keeps the light
out<00:06:23.619> so<00:06:24.069> when<00:06:24.399> we<00:06:24.490> transport<00:06:24.969> to<00:06:25.089> labs<00:06:25.330> there's

00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:25.719 
out so when we transport to labs there's

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:43.790 
out so when we transport to labs there's
no<00:06:26.159> increases<00:06:27.159> in<00:06:27.309> growth

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.760 

and<00:06:44.800> we<00:06:44.889> have<00:06:45.009> two<00:06:45.189> more<00:06:45.369> bottles<00:06:45.610> here<00:06:46.770> these

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
and we have two more bottles here these

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.829 
and we have two more bottles here these
come<00:06:48.069> from<00:06:48.099> the<00:06:48.279> lab<00:06:48.490> so<00:06:49.119> this<00:06:49.270> is<00:06:49.509> just<00:06:49.689> a

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:49.839 
come from the lab so this is just a

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:52.649 
come from the lab so this is just a
plain<00:06:50.110> plain<00:06:50.649> bottle<00:06:51.069> this<00:06:52.059> is<00:06:52.270> preserved

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:52.659 
plain plain bottle this is preserved

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:55.320 
plain plain bottle this is preserved
with<00:06:52.899> sulfuric<00:06:53.409> acid<00:06:53.830> for<00:06:54.309> some<00:06:55.149> of<00:06:55.270> the

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
with sulfuric acid for some of the

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:06.179 
with sulfuric acid for some of the
parameters<00:06:55.599> required<00:06:56.020> preservative<00:06:56.919> so<00:07:05.189> just

00:07:06.179 --> 00:07:06.189 
parameters required preservative so just

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:09.449 
parameters required preservative so just
use<00:07:06.309> your<00:07:06.339> plain<00:07:06.639> bottle<00:07:07.800> to<00:07:08.800> pour<00:07:09.039> into

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:09.459 
use your plain bottle to pour into

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:11.969 
use your plain bottle to pour into
yourself<00:07:10.089> or<00:07:10.209> your<00:07:10.300> fellow<00:07:10.740> because<00:07:11.740> you<00:07:11.830> want

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:11.979 
yourself or your fellow because you want

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:13.290 
yourself or your fellow because you want
to<00:07:12.039> keep<00:07:12.129> that<00:07:12.279> preservative<00:07:12.879> in<00:07:13.029> there<00:07:13.179> you

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.300 
to keep that preservative in there you

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:19.309 
to keep that preservative in there you
don't<00:07:13.389> want<00:07:13.479> to<00:07:13.629> lose<00:07:13.779> that<00:07:13.809> in<00:07:14.169> the<00:07:14.229> leg<00:07:14.409> water

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:22.469 

how<00:07:20.319> much<00:07:20.349> the<00:07:20.589> food<00:07:20.740> case<00:07:21.009> it<00:07:21.159> is<00:07:21.249> not<00:07:21.429> I<00:07:21.729> think

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 
how much the food case it is not I think

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:26.809 
how much the food case it is not I think
they<00:07:22.749> put<00:07:22.929> it<00:07:23.050> like<00:07:23.169> one<00:07:23.349> or<00:07:23.439> two<00:07:23.469> mils<00:07:23.860> yeah

00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:26.819 

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:29.189 

it's<00:07:27.819> pretty<00:07:28.029> much<00:07:28.240> just<00:07:28.389> to<00:07:28.539> get<00:07:28.659> that<00:07:28.809> pH

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 
it's pretty much just to get that pH

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:39.749 
it's pretty much just to get that pH
below<00:07:29.580> to<00:07:30.580> work<00:07:37.769> and<00:07:38.769> then<00:07:38.949> we'll<00:07:39.579> go<00:07:39.699> ahead

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 
below to work and then we'll go ahead

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:49.139 
below to work and then we'll go ahead
and<00:07:39.969> we'll<00:07:40.089> get<00:07:40.240> our<00:07:40.389> deep<00:07:40.930> samples<00:07:47.939> so<00:07:48.939> for

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:49.149 
and we'll get our deep samples so for

00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:51.649 
and we'll get our deep samples so for
that<00:07:49.240> we<00:07:49.419> use<00:07:49.599> this<00:07:49.779> contraption<00:07:50.469> which<00:07:51.039> is<00:07:51.249> a

00:07:51.649 --> 00:07:51.659 
that we use this contraption which is a

00:07:51.659 --> 00:07:56.699 
that we use this contraption which is a
bandura<00:07:52.659> sampling<00:07:53.229> device<00:07:55.289> which<00:07:56.289> is<00:07:56.439> pretty

00:07:56.699 --> 00:07:56.709 
bandura sampling device which is pretty

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:59.550 
bandura sampling device which is pretty
pretty<00:07:57.129> simple
