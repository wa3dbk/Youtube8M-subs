and cracks whew all right Michael's here
he's<00:00:46.590> gonna<00:00:46.680> demonstrate<00:00:46.920> how<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.460> works<00:00:47.520> so

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
he's gonna demonstrate how this works so

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.240 
he's gonna demonstrate how this works so
say<00:00:48.450> we<00:00:48.600> got<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> pipe<00:00:49.050> here<00:00:49.350> now<00:00:49.829> Michael's

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
say we got a pipe here now Michael's

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.580 
say we got a pipe here now Michael's
gonna<00:00:50.340> use<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.820> fire<00:00:51.090> break<00:00:51.449> phone<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:52.079> case

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
gonna use this fire break phone in case

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.010 
gonna use this fire break phone in case
there's<00:00:52.860> fire<00:00:53.190> codes<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> retarded

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
there's fire codes we have a retarded

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.709 
there's fire codes we have a retarded
foam<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.980> retards<00:00:56.460> fire<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.270> can't<00:00:57.539> you

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
foam that retards fire and I can't you

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.349 
foam that retards fire and I can't you
can<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.039> comes<00:00:59.250> out<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.760> color<00:01:00.030> which

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
can and it comes out in a color which

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.720 
can and it comes out in a color which
it's<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> building<00:01:01.800> inspectors<00:01:02.280> know<00:01:02.460> about

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
it's the building inspectors know about

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.590 
it's the building inspectors know about
look<00:01:03.329> at<00:01:03.449> that

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
look at that

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.340 
look at that
and<00:01:05.140> it's<00:01:05.320> as<00:01:05.470> easy<00:01:05.620> as<00:01:05.800> that<00:01:06.960> well<00:01:07.960> now

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
and it's as easy as that well now

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.260 
and it's as easy as that well now
that'll<00:01:08.650> seal<00:01:08.890> seal<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.520> air<00:01:09.610> from<00:01:09.850> coming<00:01:10.180> in

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
that'll seal seal the air from coming in

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.880 
that'll seal seal the air from coming in
that<00:01:10.420> penetration<00:01:10.990> how<00:01:11.410> long<00:01:11.560> does<00:01:11.620> it<00:01:11.710> take

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
that penetration how long does it take

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.070 
that penetration how long does it take
to<00:01:12.010> set<00:01:12.300> depends<00:01:13.300> on<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.510> moisture<00:01:13.930> in<00:01:14.020> the

minutes<00:01:16.810> it<00:01:16.930> depends<00:01:17.260> gotcha<00:01:17.650> and<00:01:18.340> now<00:01:18.670> he's

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
minutes it depends gotcha and now he's

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.090 
minutes it depends gotcha and now he's
gonna<00:01:19.060> use<00:01:19.390> our<00:01:19.600> maxvill<00:01:20.440> touch<00:01:20.770> of<00:01:20.920> foam

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
gonna use our maxvill touch of foam

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.740 
gonna use our maxvill touch of foam
asheville<00:01:21.580> expanding<00:01:21.610> foam<00:01:22.360> and<00:01:22.540> he's<00:01:22.630> gonna

asheville expanding foam and he's gonna

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.940 
asheville expanding foam and he's gonna
fill<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.350> pretend<00:01:24.010> this<00:01:24.100> is<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.310> gap<00:01:25.270> in<00:01:25.510> your

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
fill the pretend this is a gap in your

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.500

around a window frame that fast and

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.719 
around a window frame that fast and
it'll<00:01:31.780> start<00:01:32.080> to<00:01:32.170> expand<00:01:32.710> out<00:01:32.950> some<00:01:33.370> so<00:01:33.610> he

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
it'll start to expand out some so he

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.520 
it'll start to expand out some so he
doesn't<00:01:34.060> have<00:01:34.180> to<00:01:34.300> fill<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.720> entire<00:01:34.810> cavity

doesn't have to fill the entire cavity

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.770 
doesn't have to fill the entire cavity
it'll<00:01:36.280> start<00:01:36.550> so<00:01:36.880> it's<00:01:37.150> gonna<00:01:37.300> be<00:01:37.540> it's<00:01:37.600> gonna

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
then you can see how it works right over

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.270 
then you can see how it works right over
here<00:02:09.790> correct<00:02:10.119> this<00:02:10.869> is<00:02:11.050> how<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.290> works<00:02:11.530> if<00:02:11.860> you

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
here correct this is how it works if you

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.090 
here correct this is how it works if you
I<00:02:13.000> can<00:02:13.450> I<00:02:13.600> can<00:02:13.840> take<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.230> down<00:02:14.260> over<00:02:14.620> here

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
I can I can take it down over here

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.009 
I can I can take it down over here
here's<00:02:15.519> pipe<00:02:15.850> penetrations<00:02:16.660> that<00:02:16.870> we're

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
here's pipe penetrations that we're

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.400 
here's pipe penetrations that we're
sealing<00:02:17.230> around<00:02:17.470> nice<00:02:18.390> window<00:02:19.410> penetration

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
sealing around nice window penetration

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.150 
sealing around nice window penetration
here

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
here

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.280 
here
this<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:22.940> something<00:02:23.510> that's<00:02:23.690> called<00:02:23.900> flash

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
this is something that's called flash

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.470 
this is something that's called flash
and<00:02:24.560> bat<00:02:24.710> where<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:25.190> use<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.460> foam<00:02:26.000> with

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
and bat where you use the foam with

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.400 
and bat where you use the foam with
fiberglass

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
fiberglass

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.990 
fiberglass
all<00:02:27.470> right<00:02:27.710> because<00:02:28.010> foam<00:02:28.310> is<00:02:28.520> more<00:02:28.700> expensive

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
all right because foam is more expensive

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.090 
all right because foam is more expensive
than<00:02:29.240> fiberglass<00:02:29.570> you<00:02:30.200> can<00:02:30.350> put<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.560> little

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
than fiberglass you can put a little

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.530 
than fiberglass you can put a little
layer<00:02:31.340> of<00:02:31.520> foam<00:02:31.760> on<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.210> then<00:02:32.300> put<00:02:32.450> the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
layer of foam on and then put the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.010 
layer of foam on and then put the

fiberglass over smart seal the air
penetrations<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.290> then<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.500> fiberglass

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
penetrations and then the fiberglass

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.130 
penetrations and then the fiberglass
serves<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.790> insulate<00:02:38.210> that's<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:38.570> easy<00:02:38.720> anyone
