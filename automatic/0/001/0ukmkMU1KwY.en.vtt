all right so as you guys can see al J

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.329 
all right so as you guys can see al J
goguardian<00:00:03.500> upper<00:00:04.500> half<00:00:04.680> looks<00:00:04.980> pretty<00:00:05.220> much

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
goguardian upper half looks pretty much

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.130 
goguardian upper half looks pretty much
the<00:00:05.460> same<00:00:05.609> as<00:00:05.850> how<00:00:05.970> Jago<00:00:06.210> destroy<00:00:06.600> it's<00:00:07.049> a

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
the same as how Jago destroy it's a

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.080 
the same as how Jago destroy it's a
different<00:00:07.560> color<00:00:07.740> silver<00:00:08.519> Al<00:00:08.700> Jarreau<00:00:08.910> the

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
different color silver Al Jarreau the

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.770 
different color silver Al Jarreau the
strong<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.360> great

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
strong is great

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.740 
strong is great
so<00:00:10.469> just<00:00:10.830> like<00:00:11.040> out<00:00:11.280> Drago<00:00:11.759> destroy<00:00:12.269> you<00:00:12.570> have

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
so just like out Drago destroy you have

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.169 
so just like out Drago destroy you have
the<00:00:12.900> two<00:00:13.080> rings<00:00:13.889> in<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.309> can<00:00:14.460> get<00:00:14.730> absorb

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
the two rings in that you can get absorb

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.250 
the two rings in that you can get absorb
mode<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.809> attack<00:00:16.139> mode<00:00:17.240> wild<00:00:18.240> when<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
mode and attack mode wild when the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.500 
mode and attack mode wild when the
plastic<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:19.949> facing<00:00:20.369> outward<00:00:20.789> starving<00:00:21.390> this

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
plastic is facing outward starving this

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.779 
plastic is facing outward starving this
absorb<00:00:22.020> mode<00:00:22.640> like<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:24.019> and<00:00:25.400> the<00:00:26.400> other<00:00:26.550> way

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
absorb mode like that and the other way

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.910 
absorb mode like that and the other way
spin<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.720> 180<00:00:28.380> degrees<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:29.099> get<00:00:30.140> your<00:00:32.840> your

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
spin it 180 degrees you get your your

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.389 
spin it 180 degrees you get your your
attack<00:00:34.920> mode

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
attack mode

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.700 
attack mode
so<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> s130<00:00:36.480> track<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.870> pretty<00:00:37.079> rare<00:00:37.260> tractor

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
so the s130 track is pretty rare tractor

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.459 
so the s130 track is pretty rare tractor
so<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:38.910> pretty<00:00:39.000> good<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.450> here's<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> new

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
so it's pretty good and here's the new

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.860 
so it's pretty good and here's the new
metal<00:00:40.770> ball<00:00:40.950> it's<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.850> heaviest<00:00:42.270> performance

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
metal ball it's the heaviest performance

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.900 
metal ball it's the heaviest performance
tip<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.550> you<00:00:44.550> know

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
tip that you know

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.670 
tip that you know
beyblades<00:00:45.690> have<00:00:45.809> ever<00:00:46.020> been<00:00:46.230> made<00:00:46.410> with<00:00:46.590> I

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
beyblades have ever been made with I

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.940 
beyblades have ever been made with I
guess<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.129> far<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.960> what<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.050> metal<00:00:49.260> ball<00:00:49.410> has

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
guess so far and what the metal ball has

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.100 
guess so far and what the metal ball has
a<00:00:49.980> less<00:00:50.309> friction<00:00:50.520> with<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.820> stadium<00:00:51.110> so

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
a less friction with the stadium so

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.660 
a less friction with the stadium so
that's<00:00:52.530> gonna<00:00:52.620> be<00:00:52.710> pretty<00:00:52.829> good<00:00:53.100> with<00:00:53.430> any

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
that's gonna be pretty good with any

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
that's gonna be pretty good with any
good<00:00:54.420> defense<00:00:54.600> type<00:00:55.430> mm-hmm<00:00:56.520> all<00:00:57.420> right<00:00:57.570> so

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
good defense type mm-hmm all right so

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.410 
good defense type mm-hmm all right so
now<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:57.870> put<00:00:57.930> on<00:00:58.140> stickers<00:00:59.090> so<00:01:00.090> that's<00:01:00.270> what

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
now we put on stickers so that's what

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.920 
now we put on stickers so that's what
the<00:01:00.510> stickers<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.890> let's<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> test

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
the stickers on you and let's do a test

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.359 
the stickers on you and let's do a test
battle<00:01:03.930> or<00:01:04.500> spin<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.670> stock<00:01:06.030> Fangio

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
battle or spin with stock Fangio

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.270 
battle or spin with stock Fangio
three<00:01:08.369> two<00:01:09.299> one<00:01:09.600> go<00:01:11.900> Drago<00:01:12.900> Guardian<00:01:13.409> three

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
three two one go Drago Guardian three

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:24.440 
three two one go Drago Guardian three
two<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:15.150> go<00:01:22.040> so<00:01:23.040> with<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:24.030> metal<00:01:24.270> ball

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
two one go so with the metal ball

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.760 
two one go so with the metal ball
doesn't<00:01:24.720> have<00:01:24.869> too<00:01:25.020> much<00:01:25.110> friction<00:01:25.409> with<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
doesn't have too much friction with the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.910 
doesn't have too much friction with the
stadium<00:01:26.220> floor<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.080> does<00:01:28.229> bounce<00:01:28.470> around<00:01:28.680> a

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
stadium floor so it does bounce around a

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.319 
stadium floor so it does bounce around a
lot<00:01:29.070> when<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.369> gets<00:01:29.520> hit<00:01:29.700> with<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.909> pretty<00:01:30.180> big

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
lot when it gets hit with a pretty big

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:38.990 
lot when it gets hit with a pretty big
mess<00:01:33.530> this<00:01:34.530> combo<00:01:37.280> yeah<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.490> be<00:01:38.579> honest<00:01:38.939> I

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
mess this combo yeah to be honest I

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.429 
mess this combo yeah to be honest I
think<00:01:39.180> metal<00:01:39.299> balls<00:01:39.600> probably<00:01:39.750> better<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.170> it

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
think metal balls probably better on it

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.230 
think metal balls probably better on it
then<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:41.250> old<00:01:41.430> object<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.909> story<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
then the old object of the story the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.700 
then the old object of the story the
