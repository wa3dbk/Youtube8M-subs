it's just a few years ago this program
was<00:03:35.300> really<00:03:35.450> struggling<00:03:35.780> so<00:03:36.050> what<00:03:36.440> we've<00:03:36.620> done

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
was really struggling so what we've done

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.320 
was really struggling so what we've done
is<00:03:37.010> that<00:03:37.040> we've<00:03:37.160> been<00:03:37.430> able<00:03:37.550> to<00:03:37.730> upgrade<00:03:38.209> this

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
is that we've been able to upgrade this
