00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.670
 almost every summer resident and resident 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.799
 cities sooner or later arise 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.719
 need to see a specialist 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.189
 or barist poet work suggests 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.920
 removal of trees in cramped conditions 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.350
 when there is a structure of wire fences 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.609
 some elements of beautification 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:33.510
 it includes the removal of trees in parts 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:35.130
 betakes suspend the trunk well 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.050
 Naturally, provided that it does not 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.770
 damaged none of the listed 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.770
 items 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.030
 but before you cut down a tree 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.910
 for some reasons become superfluous 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.970
 plot will have to go to local authorities 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.930
 but any tree requires permission 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.230
 whatever is on your 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.660
 plot or not here in the suburbs it 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.810
 permission is given by local administration 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:10.620
 but deadwood permit free on 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.500
 live trees well permit costs 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.270
 about 10-15 thousand on the tree we are shown 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.820
 cramped conditions cottage building 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.800
 sperry tree is not just complexity 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.380
 include availability in 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.210
 directly near the wires 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.070
 buildings 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.860
 exposed high-voltage wires 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.550
 wires but also elements of accomplishment 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.440
 sort of plant tracks so plan 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.729
 landing is worth considering for a few 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.430
 years ahead do not plant trees near 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.770
 with power lines but closer than 5 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.210
 meters from houses because the foundation and 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.290
 damage the roots 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.200
 that is, when building a house is damaged 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.780
 foundation roots and tree are damaged 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.530
 from this dries further it is first 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.440
 secondly you should not plant on plots 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.110
 poplar and willow and here's that kind 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.759
 trees that tend 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.190
 grow to a large size and enjoy 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.350
 increased brittleness and high weight 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.790
 Berezan and contented and gentle themselves by 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.579
 yourself and 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.170
 any nail any 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.269
 rope which is tied to it she 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.980
 damages bark and birch 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.859
 from this can dry out here actually 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.780
 saying how did birch happen here 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.250
 withered and about would like to be taken 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.140
 separately say that 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.280
 birch is better not to bring to the state 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.079
 when they dry up and start already with them 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.250
 fall off branches because birch 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.769
 extreme breaking and very quickly losing their 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.019
 strength to such trees 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.480
 it is very dangerous to climb in some cases 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.030
 even impossible in such cases it may 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.840
 bring out the big financial 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.760
 costs because if i'm great that dead body 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.159
 some other climber won't climb on 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.169
 such a tree, then it is against removing the tower 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:04.530
 or a crane and, respectively, completely 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:06.209
 other expenses and other organization I would 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.439
 advised to plant small trees 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:13.260
 like the pines that grow on 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.700
 grow quite a long time but thanks 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.700
 features of its root system 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:23.220
 senior rod can extract water 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:25.949
 from from great depth and not so wrong 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.989
 prone to drought trying to get rid of 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:30.629
 the tree itself can end 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.970
 pitiable to avoid risk or barista 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:36.629
 has pretty serious and gear this 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.940
 tree climbing equipment i 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.919
 use low technology that is 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.739
 i need ropes at least 2 3 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:46.620
 the ropes on the tree need they will 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.620
 Miscellaneous average length of use 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.949
 40 80 meters will take my seeds safe 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.319
 those so-called strapping is 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:57.540
 special boriska trim for rba 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.599
 leaves and always worth destroying live 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.859
 trees are a number of cases to 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.900
 make a tree safe optional 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.829
 deleting it completely sometimes is enough 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.329
 do sanitary pruning shielding 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.250
 This means that you can cut down half 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.910
 the tree is particularly well tolerated 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.800
 poplar lindens and you 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:19.330
 and similar trees they are then on 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.100
 next year give young shoots at 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.920
 croning 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.820
 upper cut trunk needed 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.560
 necessarily done slightly diagonally 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.110
 so that the moisture does not get inside 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:34.270
 trunk I did not occur gomel here is how on 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:36.280
 this birch here and here is clearly water 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.680
 got inside the trunk and inside the trunk 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.689
 rotted on a living tree need to work so 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.060
 so as not to harm him 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:46.469
 when climbing a tree which you do not 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.449
 planning to steal not an opening 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:53.960
 use lifting equipment 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.960
 not damaging mikaru this loop example 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:05:00.389
 for clings around a tree climber 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.569
 does not bind after this second 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.569
 a loop 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.050
 fixed above 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.340
 and climbing is achieved on it and so 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.980
 to the top 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.990
 allows not to damage the bark when lifting 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.690
 on living trees and still better 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.970
 treatment is prevention plan your 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.020
 plots carefully and live in peace with 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.020
 with your plants
