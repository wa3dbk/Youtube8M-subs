00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.820
 hello all lately 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.010
 notice what people on the internet are looking for 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.509
 tutorial on grow well to be honest was 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.790
 a little surprised because the game has 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.320
 very lucidly manual on the fight but 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.170
 no less decided to record a small video 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.180
 about the basics of stalls let's start with the transitions in 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.800
 the game is very intuitive 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.289
 sense which way you want to go 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.480
 In that and turn the stick to the left means to the left 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.130
 right right pay attention to 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.199
 pointers in the lower right have 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.660
 transitions that can only be done 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.430
 when you press a button or one for example 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.800
 rise from the cities position when you 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.300
 keep your opponent's legs lethal proud 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.489
 go immediately full mode 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.770
 also throw off your opponent when he 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.480
 there is a fall Mauser example if you do not 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.030
 press or one in this position and you 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.190
 give your opponent back to block 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.379
 transitions need to clamp the button block and 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.180
 about the stick side of the transition and here again 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.670
 it is logical to see that your opponent 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.129
 passes right press r2 and right stick 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.680
 right-left do the same to the left 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.899
 pay attention to the bottom right again 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.330
 corner if the opponent is trying to get you up 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.020
 or pushed out of the orchestra at you, press r2 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.570
 and down 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.760
 take on pain r2 and right stick up 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.860
 for successful struggle you need to keep 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.869
 stamina is very important especially with 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.680
 rival whose character is high 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.020
 skill of struggle 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.729
 probably the most necessary to study it 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.860
 all transition animation in the pit 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.990
 it is easy for each position of all 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.030
 several variations transitions to the left and 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.220
 Rising to the right from the enemy and exit to 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.200
 painful end will tell you about the most 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.939
 common mistakes people I see in 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.520
 online and now about pain 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.590
 done not see the mini game of the moment 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.810
 activating the reception there cooking 400 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.850
 gates and sides of defense from only one 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.280
 the goal to go beyond using the right 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.829
 the stick just sounds right isn't it 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.570
 quite so when he introduces a strip she 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.030
 suddenly stopped it means that 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.009
 your opponent is trying to prevent you from starting 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.960
 crush the other side on this all for 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.299
 defense is nothing more to do but 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.399
 here's an attacker will have a little more difficult 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.200
 when you attack you see which one 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.299
 side hit stick your rival 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.430
 hinder your goal as long as possible 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.909
 movement in the same direction as he is right 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.799
 stick 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.170
 after some time you will start 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.670
 highlight 1 of 2 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.740
 turnaround at this point you should 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.020
 point the left side of that corner 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.790
 if you have time the pain will go on 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.709
 new stage where the gates will shrink 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.930
 the opponent will be harder to get out of the hold 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.000
 and so several times for the completion 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.560
 pain if you do not have time to click 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.270
 left stick or choose the wrong 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.340
 turning direction expand and 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.110
 it will be easier for the opponent to get out 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.760
 about pain all important to understand the principle 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.920
 actions and you will not be difficult 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.810
 get out of it don't neglect 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.790
 grabs using them can get out 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.830
 seemingly already completely lost 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.780
 bout how did my rival on this 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.580
 video fragment but now about errors 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.950
 which I see online even in red 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.660
 division do not make the transition all the time in 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.680
 one side as you can see it is very easy 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.630
 is blocked 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.430
 don't try to make the transition during 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.739
 when the hail of blows falls on you 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.989
 take at least one punch and block after 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.819
 what make the transition otherwise 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.950
 your actions come to nothing except knockout 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.900
 will lead in general experiment 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.910
 ground is a very important part of this game. 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.910
 Thanks for watching so far
