00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
the box sup a look at the case now

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.500 
the box sup a look at the case now
already<00:02:20.720> I'm<00:02:21.680> liking<00:02:22.069> this<00:02:22.370> is<00:02:22.610> way<00:02:23.239> more

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
already I'm liking this is way more

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.570 
already I'm liking this is way more
rigid<00:02:23.840> than<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:24.049> silicon<00:02:24.440> case<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:27.459> it's<00:02:28.459> still

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
rigid than a silicon case and it's still

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.690 
rigid than a silicon case and it's still
got<00:02:28.730> that<00:02:28.819> flex<00:02:29.150> there<00:02:29.450> but<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:29.840> is<00:02:30.049> a<00:02:30.260> lot<00:02:30.620> more

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
got that flex there but it is a lot more

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.250 
got that flex there but it is a lot more
rigid<00:02:31.700> if<00:02:31.849> we<00:02:31.970> look<00:02:32.120> at<00:02:32.239> maybe<00:02:32.629> the<00:02:32.810> probe<00:02:32.989> port

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
rigid if we look at maybe the probe port

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.780 
rigid if we look at maybe the probe port
silicon<00:02:33.680> case<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.099> steri<00:02:34.340> touch<00:02:34.549> that<00:02:34.700> we

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
silicon case the steri touch that we

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.190 
silicon case the steri touch that we
looked<00:02:34.940> at<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.060> couple<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.299> days<00:02:35.390> ago<00:02:35.599> as<00:02:36.110> you

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
looked at a couple of days ago as you

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.690 
looked at a couple of days ago as you
can<00:02:36.319> see<00:02:36.560> look<00:02:36.769> how<00:02:36.799> flexible<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.489> a<00:02:37.549> is

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
can see look how flexible that a is

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.400 
can see look how flexible that a is
which<00:02:38.329> is<00:02:38.450> great<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:38.870> what<00:02:38.959> people<00:02:39.200> want<00:02:39.379> from

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
which is great and what people want from

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.190 
which is great and what people want from
a<00:02:39.560> silicon<00:02:39.920> case<00:02:39.970> however<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.480> fancy<00:02:42.049> something

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
a silicon case however I fancy something

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.319 
a silicon case however I fancy something
a<00:02:42.349> bit<00:02:42.409> different<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:43.159> also<00:02:43.640> if<00:02:43.819> we<00:02:43.940> listen<00:02:44.090> to

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
a bit different and also if we listen to

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.830 
a bit different and also if we listen to
this<00:02:45.160> that's<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.280> silicon<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:47.690> is<00:02:47.780> the

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
this that's the silicon and this is the

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.520 
this that's the silicon and this is the
rubber<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:49.760> can<00:02:49.790> tell<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:50.870> is<00:02:50.930> very<00:02:51.290> different

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
rubber you can tell it is very different

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.699 
rubber you can tell it is very different
and<00:02:52.569> all<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:53.750> usual<00:02:53.989> cut<00:02:54.140> waves<00:02:54.349> I<00:02:54.440> live<00:02:54.560> look

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
and all the usual cut waves I live look

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.349 
and all the usual cut waves I live look
at<00:02:54.799> those<00:02:54.950> when<00:02:55.099> we<00:02:55.190> put<00:02:55.340> on<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.459> phone<00:02:55.790> on<00:02:56.180> the

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
at those when we put on the phone on the

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.500 
at those when we put on the phone on the
back<00:02:56.599> you<00:02:56.629> can<00:02:56.900> see<00:02:57.019> that<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.530> whole<00:02:57.709> case<00:02:57.950> is

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
back you can see that the whole case is

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.390 
back you can see that the whole case is
fairly<00:02:59.510> transparent<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.530> I'll<00:03:01.129> saw<00:03:01.340> the

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
fairly transparent and I'll saw the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.809 
fairly transparent and I'll saw the
skullcandy<00:03:02.090> part<00:03:02.739> logo<00:03:03.739> they<00:03:03.920> see<00:03:04.549> it<00:03:04.700> that's

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
skullcandy part logo they see it that's

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.960 
skullcandy part logo they see it that's
all<00:03:05.090> so<00:03:05.299> transparent<00:03:06.310> really<00:03:07.310> nice<00:03:07.459> rich

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
all so transparent really nice rich

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.140 
all so transparent really nice rich
cherry<00:03:08.359> red<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:08.870> really<00:03:09.170> like<00:03:09.290> this<00:03:09.579> so<00:03:10.579> we'll

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
cherry red I really like this so we'll

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.839 
cherry red I really like this so we'll
put<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.359> phone<00:03:11.540> in<00:03:11.720> just<00:03:11.870> using<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.230> normal

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
put the phone in just using the normal

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.970 
put the phone in just using the normal
silicon<00:03:13.849> case<00:03:14.090> kind<00:03:14.480> of<00:03:14.569> way<00:03:14.720> bottom<00:03:15.680> end<00:03:15.829> in

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
silicon case kind of way bottom end in

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.000 
silicon case kind of way bottom end in
on<00:03:16.129> top<00:03:16.370> which<00:03:16.489> ever<00:03:16.669> went<00:03:16.849> first<00:03:17.709> pop<00:03:18.709> and

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
on top which ever went first pop and

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.039 
on top which ever went first pop and
that<00:03:19.609> is<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.760> really<00:03:20.030> nice<00:03:20.299> fit<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.930> is<00:03:21.019> a

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
that is a really nice fit that is a

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.890 
that is a really nice fit that is a
really<00:03:21.260> nice<00:03:21.519> sharp<00:03:22.519> sort<00:03:22.819> of<00:03:22.880> snap<00:03:23.239> on<00:03:23.450> there

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
really nice sharp sort of snap on there

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.680 
really nice sharp sort of snap on there
I<00:03:24.430> like<00:03:25.430> that<00:03:25.609> on<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.030> top<00:03:26.239> we've<00:03:26.359> got<00:03:26.389> the<00:03:26.510> cut

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
I like that on the top we've got the cut

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.830 
I like that on the top we've got the cut
way<00:03:26.840> for<00:03:27.079> the<00:03:27.139> headphone<00:03:28.419> power<00:03:29.419> switch<00:03:29.810> is

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
way for the headphone power switch is

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.300 
way for the headphone power switch is
covered<00:03:30.410> on<00:03:30.590> this<00:03:30.769> one<00:03:31.060> mute<00:03:32.060> switch<00:03:32.359> exposed

volume<00:03:34.310> switch<00:03:34.519> she's<00:03:34.910> covered<00:03:35.510> we'll<00:03:35.930> have<00:03:36.019> a

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
volume switch she's covered we'll have a

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.500 
volume switch she's covered we'll have a
look<00:03:36.200> at<00:03:36.380> how<00:03:36.470> they<00:03:36.650> fare<00:03:36.980> in<00:03:37.160> a<00:03:37.220> minute<00:03:37.579> bottom

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
look at how they fare in a minute bottom

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.220 
look at how they fare in a minute bottom
nice<00:03:38.989> neat<00:03:39.290> cut<00:03:39.500> away<00:03:39.680> their<00:03:40.120> camera<00:03:41.169> not<00:03:42.169> bad

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
nice neat cut away their camera not bad

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.640 
nice neat cut away their camera not bad
at<00:03:42.470> all<00:03:42.620> that's<00:03:43.489> the<00:03:43.639> camera<00:03:43.940> cut<00:03:44.120> away<00:03:44.269> there

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
at all that's the camera cut away there

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.330 
at all that's the camera cut away there
sometimes<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:45.709> have<00:03:45.799> to<00:03:45.889> give<00:03:46.010> them<00:03:46.130> a<00:03:46.190> little

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
sometimes you have to give them a little

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.180 
sometimes you have to give them a little
bit<00:03:46.549> of<00:03:46.639> a<00:03:46.730> bit<00:03:47.180> minaji<00:03:47.599> new<00:03:47.780> they're<00:03:48.230> getting

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
bit of a bit minaji new they're getting

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.319 
bit of a bit minaji new they're getting
in<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.370> right<00:03:49.519> place<00:03:49.849> you<00:03:50.030> know<00:03:50.120> what<00:03:50.209> I<00:03:50.239> mean

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
in the right place you know what I mean

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.129 
in the right place you know what I mean
but<00:03:50.690> yeah<00:03:51.590> so<00:03:51.859> that's<00:03:52.160> good<00:03:52.340> I<00:03:52.430> like<00:03:52.459> that

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
but yeah so that's good I like that

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.140 
but yeah so that's good I like that
whole<00:03:54.139> thing<00:03:54.349> feels<00:03:54.769> really<00:03:55.220> nice<00:03:55.459> very

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
whole thing feels really nice very

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.720 
whole thing feels really nice very
smooth<00:03:56.560> but<00:03:57.560> Griffey<00:03:57.829> at<00:03:57.889> the<00:03:57.950> same<00:03:58.129> time<00:03:58.370> if

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
smooth but Griffey at the same time if

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.440 
smooth but Griffey at the same time if
you<00:03:58.940> catch<00:03:59.120> my<00:03:59.299> drift<00:04:01.030> that's<00:04:02.030> nice<00:04:02.239> that's

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
you catch my drift that's nice that's

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.509 
you catch my drift that's nice that's
nice<00:04:02.660> feel<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:02.989> it<00:04:03.169> just<00:04:03.500> feels<00:04:03.739> a<00:04:03.859> lot<00:04:03.980> more<00:04:04.040> I

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
nice feel to it just feels a lot more I

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.819 
nice feel to it just feels a lot more I
don't<00:04:05.389> know<00:04:05.450> it<00:04:05.599> feels<00:04:05.750> a<00:04:05.900> lot<00:04:05.989> sharper<00:04:06.319> in

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
don't know it feels a lot sharper in

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.000 
don't know it feels a lot sharper in
terms<00:04:07.069> of<00:04:07.870> like<00:04:08.870> if<00:04:09.019> you<00:04:09.139> bought<00:04:09.319> a<00:04:09.349> sharp<00:04:09.650> suit

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
terms of like if you bought a sharp suit

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.530 
terms of like if you bought a sharp suit
you<00:04:10.250> know<00:04:10.370> it<00:04:10.549> would<00:04:10.699> be<00:04:10.819> fits<00:04:11.209> really<00:04:11.449> well

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
you know it would be fits really well

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.020 
you know it would be fits really well
and<00:04:11.930> that's<00:04:12.019> the<00:04:12.230> way<00:04:12.319> this<00:04:12.500> is<00:04:12.799> this<00:04:13.010> fits<00:04:13.310> and

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
and that's the way this is this fits and

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.280 
and that's the way this is this fits and
so<00:04:14.480> let's<00:04:14.599> have<00:04:14.720> a<00:04:14.750> look<00:04:14.870> at<00:04:14.900> these<00:04:14.989> buttons

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
so let's have a look at these buttons

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.199 
so let's have a look at these buttons
because<00:04:15.440> it<00:04:15.620> covered<00:04:15.889> as<00:04:15.980> well<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.970> reason

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
because it covered as well the reason

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.520 
because it covered as well the reason
want<00:04:17.359> to<00:04:17.419> look<00:04:17.510> at<00:04:17.630> me<00:04:17.780> is<00:04:17.840> because<00:04:17.989> on<00:04:18.470> a

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
want to look at me is because on a

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.259 
want to look at me is because on a
silicon<00:04:18.949> case<00:04:18.979> all<00:04:19.459> of<00:04:19.699> the<00:04:19.820> cupboard<00:04:20.030> they're

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
silicon case all of the cupboard they're

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.510 
silicon case all of the cupboard they're
really<00:04:20.450> easy<00:04:20.479> and<00:04:20.870> like<00:04:20.989> soft<00:04:21.289> touch<00:04:21.530> but

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
really easy and like soft touch but

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.070 
really easy and like soft touch but
obviously<00:04:22.820> we've<00:04:23.180> got<00:04:23.270> a<00:04:23.300> more<00:04:23.510> rigid<00:04:23.719> case

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
obviously we've got a more rigid case

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.510 
obviously we've got a more rigid case
and<00:04:24.320> especially<00:04:24.530> around<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:24.890> edges<00:04:25.039> here

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
and especially around the edges here

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.790 
and especially around the edges here
pretty<00:04:25.910> rigid<00:04:26.120> so<00:04:26.449> let's<00:04:27.080> test<00:04:27.259> the<00:04:27.470> old<00:04:27.590> power

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
pretty rigid so let's test the old power

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.119 
pretty rigid so let's test the old power
switch<00:04:28.099> amp<00:04:29.379> that<00:04:30.379> is<00:04:30.500> surprisingly<00:04:31.009> easy

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:31.129 
switch amp that is surprisingly easy

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:33.700 
switch amp that is surprisingly easy
actually<00:04:31.910> I<00:04:32.300> really<00:04:33.199> fought<00:04:33.349> was<00:04:33.500> you<00:04:33.560> have<00:04:33.680> to

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
actually I really fought was you have to

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.050 
actually I really fought was you have to
put<00:04:33.860> a<00:04:33.889> lot<00:04:33.979> of<00:04:34.039> pressure<00:04:34.280> on<00:04:34.400> that<00:04:34.639> but<00:04:34.879> now

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
put a lot of pressure on that but now

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.100 
put a lot of pressure on that but now
there<00:04:35.509> we<00:04:35.599> go<00:04:35.780> I'm<00:04:36.819> volume<00:04:37.819> switches<00:04:38.300> its<00:04:38.900> test

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
there we go I'm volume switches its test

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.240 
there we go I'm volume switches its test
I<00:04:39.259> was<00:04:39.379> up<00:04:40.000> get<00:04:41.000> this<00:04:41.120> open<00:04:41.889> okay<00:04:42.889> volume

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
I was up get this open okay volume

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.240 
I was up get this open okay volume
switch<00:04:43.370> is<00:04:43.699> yet<00:04:44.389> again<00:04:44.800> you'd<00:04:45.800> think<00:04:45.830> that<00:04:46.190> you

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
switch is yet again you'd think that you

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.830 
switch is yet again you'd think that you
would<00:04:46.280> really<00:04:46.699> really<00:04:47.030> have<00:04:47.360> to<00:04:47.389> press<00:04:47.690> these

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
would really really have to press these

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.210 
would really really have to press these
hard<00:04:48.169> nice<00:04:49.039> soft<00:04:49.340> touch<00:04:49.430> and<00:04:50.800> other<00:04:51.800> issue<00:04:51.979> as

hard nice soft touch and other issue as

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.159 
hard nice soft touch and other issue as
well<00:04:52.250> that<00:04:52.520> we<00:04:52.580> need<00:04:52.729> to<00:04:52.819> look<00:04:52.970> at<00:04:53.150> is<00:04:53.419> mute

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
well that we need to look at is mute

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.960 
well that we need to look at is mute
switch<00:04:54.440> do<00:04:54.770> we<00:04:54.860> have<00:04:55.009> to<00:04:55.159> use<00:04:55.310> our<00:04:55.430> fingernail

form some of these cases you have to
really<00:04:59.150> dig<00:04:59.449> your<00:04:59.599> fingernail<00:05:00.080> in<00:05:00.229> there<00:05:00.520> so<00:05:01.520> I

black one for so long you want to show

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.390 
black one for so long you want to show
off<00:05:18.139> the<00:05:18.469> fact<00:05:18.650> that<00:05:18.680> it's<00:05:18.860> white<00:05:19.039> because<00:05:19.280> on

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
off the fact that it's white because on

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.430 
off the fact that it's white because on
the<00:05:19.490> front<00:05:19.759> what<00:05:20.690> surprise<00:05:20.990> it<00:05:21.169> looks<00:05:21.319> exactly

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
the front what surprise it looks exactly

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.790 
the front what surprise it looks exactly
the<00:05:21.710> same<00:05:22.180> and<00:05:23.180> this<00:05:23.360> does<00:05:23.569> show<00:05:23.780> show<00:05:24.530> off<00:05:24.680> the

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
the same and this does show show off the

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.080 
the same and this does show show off the
white<00:05:24.949> quite<00:05:25.250> well<00:05:25.490> actually<00:05:25.639> it's

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
white quite well actually it's

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.930 
white quite well actually it's
transparent<00:05:26.750> so<00:05:26.960> we<00:05:27.889> can<00:05:28.039> see<00:05:28.219> the<00:05:28.430> apple<00:05:28.789> logo

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
transparent so we can see the apple logo

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.689 
transparent so we can see the apple logo
through<00:05:29.419> there<00:05:29.599> we<00:05:29.690> can<00:05:29.810> see<00:05:29.900> the<00:05:29.990> iphone<00:05:30.699> 3gs

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
through there we can see the iphone 3gs

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.640 
through there we can see the iphone 3gs
and<00:05:32.120> we<00:05:32.360> can<00:05:32.509> see<00:05:32.659> some<00:05:32.810> of<00:05:32.840> the<00:05:32.960> white<00:05:33.110> exposed

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
and we can see some of the white exposed

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.100 
and we can see some of the white exposed
as<00:05:33.889> well<00:05:34.190> I<00:05:34.520> think<00:05:35.389> the<00:05:35.539> red<00:05:35.690> goes<00:05:35.870> really

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
as well I think the red goes really

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.839 
as well I think the red goes really
really<00:05:36.560> well<00:05:36.680> with<00:05:36.949> the<00:05:37.039> white<00:05:37.219> as<00:05:37.250> well<00:05:37.580> like
