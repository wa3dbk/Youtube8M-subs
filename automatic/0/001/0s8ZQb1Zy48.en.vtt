00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.009
 and today we will be able to seek to create and 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.009
 enjoy the minions 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.179
 and the first of the three books that you 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.369
 I'm going to teach today is this book 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.160
 cutouts do not panic because it's very 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.289
 easy to prepare the children you just have to 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.090
 separate the pieces stick them by the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.920
 dotted lines that are indicated and 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.810
 then insert the tabs and mount the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.590
 eyes arms and feet and will be so 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.760
 pretty like these 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.760
 let's investigate 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.300
 we keep investigating this is a bit 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.220
 introduction and equipment we have the 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.960
 characters from the movie and some 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.239
 about the good story to see if they arrive 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.519
 the children because I have taken this book 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.350
 to find a cut-out minion 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.909
 but games good good this book 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.760
 it seems that it hides more surprises than 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:56.530
 that here they are here are these are the 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.850
 the leaves where we have the children 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.460
 cut-outs that by the way are a 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.460
 slightly thicker than the other houses 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.230
 and this because they are scenarios in case 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.840
 we want to play with them too 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.230
 cut-outs and good you have minions 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.060
 Egyptian pirates of all kinds and let's 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.430
 with the second of the books that this one 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.500
 search and find that it is a book like 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.510
 those of looking for wally where are we going to 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.040
 have different scenarios and a list 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.110
 of things that we have to find in 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.700
 each one of them for example a 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.560
 minion dancing on top of the water or by 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.810
 example in this Egyptian so you can 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.180
 have to look for a minion at best 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.650
 who is trying to catch a pigeon and 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.650
 as you can see there are different scenarios 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.659
 in many of them related to the 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.250
 movie like this that you are going to see now 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.620
 villa piano 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.360
 sure you've seen the movie you go 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.110
 to recognize some of the characters 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.360
 what's here 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.140
 and now let's investigate the comic the 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.400
 comic has an incredible design I think that 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.880
 of the three is the one with a design 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:08.210
 more careful or maybe a little more 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.759
 funny the characters the colors the 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.160
 expressions I have loved this 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.350
 third and I think that of the three who 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.660
 more I liked it is a collection and 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.560
 this is only the first volume that 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.560
 banana flame 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.830
 and it is now when you touches you in 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.629
 the comments tell me which of the three 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.200
 books that I have taught you today has 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.200
 liked more
