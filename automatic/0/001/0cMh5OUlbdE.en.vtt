don't<00:02:18.659> have<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.019> swish<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.560> know<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:20.040> couple<00:02:20.730> of

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
don't have the swish I know a couple of

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.880 
don't have the swish I know a couple of
my<00:02:21.000> homies<00:02:21.450> was<00:02:21.689> uh<00:02:21.719> they<00:02:22.379> didn't<00:02:22.620> really<00:02:22.769> like

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
my homies was uh they didn't really like

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.649 
my homies was uh they didn't really like
this<00:02:23.040> too<00:02:23.310> because<00:02:23.549> of<00:02:23.969> the<00:02:24.090> Swiss<00:02:24.390> but<00:02:24.599> i

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
this too because of the Swiss but i

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.809 
this too because of the Swiss but i
think<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.930> swiss<00:02:25.260> definitely<00:02:26.099> was<00:02:26.370> perfect

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
think the swiss definitely was perfect

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.440 
think the swiss definitely was perfect
for<00:02:26.939> this<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.150> camo<00:02:27.720> pattern<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:29.060> that's<00:02:30.060> pretty

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
for this a camo pattern so that's pretty

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.539 
for this a camo pattern so that's pretty
much<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.750> upper<00:02:31.379> part<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.769> shoe<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.310> this

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
much the upper part of the shoe is this

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.289 
much the upper part of the shoe is this
camo<00:02:32.849> and<00:02:33.239> it's<00:02:33.689> like<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.930> it's<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:35.010> dog<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:36.090> a

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
camo and it's like a it's a dog it's a

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.640 
camo and it's like a it's a dog it's a
really<00:02:36.540> dull<00:02:37.430> pattern<00:02:38.430> it's<00:02:38.639> not<00:02:38.790> like<00:02:38.970> a

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
really dull pattern it's not like a

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.619 
really dull pattern it's not like a
glossy<00:02:40.650> look<00:02:40.859> or<00:02:41.129> matte<00:02:41.609> look<00:02:41.819> but<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.329> dull

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
glossy look or matte look but it is dull

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.960 
glossy look or matte look but it is dull
I<00:02:42.930> think<00:02:43.439> the<00:02:43.560> shooter<00:02:44.010> really<00:02:44.310> been<00:02:44.459> hot<00:02:44.730> if

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
I think the shooter really been hot if

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.309 
I think the shooter really been hot if
they<00:02:45.299> would<00:02:45.480> have<00:02:45.540> went<00:02:45.840> with<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:46.019> glossy

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
they would have went with a glossy

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.740 
they would have went with a glossy
pattern<00:02:47.099> so<00:02:47.939> here<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.209> guys<00:02:48.359> go<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:51.239> also<00:02:51.689> to

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
pattern so here you guys go the also to

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.289 
pattern so here you guys go the also to
shoe<00:02:52.019> is<00:02:52.169> a<00:02:52.200> gum<00:02:52.470> bottom<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.909> me<00:02:54.060> which

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
shoe is a gum bottom to me which

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.449 
shoe is a gum bottom to me which
probably<00:02:54.629> symbolize<00:02:55.169> like<00:02:55.409> a<00:02:55.439> boot<00:02:55.769> which<00:02:56.430> is

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
probably symbolize like a boot which is

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.550 
probably symbolize like a boot which is
very<00:02:56.790> hot<00:02:57.000> as<00:02:57.180> well<00:02:57.389> they<00:02:57.720> didn't<00:02:57.930> go<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.139> icy

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
very hot as well they didn't go to icy

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.920 
very hot as well they didn't go to icy
bottom<00:02:58.950> um<00:02:59.549> I<00:02:59.819> also<00:03:00.060> think<00:03:00.450> they<00:03:00.689> would<00:03:00.840> have

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
bottom um I also think they would have

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.059 
bottom um I also think they would have
went<00:03:01.049> with<00:03:01.109> a<00:03:01.200> black<00:03:01.439> bottom<00:03:01.799> I<00:03:01.859> would<00:03:01.980> have

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
went with a black bottom I would have

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.879 
went with a black bottom I would have
been<00:03:02.189> tough<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.700> but<00:03:03.329> uh<00:03:03.359> got<00:03:04.049> your<00:03:04.230> gum<00:03:04.439> bottom

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
been tough to but uh got your gum bottom

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.259 
been tough to but uh got your gum bottom
so<00:03:05.099> you<00:03:05.129> know<00:03:05.400> there's<00:03:05.609> probably<00:03:05.909> no

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
so you know there's probably no

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.259 
so you know there's probably no
discoloration<00:03:06.780> on<00:03:07.349> this<00:03:07.560> shoe<00:03:07.980> at<00:03:08.099> all<00:03:08.280> your
