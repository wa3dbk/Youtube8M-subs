00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.810

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.539
 for you beautiful and wonderful person who 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.970
 is demanding at this moment how you 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.240
 know is inscribed in the description of this 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.260
 video I lost weight 14 kilos did with 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.630
 only one month and without diets and exercises 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.030
 I used just a few techniques that I 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.550
 found on the Internet the same 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.489
 some went wrong at some sufficed 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.120
 certain and those that worked with me 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.329
 I'll pass on to you that I'll be there. 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.719
 happening to you today is the technician of the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.570
 change of dish great effect 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.410
 if this from here to the small dish 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.760
 this one knows that dessert plate 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.489
 exactly this from here to main 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.100
 technique was created by an English 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.570
 I do not remember German, but he 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.970
 believed and researched and really 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.400
 proved that eating a dish and that he 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.920
 makes us think we're eating 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.140
 much more food as you can 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.909
 look at this image that will appear 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.850
 somewhere here on the screen 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.670
 this image we have a white circle that 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.820
 It represents the plate and the inner circle 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.400
 which represents the amount of food in the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.400
 if the amount of food in the circle 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.869
 white and smaller the same size as the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.590
 circus inside 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.590
 only in this circle on the smaller dish is 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.470
 It looks like there is a lot more black circle 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.049
 in the case food but anyway I do not know French 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.540
 in cash means that the higher the 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.390
 dish but the sicoob as the best dish 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.040
 - you run was easy to understand or 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.960
 not anything and write a 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.450
 comment that I make videos aggravating 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.060
 answering you in the case what you 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.970
 ask the technical income from the patio 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.660
 small you have to chew with 20 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.380
 minutes 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.510
 This little dish is not in the hug that is 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.880
 for you to chew and yes the food inside 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.520
 of the dish you have to eat for 20 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.920
 minutes because your brain only recognizes 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.350
 That your picture is over after 20 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.380
 minutes but arriving in case you have 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.470
 to eat slowly slowly comes even 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.660
 in this brain understand that it will stay 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.269
 satisfied in 20 minutes many 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.890
 times you do that deal with this 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.440
 size so even a little bit 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.110
 still the quick and not the 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.540
 no use eating this dish fast 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.510
 food because what will happen despite 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.390
 of the amount of food your lunch 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.250
 be very good at trying to solve anything 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.110
 because you will not get hurt by 20 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.150
 minutes then in an hour you go 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.890
 been starving for 30 refrigerator 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.709
 to look for something hot to 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.590
 and it is also important to highlight 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.350
 that we can not eat in front of the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.360
 television in front of the computer is 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.480
 be watching a video this 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.459
 My channel is a joke, people can not 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.190
 It will give to eat to distract you have to 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.500
 sitting at the table has to be alone with 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.840
 your family take advantage of that time 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.769
 that politicians talk on tv 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.350
 You know 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.810
 Turn off the tv, go and sit down at the table. 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.250
 restful dinner and then you come back to 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.280
 watch your novel 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.010
 simple prank us nothing 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.519
 against political hours is to vote 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.620
 serious is not clown despite the team 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.079
 be there as part of the schedule 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.720
 election and there are others who are very 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.670
 Worst, I know I'm kidding, I'm not going to talk. 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.280
 but I did not say anything else 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.010
 nevermind then staff this was the 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.260
 video that today I will be posting the 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.959
 little by little so that you 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.150
 can adapt because it does not help 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.890
 I drop everything at once that you do not 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.330

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.780
