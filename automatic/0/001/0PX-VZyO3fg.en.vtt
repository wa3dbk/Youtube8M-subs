do<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.750> can<00:00:18.900> make<00:00:18.930> texture<00:00:19.410> with<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:19.680> Fork

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
do you can make texture with this Fork

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.470 
do you can make texture with this Fork
I've<00:00:20.789> got<00:00:21.119> an<00:00:21.480> oyster<00:00:22.109> shucker<00:00:23.119> I've<00:00:24.119> got<00:00:24.330> the

squeegee so don't limit yourself just by

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.300 
squeegee so don't limit yourself just by
what<00:00:27.599> they<00:00:27.840> say<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.140> can<00:00:28.619> make<00:00:28.710> texture<00:00:29.130> width

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
what they say you can make texture width

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.740 
what they say you can make texture width
you<00:00:29.429> can<00:00:29.460> use<00:00:29.760> anything<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.240> can<00:00:30.480> use<00:00:30.510> your

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
with the squeegee you know I can

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.380 
with the squeegee you know I can
continue<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.040> squeegee<00:00:38.340> extra<00:00:38.850> paint<00:00:39.090> here

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
continue to squeegee extra paint here

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.549 
continue to squeegee extra paint here
then<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.649> come<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.430> pull<00:00:41.760> out<00:00:42.050> lines<00:00:43.050> in

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
then I can come in and pull out lines in

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.029 
then I can come in and pull out lines in
the<00:00:44.809> rock<00:00:45.809> face<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.320> these<00:00:46.410> mountains

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
paint I can come in here and just

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.060 
paint I can come in here and just
crosshatch<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.430> again<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.620> then<00:00:55.620> pull<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
crosshatch this again and then pull the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.490

paint<00:00:56.309> out<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> way<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.210> then<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.350> will

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
paint out of the way and then it will

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.450 
paint out of the way and then it will
make<00:00:58.949> slicing<00:00:59.609> carves<00:01:00.059> into<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> paint

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
make slicing carves into the paint

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.870 
make slicing carves into the paint
coming<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.059> then<00:01:03.510> if<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.809> want<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.880> can

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
coming here and then if I want I can

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.149 
coming here and then if I want I can
take<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.330> dip<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.689> edge<00:01:07.189> into<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:10.159> extra

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
take and dip the edge into this extra

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.700 
take and dip the edge into this extra
paint<00:01:11.400> here<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:12.119> kind<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.360> chop<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:15.710> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
paint here and just kind of chop it and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.420 
paint here and just kind of chop it and
then<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:17.250> can<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:17.729> kind<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.090> DAB<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.780> make

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
then I can just kind of DAB it and make

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.190 
then I can just kind of DAB it and make
the<00:01:20.430> kind<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.909> motion<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.540> movement<00:01:23.840> if<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.960> want

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the kind of motion of movement if I want

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.310 
the kind of motion of movement if I want
I<00:01:25.320> could<00:01:25.380> take<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.799> fork<00:01:26.810> and<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:27.960> come<00:01:28.200> in

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
I could take this fork and just come in

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.240 
I could take this fork and just come in
here<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.740> draw<00:01:28.950> really<00:01:29.670> thin<00:01:29.909> lines<00:01:30.979> and<00:01:31.979> drag

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
here and draw really thin lines and drag

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.280 
here and draw really thin lines and drag
them<00:01:32.430> out<00:01:35.299> this<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.479> gonna<00:01:36.689> give<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.049> little

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
them out this is gonna give it a little

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.789 
them out this is gonna give it a little
bit<00:01:37.560> more<00:01:37.770> three-dimensional<00:01:38.900> feel<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.320> see

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
bit more three-dimensional feel and see

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.830 
bit more three-dimensional feel and see
I<00:01:40.829> couldn't<00:01:41.250> do<00:01:41.400> these<00:01:41.610> lines<00:01:41.880> with<00:01:42.299> them<00:01:42.450> with

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
I couldn't do these lines with them with

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.719 
I couldn't do these lines with them with
a<00:01:42.869> paintbrush<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.560> couldn't<00:01:43.860> go<00:01:44.009> back<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.490> and

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
a paintbrush I couldn't go back in and

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.850 
a paintbrush I couldn't go back in and
paint<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.270> really<00:01:45.930> thin<00:01:46.140> line<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:46.649> that

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
paint that really thin line but that

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.620 
paint that really thin line but that
with<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> fork<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.970> could<00:01:48.180> come<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.360> here<00:01:48.570> and

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
with a fork I could come in here and

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.859 
with a fork I could come in here and
make<00:01:48.810> these<00:01:48.990> really<00:01:49.259> neat<00:01:49.530> shapes<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:54.750> it

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
make these really neat shapes and it

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.920 
make these really neat shapes and it
looks<00:01:55.049> kind<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.399> animal-like<00:01:56.460> almost<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.270> it

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
looks kind of animal-like almost but it

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.260 
looks kind of animal-like almost but it
adds<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.320> lot<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.500> texture<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.250> painting<00:01:59.640> so

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
adds a lot of texture to the painting so

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.090 
adds a lot of texture to the painting so
don't<00:02:00.630> limit<00:02:00.810> yourself<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.560> what's<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
don't limit yourself on what's in the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.920 
don't limit yourself on what's in the
art<00:02:02.549> store<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.149> know<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.360> can<00:02:03.540> get<00:02:03.719> creative

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
art store you know you can get creative

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.139 
art store you know you can get creative
I<00:02:04.229> could<00:02:04.380> take<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.710> oyster<00:02:05.159> shucker<00:02:05.399> and

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
I could take this oyster shucker and

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.390 
I could take this oyster shucker and
just<00:02:06.500> scratch<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.799> out<00:02:08.300> scratch<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.539> out

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
just scratch this out scratch this out

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.860 
just scratch this out scratch this out
scratch<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.670> out

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.390 

so<00:02:16.870> that's<00:02:17.500> adding<00:02:17.680> texture<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.280> your

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
so that's adding texture to your

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.360 
so that's adding texture to your
abstract<00:02:18.760> painting
