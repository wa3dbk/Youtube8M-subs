00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 all beaver dear friends swami windows and 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.470
 today we'll talk about springtrap 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.450
 not even about one springtrap but about 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.469
 just do not forget a few please 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.500
 put like 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.020
 so here and tell your friends about 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.400
 this easter for a long time I get 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.010
 comments on what 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.560
 why is there some springtrap here 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.840
 well ka picks himself up and de explain and 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.880
 In general, it is time to explain were 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.789
 theories about the fact that both springtrap 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.920
 are true in one of them ox 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.649
 there is a purple guy and in another 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.630
 there is a pink guy well of course 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.120
 same not because if it were true 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.739
 then we would watch a whole game 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.120
 springtrap because we know that 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.340
 real people can't 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.649
 teleport and accordingly if 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.539
 would have been on this attraction 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.329
 one more person you would see 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.059
 the moment of his entrance to our attraction yet 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.079
 many speak on the subject of what is in 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.129
 the extra tab is a few 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.890
 springtrap and many do from this 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.769
 the conclusion is that there are several springtraps and 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.930
 you know i think they are right in 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.570
 the animatronics are shown not 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.490
 only but also animatronics and phantoms 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.299
 This means that the first stream hail 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.470
 is animatronic and here is the second 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.659
 I will explain to you a phantom a little further 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.640
 why I think this is how it is 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.920
 confirmed by scott himself but in 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.990
 screamer a few springtrap of because 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.060
 that he attacks from two sides 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.640
 note that the first cropper has 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.130
 us as if he attacks on the left and the second 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.210
 the crimper he rises head start what 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.610
 mean he attacks 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.549
 with ventilation and now back to 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.460
 explaining 2 springtrap is exactly 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.799
 when glitches start with ventilation 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.840
 will remind according to the background of the guy here like this 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.180
 very strange air because without 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.210
 ventilation means without purification 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.329
 this air causes the main character 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.159
 hallucinations 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.409
 because of this as he said tam already 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.170
 see weird stuff and that's it 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.179
 so when ventilation is completely 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:05.039
 breaks we can see 2 shearing trail 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:08.160
 and that is rather strange both 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.019
 springtraps are dangerous that is 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.540
 if you follow the springtrap on 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.060
 room 8 and then suddenly you 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.760
 turns off the ventilation near you can 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.890
 springtrap appear one more which 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.410
 can attack you and the main character 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.180
 will die however it doesn’t prove at all 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.610
 that phantom are real pro 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.099
 most likely the hero dies from 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.260
 some beetle or it's trite 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.970
 heart stops from fear because 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.700
 By the way, we don’t even know what 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.280
 us to do a real sprint 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.230
 he also does not kill us like a phantom 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.900
 he just comes to us and our main 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.359
 the hero gets too scared and dies 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.790
 literally fear and after all it is not only 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.489
 my words just recently scott released 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.760
 update for five nights at freddy's 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.129
 1.03 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.760
 in which he wrote that included 4 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.099
 stars 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.769
 and he also decided to explain why 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.019
 several sprig of ladders appear and 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.120
 here with plain text it says that you 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.840
 can see several springtrap of and 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.450
 this is not a glitch 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.000
 it is conceived from the very beginning skoda pro 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.799
 salon and explained this so may 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.680
 appear some springtrap of if 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.810
 suddenly you have broken ventilation around 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.260
 the amusement lights are burning red 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.480
 phantom springtrap phantom appears 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.389
 so in theory if you follow 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.540
 ventilation then you will not be disturbed 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:29.609
 this second springtrap so judging by 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.010
 the way Scott said though of course he 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.260
 I could lie but I personally do not think that 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.090
 in this place lied to us like that 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.720
 that there are a few sprig of ladders not 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.269
 there is nothing supernatural there 2 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.760
 purple guy is not there even pink 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.280
 guy and even the very springtrap if 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.540
 2 Strictly speaking, too, do not have it all 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.049
 just our game 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.519
 poisoned and david air 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.470
 imagination write what you think about 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.750
 this friends and we will meet in 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.240
 following videos thanks for watching 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.990
 bye Bye 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.990
 good luck
