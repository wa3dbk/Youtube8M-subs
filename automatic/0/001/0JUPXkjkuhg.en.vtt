00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:02.460
 the display is the Albtal 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.380
 I have just been there 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.689
 Bought AutoStore Fifth Avenue in New York it is the very first alheit 

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:12.689
 that has been sold there 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:17.550
 by all means the first iPad that has been sold in New York I know 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.169
 not if it is too 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.539
 in the whole US was by all means 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.029
 ever here a unique and therefore particularly valuable 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:30.749
 the packaging of the association 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.140
 Duck man couple stickers with the usual 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.120
 Key figures Asus the 16-gigabyte version 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.540
 So the cheapest model 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.540
 even without UMTS he could open his dad 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.970
 to find out where to just get up 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.090
 the whole package 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.090
 is not that hard 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.000
 if the surfaces for me again to save packaging material 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.000
 Packaging feels smooth and beautiful 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 and that happens 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.830
 there it is 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.830
 I have that time 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.760
 mirrored a bit 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.440
 Plastic wrap around it 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.940
 and 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.270
 it's and Bowman came in before 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.150
 I steal a bit more 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.780
 So it's the size 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.780
 compact for fish 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.160
 lies 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.070
 Big John that you can feel that you have one-stop 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.759
 is 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:53.700
 very 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.140
 Finding his back is jobless with no job 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.240
 very round about the two rounds 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.240
 a hot hatch 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.010
 yes the counter 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.819
 Cutie pie 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.950
 it is not any different than it is now we have to do that today of course 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.629
 in the back a bit 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.719
 it would have to be demolished 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.179
 but very, very nice 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:21.269
 Finally, the effect continues to shove on it and 16 gigabytes 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.949
 is that okay 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.739
 Salt is 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:40.039
 and also on 1 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:43.349
 very very precious very nice 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.449
 b you enjoy too tight 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:47.919
 what's going on 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:51.409
 So very very nice in the back very smooth the few light Max behind 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:54.300
 So not so mirror-smooth been 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.889
 original part 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:58.679
 Frankfurt 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.679
 the logo saves it tenth and thats you are me now 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:04.919
 sorry simply a better grip on the ground 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.999
 always be allowed to use coffee table 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:09.919
 yes the surface 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:12.549
 and defiant almost unable to touch on Wade 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.699
 he already has finger Pabst consumption 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:15.499
 but 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:18.499
 actually very nice 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.829
 "Now we're going to look at the East, otherwise we'll get it in the package 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.799
 the picture shows 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:30.969
 they are Fuentes 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:33.189
 p 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:36.189
 fen 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:39.789
 and we are happy that in our and 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:42.299
 the usual on everyone's fights are yes 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.199
 Pfeiffer product it seems to the point 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.309
 Not 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:51.579
 So is the connector as the connection to with coolies b 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:55.959
 In the end, it is just normal Charles becomes conspicuous old 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.099
 your turn 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:59.239
 whether head 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.969
 for charging 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:04.160
 and that is asked what is it like that is the power supply unit 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.010
 and here that's the problem now because it's bought in the US is this one 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.549
 Route lie 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.549
 the dozen pros the sea-dwellers of course 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.949
 we need to top ourselves again 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.049
 but that's the nice thing about APA 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.099
 JPY you can just do things off 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.099
 and a German occlusive disease 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.419
 You have to keep that in mind, not a new one 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.189
 Charger so cook here could USB 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:33.219
 could plug in USB 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:36.639
 so you can use it so a plug-in animals that is also part of it 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.780
 yes that's the basic equipment that we succeeded in doing is the real one 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.430
 method 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.259
 H 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.689
 Vossen Plastik that I have to say honestly intimately better packaging 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:48.490
 used to Apple 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.460
 then around the iPhone that could be these rules 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.919
 black 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.120
 the casket with Smith with these self consumed this is one 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.650
 bit of plastic so that's it 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.210
 that hurt so much 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.189
 such a standard product 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:06.240
 DAPD 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.240
 at the end of the 8 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.139
 but now mostly come only with 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.139
 I've never done it that's an absolute premiere for me too 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.379
 So what 's up, I know that you' re in the camera as much as possible 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:24.569
 Institute concerned the city 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:27.569
 Youngster played 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.020
 it happens 

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:41.559
 Norton 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.160
 it's hard so it does not end up like that now 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.910
 It is also easy to say that you have something in your hand 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:48.539
 Has 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:49.969
 and at 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:51.090
 could imagine 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.499
 a mistake that I'm about to get ready for 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:56.839
 then i have to pause the video briefly i in front of the computer and 

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:57.289
 then 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:58.089
 we want to do
