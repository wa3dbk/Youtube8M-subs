lot of notes what we're doing is we're

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.680 
lot of notes what we're doing is we're
basically<00:04:11.370> looking<00:04:11.790> at<00:04:12.060> what<00:04:12.209> we<00:04:12.329> knew<00:04:12.510> with

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
basically looking at what we knew with

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.449 
basically looking at what we knew with
the<00:04:12.810> minor<00:04:12.989> pentatonic<00:04:13.409> and<00:04:13.829> just<00:04:14.040> add<00:04:14.129> a<00:04:14.159> few

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
the minor pentatonic and just add a few

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:15.949 
the minor pentatonic and just add a few
extra<00:04:14.579> notes<00:04:14.879> we're<00:04:15.180> not<00:04:15.299> looking<00:04:15.629> a<00:04:15.720> whole

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
extra notes we're not looking a whole

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.500 
extra notes we're not looking a whole
new<00:04:16.199> scale<00:04:16.440> shape<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:16.970> then<00:04:17.970> if<00:04:18.120> we<00:04:18.269> follow

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
new scale shape and then if we follow

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.479 
new scale shape and then if we follow
that<00:04:18.840> through<00:04:19.229> as<00:04:19.500> long<00:04:19.769> as<00:04:19.889> the<00:04:19.979> pattern<00:04:20.340> is

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
that through as long as the pattern is

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.000 
that through as long as the pattern is
the<00:04:20.639> same<00:04:20.669> from<00:04:21.269> every<00:04:21.780> octave<00:04:22.260> or<00:04:22.530> every

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
the same from every octave or every

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.279 
the same from every octave or every
every<00:04:23.430> one<00:04:23.550> of<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.699> same<00:04:23.910> note<00:04:24.180> we<00:04:24.930> can<00:04:24.960> play

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
every one of the same note we can play

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.689 
every one of the same note we can play
these<00:04:25.560> when<00:04:25.800> we<00:04:25.889> know<00:04:26.010> exactly<00:04:26.400> where<00:04:26.580> they

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
these when we know exactly where they

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:26.990 
these when we know exactly where they
are

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000
