got to thinking I mean I know there's a

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.009 
got to thinking I mean I know there's a
little<00:01:02.499> bit<00:01:02.649> of<00:01:02.829> a<00:01:02.920> difference<00:01:03.370> between<00:01:04.019> cane

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
little bit of a difference between cane

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
sugar and beet sugar not much though I

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.380 
sugar and beet sugar not much though I
mean<00:01:08.740> it's<00:01:08.890> still<00:01:09.130> sugar<00:01:09.430> it's<00:01:09.820> I<00:01:10.000> mean<00:01:10.360> it's

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
mean it's still sugar it's I mean it's

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.360 
mean it's still sugar it's I mean it's
not<00:01:10.659> that<00:01:10.960> great<00:01:11.320> for<00:01:11.380> us<00:01:11.680> we<00:01:11.830> all<00:01:11.950> should<00:01:12.190> be

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
not that great for us we all should be

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.660 
not that great for us we all should be
using<00:01:13.240> less<00:01:13.780> of<00:01:13.810> it<00:01:14.260> I<00:01:14.470> haven't<00:01:15.190> got<00:01:15.430> to<00:01:15.640> a

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
using less of it I haven't got to a

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.630 
using less of it I haven't got to a
point<00:01:16.030> in<00:01:16.360> my<00:01:16.750> life<00:01:17.350> where<00:01:17.920> we<00:01:18.100> don't<00:01:18.310> use<00:01:18.610> a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
point in my life where we don't use a

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.250 
point in my life where we don't use a
little<00:01:19.150> of<00:01:19.270> it<00:01:19.390> every<00:01:19.570> now<00:01:19.690> and<00:01:19.840> then<00:01:19.930> I<00:01:19.990> made<00:01:20.230> a

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
little of it every now and then I made a

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.500 
little of it every now and then I made a
cake<00:01:20.500> yesterday<00:01:21.040> that's<00:01:21.220> a<00:01:21.340> rare<00:01:21.550> a<00:01:21.970> rare

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
cake yesterday that's a rare a rare

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.300 
cake yesterday that's a rare a rare
occurrence<00:01:22.990> but<00:01:23.380> occasionally<00:01:23.800> I<00:01:23.950> used<00:01:24.190> to

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
occurrence but occasionally I used to

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.250 
occurrence but occasionally I used to
live<00:01:24.460> sure<00:01:24.670> so<00:01:25.630> I'm<00:01:25.690> like<00:01:25.840> I<00:01:25.960> wonder<00:01:26.110> if

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
live sure so I'm like I wonder if

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.740 
live sure so I'm like I wonder if
there's<00:01:26.500> really<00:01:26.860> that<00:01:27.220> big<00:01:27.760> a<00:01:28.000> difference<00:01:28.210> and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
there's really that big a difference and

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.530 
there's really that big a difference and
so<00:01:29.350> ever<00:01:29.560> did<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:30.040> research<00:01:30.610> one<00:01:31.390> of<00:01:31.450> the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
so ever did the research one of the

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.900 
so ever did the research one of the
things<00:01:31.720> I<00:01:31.840> noted<00:01:32.170> was<00:01:32.350> that<00:01:32.760> some<00:01:33.760> of<00:01:33.850> the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
things I noted was that some of the

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.810 
things I noted was that some of the
researchers<00:01:34.420> say<00:01:34.630> that<00:01:35.190> beet<00:01:36.190> sugar<00:01:36.580> is<00:01:36.790> a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
researchers say that beet sugar is a

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.880 
researchers say that beet sugar is a
dirtier<00:01:37.330> sugar<00:01:37.660> than<00:01:37.900> cane<00:01:38.140> sugar<00:01:38.500> because

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
dirtier sugar than cane sugar because

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.460 
dirtier sugar than cane sugar because
there's<00:01:39.070> just<00:01:39.130> no<00:01:39.670> way<00:01:40.000> to<00:01:40.270> get<00:01:40.540> every<00:01:41.320> little

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
there's just no way to get every little

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.950 
there's just no way to get every little
bit<00:01:41.770> of<00:01:41.980> dirt<00:01:42.190> out<00:01:42.910> of<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.300> sugar<00:01:43.540> beets<00:01:43.750> when

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
bit of dirt out of the sugar beets when

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.030 
bit of dirt out of the sugar beets when
they<00:01:44.050> process<00:01:44.530> them<00:01:44.650> so<00:01:44.800> that<00:01:44.920> was

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
they process them so that was

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.140 
they process them so that was
interesting<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:47.710> there<00:01:48.160> is<00:01:48.460> a<00:01:48.490> difference

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
interesting but there is a difference

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.000 
interesting but there is a difference
and<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.880> research<00:01:52.330> is<00:01:52.540> hard<00:01:52.930> to<00:01:53.230> find<00:01:53.500> and

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
and the research is hard to find and

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.600 
and the research is hard to find and
I've<00:01:54.490> searched<00:01:55.180> several<00:01:55.690> sites<00:01:56.320> in<00:01:56.680> fact<00:01:57.400> one

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
I've searched several sites in fact one

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.300 
I've searched several sites in fact one
of<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.790> things<00:01:57.940> I<00:01:58.060> did<00:01:58.270> was<00:01:58.300> I<00:01:58.480> went<00:01:58.780> to

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
of the things I did was I went to

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.770 
of the things I did was I went to
dominoes<00:02:00.310> on<00:02:00.580> site<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.240> I<00:02:01.300> left<00:02:01.510> them<00:02:01.690> a

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
dominoes on site and I left them a

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.410 
dominoes on site and I left them a
message<00:02:01.810> saying<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:02.770> it<00:02:03.280> was<00:02:03.400> pertaining<00:02:04.300> to

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
message saying and it was pertaining to

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.840 
message saying and it was pertaining to
this<00:02:04.600> exact<00:02:05.080> sugar<00:02:05.710> right<00:02:06.010> here<00:02:06.250> I<00:02:06.280> talked

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
this exact sugar right here I talked

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.309 
this exact sugar right here I talked
about<00:02:07.120> the<00:02:07.240> sugar<00:02:07.450> in<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.630> four<00:02:07.840> pound<00:02:08.080> bag

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
about the sugar in the four pound bag

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.559 
about the sugar in the four pound bag
the<00:02:08.530> granulated<00:02:08.920> sugar<00:02:09.069> and<00:02:09.550> I<00:02:10.000> sent<00:02:10.330> them<00:02:10.450> a

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
the granulated sugar and I sent them a

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.290 
the granulated sugar and I sent them a
message<00:02:10.989> saying<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:12.099> your<00:02:13.560> cane<00:02:14.560> sugar

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
message saying is your cane sugar

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.690 
message saying is your cane sugar
granulated<00:02:16.300> sugar<00:02:16.450> genetically<00:02:17.290> modified<00:02:17.800> so

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
granulated sugar genetically modified so

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.130 
granulated sugar genetically modified so
I<00:02:18.730> haven't<00:02:19.000> heard<00:02:19.210> back<00:02:19.390> from<00:02:19.450> them<00:02:19.870> so<00:02:20.020> I'll

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
I haven't heard back from them so I'll

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.510 
I haven't heard back from them so I'll
be<00:02:20.260> waiting<00:02:20.620> on<00:02:20.710> that<00:02:20.770> and<00:02:21.100> I'll<00:02:21.160> let<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.490> know

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
be waiting on that and I'll let you know

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.280 
be waiting on that and I'll let you know
when<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:21.790> get<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.090> answer<00:02:22.500> but

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
when I get the answer but

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.780 
when I get the answer but
I<00:02:24.379> researched<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:25.040> lot<00:02:25.159> of<00:02:25.219> different<00:02:25.549> sites

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
I researched a lot of different sites

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.309 
I researched a lot of different sites
and<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:26.060> came<00:02:26.269> to<00:02:26.450> this<00:02:26.629> one<00:02:26.840> which<00:02:26.959> is<00:02:27.079> called

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
and I came to this one which is called

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.069 
and I came to this one which is called
Nam<00:02:27.650> Nam<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:28.909> they<00:02:29.870> sell<00:02:30.939> palm<00:02:31.939> sugar<00:02:32.390> that's

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
Nam Nam and they sell palm sugar that's

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.110 
Nam Nam and they sell palm sugar that's
I<00:02:33.290> mean<00:02:33.409> that's<00:02:33.469> their<00:02:33.799> business<00:02:34.159> that's<00:02:34.939> what

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
I mean that's their business that's what

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.009 
I mean that's their business that's what
they<00:02:35.269> do<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:36.700> they<00:02:37.700> have<00:02:37.969> a<00:02:38.269> bunch<00:02:38.629> of<00:02:38.719> articles

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
they do so they have a bunch of articles

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.050 
they do so they have a bunch of articles
on<00:02:39.379> sugar<00:02:39.769> there<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.310> I<00:02:40.370> went<00:02:40.609> to<00:02:40.730> this<00:02:40.849> one

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
on sugar there and I went to this one

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.699 
on sugar there and I went to this one
that<00:02:41.150> said<00:02:41.329> genetically<00:02:41.930> modified<00:02:42.409> sugar

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
that said genetically modified sugar

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.390 
that said genetically modified sugar
cane<00:02:43.420> coming<00:02:44.420> soon<00:02:44.689> to<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.900> store<00:02:45.290> near<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.709> and

cane coming soon to a store near you and

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.170 
cane coming soon to a store near you and
I<00:02:47.590> couldn't<00:02:48.590> find<00:02:48.859> a<00:02:49.099> date<00:02:49.430> on<00:02:49.670> this<00:02:49.849> article

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
I couldn't find a date on this article

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.460 
I couldn't find a date on this article
but<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.480> doesn't<00:02:50.750> matter<00:02:50.900> because<00:02:51.019> there's

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
but it doesn't matter because there's

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.339 
but it doesn't matter because there's
dates<00:02:51.769> listed<00:02:52.159> in<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.939> article<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.569> it<00:02:54.139> was

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
a little bit about what it says because

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.839 
a little bit about what it says because
it's<00:03:02.299> interesting<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:03.519> what<00:03:04.519> I<00:03:04.549> find

it's interesting and what I find

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.460 
it's interesting and what I find
fascinating<00:03:05.030> is<00:03:05.329> these<00:03:05.540> people<00:03:05.840> are<00:03:05.900> trying

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
fascinating is these people are trying

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.899 
fascinating is these people are trying
to<00:03:06.530> sell<00:03:06.799> palm<00:03:07.159> sugar<00:03:07.459> but<00:03:07.669> they're<00:03:07.790> not

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
to sell palm sugar but they're not

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.369 
to sell palm sugar but they're not
really<00:03:08.090> particularly<00:03:08.569> trashing<00:03:09.169> the<00:03:09.260> other

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
really particularly trashing the other

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:10.539 
really particularly trashing the other
sugars<00:03:09.829> they're<00:03:09.980> just<00:03:10.189> giving<00:03:10.430> you<00:03:10.519> some

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
sugars they're just giving you some

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:17.619 
sugars they're just giving you some
information<00:03:11.269> here<00:03:11.480> but<00:03:12.470> they<00:03:12.620> say<00:03:12.980> that<00:03:16.629> beet

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
information here but they say that beet

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.659 
information here but they say that beet
sugar<00:03:17.989> has<00:03:18.319> been<00:03:18.560> genetically<00:03:18.889> modified<00:03:19.040> for

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
sugar has been genetically modified for

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.970 
sugar has been genetically modified for
a<00:03:19.700> long<00:03:19.879> time<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:20.659> when<00:03:21.230> they<00:03:21.319> started<00:03:21.739> trying

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
a long time and when they started trying

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.500 
a long time and when they started trying
to<00:03:22.340> market<00:03:24.010> genetically<00:03:25.010> modified<00:03:25.510> sugar

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
to market genetically modified sugar

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.830 
to market genetically modified sugar
cane<00:03:27.159> sugar<00:03:28.159> that<00:03:28.790> there<00:03:28.970> was<00:03:29.090> a<00:03:29.120> big<00:03:29.510> outcry

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
cane sugar that there was a big outcry

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.909 
cane sugar that there was a big outcry
and<00:03:31.030> that<00:03:32.030> was<00:03:32.180> very<00:03:32.449> unsuccessful<00:03:33.019> it<00:03:33.680> kind

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:33.919 
and that was very unsuccessful it kind

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.569 
and that was very unsuccessful it kind
of<00:03:33.979> dropped<00:03:34.310> trying<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.479> to<00:03:36.409> modify<00:03:37.129> it<00:03:37.190> and

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
of dropped trying to to modify it and

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.449 
of dropped trying to to modify it and
the<00:03:38.209> research<00:03:38.599> shows<00:03:38.629> that<00:03:38.959> it's<00:03:39.290> it<00:03:39.979> was<00:03:40.129> very

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
the research shows that it's it was very

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.610 
the research shows that it's it was very
easy<00:03:40.879> to<00:03:41.120> genetically<00:03:41.629> modify<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:42.169> beet<00:03:42.440> but

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
easy to genetically modify the beet but

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.899 
easy to genetically modify the beet but
they're<00:03:42.739> having<00:03:42.919> a<00:03:43.129> lot<00:03:43.190> of<00:03:43.250> trouble<00:03:43.669> with<00:03:43.760> the

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
they're having a lot of trouble with the

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.449 
they're having a lot of trouble with the
sugar<00:03:44.150> cane<00:03:44.419> and<00:03:44.840> so<00:03:45.560> it<00:03:45.739> says<00:03:46.040> here

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459

I'm<00:04:05.449> gonna<00:04:05.540> skip<00:04:05.810> down<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:05.989> ask<00:04:06.530> for<00:04:06.859> GM<00:04:07.159> sugar

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:20.659 
sugar cane in their sights so that's

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:22.420 
sugar cane in their sights so that's
interesting<00:04:21.079> I<00:04:21.500> think<00:04:21.620> they're<00:04:22.070> already

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
interesting I think they're already

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.330 
interesting I think they're already
growing<00:04:22.669> some<00:04:23.060> BT<00:04:23.449> sugarcane<00:04:23.990> in<00:04:24.169> Brazil<00:04:24.590> but

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
growing some BT sugarcane in Brazil but

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.379 
growing some BT sugarcane in Brazil but
it<00:04:25.460> appears<00:04:26.000> not<00:04:26.750> in<00:04:27.020> this<00:04:27.259> country<00:04:27.800> so<00:04:28.580> what

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
it appears not in this country so what

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.469 
it appears not in this country so what
you're<00:04:29.599> looking<00:04:30.199> at<00:04:30.320> here<00:04:30.380> this<00:04:31.340> sugar<00:04:31.759> may

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
you're looking at here this sugar may

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.080 
you're looking at here this sugar may
not<00:04:32.810> be<00:04:33.229> genetically<00:04:33.889> modified<00:04:34.370> and<00:04:34.610> I<00:04:34.760> use

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
not be genetically modified and I use

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.839 
not be genetically modified and I use
that<00:04:35.380> term<00:04:36.380> loosely<00:04:36.440> it<00:04:37.130> may

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
that term loosely it may

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:41.019 
that term loosely it may
be<00:04:38.209> genetically<00:04:39.050> modified<00:04:39.589> so<00:04:40.309> I<00:04:40.339> might<00:04:40.789> pick

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:41.029 
be genetically modified so I might pick

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:42.730 
be genetically modified so I might pick
up<00:04:41.179> a<00:04:41.330> little<00:04:41.360> bit<00:04:41.689> of<00:04:41.809> this<00:04:41.990> for<00:04:42.229> food<00:04:42.439> stores

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
up a little bit of this for food stores

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.469 
up a little bit of this for food stores
just<00:04:43.009> and<00:04:43.219> hope<00:04:43.399> that<00:04:43.550> it's<00:04:43.699> not<00:04:43.759> because<00:04:44.270> you

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
just and hope that it's not because you

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.320 
just and hope that it's not because you
know<00:04:44.830> that<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:46.039> regular<00:04:46.669> sugarcane<00:04:47.149> you're

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
know that the regular sugarcane you're

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.139 
know that the regular sugarcane you're
buying<00:04:47.569> that's<00:04:48.199> made<00:04:48.439> from<00:04:48.679> beets<00:04:48.860> it<00:04:49.189> is<00:04:49.520> for

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:50.149 
buying that's made from beets it is for

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:52.839 
buying that's made from beets it is for
certain<00:04:50.439> so<00:04:51.439> anyway<00:04:51.919> just<00:04:52.099> a<00:04:52.309> little<00:04:52.520> heads-up

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
certain so anyway just a little heads-up

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:54.790 
certain so anyway just a little heads-up
on<00:04:53.029> that<00:04:53.300> you<00:04:54.020> might<00:04:54.199> want<00:04:54.439> to<00:04:54.469> do<00:04:54.619> some

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
on that you might want to do some

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.589 
on that you might want to do some
research<00:04:54.979> too<00:04:55.490> it's<00:04:55.699> kind<00:04:55.849> of<00:04:55.939> fascinating<00:04:56.509> as

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
research too it's kind of fascinating as

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:58.989 
research too it's kind of fascinating as
you<00:04:56.689> read<00:04:56.839> about<00:04:57.009> about<00:04:58.009> these<00:04:58.279> sugars<00:04:58.759> and

00:04:58.989 --> 00:04:58.999 
you read about about these sugars and

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:02.859 
you read about about these sugars and
how<00:04:59.330> they're<00:04:59.509> processed<00:05:01.209> anyway<00:05:02.209> hope<00:05:02.689> that

00:05:02.859 --> 00:05:02.869 
how they're processed anyway hope that

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:04.089 
how they're processed anyway hope that
gives<00:05:03.080> you<00:05:03.139> at<00:05:03.319> least<00:05:03.349> some<00:05:03.679> food<00:05:03.860> for<00:05:04.039> thought

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:04.099 
gives you at least some food for thought

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:06.010 
gives you at least some food for thought

I'm gonna go get a little bit of this

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.919 
I'm gonna go get a little bit of this
cane<00:05:06.259> sugar<00:05:06.589> to<00:05:06.740> put<00:05:06.889> in<00:05:06.979> my<00:05:07.129> storage<00:05:07.899> be<00:05:08.899> a

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:08.929 
cane sugar to put in my storage be a

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:12.550 
cane sugar to put in my storage be a
