I split in the back and that's pretty
much<00:02:23.340> all<00:02:23.820> there<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.830> hiker<00:02:26.100> symbols

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
much all there is and the hiker symbols

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.150 
much all there is and the hiker symbols
are<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.180> small<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.930> looks<00:02:28.170> more<00:02:28.470> like<00:02:28.740> he<00:02:28.950> works

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
are so small it looks more like he works

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.390 
are so small it looks more like he works
for<00:02:29.580> Cobra<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:31.020> also<00:02:31.200> comes<00:02:31.650> with<00:02:31.770> part<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.280> a

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
for Cobra it also comes with part of a

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.820 
for Cobra it also comes with part of a
build<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.880> figure<00:02:33.090> which<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.960> assume<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.410> means

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
build a figure which I assume that means

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.910 
build a figure which I assume that means
a<00:02:35.100> figure<00:02:35.490> that<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.910> can<00:02:36.180> build<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:37.440> has<00:02:37.710> this

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
a figure that you can build it has this

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.360 
a figure that you can build it has this
double-edged<00:02:38.640> blade<00:02:39.600> thing<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.680> fist<00:02:41.010> that

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
double-edged blade thing and a fist that

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.500 
double-edged blade thing and a fist that
doesn't<00:02:41.670> move<00:02:41.850> but<00:02:42.330> does<00:02:43.200> rotate<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:44.100> bend<00:02:44.730> it

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
doesn't move but does rotate and bend it

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.380 
doesn't move but does rotate and bend it
also<00:02:46.260> comes<00:02:46.710> with<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:47.010> joint<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:47.880> assume

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
also comes with a joint that I assume

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.140 
also comes with a joint that I assume
attaches<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.980> something<00:02:50.340> else<00:02:50.550> from<00:02:50.850> another

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150
