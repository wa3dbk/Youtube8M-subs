00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
new react 100 helmets they look similar

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.210 
new react 100 helmets they look similar
but<00:00:16.170> they<00:00:16.289> just<00:00:16.500> look<00:00:16.619> like<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.770> nice<00:00:17.010> evolution

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
but they just look like a nice evolution

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.970 
but they just look like a nice evolution
of<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.000> react<00:00:18.359> but<00:00:19.260> now<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.439> was<00:00:19.619> looking<00:00:19.859> at

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
of the react but now I was looking at

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.429 
of the react but now I was looking at
the<00:00:20.160> liner<00:00:20.400> here<00:00:20.930> what<00:00:21.930> are<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.199> big

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
the liner here what are the big

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.410 
the liner here what are the big
differences<00:00:23.010> or<00:00:23.279> big<00:00:23.490> changes<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.150> we<00:00:24.240> see

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
differences or big changes that we see

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.880 
differences or big changes that we see
from<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.750> reactor<00:00:25.260> there's<00:00:25.439> actually<00:00:25.740> quite

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
from that reactor there's actually quite

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.300 
from that reactor there's actually quite
a<00:00:25.980> few<00:00:26.310> improvements<00:00:27.300> we<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.710> know<00:00:28.830> when<00:00:29.279> we

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
a few improvements we you know when we

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.370 
a few improvements we you know when we
launch<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.730> react<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.210> said<00:00:30.420> hey<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:31.170> is

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
launch to react we said hey this is

or this one so can you tell me a little

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.650 
or this one so can you tell me a little
bit<00:00:55.920> about<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.340> definitely<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.270> know<00:00:57.480> what

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
bit about that definitely you know what

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.349 
bit about that definitely you know what
we're<00:00:58.230> calling<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.680> spent<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.340> its<00:01:00.120> it

we're calling this a spent a to its it

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.900 
we're calling this a spent a to its it
again<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:01.020> your<00:01:01.140> points<00:01:01.440> very<00:01:01.649> similar<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.370> it

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
again to your points very similar but it

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.770 
again to your points very similar but it
is<00:01:03.660> improved<00:01:04.080> we're<00:01:04.439> using<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.760> new<00:01:06.360> system

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
is improved we're using a new system

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.920 
is improved we're using a new system
called<00:01:07.110> flex<00:01:07.830> orb<00:01:08.070> technology<00:01:08.670> as<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.780> can

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
called flex orb technology as you can

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
of a darker feature but what it is it's

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.149 
of a darker feature but what it is it's
it's<00:01:15.000> Poron<00:01:15.689> XRD<00:01:15.780> molded<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> four-way

past and we found out that injuries can

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.020 
past and we found out that injuries can
occur<00:01:42.689> when<00:01:43.500> player<00:01:43.860> falls<00:01:44.159> down<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.790> hits

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
occur when player falls down and hits

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.469 
occur when player falls down and hits
smacks<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.869> back<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.170> their<00:01:46.259> head<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.770> ice

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
smacks the back of their head on the ice

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.090 
smacks the back of their head on the ice
especially<00:01:48.479> those<00:01:48.659> high-energy<00:01:49.049> hits<00:01:49.799> that's

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
especially those high-energy hits that's

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.249 
especially those high-energy hits that's
that<00:01:50.520> that's<00:01:50.850> very<00:01:50.939> usually<00:01:51.390> occur<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:51.840> that's

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
that that's very usually occur so that's

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.719 
that that's very usually occur so that's
actually<00:01:52.560> actually<00:01:52.710> where<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.100> put<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.399> 7

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
actually actually where we put the 7

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.990 
actually actually where we put the 7
tech<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.509> embedded<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.079> into<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.369> key<00:01:56.640> area

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
tech we embedded it into this key area

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.899 
tech we embedded it into this key area
in<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> back<00:01:57.479> through<00:01:57.899> here<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.700> player

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
in the back through here so if a player

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.179 
in the back through here so if a player
does<00:02:00.119> slip<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.570> fall<00:02:00.780> or<00:02:00.810> gets<00:02:01.200> hit<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.710> falls

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
does slip and fall or gets hit and falls

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.130 
does slip and fall or gets hit and falls
in<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.460> back<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.790> their<00:02:02.880> head<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.960> know<00:02:04.079> you

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
in the back of their head you know you

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.560 
in the back of their head you know you
have<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.530> material<00:02:04.979> there<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.310> then<00:02:05.880> what

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
have this material there and then what

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.199 
have this material there and then what
about<00:02:06.810> up<00:02:07.079> into<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:08.580> kind<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.819> forehead

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
about up into the kind of forehead

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.490 
about up into the kind of forehead
region<00:02:09.599> here<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.840> looks<00:02:10.020> like<00:02:10.140> there's<00:02:10.319> some

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
region here it looks like there's some

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.320 
region here it looks like there's some
cool<00:02:10.679> improvements<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.489> saw<00:02:11.700> yeah

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
cool improvements that I saw yeah

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.850 
cool improvements that I saw yeah
definitely<00:02:12.810> we<00:02:12.930> included

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
definitely we included

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.250 
definitely we included
this<00:02:13.920> new<00:02:14.130> moisture<00:02:14.550> management<00:02:15.030> system<00:02:15.420> one

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
this new moisture management system one

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.800 
this new moisture management system one
adds<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.740> level<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.190> comfort<00:02:17.490> but<00:02:18.210> -<00:02:18.420> it's<00:02:18.600> also

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
adds a level of comfort but - it's also

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.600 
adds a level of comfort but - it's also
has<00:02:19.080> channels<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:19.710> it<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.340> know

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
has channels in it so you know

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.490 
has channels in it so you know
traditional<00:02:21.120> helmets<00:02:21.480> player<00:02:22.170> leans<00:02:22.410> forward

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
traditional helmets player leans forward

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.830 
traditional helmets player leans forward
a<00:02:22.890> lot<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.160> moisture<00:02:23.370> or<00:02:23.850> preparation<00:02:24.390> you

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
a lot of moisture or preparation you

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.660 
a lot of moisture or preparation you
know<00:02:24.930> comes<00:02:25.380> out<00:02:25.590> onto<00:02:25.950> their<00:02:26.070> face<00:02:26.310> or<00:02:26.580> on

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
know comes out onto their face or on

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.210 
know comes out onto their face or on
their<00:02:26.790> face<00:02:27.210> mask<00:02:27.510> or<00:02:27.720> visor<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.100> these

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
their face mask or visor and so these

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.620 
their face mask or visor and so these
channels<00:02:29.610> do<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.790> good<00:02:29.970> job<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.330> actually

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
channels do a good job of actually

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.230 
channels do a good job of actually
angling<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.290> moisture<00:02:31.770> away<00:02:32.100> from<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.120> ice

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
angling that moisture away from the ice

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.570 
angling that moisture away from the ice
awesome<00:02:34.110> well<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.560> guess<00:02:34.710> continuing<00:02:35.400> with

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
awesome well I guess continuing with

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.970 
awesome well I guess continuing with
that<00:02:35.790> comfort<00:02:36.300> let's<00:02:36.900> go<00:02:37.020> out<00:02:37.200> out<00:02:37.440> onto<00:02:37.890> the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
that comfort let's go out out onto the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.710 
that comfort let's go out out onto the
shell<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.430> look<00:02:38.580> at<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.850> new<00:02:39.030> fit<00:02:39.270> system

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
shell and look at that new fit system

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.910 
shell and look at that new fit system
how<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:39.900> kind<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.200> has<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.830> know

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
how it kind of has that you know

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.830 
how it kind of has that you know
different<00:02:41.310> kind<00:02:41.459> of<00:02:41.520> work<00:02:41.880> than<00:02:42.360> what<00:02:42.480> we<00:02:42.630> saw

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
different kind of work than what we saw

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.650 
different kind of work than what we saw
in<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.380> react<00:02:43.680> okay<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:44.910> is<00:02:45.120> what<00:02:45.540> we're

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
in the react okay so this is what we're

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.360 
in the react okay so this is what we're
calling<00:02:45.840> if<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.260> want<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.500> trade<00:02:46.680> here<00:02:46.860> what

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
calling if you want to trade here what

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.070 
calling if you want to trade here what
we're<00:02:47.520> calling<00:02:47.670> your<00:02:48.360> fit<00:02:48.570> system<00:02:48.780> it's

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
we're calling your fit system it's

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.830 
we're calling your fit system it's
composed<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.620> three<00:02:49.980> different<00:02:50.330> elements<00:02:51.330> we

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
composed of three different elements we

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.710 
composed of three different elements we
have<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:52.050> central<00:02:52.590> truelist<00:02:52.950> adjustment<00:02:53.550> so<00:02:54.030> so

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
have a central truelist adjustment so so

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.930 
have a central truelist adjustment so so
a<00:02:54.750> quick<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.680> easy<00:02:55.830> adjustment<00:02:56.130> what<00:02:56.640> we<00:02:56.760> did

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
a quick and easy adjustment what we did

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.990 
a quick and easy adjustment what we did
is<00:02:57.030> we<00:02:57.060> inverted<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:58.070> from<00:02:59.070> previous<00:02:59.610> models

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
is we inverted it from previous models

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.790 
is we inverted it from previous models
and<00:03:00.270> what<00:03:00.600> that<00:03:00.750> does<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.140> just<00:03:01.170> allows<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.770> to

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
and what that does it just allows it to

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.820 
and what that does it just allows it to
one<00:03:02.580> walk<00:03:02.940> better<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:04.020> also<00:03:04.170> stays<00:03:04.560> very

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
one walk better and it also stays very

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.690 
one walk better and it also stays very
stable<00:03:05.160> at<00:03:06.000> impact<00:03:06.920> another<00:03:07.920> key<00:03:08.190> element<00:03:08.340> is

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
stable at impact another key element is

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.060 
stable at impact another key element is
the<00:03:09.209> occipital<00:03:09.570> lock<00:03:10.020> located<00:03:10.709> in<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.860> back

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
the occipital lock located in the back

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.520 
the occipital lock located in the back
to<00:03:12.030> help<00:03:12.180> stabilize<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.750> back<00:03:13.110> of<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.350> head

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
to help stabilize the back of the head

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.729 
to help stabilize the back of the head
during<00:03:14.400> play<00:03:14.760> as<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:15.810> can<00:03:15.930> see<00:03:16.140> we<00:03:16.380> went<00:03:16.560> back

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
during play as you can see we went back

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.229 
during play as you can see we went back
to<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:16.980> two<00:03:17.190> dial<00:03:17.400> system<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:18.060> functions

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
to a two dial system that functions

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.110 
to a two dial system that functions
great<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.769> allows<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.519> know<00:03:20.549> still
