00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.320
 he does not die even once I move around 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.119
 the whole map did not champion either I'm going to take it out 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.740
 you are going to see what I would have 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.840
 make a game action of the saya the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.239
 true that this morning was a failure 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.550
 since at 12 when it arrives they have 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.489
 put to play and take me some games 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.370
 hallucinating has taken me 2 very in a row 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.100
 an authentic and an active insula and you 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.440
 you will know that tomorrow friends and 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.930
 well let's talk about this video that 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.820
 is what we are going to and what is interesting and is 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.280
 that here as you know leads the mp feels 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.250
 since I'm doing the rap series 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.859
 you mp7 valero to his voice until he arrives 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.589
 to gold I have autumn already worth it 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.510
 we are in double points of agreement and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.520
 what happens with the double points so that 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.880
 its very fast and good level and 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.780
 in autumn in the sixth episode but still 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.140
 134 episodes will be smaller and the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.700
 friends that although the 37th party and when 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.280
 it's over the back had the top 7 of 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.979
 friends there will be more things our functions 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.130
 and good I hope you liked the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.899
 montage that I did yesterday is worth what yesterday 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.610
 you will not have I will not leave the 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.039
 distribution we are worth if you will not have it 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.399
 seen I hope you see it since it has 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.319
 cost a lot of effort the truth is not 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.869
 easy to get good low all 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.399
 days is worth modern warfare2 and less 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.759
 in modern warfare2 since lately 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.530
 is the unplayable modern warfare2 on 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.579
 all the weekend like I told you 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.750
 since apparently they usually concentrate the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.330
 Most players 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.340
 - frost so to speak, normally 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.190
 because they were more children does not mean that 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.229
 the more kids are more kids are 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.259
 but none of that simply those that are 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.539
 those who usually carry cameras 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.670
 close but good do not come to the subject 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.450
 all this since we are here in modern 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.850
 warfare 3 with a game of insist 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.520
 we are with double points what does it mean 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.130
 that then friends we are with points for 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.580
 four yes because when you throw the web like 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.830
 you know you multiply by two is worth 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.110
 points and having double points since 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.709
 we have until today Monday valley and this one 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.350
 it will end then I have points by four at 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.319
 end of the game and there is a moment of 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.709
 the game that 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:47.329
 I am already telling you without a barbarity of 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.780
 points you'll see more on the right 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:53.489
 well here you see I'm going around 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.849
 everything is worth 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.500
 the map or I do not stay still where 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.450
 I was separating the started and I spin 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.519
 US never know side 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.010
 map and that's one of the keys to 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.439
 get the fashion and that is how you play 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.180
 with moderately good people the moment 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.769
 that it needs to be a roaming site and 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.530
 sending them all the time they will go for 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.760
 you to death and it is one of the failures that 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.189
 I will comment later 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.400
 talk as though not talk about 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:23.159
 audience if I see something I have here 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.230
 they started then I'm going to tell you 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:28.799
 in plan as tips so to speak 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.199
 to play since it 's an old dog in 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.139
 this since it took a lot of time in the 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:36.419
 call of duty and many hours played 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:39.030
 between all numbers I want to imagine 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:42.599
 the work discovers spending DÃ­az Cabrera Chau 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.970
 ok then I want to comment to the most 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.250
 Novels then try to help them 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.970
 and giving them advice is then worth 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.730
 example a question a colleague asked 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.940
 on twitter I will read your name more than 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.600
 it seems good to me it's called alberto 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.050
 OK 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.370
 marquez low bar 23 is worth it tells me 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.550
 always look at the radar 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.950
 We thought I laughed good because the truth 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.400
 yes, I think it's a very 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.310
 important to have the radar controlled more 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.080
 that nothing apart 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.090
 and have enemies controlled 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.579
 when they shoot that clearly the 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.440
 radar and where more or less 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.410
 but many times I have the bad after 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.280
 last and that is how they carry it like that 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.230
 possibly from looking at the map 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.960
 much much to my dads and mcdonald and 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.700
 be looking too much at the map and pass 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.560
 a shot at not realizing it because it's going 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.720
 to be good it is very important to look at the 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.990
 map especially also your allies 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.270
 where they are since if depending on the 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.740
 zone once you know you know well 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.380
 the maps if you know where are the 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.090
 remains when you see where your 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.889
 allies you're going to make the idea more or 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.470
 less where are the response and 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.970
 what to do because if 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.800
 for example I answer now I think that 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.780
 I have it there in that house, it's worth what 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.040
 I think it may or may not be 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.260
 instead of going straight to the house what 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.510
 I'll go around just in case one is 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.050
 escaping by the response kill him and 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.220
 also more than anything so that if I go 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.800
 direct to the respawn to agree for a 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.690
 side then always have let's say 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.810
 leave behind the back look here the voice is worth 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.509
 here you see the ocean sea has once the 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.479
 perfect match together by four one 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:25.220
 outrageous and good here is the 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.159
 moment in which you see the amount 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:33.020
 of table points as 106 different here 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:36.080
 as he threw to the water 1,700 1,900 be a 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:40.099
 authentic barbarity a massacre here 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.870
 200 other that is 200 or more points 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.490
 impossible and now what I wanted was with 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.060
 the game has been the moment of the 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:49.639
 game in which the abbot throws the sea 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.130
 I take it and say that I kill myself and 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:55.000
 He tried to get me another love but I look 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:57.260
 the score and I say ok is not impossible 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.580
 get him work was there is the 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.070
 game and I say what I'm going to do is 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.240
 treat all possible and get 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.180
 is the possible plates to get 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.680
 most points 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.450
 I can get in this game 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.580
 so what I do is to continue with the 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.180
 same tactic is to measure like crazy I keep 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.470
 with the same tactic and this let's say go 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:19.340
 well as it was commented seeing where 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:21.380
 are the redhawks surrounding as I say 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.040
 always and 6-3 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:27.710
 what I do is always go 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.740
 very far from my friends since now in 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.210
 specialist if they take out a volume I do not 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.940
 it's no use having the class 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.500
 specialist 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.540
 well, nothing appears but my friends do 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.400
 and if you talk about my friends what 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.020
 will happen is that giving the big one my 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.990
 friends and they kill me between always 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.180
 always tried to go let's say a little bit alone 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:50.560
 as if they were lone wolves had in 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:53.420
 here page here I take the badge and 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.850
 there are already few casualties, the 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.200
 gameplay goes from friends and I hope it gets 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.080
 is liking all this I am 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.930
 quite happy with all of us with 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:06.130
 acceptance of the channel let's hope that the 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:09.080
 Monday play good there's always a montage that 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.940
 to the sandy rabas valera a small 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.850
 tribute to the face in watermelons not me 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:17.000
 I consider neither half of good girl 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:19.340
 I hope you like it and the swap that you 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.750
 I thought it would help me a lot and 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.960
 good friends, this is running out 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.640
 it's over and you see it perfect and 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.569
 Well I hope you liked it tomorrow 

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.159
 more and better
