out of that be amazing so anyway that
was<00:02:06.600> my<00:02:06.719> cilium<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.530> for<00:02:08.069> bone<00:02:08.250> meal

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
was my cilium and it is for bone meal

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.260 
was my cilium and it is for bone meal
any<00:02:08.910> any<00:02:09.780> type<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.400> crushed<00:02:11.400> mushroom<00:02:12.030> so

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
any any type of crushed mushroom so

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.850 
any any type of crushed mushroom so
these<00:02:12.840> could<00:02:13.200> be<00:02:13.379> in

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
these could be in

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.910 
these could be in
way<00:02:14.750> you<00:02:15.750> just<00:02:15.840> did<00:02:15.900> for<00:02:16.200> my<00:02:16.440> crush<00:02:16.650> her<00:02:16.770> who

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
way you just did for my crush her who

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.990 
way you just did for my crush her who
and<00:02:17.160> one<00:02:17.400> dirt<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:18.720> get<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.820> then<00:02:20.820> if<00:02:20.910> you

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
and one dirt to get this and then if you

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.160 
and one dirt to get this and then if you
break<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.480> course<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.750> tears<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:22.020> could

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
break it of course the tears I could

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.950 
break it of course the tears I could
today<00:02:22.350> so<00:02:22.980> we'll<00:02:23.130> move<00:02:23.220> on<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.720> spruce<00:02:24.720> leaves

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
today so we'll move on to spruce leaves

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.080 
today so we'll move on to spruce leaves
which<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.620> spruce<00:02:26.040> saplings<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.610> two<00:02:26.820> seats

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
which is a spruce saplings and two seats

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.430 
which is a spruce saplings and two seats
so<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.360> couldn't<00:02:27.690> be<00:02:27.720> done<00:02:27.870> with<00:02:28.080> any<00:02:28.110> type<00:02:28.410> of

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
so it couldn't be done with any type of

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.340 
so it couldn't be done with any type of
sappening<00:02:28.860> again<00:02:29.220> as<00:02:29.460> usual<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:31.020> then<00:02:31.260> we

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
sappening again as usual and then we

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.180 
sappening again as usual and then we
have<00:02:31.700> chained<00:02:32.780> Chesley<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:35.040> could

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
have chained Chesley so you could

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.520 
have chained Chesley so you could
actually<00:02:35.400> make<00:02:35.880> change<00:02:36.300> hair<00:02:36.480> space<00:02:36.690> now<00:02:36.930> by

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
actually make change hair space now by

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.910 
actually make change hair space now by
using<00:02:37.800> these<00:02:38.130> chains<00:02:38.970> links<00:02:39.660> right<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.590> I

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
using these chains links right so I

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.460 
using these chains links right so I
actually<00:02:41.670> don't<00:02:42.270> know<00:02:42.540> how<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.780> get<00:02:43.140> chain

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
actually don't know how to get chain

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.790 
actually don't know how to get chain
links<00:02:43.890> which<00:02:44.670> isn't<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.150> best<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.660> things<00:02:47.270> hmm

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.410 

how<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.860> hell<00:02:53.100> do<00:02:53.280> we<00:02:53.340> do<00:02:53.489> this<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.820> actually

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
how the hell do we do this I actually

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.910 
how the hell do we do this I actually
have<00:02:54.720> no<00:02:54.900> idea<00:02:54.930> how<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.290> get<00:02:55.500> chain<00:02:55.680> links

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
have no idea how you get chain links

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.570 
have no idea how you get chain links
which<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.520> not<00:02:56.820> good<00:02:56.850> i<00:02:57.120> suppose<00:02:57.630> but<00:02:58.550> i'm<00:02:59.550> sure

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
which is not good i suppose but i'm sure

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.870 
which is not good i suppose but i'm sure
you<00:02:59.910> guys<00:02:59.940> could<00:03:00.300> figure<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.660> out<00:03:01.550> how<00:03:02.550> you<00:03:02.610> get

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
you guys could figure it out how you get

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.690 
you guys could figure it out how you get
chain<00:03:03.090> links<00:03:03.480> maybe<00:03:03.810> they're<00:03:04.110> in<00:03:04.140> mob<00:03:04.700> chests

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
chain links maybe they're in mob chests

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.510 
chain links maybe they're in mob chests
I<00:03:05.940> have<00:03:06.840> no<00:03:07.050> idea<00:03:07.080> but<00:03:07.800> anyway<00:03:08.130> with<00:03:08.370> these

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
I have no idea but anyway with these

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.890 
I have no idea but anyway with these
chain<00:03:08.790> links<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.450> can<00:03:09.780> make<00:03:10.110> armor<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.810> you

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
chain links you can make armor and you

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.870 
chain links you can make armor and you
can<00:03:13.050> make<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.230> change<00:03:13.440> chest<00:03:13.680> plate<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.100> then

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
can make you change chest plate and then

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.990 
can make you change chest plate and then
we're<00:03:15.090> moving<00:03:15.390> on<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.720> Moss<00:03:16.260> stone

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
we're moving on to Moss stone

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.210 
we're moving on to Moss stone
cobblestone<00:03:18.000> with<00:03:18.239> vines<00:03:18.480> clever<00:03:19.320> idea<00:03:19.680> I'm

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
cobblestone with vines clever idea I'm

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.740 
cobblestone with vines clever idea I'm
going<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.489> move<00:03:20.580> on<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.730> music<00:03:21.390> disc<00:03:21.570> so<00:03:21.690> you

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
going to move on to music disc so you

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.330 
going to move on to music disc so you
don't<00:03:21.930> have<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.140> kill<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.890> don't<00:03:22.980> have<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.250> get

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
don't have to kill you don't have to get

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.070 
don't have to kill you don't have to get
scary<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.760> kill<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:23.940> creeper<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.570> can<00:03:24.750> make<00:03:24.870> any
