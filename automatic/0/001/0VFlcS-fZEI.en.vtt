00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 these are three dora and we are on 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.250
 an event called samsung 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.020
 contact 2012 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.870
 several new products appeared at once and 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.590
 one of them is a galaxy camera about it already 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.530
 was and 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.940
 Internet leak is such a camera 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.369
 which combines the features 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.230
 smartphones cameras on android nobody 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.510
 given presented something like let's 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.109
 look now at this product in 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.990
 first you can see the size is enough 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.070
 get impressive size due to 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.120
 due to the screen the screen is 48 inches and here 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.030
 super lcd 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.980
 super clear lcd i what is it right 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.829
 the choice that did not put amoled because 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.620
 amoled often lies in colors a super 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.410
 clear lcd still makes it more honest 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.460
 colors and this is important for the photographer in 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.739
 the second lens has 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.660
 21x zoom and good enough 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.920
 diaphragm 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:01.020
 high-aperture 2 and 8 so well and the rest 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.199
 he has a flare 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.659
 this rabara t'a and what else on the case 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.770
 interesting here it is a zoom button 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.770
 here is this button of descent 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.929
 and here's a flash button in principle on 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.770
 that's all let's look now at 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:19.399
 shell 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.750
 here it is android 4.1 it 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.469
 really great what they put 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.380
 here is jellibin 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:26.210
 He works really smartly about 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.959
 the processor doesn't say any yet 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.979
 inside maybe we will find out later 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:33.860
 You can install any applications from 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.049
 android market and you can send photos to 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.969
 instagram well in short all that 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.030
 but itâ€™s interesting itself of course here 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.590
 there is a lot of camera application 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.829
 interesting modes but it is really 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.989
 looks like a camera as you can see from the side 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.220
 there is such a switch you need 

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:52.140
 select auto mode 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.960
 there is still a very interesting smart mode 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.060
 pro smart pro he lets you choose a few 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.250
 topics for shooting for example when you 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.250
 you shoot the sky it becomes more 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.740
 blue shoot there what nature she 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.300
 makes them more green and very well 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.580
 The principle is really the effect is 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.770
 from these pieces he just arranges there 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.420
 colors and it turns out 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.240
 really beautiful let's try 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.590
 let's say macro simplicity weave mode 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.560
 neighbors camera is not a macro like that 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.099
 here 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.099
 basically 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.340
 the most important thing there is still such a major 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.180
 thing to share photos 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.800
 there is wifi 3g and 4g 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.700
 yes indeed there is 4g in this camera 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.200
 it's great there are altai and pictures 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.360
 big they will stay long 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.830
 so you need fast samsung connections 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.430
 thought about it and it really 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.840
 cool what else you want to say about it 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.570
 device will be presented in 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.590
 a few colors everything is so white 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.740
 the black 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.470
 Here is such a pink for girls yet 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.860
 the orange ones on that side are there and 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.860
 that's all 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.740

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.030
 such stress plow with you driver and
