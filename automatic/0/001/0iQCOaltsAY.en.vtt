great thing about this is this is
actually<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> spawn<00:02:02.160> traverse<00:02:02.640> what<00:02:02.820> we

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
actually like a spawn traverse what we

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.450 
actually like a spawn traverse what we
really<00:02:03.270> need<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.960> slick<00:02:04.590> will<00:02:04.740> fire<00:02:04.920> and

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
really need is the slick will fire and

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.430 
really need is the slick will fire and
when<00:02:05.580> you<00:02:05.640> shoot<00:02:05.940> one<00:02:06.119> zombie<00:02:06.330> it'll<00:02:07.020> kill<00:02:07.229> all

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
tramplesteam like I do facing the window

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.000 
tramplesteam like I do facing the window
and<00:02:22.770> basically<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:24.140> zombies<00:02:25.140> actually<00:02:25.650> jump

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
and basically the zombies actually jump

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.470 
and basically the zombies actually jump
up<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.459> zombies<00:02:26.760> would<00:02:26.850> actually<00:02:27.239> jump

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
up and the zombies would actually jump

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.090 
up and the zombies would actually jump
outside<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.959> window<00:02:28.260> will<00:02:28.440> actually<00:02:28.770> hit<00:02:28.920> the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
outside the window will actually hit the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.830 
outside the window will actually hit the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
about the window and all the jumpy

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.509 
about the window and all the jumpy
zombies<00:02:37.290> I'll<00:02:37.440> jump<00:02:37.680> up<00:02:37.890> but<00:02:38.070> like<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.310> said

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
zombies I'll jump up but like I said

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.770 
zombies I'll jump up but like I said
they'll<00:02:38.760> just<00:02:38.970> die<00:02:39.150> by<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.360> trample<00:02:39.750> steam

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
they'll just die by the trample steam

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.140 
they'll just die by the trample steam
and<00:02:40.170> there's<00:02:40.680> only<00:02:40.739> six<00:02:41.160> Dom<00:02:41.370> bees<00:02:41.610> per<00:02:41.850> round

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
and there's only six Dom bees per round

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.580 
and there's only six Dom bees per round
for<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.450> minions<00:02:42.810> especially<00:02:43.350> when<00:02:43.470> you're

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
for the minions especially when you're

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.590 
for the minions especially when you're
on<00:02:43.650> solo<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.250> they<00:02:44.850> give<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> max<00:02:45.450> ammo

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
on solo and they give you a max ammo

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.240 
on solo and they give you a max ammo
every<00:02:46.019> time<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.500> don't<00:02:46.650> really<00:02:46.890> have<00:02:47.010> to

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
every time so you don't really have to

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.310 
every time so you don't really have to
worry<00:02:47.400> about<00:02:47.519> ammo<00:02:47.820> guys<00:02:48.140> but<00:02:49.140> that's

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
worry about ammo guys but that's

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.170
