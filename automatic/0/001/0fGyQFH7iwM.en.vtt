00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
there's not that many people out there

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.480 
there's not that many people out there
playing<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.560> yet<00:02:17.830> but<00:02:18.010> that<00:02:18.160> shouldn't<00:02:18.340> be<00:02:18.460> a

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
playing it yet but that shouldn't be a

problem<00:02:18.700> for<00:02:18.820> too<00:02:19.120> long<00:02:19.300> because<00:02:19.510> it's

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
problem for too long because it's

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.750 
problem for too long because it's
cross-platform<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:20.740> I<00:02:20.770> can<00:02:20.980> even<00:02:21.190> play<00:02:21.400> people
