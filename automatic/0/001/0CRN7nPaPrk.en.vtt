00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.540
 good we continue with doctor amaya 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.870
 who is now going to talk to us about the 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.410
 m &amp; r macular degeneration related to 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.740
 the age 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.900
 doctor could you explain what is this the 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.880
 macular degeneration related to 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.019
 age is the disease of the retina 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.019
 produced by the years 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.530
 the most important symptom of 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.490
 macular degeneration is the vision 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:37.340
 blurred or distorted central 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.730
 eventually macular degeneration 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.670
 can affect vision by forming a 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.430
 Blurred area obscured or empty in the 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.890
 visual center this distorts the 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.110
 environment especially in the appearance of 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.990
 the straight lines 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.350
 It can also reduce the lives of 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.350
 colors 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.570
 a blurred central vision or 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.720
 You can prevent distorted perform 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.350
 tasks that require precision as per 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.670
 example driving a car 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.400
 fortunately this disease does not 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.090
 produces total blindness because it does not affect 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.090
 the side view 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.640
 if it occurs in only one eye 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.430
 your symptoms may not be noticeable 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.940
 immediately because the healthy eye compensates the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.450
 sick eye 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.880
 it is essential to take those symptoms very 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.350
 serious and talk immediately with 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.720
 ophthalmologists and they come to appear 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.850
 being the retina against 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.850
 related macular degeneration 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.400
 age, medications can be used to 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.650
 slow the progression of the disease and 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.780
 help preserve eyesight 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.880
 ophthalmologists usually recommend the 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.850
 application of medications directly 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.549
 in the vitreous to treat this 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.440
 disease like the vitreous humor is in 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.780
 contact with the retina 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.390
 Intravitreal injections are usually 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.790
 the most effective way to apply the 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.180
 medication exactly where 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.180
