that I chose I really like this color

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.190 
that I chose I really like this color
because<00:02:22.019> it's<00:02:22.709> springy<00:02:23.430> but<00:02:24.269> it's<00:02:24.510> not<00:02:24.750> too

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
nails while there's still just a little

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.970 
nails while there's still just a little
dent<00:02:59.849> because<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.780> feel<00:03:00.959> like<00:03:00.989> it<00:03:01.290> mixes<00:03:01.769> in

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
dent because I feel like it mixes in

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.520 
dent because I feel like it mixes in
with<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.250> color<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.700> somehow<00:03:03.319> it<00:03:04.319> works

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
with the color and somehow it works

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.400 
with the color and somehow it works
better<00:03:04.829> than<00:03:04.980> if<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:06.120> let<00:03:06.630> my<00:03:06.750> nails<00:03:06.930> completely

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
better than if I let my nails completely

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.220 
better than if I let my nails completely
dry<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.920> then<00:03:08.010> add<00:03:08.579> it<00:03:08.730> later<00:03:08.910> so<00:03:09.569> that's<00:03:09.900> the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
dry and then add it later so that's the

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.699 
dry and then add it later so that's the
last<00:03:10.410> step<00:03:11.269> then<00:03:12.269> just<00:03:12.720> sit<00:03:13.019> tight<00:03:13.049> for<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> few

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
last step then just sit tight for a few

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.559 
last step then just sit tight for a few
minutes<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.400> make<00:03:14.760> sure<00:03:14.940> your<00:03:15.090> nails<00:03:15.329> don't
