00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
stylized in the graphic novel so I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.280 
stylized in the graphic novel so I
wanted<00:02:02.090> to<00:02:02.150> try<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:02.450> emulate<00:02:02.630> that<00:02:02.930> with<00:02:03.170> how

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
wanted to try and emulate that with how

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:17.890 
wanted to try and emulate that with how
I<00:02:03.320> drew<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.710> teeth

with a red Hydra color I began making

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.970 
with a red Hydra color I began making
the<00:02:20.970> exposed<00:02:21.390> muscle<00:02:21.840> lines<00:02:22.050> simply

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
the exposed muscle lines simply

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.650 
the exposed muscle lines simply
sketching<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.670> shapes<00:02:23.880> in<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.390> then<00:02:24.480> using

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
sketching the shapes in and then using

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.570 
sketching the shapes in and then using
different<00:02:25.140> shades<00:02:25.350> of<00:02:25.500> Pink's<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.069> reinforce

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
different shades of Pink's to reinforce

00:02:26.580 --> 00:03:04.230 
different shades of Pink's to reinforce
and<00:02:26.880> build<00:02:27.030> up<00:02:27.180> those<00:02:27.330> areas

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.720 

I<00:03:07.410> used<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.590> block<00:03:08.800> to<00:03:08.830> outline<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.370> teeth

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
I used the block to outline the teeth

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.910 
I used the block to outline the teeth
keeping<00:03:10.270> that<00:03:10.300> stylize<00:03:11.020> connected<00:03:11.620> look<00:03:11.770> to

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
keeping that stylize connected look to

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.710 
keeping that stylize connected look to
them<00:03:12.070> and<00:03:12.280> then<00:03:12.490> filled<00:03:12.760> in<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.030> lip<00:03:13.180> area<00:03:13.360> in

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
them and then filled in the lip area in

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:31.509 
them and then filled in the lip area in
between<00:03:13.840> as<00:03:14.230> well

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.089 

in<00:03:32.629> areas<00:03:33.629> I<00:03:33.840> left<00:03:34.019> bare<00:03:34.319> in<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.620> muscle<00:03:34.920> area

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
in areas I left bare in the muscle area

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.100 
in areas I left bare in the muscle area
I<00:03:35.519> filled<00:03:35.879> them<00:03:35.970> in<00:03:36.120> with<00:03:36.269> black<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.780> give<00:03:36.930> some

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
I filled them in with black to give some

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.170 
I filled them in with black to give some
strong<00:03:37.410> depth<00:03:37.739> and<00:03:38.040> then<00:03:38.489> outlined<00:03:38.940> the

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
strong depth and then outlined the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.729 
strong depth and then outlined the
muscle<00:03:39.480> groupings<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:40.080> make<00:03:40.230> them<00:03:40.379> stand<00:03:40.620> out

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
muscle groupings to make them stand out

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.420 
muscle groupings to make them stand out

or purple toned and then I also filled
in<00:04:11.600> the<00:04:11.750> ripped<00:04:11.930> chin<00:04:12.290> area

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.809 

with<00:04:24.229> a<00:04:24.259> white<00:04:24.530> I<00:04:24.560> added<00:04:25.039> some<00:04:25.069> last<00:04:25.460> strong

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:25.819 
with a white I added some last strong

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:27.429 
with a white I added some last strong
highlights<00:04:26.300> and<00:04:26.629> then<00:04:26.749> immediately<00:04:26.990> did<00:04:27.319> the

00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:27.439 
highlights and then immediately did the

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:29.170 
highlights and then immediately did the
same<00:04:27.650> with<00:04:27.830> black<00:04:28.069> lines<00:04:28.370> to<00:04:28.699> complete<00:04:29.030> the

same with black lines to complete the

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:38.360 
same with black lines to complete the
Illustrated<00:04:29.749> look

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.370 

to<00:04:39.370> really<00:04:39.820> increase<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.449> separation<00:04:40.660> of<00:04:41.320> the

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
to really increase the separation of the

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.050 
to really increase the separation of the
muscle<00:04:41.770> lines<00:04:41.979> and<00:04:42.310> give<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.520> appearance<00:04:42.610> of

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
muscle lines and give the appearance of

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.029 
muscle lines and give the appearance of
forward<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:43.720> recessed<00:04:44.050> areas<00:04:44.470> I<00:04:44.740> used<00:04:44.949> a

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
forward and recessed areas I used a

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:46.710 
forward and recessed areas I used a
black<00:04:45.250> eye<00:04:45.430> shadow<00:04:45.460> on<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.000> outer<00:04:46.120> edges<00:04:46.479> of

black eye shadow on the outer edges of

black eye shadow on the outer edges of
some<00:04:47.110> of<00:04:47.199> the<00:04:47.259> muscle<00:04:47.530> groupings<00:04:47.860> I

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
some of the muscle groupings I

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.939 
some of the muscle groupings I
highlighted<00:04:49.960> a<00:04:50.139> bit<00:04:50.289> with<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.500> white<00:04:50.680> and

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
highlighted a bit with the white and

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.330 
highlighted a bit with the white and
shadowed<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.550> chin<00:04:51.759> area<00:04:51.970> and<00:04:52.360> that<00:04:52.660> was<00:04:52.840> it
