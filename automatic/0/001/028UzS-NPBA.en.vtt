understanding<00:00:02.129> code<00:00:02.340> transport<00:00:03.030> is<00:00:03.179> probably

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
understanding code transport is probably

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.300 
understanding code transport is probably
the<00:00:03.629> most<00:00:03.810> challenging<00:00:04.500> so<00:00:04.920> let's<00:00:05.130> get

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
the most challenging so let's get

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.919 
the most challenging so let's get

transport<00:00:14.809> we<00:00:15.809> need<00:00:16.400> two<00:00:19.609> channels<00:00:20.609> for<00:00:21.480> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
transport we need two channels for the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.259 
transport we need two channels for the
passage<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.430> ions<00:00:23.430> molecules<00:00:25.580> let's<00:00:26.580> put<00:00:26.970> some

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
passage of ions molecules let's put some

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.049 
passage of ions molecules let's put some
kind<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:28.369> active<00:00:29.369> transport<00:00:32.059> transport

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059

protein and the membrane here and some
kind<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:39.829> channel<00:00:40.829> protein<00:00:41.399> over<00:00:41.820> here<00:00:44.629> the

kind of channel protein over here the

kind of channel protein over here the
goal<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.170> video<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.190> show<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.489> how

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
goal of this video is to show you how

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.729 
goal of this video is to show you how
the<00:00:47.879> cell<00:00:48.480> can<00:00:48.930> bring<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.850> more<00:00:50.850> glucose<00:00:51.780> as

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
the cell can bring in more glucose as

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.639 
the cell can bring in more glucose as
you<00:00:53.730> see<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.239> already<00:00:54.539> has<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.610> lot<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.789> glucose

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
you see it already has a lot of glucose

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.150 
you see it already has a lot of glucose
on<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.010> inside<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:01.160> high

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
on the inside so we have a high

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.820 
on the inside so we have a high
concentration<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.539> glucose<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> inside

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
concentration of glucose on the inside

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.789 
concentration of glucose on the inside
and<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:06.479> outside<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> low

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
and the outside we have a low

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.080 
and the outside we have a low
concentration<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:09.240> glucose<00:01:09.869> out<00:01:10.140> here<00:01:10.939> so<00:01:11.939> let

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
concentration of glucose out here so let

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.929 
concentration of glucose out here so let
me<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.330> write<00:01:12.659> one<00:01:13.350> more<00:01:13.680> outside<00:01:14.430> to

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
me just write one more outside to

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.999 
me just write one more outside to
illustrate<00:01:15.540> what<00:01:15.960> we're<00:01:16.110> going<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.259> do<00:01:19.009> over

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
illustrate what we're going to do over

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.960 
illustrate what we're going to do over
here<00:01:20.040> at<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:21.000> transport<00:01:21.960> protein<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:23.640> cell

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
here at this transport protein the cell

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:34.359 
here at this transport protein the cell
is<00:01:24.240> going<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.630> use<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:26.180> TP<00:01:29.119> to<00:01:30.119> pump<00:01:31.430> sodium<00:01:32.430> ions

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
is going to use a TP to pump sodium ions

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.140 
is going to use a TP to pump sodium ions
against<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.549> concentration<00:01:36.090> gradient<00:01:36.979> that

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
against the concentration gradient that

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.359 
against the concentration gradient that
means<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.689> have<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> lot<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.530> sodium<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
means we have a lot of sodium on the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.810 
means we have a lot of sodium on the
outside<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:43.890> not<00:01:44.729> very<00:01:45.090> much<00:01:45.360> sodium<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
outside and not very much sodium on the

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.920 
outside and not very much sodium on the
inside<00:01:48.649> that's<00:01:49.649> why<00:01:49.890> we<00:01:50.070> need<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.310> ATP<00:01:50.970> it's

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
inside that's why we need the ATP it's

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.069 
inside that's why we need the ATP it's
like<00:01:52.140> canoeing<00:01:52.860> up<00:01:53.750> stream<00:01:54.890> on<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.950> river<00:01:57.079> we

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
like canoeing up stream on a river we

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.139 
like canoeing up stream on a river we
still<00:01:58.350> haven't<00:01:58.710> brought<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.159> any<00:01:59.490> glucose

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
still haven't brought in any glucose

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:08.449 
still haven't brought in any glucose
we've<00:02:01.110> only<00:02:01.640> pumped<00:02:02.640> out<00:02:03.920> sodium<00:02:04.920> ions

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.179 

so<00:02:10.129> the<00:02:11.129> sodium<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.760> free<00:02:12.120> now<00:02:12.359> to<00:02:12.920> diffuse<00:02:13.920> in

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 
so the sodium is free now to diffuse in

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:21.050 
so the sodium is free now to diffuse in
through<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:15.590> channel<00:02:16.590> protein<00:02:18.709> at<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:20.760> same

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
through this channel protein at the same

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.929 
through this channel protein at the same
time<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.719> brings<00:02:22.019> in<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:23.120> glucose<00:02:24.120> molecule

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
time it brings in a glucose molecule

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:32.470 
time it brings in a glucose molecule
it's<00:02:26.939> kind<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.180> like<00:02:27.420> they<00:02:28.040> hold<00:02:29.040> hands

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:42.140 

no<00:02:35.030> ATP<00:02:37.310> needed<00:02:38.310> on<00:02:38.489> this<00:02:39.030> side<00:02:40.700> we<00:02:41.700> only<00:02:41.730> use

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
no ATP needed on this side we only use

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.089 
no ATP needed on this side we only use
ATP<00:02:42.659> on<00:02:43.079> this<00:02:43.409> side<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:45.000> bring<00:02:45.269> in<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:46.650> pop<00:02:46.859> out

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
ATP on this side to bring in to pop out

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.359 
ATP on this side to bring in to pop out
the<00:02:47.280> next<00:02:47.519> sodium<00:02:48.000> ion
