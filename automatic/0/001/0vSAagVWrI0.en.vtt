 I will show you shortly 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.260
 So let's start on the far left 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.900
 need sugar we need baking powder 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.260
 we need mail a pinch of salt 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.870
 we need oil we should need 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.809
 every case medium or classic whole 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.820
 I spout then we need cacau whole 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.909
 important not to drink but 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.489
 right back or dessert cacau then 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:48.309
 we need two eggs and we need 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.699
 of course, form a sieve 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:55.059
 hand mixer a bowl and to decorate 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:59.379
 after receiving kitchens glaze or in kitchens 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:02.290
 blasum glaze powdered sugar chocolate 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.750
 droplets of chocolate sprinkles sugar sprinkles 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.060
 colorful sprinkles and so on and so forth 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.590
 or almonds what you like to stop 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.420
 afterwards decorate on your weapons 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.630
 needs and how the whole thing works 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.520
 I'll show you a lot of fun like this 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.500
 First step for our muffins we 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:23.320
 Feel a cup completely with oil 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:25.990
 given that in our bowl then 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:34.180
 We give a whole cup of sugar to the oil 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:38.850
 and then both come yolk 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.850
 and protein to the oil and sugar-free 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.520
 and the whole is then only times 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.520
 middle stage, nice and creamy 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:08.050
 so here's a mugs flour pure and 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.910
 we pass through a sieve so that the 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.440
 nice fluffy afterwards will be at the 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.990
 make it nice and easy 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:20.710
 flaky are then half a cup 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:29.860
 mail and half a packet of baking powder 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:31.660
 touch it all over again and 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.480
 then on top of that comes another pinch 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.810
 salt and all this now for the first time 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.810
 beautiful 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.720
 now comes with the most important and indeed 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.300
 It must be on each one 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.070
 case medium be the same on top 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.070
 and the whole thing will be back now 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.810
 like that for example 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.640
 decides you just want dark 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.480
 make muffins then he stays at the 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.980
 a bowl 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.560
 I want bright and dark ones once 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.870
 make for a small bowl 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.270
 and there are a few chocolate droplets 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.760
 no you can also chocolate sprinkles 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.650
 take that under then I have one 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.950
 prepared baking tray packs there now 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:39.250
 have it all already on it 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:43.630
 times the oven preheated to 200 degrees and 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.390
 my bright muffins feel nice in the 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.730
 pure form 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:04:03.040
 Well and there happens the first misfortune there 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:04:05.880
 I was just too few to have that 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.880
 We were born fast 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.490
 So I would always to just below 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.010
 fill the edge because they go too 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.479
 yet so for the dark muffins 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.850
 we are now taking the cocoa in so 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:49.639
 a three quarter cup the whole thing too 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.010
 again through the sieve give it that beautiful 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.130
 fluffy after all the muffins will that 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.630
 It really important if you did that 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.370
 have then only come back 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:11.240
 the hand mixer in play and then stir 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:12.979
 you see the really nice clinic 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.080
 that's not tasty for my god on 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:19.100
 it tastes the most delicious so the bowl 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.450
 to noodle that's so delicious and that 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.820
 I give now in the whole 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.820
 tart- shaped or muffin-shaped 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.620
 so and then the little ones get 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:19.050
 in our preheated oven and then 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.120
 so stay around and at eight to twelve 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.419
 minutes in there until they train the high 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.860
 went 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:28.140
 yes and that is the result 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.940
 and now they are really warm 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.890
 I now have my colorful sugar sprinkles 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.080
 and dribble some muffins with it 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:40.169
 she wanted to make her look very colorful 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:41.880
 and that she is too mad 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:43.200
 they melt that is really nice 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:48.690
 so mega yummy if you feel like it afterwards 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:53.400
 are completely dried or cooled 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:54.900
 are and then I still have 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.100
 the school droplets decided too 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.330
 to pack on top of that, but 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.310
 by being mad as well 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:03.870
 they always melt so nicely chocolate 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:06.000
 and that's what they are 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.919
 my muffins i hope you have that 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.600
