today<00:00:25.650> I'm<00:00:25.740> going<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.890> be<00:00:26.009> finishing<00:00:26.189> up<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:26.669 
today I'm going to be finishing up the

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.460 
today I'm going to be finishing up the
landing<00:00:26.970> here<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:27.900> I'm<00:00:27.990> gonna<00:00:28.079> be<00:00:28.199> doing

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
landing here and what I'm gonna be doing

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.900 
landing here and what I'm gonna be doing
is<00:00:29.060> countersinking<00:00:30.199> holes<00:00:31.199> on<00:00:31.649> the<00:00:32.460> mounting

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
is countersinking holes on the mounting

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.660 
is countersinking holes on the mounting
plate<00:00:33.149> with<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.410> half-inch<00:00:35.010> countersink

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
plate with this half-inch countersink

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.360 
plate with this half-inch countersink
and<00:00:36.420> I'm<00:00:37.019> going<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.199> be<00:00:37.320> using<00:00:37.739> flathead

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
and I'm going to be using flathead

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.119 
and I'm going to be using flathead
screws<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.659> I<00:00:39.809> can<00:00:40.110> have<00:00:40.730> them<00:00:41.730> lay<00:00:42.180> flush

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
screws so that I can have them lay flush

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.890 
screws so that I can have them lay flush
with<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.309> surface<00:00:44.600> when<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:45.720> mounted

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
with this surface when it's mounted

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.740 
with this surface when it's mounted
because<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:46.920> up<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.309> higher<00:00:47.600> such<00:00:48.600> as

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
because if it's up to higher such as

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.280 
because if it's up to higher such as
this<00:00:49.730> let<00:00:50.730> me<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:50.820> show<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.239> here<00:00:51.420> if<00:00:52.079> you

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
this let me just show you here if you

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.350 
this let me just show you here if you
can<00:00:52.440> see<00:00:52.470> it's<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.190> gonna<00:00:53.399> be<00:00:53.550> up<00:00:53.670> raised<00:00:54.149> up

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
can see it's it's gonna be up raised up

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.700 
can see it's it's gonna be up raised up
like<00:00:54.540> that<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.960> that's<00:00:55.050> not<00:00:55.350> going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> be

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
like that and that's not going to be

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.340 
like that and that's not going to be
also<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:56.969> two<00:00:57.149> reasons<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.989> want<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.199> have

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
also for two reasons you want to have

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.599 
also for two reasons you want to have
that<00:00:58.699> kind<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.760> flush<00:01:00.090> with<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.510> plain<00:01:01.609> one

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
that kind of flush with this plain one

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.999 
that kind of flush with this plain one
you're<00:01:03.570> not<00:01:03.690> getting<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.019> true<00:01:04.379> strength<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
you're not getting a true strength of a

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.749 
you're not getting a true strength of a
screw<00:01:05.250> if<00:01:05.429> it's<00:01:05.640> not<00:01:06.170> touching<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:08.310> complete

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
screw if it's not touching the complete

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.350 
screw if it's not touching the complete
surface<00:01:09.570> area<00:01:10.050> of<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.470> head<00:01:10.800> and<00:01:11.070> -<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.090> want<00:01:12.300> it

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
surface area of the head and - I want it

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.740 
surface area of the head and - I want it
flush<00:01:12.630> because<00:01:13.619> if<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.830> don't<00:01:14.330> when<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.450> put<00:01:15.630> it

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
flush because if I don't when you put it

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.190 
flush because if I don't when you put it
in<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.929> wing<00:01:16.310> it<00:01:17.310> would<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.640> raised<00:01:17.970> above<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.290 

landing<00:01:22.200> gear<00:01:22.409> rails<00:01:22.850> we<00:01:23.850> really<00:01:24.090> want<00:01:24.240> to

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
landing gear rails we really want to

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.520 
landing gear rails we really want to
just<00:01:24.570> take<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> time<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.860> use<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> countersink

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
just take the time to use a countersink

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.529 
just take the time to use a countersink
and<00:01:28.530> make<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:30.030> necessary<00:01:30.289> holes<00:01:32.239> sunk<00:01:33.239> so

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
and make the necessary holes sunk so

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.350 
and make the necessary holes sunk so
that<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.899> flat<00:01:34.229> head<00:01:34.500> will<00:01:34.890> sit<00:01:35.819> in<00:01:36.030> top<00:01:36.330> of

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
that the flat head will sit in top of

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:45.139 
that the flat head will sit in top of
the<00:01:36.569> mounting<00:01:36.899> plate<00:01:37.640> nice<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.849> flat<00:01:43.310> as<00:01:44.310> you

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
the mounting plate nice and flat as you

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.260 
the mounting plate nice and flat as you
can<00:01:45.300> see<00:01:45.599> I<00:01:46.220> put<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.610> landing<00:01:47.910> gear<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.209> a

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
can see I put the landing gear in a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.199 
can see I put the landing gear in a
small<00:01:48.539> vise<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.520> what<00:01:50.520> I'm<00:01:50.640> gonna<00:01:50.759> be<00:01:50.849> doing

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209 
small vise and what I'm gonna be doing

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:52.550 
small vise and what I'm gonna be doing
and<00:01:51.390> normally<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.810> would<00:01:51.929> use<00:01:52.050> my<00:01:52.200> drill<00:01:52.500> press

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
and normally I would use my drill press

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.419 
and normally I would use my drill press
but<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:54.509> demonstrate<00:01:55.080> this<00:01:55.289> I'm<00:01:55.920> going<00:01:56.129> to<00:01:56.250> use

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
but to demonstrate this I'm going to use

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.479 
but to demonstrate this I'm going to use
the<00:01:57.179> countersink<00:01:57.720> on<00:01:58.170> my<00:01:58.530> lowest<00:01:58.979> setting

00:01:59.479 --> 00:01:59.489 
the countersink on my lowest setting

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:03.969 
the countersink on my lowest setting
lowest<00:02:00.330> speed<00:02:00.599> in<00:02:01.140> my<00:02:01.860> portable<00:02:02.789> drill<00:02:03.149> and

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
lowest speed in my portable drill and

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.380 
lowest speed in my portable drill and
this<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.160> just<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.489> if<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.910> only<00:02:06.149> have<00:02:06.270> a

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
this is just so if you only have a

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.119 
this is just so if you only have a
portable<00:02:06.660> drill<00:02:06.929> you<00:02:07.050> can<00:02:07.110> see<00:02:07.379> how<00:02:07.619> easy<00:02:07.860> this

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
portable drill you can see how easy this

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.570 
portable drill you can see how easy this
is<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.399> do<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:10.259> reason<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.530> would<00:02:10.679> recommend

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
is to do the reason I would recommend

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.160 
is to do the reason I would recommend
using<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:11.910> drill<00:02:12.090> presses<00:02:12.360> because<00:02:12.690> then<00:02:13.080> you

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
using in drill presses because then you

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.280 
using in drill presses because then you
can<00:02:13.319> set<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.650> depth<00:02:14.180> for<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.330> countersink<00:02:15.900> on

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
can set the depth for the countersink on

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.260 
can set the depth for the countersink on
the<00:02:16.500> drill<00:02:16.709> press<00:02:16.739> so<00:02:17.489> that<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.700> have<00:02:17.970> a

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
the drill press so that you have a

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.160 
the drill press so that you have a
consistent<00:02:19.489> hole<00:02:20.489> but<00:02:21.480> instead<00:02:21.870> what<00:02:22.080> I'm

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
consistent hole but instead what I'm

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.890 
consistent hole but instead what I'm
going<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.319> do<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:23.400> I'm<00:02:24.030> going<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.360> keep<00:02:24.690> my

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
going to do is I'm going to keep my

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.250 
going to do is I'm going to keep my
screw<00:02:25.590> nice<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:26.700> handy<00:02:27.030> I'm<00:02:27.629> going<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.870> drill

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
screw nice and handy I'm going to drill

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.110 
screw nice and handy I'm going to drill
each<00:02:28.500> one<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.769> these<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.489> countersink<00:02:30.000> the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
each one of these the countersink the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.280 
each one of these the countersink the
holes<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.990> I'm<00:02:31.140> going<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.320> test<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.950> Deb

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
holes and I'm going to test the Deb

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.429 
holes and I'm going to test the Deb
with<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.739> screw<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:33.730> it's<00:02:33.879> going<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.060> be<00:02:34.180> a

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
with the screw so it's going to be a

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.759 
with the screw so it's going to be a

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
until we get each one set it might take

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.360 
until we get each one set it might take
a<00:02:40.989> little<00:02:41.110> longer<00:02:41.230> but<00:02:41.829> if<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.069> don't<00:02:42.250> have<00:02:42.310> a

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
a little longer but if you don't have a

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.309 
a little longer but if you don't have a
drill<00:02:42.610> press<00:02:42.640> at<00:02:43.180> least<00:02:43.360> you<00:02:43.450> can<00:02:43.659> see<00:02:43.989> that

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
drill press at least you can see that

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.390 
drill press at least you can see that
you<00:02:44.769> can<00:02:44.980> do<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:45.420> with<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.750> drill<00:02:47.400> portable

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
you can do it with a drill portable

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.520 
you can do it with a drill portable
drill<00:02:51.569> now<00:02:52.569> you<00:02:52.629> don't<00:02:52.870> want<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.079> put<00:02:53.319> too<00:02:53.500> much

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
drill now you don't want to put too much

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.130 
drill now you don't want to put too much
pressure<00:02:53.829> down<00:02:54.190> but<00:02:54.930> countersinks<00:02:55.930> don't

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
pressure down but countersinks don't

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.190 
pressure down but countersinks don't
like<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.440> go<00:02:56.560> fast<00:02:56.829> so<00:02:57.489> just<00:02:57.840> keep<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.989> speed

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
like to go fast so just keep the speed

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.330 
like to go fast so just keep the speed
low<00:02:59.440> and<00:03:00.900> get<00:03:01.900> even<00:03:02.230> pressure<00:03:02.439> down<00:03:02.769> make<00:03:03.310> sure

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
low and get even pressure down make sure

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.270 
low and get even pressure down make sure
you're<00:03:03.609> as<00:03:03.849> level<00:03:04.150> as<00:03:04.209> possible<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.560> go<00:03:06.010> for

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
you're as level as possible and go for

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:15.410 
you're as level as possible and go for
it<00:03:12.299> you<00:03:13.299> can<00:03:13.450> see<00:03:13.599> it's<00:03:13.720> already<00:03:13.870> started

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
it you can see it's already started

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.610 
it you can see it's already started
this<00:03:16.420> being<00:03:16.659> aluminum<00:03:17.170> makes<00:03:17.349> it<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.470> lot

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
this being aluminum makes it a lot

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:30.270 
this being aluminum makes it a lot
easier<00:03:17.889> to<00:03:18.040> countersink

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.949 

now<00:03:31.280> I<00:03:31.340> can<00:03:31.580> tell<00:03:31.760> already<00:03:32.120> that's<00:03:32.450> not<00:03:32.690> deep

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
now I can tell already that's not deep

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.809 
now I can tell already that's not deep
enough<00:03:33.080> just<00:03:33.500> because<00:03:33.650> I've<00:03:33.920> done<00:03:34.580> enough

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
enough just because I've done enough

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.150 
enough just because I've done enough
countersinking<00:03:35.599> but<00:03:35.840> you<00:03:36.830> would<00:03:36.950> want<00:03:37.130> to

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
countersinking but you would want to

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.900 
countersinking but you would want to
test<00:03:37.430> right<00:03:37.640> now<00:03:37.700> just<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.090> make<00:03:38.150> sure<00:03:42.910> all

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
test right now just to make sure all

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.780 
test right now just to make sure all
right<00:03:43.970> let's<00:03:44.750> just<00:03:44.959> look<00:03:45.110> at<00:03:45.230> that<00:03:45.670> see<00:03:48.790> you

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
right let's just look at that see you

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.930 
right let's just look at that see you
take<00:03:50.000> this<00:03:50.150> out<00:03:51.550> okay<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.900> there's<00:03:54.080> the<00:03:54.260> screw

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
take this out okay so there's the screw

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.449 
take this out okay so there's the screw
there<00:03:55.940> it<00:03:56.150> is<00:03:56.980> almost<00:03:57.980> there

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
there it is almost there

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.470 
there it is almost there
throw<00:03:59.030> a<00:03:59.060> little<00:03:59.269> bit<00:03:59.360> more<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:01.340> see<00:04:02.300> what<00:04:02.420> it

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
throw a little bit more and see what it

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:13.020 
throw a little bit more and see what it
looks<00:04:02.600> like

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.979 

remember<00:04:14.030> to<00:04:14.120> keep<00:04:14.209> that<00:04:14.360> even<00:04:14.630> pressure<00:04:14.810> and

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
remember to keep that even pressure and

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:27.520 
remember to keep that even pressure and
make<00:04:15.230> sure<00:04:15.350> your<00:04:15.500> level<00:04:26.110> drill<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:27.290> test

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
make sure your level drill and test

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:36.400 
make sure your level drill and test
fill-in<00:04:28.370> test<00:04:29.530> okay<00:04:30.850> we're<00:04:31.850> almost<00:04:32.030> there<00:04:35.410> now

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
fill-in test okay we're almost there now

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.219 
fill-in test okay we're almost there now
this<00:04:36.590> is<00:04:37.240> gonna<00:04:38.240> be<00:04:38.360> a<00:04:38.390> fun<00:04:38.630> job<00:04:38.810> if<00:04:38.990> you<00:04:39.110> have

this is gonna be a fun job if you have
it<00:04:39.320> set<00:04:39.530> up<00:04:39.560> right<00:04:39.680> otherwise<00:04:40.370> it<00:04:40.610> could<00:04:40.789> be<00:04:40.820> a

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
it set up right otherwise it could be a

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.969 
it set up right otherwise it could be a
little<00:04:41.900> frustrating<00:04:42.500> if<00:04:42.560> you<00:04:42.650> don't<00:04:42.800> have<00:04:42.890> the

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
right tools borrow them from somebody or

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.590 
right tools borrow them from somebody or
you<00:04:48.050> know<00:04:48.169> take<00:04:48.470> them<00:04:48.850> to<00:04:49.850> a<00:04:49.880> shop<00:04:50.210> whatever

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
you know take them to a shop whatever

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.909 
you know take them to a shop whatever
you<00:04:50.780> need<00:04:50.900> to<00:04:51.020> do<00:04:51.140> to<00:04:51.289> get<00:04:51.410> it<00:04:51.500> done<00:04:51.680> so<00:04:51.710> that

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
you need to do to get it done so that

00:04:51.919 --> 00:05:02.689 
you need to do to get it done so that
it's<00:04:52.160> right

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.329 

okay<00:05:03.699> as<00:05:04.449> I<00:05:04.569> said<00:05:04.779> I<00:05:04.809> would<00:05:04.930> normally<00:05:05.379> just<00:05:05.409> set

00:05:06.329 --> 00:05:06.339 
okay as I said I would normally just set

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.420 
okay as I said I would normally just set
the<00:05:06.490> depth<00:05:06.809> enjoy<00:05:07.809> h1<00:05:08.229> and<00:05:08.439> be<00:05:09.039> done<00:05:09.249> already

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
the depth enjoy h1 and be done already

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.029 
the depth enjoy h1 and be done already
but<00:05:09.759> again<00:05:10.210> I'm<00:05:10.330> sure<00:05:10.599> I'm<00:05:10.779> showing<00:05:11.050> you<00:05:11.080> so

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
but again I'm sure I'm showing you so

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.230 
but again I'm sure I'm showing you so
you<00:05:12.129> can<00:05:12.279> see<00:05:12.400> how<00:05:12.490> to<00:05:12.580> do<00:05:12.729> this<00:05:12.909> for<00:05:13.150> yourself

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
you can see how to do this for yourself

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.929 
you can see how to do this for yourself
if<00:05:13.719> you<00:05:13.809> don't<00:05:13.960> have<00:05:14.080> a<00:05:14.110> drill<00:05:14.319> for<00:05:14.349> us<00:05:14.939> again

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:15.939 
if you don't have a drill for us again

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:19.200 
if you don't have a drill for us again
it's<00:05:16.150> getting<00:05:16.749> close<00:05:17.139> but<00:05:17.439> it<00:05:17.559> needs<00:05:17.770> a<00:05:18.210> little

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
it's getting close but it needs a little

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:35.010 
it's getting close but it needs a little
bit<00:05:19.330> more<00:05:33.270> that<00:05:34.270> looks<00:05:34.419> pretty<00:05:34.599> good<00:05:34.719> let's

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
bit more that looks pretty good let's

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.159 
bit more that looks pretty good let's
see<00:05:35.259> what<00:05:35.349> it<00:05:35.409> looks<00:05:35.559> like<00:05:38.639> okay<00:05:40.169> that's

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
see what it looks like okay that's

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.379 
see what it looks like okay that's
pretty<00:05:41.529> good<00:05:41.800> I<00:05:42.069> might<00:05:42.879> take<00:05:43.059> a<00:05:43.120> little<00:05:43.270> more

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
pretty good I might take a little more

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:46.589 
pretty good I might take a little more
off<00:05:43.509> but<00:05:43.960> you<00:05:44.620> get<00:05:44.800> the<00:05:44.919> idea<00:05:45.189> and<00:05:45.460> I<00:05:46.449> won't

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
off but you get the idea and I won't

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.480 
off but you get the idea and I won't
make<00:05:46.749> you<00:05:46.809> watch<00:05:47.050> this<00:05:47.199> any<00:05:47.379> longer<00:05:47.770> just<00:05:47.949> to

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
make you watch this any longer just to

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.089 
make you watch this any longer just to
see<00:05:48.639> it<00:05:48.789> drill<00:05:49.210> in<00:05:49.419> but<00:05:49.659> just<00:05:49.899> keep<00:05:50.740> drilling

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
see it drill in but just keep drilling

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:53.879 
see it drill in but just keep drilling
and<00:05:51.370> testing<00:05:51.759> until<00:05:52.059> this<00:05:52.689> flathead<00:05:53.469> screw<00:05:53.740> is

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
and testing until this flathead screw is

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.369 
and testing until this flathead screw is
flush<00:05:54.279> with<00:05:54.309> this<00:05:54.639> surface<00:05:55.120> and<00:05:55.990> remember

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:56.379 
flush with this surface and remember

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
thick mounting plate so don't go too

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:02.939 
thick mounting plate so don't go too
deep<00:06:01.810> or<00:06:02.199> you're<00:06:02.319> not<00:06:02.379> going<00:06:02.529> to<00:06:02.620> have<00:06:02.709> enough

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
deep or you're not going to have enough

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.429 
deep or you're not going to have enough
material<00:06:03.129> left<00:06:03.430> over<00:06:03.729> to<00:06:04.089> bite<00:06:04.839> into<00:06:05.080> and

material left over to bite into and

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:09.989 
material left over to bite into and
secure<00:06:06.099> the<00:06:06.249> screw<00:06:06.849> to<00:06:07.029> so<00:06:08.490> get<00:06:09.490> it<00:06:09.639> so<00:06:09.819> it's

00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:09.999 
secure the screw to so get it so it's

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:11.909 
secure the screw to so get it so it's
just<00:06:10.449> flush<00:06:10.870> it<00:06:11.080> and<00:06:11.229> if<00:06:11.409> it's<00:06:11.560> a<00:06:11.649> little<00:06:11.800> high

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
just flush it and if it's a little high

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:14.519 
just flush it and if it's a little high
it's<00:06:12.339> a<00:06:12.430> little<00:06:12.639> high<00:06:12.819> but<00:06:13.360> don't<00:06:14.169> compromise

it's a little high but don't compromise

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:16.230 
it's a little high but don't compromise
the<00:06:14.680> strength<00:06:15.189> of<00:06:15.370> the<00:06:15.490> mounting<00:06:15.819> plate<00:06:16.029> like

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
the strength of the mounting plate like

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.409 
the strength of the mounting plate like
drilling<00:06:16.930> too<00:06:17.199> deep
