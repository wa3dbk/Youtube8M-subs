00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.110
 how are we going to record the video 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:12.420
 cpu tunero good I'll start when I 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.860
 install they will tell you that if they want 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.680
 manage the configuration or install 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.850
 a configuration you what are going to 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.200
 do is install the one that says simple and 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.250
 power form 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.530
 If I put it on, I 'm the best one 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.820
 but could you put it on them? 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.820
 this screen 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:41.770
 to configure it let's go to triggers 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.600
 they have to be as I have it since 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.300
 they do not come from being turned off 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.060
 turned off and on after 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.700
 we go to profiles on 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.350
 here you disappear screen 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.600
 turned on but I change it on 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.019
 so it's easier 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.920
 sometimes it 's in the middle of the cell I see 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.780
 that here says this profile is turned on 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.100
 then it says shut off then what is 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.670
 block the cell phone and go back to 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.189
 to unlock 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.259
 then here in need they are not going to 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.650
 move nothing really because the 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:20.149
 frequencies are at maximum 1300 and the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.149
 minimum at 598 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.329
 in off also but also you 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:31.670
 change the name off for easier 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:33.150
 at maximum it should be at 598 and the minimum 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.450
 same 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.450
 in save 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.390
 now we go to governors the speed 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.070
 maximum 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.770
 this 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.850
 it must be here in performance at 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.700
 maximum I used to put it here I said 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.030
 that is not necessary but when I wanted 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.710
 watch videos hd would not let me see them on their own 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.409
 they do not know you can see hd on your cell phone 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.049
 and nothing else you see in saving there are others 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.069
 what is performance is does it mean that 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:11.290
 it will always be at 1300 cpu never 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.980
 is going to never lower to lower 500 to 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.569
 at 800/900 it will always be at 1300 in 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.370
 power means you're always going to 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.099
 be in 598 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.069
 it really shines in German wants 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.640
 say that is where cpu always need 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.640
 will return 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.370
 in the battery saving I put it on 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.110
 demand because there are times that they have 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:41.849
 processes that this really needs 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:44.010
 sometimes be active but likewise 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.470
 you can put in power sep and it's always going to 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.130
 be in 598 let's leave it like that 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.140
 while very problem 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.610
 here they can real are not going to move are the 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.710
 statistics do you want to go 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.820
 as soon as he walks now, the product happens 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:01.700
 For example there are 900 900 900 if they are 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.950
 900 with just one click goes to 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.920
 appear on how they are 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.530
 here is what they are going to know that you who 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.700
 if it's working and now you had 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:17.470
 off him 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.470
 the cell phone here appears from the hours 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.130
 from 12 45 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.819
 well that would be all to configure the 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.819
 cpu tunnel
