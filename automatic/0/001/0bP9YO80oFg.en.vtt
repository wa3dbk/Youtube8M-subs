00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.730
 if I have basketball 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.730
 then I play in a team 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.089
 why 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:14.259
 he as 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.189
 teammate 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.189
 also a responsibility who play along 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.300
 For example, a workout can only be done if you have about ten people 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.880
 will go right then if all the tanks therefore 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.880
 action is to be a basketball player 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.590
 it also belongs 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.040
 in front of the coach 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.180
 and referees 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.340
 but especially before 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.040
 the other players 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.040
 to be 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.700
 you support the teammates 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.460
 just when it is 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.060
 or 2 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.060
 then you are there for him 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.380
 you also come to the training of the bank 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.720
 do not feel like it 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.190
 Breidenbach a team game 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.870
 for the others must be there 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.870
 I think it's important for you from the beginning 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.650
 to understand 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.650
 the Americans give it away 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.670
 good team 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.590
 To be a camera 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.390
 I want to tell you that 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.550
 otherwise, too 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.770
 The national team 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.790
 we made something strong 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.790
 no one for themselves 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.870
 so I always do 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.240
 have the 4 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.000
 for the national team 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.940
 the day tickets 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.200
 everyone was 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.010
 good teammate 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.260

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.340
 no secret either 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.770
 as a player and 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.770
 as a team 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.119

 the knee 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:13.889
 found in the game 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:16.889
 who goes up and down the game in free throws 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:19.599
 with a lot to the GEMA 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.599
 about the one player 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:25.559

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:29.529
 Test matches 7

 Timo Boll Brecht 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:39.679
 or Robin Benzing 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:43.109
 also I make mistakes as 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.040
 it's normal to make a plane that's not allowed to happen August that one 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.929

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:49.989
 his self-confidence 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.139
 that you turn your head down 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.139
 the couple has despaired themselves 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.389
 short memory 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:02:59.849
 mistakes happen 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.229
 you have them off 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:02.619
 you try them 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:03.959
 not too 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.279
 but when does play 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:09.669
 and if you have the opportunity 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:11.509
 best in defense 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:12.779
 Mistakes you 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:13.529
 Attack made
