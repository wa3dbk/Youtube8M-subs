00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:05.560
 we are going to solve seven problems of stability, however, that awaits us 

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:07.520
 it's just that it's the same 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.310
 there I started this mass of our sun and distant a note 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.749
 is still eight for 13 to 12 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.079
 meters 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.539
 they are revolving around the center of masses that the postpaid system 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.489
 For both 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.820
 calculate the period of your movements 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.619
 Palencia 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:25.390
 ore 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.669
 as data 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.630
 we do not have to know good zapata as she is saying that pt was passed tostón 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.770
 well we know that 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.470
 the mass of the sun is equal 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.670
 ap a little more 98 by 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.810
 efe 10 the thin 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.859
 at 30 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.859
 kilograms foot this do not have to see as data 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.160
 so that 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
 we have two stars 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.560
 and we will have the center of the masses 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.700
 the other star 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.820
 this spectrum of raisins 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.820
 and they are spinning 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.620
 around 70 masses 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.770
 so that the distance 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.120
 between those two stars this 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.960
 8% raised something 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.390
 in agreement 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.370
 Fri 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.800
 we are going to consider it 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.860
 this we are going to take you in agreement 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.830
 What we can say is the following equality that force 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.210
 attractive between both based 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.900
 well it will be equal to the door 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.130
 efe tripp therefore 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.150
 the reaction force the agreement between both 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.600
 more astute 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.450
 the door of the post tehran that is universal by another theft dapás pac of 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.270
 both of them 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.740
 the product of the raisins 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.210
 it will be m post 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.330
 As the star is the same, it is also 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.720
 and departed from the distance block away 2 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.480
 the distance of a star tetrabases r 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.110
 then the distance 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.060
 between star acts will be 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.770
 agree and that squared 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.240
 and this cerati guada fuerte trichet 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.400
 per cent that has everything controlled 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.129
 the past 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.439
 carrying winds and minors passed by the speed has provided patio 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:16.549
 otherwise ok I passed it by the speed bull 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:21.639
 percent squared by the rating I remember that he used helmet that blames 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.639
 others but this one goes through the speed pular squares 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.099
 entity 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.249
 that agreement 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:36.049
 and we have to know also that the polar velocity the iess 2 upi match 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.089
 of the agreement period 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:40.819
 then it will be 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.139
 efe 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:43.959
 I'm going to be cleared 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.759
 replaced 

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:48.229
 the pure speed 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:49.669
 agreement 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.259
 it will be the last one 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:56.439
 kospi to the squared party of the period to the square had because that is the 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.149
 adequate speed 

00:02:58.149 --> 00:03:00.019
 the ratio 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.169
 in agreement 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.169
 i'm going to clear the period that then stamp 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:06.929
 the term 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:08.839
 p 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:11.959
 squared will be the same 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.589
 they pass it by four per square clippard by split ray 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:21.379
 efe percent 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.510
 i 2 the other squares last century as 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.679
 r slope 

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:31.699
 Well I'm going to simplify this m with this baby 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.279
 i do not have anything left four times four 16 for you squared by the way 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:42.799
 I can not wait a little bit 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.899
 and that and that's why this agreement 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:46.790
 then 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.349
 can save you explained that you have written and again 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.379
 as it was raised squared put will be equal to the square root 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.259
 very well prepared to see what was 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:04:01.430
 we will have a square root of 16 for you to the square po the derse 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:05.219
 i 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:06.559
 up to this point 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:08.559
 it will be half of these 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:11.989
 that is by 4 by 10 raised to this 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.689
 raised to the cube 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:18.000
 match let six cups 67 because this legacy 

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:21.939
 avn - 11 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:26.219
 agree and why the mass 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:29.240
 what did i ski the last of our or 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.360
 that is to say 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.599
 efe 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.599
 one like 98 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.430
 I understand 30 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.879
 in agreement 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:49.729
 i this capped a period c cork like to 75 by 10 raised to nine 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.059
 according 

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:53.590
 and it would be finished 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.590
 the problem 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.699
 if you want more studies solved they target harassment is a pencil and that if 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.919
 wants to see them because they kill you to say costs
