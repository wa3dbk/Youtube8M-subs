00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
Baba cute I write this Baby Alive doll a

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.059 
Baba cute I write this Baby Alive doll a
four<00:02:22.630> out<00:02:22.720> of<00:02:22.810> five<00:02:23.019> I<00:02:23.319> think<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.769> she<00:02:23.980> is

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
four out of five I think that she is

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.860 
four out of five I think that she is
really<00:02:24.280> cute<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.209> like<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:25.540> she<00:02:25.690> does

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
really cute and I like that she does

really cute and I like that she does
bounce<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.560> babble<00:02:27.459> but<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.480> think<00:02:28.720> there<00:02:28.870> are

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
bounce and babble but I think there are

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.190 
bounce and babble but I think there are
a<00:02:29.080> few<00:02:29.530> drawbacks<00:02:29.890> about<00:02:30.640> this<00:02:30.790> toy<00:02:31.200> her

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
a few drawbacks about this toy her

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.589 
a few drawbacks about this toy her
clothes<00:02:32.500> are<00:02:32.769> not<00:02:33.040> removable<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.239> that's<00:02:34.450> a

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
clothes are not removable so that's a

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.180 
clothes are not removable so that's a
good<00:02:34.750> thing<00:02:34.810> or<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.290> bad<00:02:35.440> thing

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
good thing or a bad thing

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.020 
good thing or a bad thing
oh<00:02:36.220> so<00:02:37.180> she<00:02:37.690> cannot<00:02:38.019> sit<00:02:38.530> on<00:02:38.950> her<00:02:39.489> own<00:02:39.670> because

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
oh so she cannot sit on her own because

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.100 
oh so she cannot sit on her own because
she<00:02:40.239> can<00:02:40.750> only<00:02:40.900> bounce<00:02:41.400> or<00:02:42.400> lay<00:02:42.790> down<00:02:43.110> also

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
she can only bounce or lay down also

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.160 
she can only bounce or lay down also
because<00:02:44.860> this<00:02:45.220> Baby<00:02:45.459> Alive<00:02:45.579> doll<00:02:46.150> can<00:02:46.660> not
