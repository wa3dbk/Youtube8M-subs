00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.099
 there was people it's jerry jones drew 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.929
 is young we end up for a small 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.039
 video about destiny in the vault of 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.300
 glass veil angers yet to prove 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.949
 that it's going very well as a study 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.630
 sarah niquer I have the potato and so we 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.529
 left for a short video on 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.010
 sowing as I just told you 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.330
 for a little myth that has remained a mix 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.310
 for a very long time even for me 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.630
 same and that I would like to clear up a 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.090
 good time for all with you 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.730
 today that's it then I would like 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.320
 talk about this phenomenon as never 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.690
 no one really has theoretically 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.079
 managed to understand this is the phenomenon 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.390
 goblins teleporting to the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.500
 tears you know it in the vault 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.899
 there are tears to hold for the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.850
 second step is actually there are some 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.840
 times mobs who teleports and who 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.039
 land directly would 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.750
 then often tear the people of 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.730
 asis of the game style the clocks 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.719
 sordo so here he is what I'm going to you 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.730
 to say precisely is that I found 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.399
 finally, I saw them with my own eyes 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.750
 why it's happening like that so I 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.369
 do not doubt that there are some 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.409
 some of you who knew it 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.460
 already I already see some already to say yes I 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.619
 knew then she had no 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.640
 damn idea in short I do not care I 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.170
 here for those interested 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.780
 really so I wanted to unveil 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.689
 today just what is 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.920
 happening is that I actually discovered 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.540
 I am always left usually 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.280
 to do the rips and I kill in 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.990
 do you know the little one the little 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.340
 slope you see it all in itself video the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.439
 small slope actually towards the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.640
 templar I kill a lot the mobs that 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.650
 come directly like that it was ok 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.829
 always quickly we go on and on 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.869
 did I realized that actually there is 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.720
 some times when there is a goblin or 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.100
 a goblin or anything that stumbles into 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.780
 did you go see on the video that 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.640
 is the kind of little walk and which 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.100
 bute abut he stumbles on the march during 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.579
 several seconds and actually you lady 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.990
 on the sidelines 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.310
 they disappear and at that moment 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.960
 when you go back on rips he 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.180
 is there and well in fact that's the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.409
 phenomenon that is happening and that of this to 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.130
 place there and it's only happening this 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.590
 place there of the map 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.170
 there is a walking and goblin bug 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.600
 above except that for the coc of 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.549
 encoding the game for the computer the 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.710
 goblin during that time where he stumbles on 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.569
 this walk for the computer he stumbles 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.580
 not for the computer he makes his way 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.370
 until the tear but we do not stop 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.629
 not due 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.129
 he continues his journey but 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.860
 virtually as he does not 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.049
 really the computer design it but in 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.580
 does not it's real so what's going to happen 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.159
 to pass is that once precisely 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.950
 this animation where he will sacrifice himself 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.599
 either tear will happen and well in 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.890
 do enough at that moment that is going to be silent 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.760
 pay directly on the tear because 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.709
 that he can not do it at 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.900
 the place where he is suddenly all 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.340
 the place all English the moment he 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.959
 is supposed to move takes place during 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.010
 that he aims in this walk the computer 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.329
 do not understand who they are walking 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.159
 conceive he's doing his 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.959
 journey and so at the moment he 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.940
 sacrifice and by step him directly for 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.470
 catch up with this animation that 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.720
 the computer then conceived so far 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.609
 so here I discovered that while 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.049
 I made at least 500 vaults since 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.000
 I have the game and I discovered that 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.900
 only there and I move in know 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.940
 many who gave me explanations 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.620
 cardboard style yes it's because 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.620
 you are going too close to the gates of 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.340
 blow istp yes that's because there is a 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.019
 mode that is hidden from the shot istp yes 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.480
 sorry yes to a mob that drives to a 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.420
 other blow this bug or stp finally I 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.980
 really never tried to find out 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.480
 did not care a bit and it fell 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.470
 like that under you lift under my nose 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.540
 so I thought, why do not you 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.980
 make a video and then you 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.450
 will you say fart to your 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.099
 hotties you know why stp hands there 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.269
 down that's why you see and you 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.829
 fart a little bit for this little 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.299
 anecdote so here I really hope 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.139
 that this little video you liked me 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.400
 for my part added to next time 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.299
 for a next video 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.299
 go ciao bye
