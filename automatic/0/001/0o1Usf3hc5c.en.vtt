hi Jenna we're supposed to be tardy

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.919 
hi Jenna we're supposed to be tardy
today<00:00:13.679> I've<00:00:13.920> got<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.130> 460<00:00:14.880> Ford<00:00:15.150> silver<00:00:15.540> head<00:00:15.750> on

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
today I've got a 460 Ford silver head on

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.920 
today I've got a 460 Ford silver head on
the<00:00:16.049> bench<00:00:16.260> we're<00:00:16.890> gonna<00:00:17.039> check<00:00:17.250> for<00:00:17.550> cracks

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
the bench we're gonna check for cracks

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:26.710 
the bench we're gonna check for cracks
complain<00:00:18.930> about<00:00:22.400> so<00:00:23.400> we're<00:00:23.670> gonna<00:00:23.760> take<00:00:23.939> a

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.769 

magnet's<00:00:28.789> taking<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.939> closer<00:00:30.210> look<00:00:30.359> at<00:00:30.599> this

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
magnet's taking a closer look at this

magnet's taking a closer look at this
cylinder<00:00:31.109> head<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:31.859> see<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
cylinder head you can see that the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.900 
cylinder head you can see that the
valves<00:00:32.910> are<00:00:33.570> good<00:00:34.469> color<00:00:34.800> meaning<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
valves are good color meaning that the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.049 
valves are good color meaning that the
engine<00:00:36.570> was<00:00:36.690> running<00:00:36.719> properly<00:00:37.760> but<00:00:38.760> we<00:00:38.910> do

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
engine was running properly but we do

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.240 
engine was running properly but we do
see<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.600> end<00:00:40.020> cylinder<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.770> little<00:00:41.040> bit<00:00:41.160> of

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
see on this end cylinder a little bit of

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.290 
see on this end cylinder a little bit of
discoloration<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.570> not<00:00:43.260> quite<00:00:43.530> as<00:00:43.710> much<00:00:44.300> ash

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
discoloration and not quite as much ash

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.319 
discoloration and not quite as much ash
deposit<00:00:46.020> as<00:00:46.200> we<00:00:46.410> had<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> other<00:00:46.890> valves<00:00:47.550> so

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
deposit as we had on the other valves so

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.970 
deposit as we had on the other valves so
we're<00:00:48.480> gonna<00:00:48.570> start<00:00:48.870> with<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.140> cylinder<00:00:49.559> and

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
we're gonna start with that cylinder and

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.720 
we're gonna start with that cylinder and
sitting<00:00:50.489> fine<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.940> cracking<00:00:52.340> we<00:00:53.340> want<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> use

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
sitting fine and cracking we want to use

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.400 
sitting fine and cracking we want to use
an<00:00:53.940> electromagnet<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.750> create<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> magnetic

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
an electromagnet to create a magnetic

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.180 
an electromagnet to create a magnetic
field<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.989> disruption<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.260> field<00:00:58.590> will

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
field and disruption in that field will

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.529 
field and disruption in that field will
indicate<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.640> there's<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.000> crack<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
indicate that there's a crack in the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.869 
indicate that there's a crack in the
head<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.829> do<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.219> we're<00:01:02.460> going<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.670> use<00:01:02.850> a

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
head and to do that we're going to use a

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.740 
head and to do that we're going to use a
fine<00:01:03.300> metallic<00:01:03.840> powder<00:01:04.199> or<00:01:04.920> dust<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:06.150> sprinkle

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
fine metallic powder or dust to sprinkle

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.450 
fine metallic powder or dust to sprinkle
on<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> head<00:01:07.110> once<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.560> energize<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:08.100> magnet

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
on the head once we energize the magnet

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.990 
on the head once we energize the magnet
so<00:01:09.240> I'm<00:01:09.299> gonna<00:01:09.450> set<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> magnet<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.200> place

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
so I'm gonna set the magnet in place

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.340 
so I'm gonna set the magnet in place
energize<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.240> I'm<00:01:12.720> gonna<00:01:12.869> take<00:01:13.080> our<00:01:13.260> dust

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.450 

Spray<00:01:17.350> on<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.189> cylinder<00:01:18.549> head<00:01:20.250> now<00:01:21.250> as<00:01:21.369> you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
Spray on the cylinder head now as you

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.100 
Spray on the cylinder head now as you
can<00:01:21.610> see<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:24.159> is<00:01:24.310> a<00:01:24.340> crack<00:01:25.030> in<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.750> cylinder

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
can see there is a crack in the cylinder

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:37.469 
can see there is a crack in the cylinder
head

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.010 

I've<00:01:38.479> removed<00:01:38.929> the<00:01:39.049> exhaust<00:01:39.439> valve<00:01:39.770> and

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
I've removed the exhaust valve and

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.169 
I've removed the exhaust valve and
continued<00:01:42.020> mic<00:01:42.369> testing<00:01:43.369> for<00:01:43.579> the<00:01:43.670> crack<00:01:43.909> and

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
continued mic testing for the crack and

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:45.880 
continued mic testing for the crack and
as<00:01:44.329> you<00:01:44.479> can<00:01:44.600> kind<00:01:44.840> of<00:01:44.929> see<00:01:45.140> it<00:01:45.350> actually<00:01:45.500> goes

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
as you can kind of see it actually goes

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.149 
as you can kind of see it actually goes
down<00:01:46.159> beneath<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.299> valve<00:01:47.509> seat<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:48.170> down

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
down beneath the valve seat and down

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.990 
down beneath the valve seat and down
into<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:49.610> port<00:01:50.289> so<00:01:51.640> fortunately<00:01:52.640> this<00:01:52.729> head

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
into the port so fortunately this head

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.190 
into the port so fortunately this head
is<00:01:54.280> unfit<00:01:55.280> for<00:01:55.490> service<00:01:55.700> we<00:01:56.659> may<00:01:56.869> be<00:01:56.929> able<00:01:57.079> to

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
is unfit for service we may be able to

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.749 
is unfit for service we may be able to
repair<00:01:57.500> this<00:01:57.679> crack<00:01:57.979> but<00:01:58.280> more<00:01:58.459> than<00:01:58.549> likely

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
repair this crack but more than likely

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.990 
repair this crack but more than likely
you<00:01:59.090> probably<00:01:59.119> just<00:01:59.810> replace<00:02:00.289> the<00:02:00.500> head

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
you probably just replace the head

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.039 
you probably just replace the head
anyway<00:02:02.000> I'll<00:02:02.329> go<00:02:02.479> ahead<00:02:02.569> and<00:02:02.780> get<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:03.020> other

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
anyway I'll go ahead and get the other

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.980 
anyway I'll go ahead and get the other
three<00:02:03.829> cylinders<00:02:04.250> done<00:02:04.630> verify<00:02:05.630> that<00:02:05.810> there's

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
three cylinders done verify that there's

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.770 
three cylinders done verify that there's
no<00:02:06.110> other<00:02:06.229> cracks<00:02:06.700> but<00:02:07.700> at<00:02:07.880> this<00:02:08.060> point<00:02:08.360> it

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
no other cracks but at this point it

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.639 
no other cracks but at this point it
looks<00:02:08.959> like<00:02:09.049> the<00:02:09.289> head<00:02:09.440> is<00:02:09.619> going

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
looks like the head is going

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.250 
looks like the head is going
