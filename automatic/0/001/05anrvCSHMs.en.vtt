00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the faithful / doc 32 texture pack so

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.850 
the faithful / doc 32 texture pack so
that's<00:01:43.140> why<00:01:43.290> there's<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.560> different

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
waterfalls if we go around it um I don't

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.449 
waterfalls if we go around it um I don't
think<00:02:28.020> there's<00:02:28.290> anything<00:02:28.530> special<00:02:29.280> but<00:02:30.890> um<00:02:31.890> on

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.210 
think there's anything special but um on
another<00:02:32.970> seat<00:02:33.209> I<00:02:33.300> found<00:02:33.510> lava<00:02:33.750> actually<00:02:34.380> but

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
another seat I found lava actually but

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
another seat I found lava actually but
oh<00:02:35.610> what's<00:02:36.090> down<00:02:36.240> here<00:02:36.570> ah<00:02:37.280> nothing<00:02:38.280> just<00:02:38.760> a

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
dips but so you got your snow biome here

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.190 
dips but so you got your snow biome here
you<00:02:47.100> got<00:02:47.280> your<00:02:47.310> big<00:02:47.670> mountain<00:02:48.120> waterfalls<00:02:48.930> and

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
you got your big mountain waterfalls and

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.860 
you got your big mountain waterfalls and
so<00:02:49.950> that's<00:02:50.190> pretty<00:02:50.459> nice<00:02:50.730> that's<00:02:51.480> pretty<00:02:51.720> nice

so that's pretty nice that's pretty nice
for<00:02:51.930> rendering<00:02:52.410> out<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:53.030> world<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.410> okay<00:02:55.410> the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
for rendering out the world and okay the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.050 
for rendering out the world and okay the
texture<00:02:55.769> pack<00:02:55.950> makes<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.340> leaves<00:02:56.910> look

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
texture pack makes the leaves look

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.960 
texture pack makes the leaves look
really<00:02:57.510> odd<00:02:57.769> but<00:02:58.769> oh<00:02:59.160> we<00:02:59.400> don't<00:02:59.550> want<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.820> show

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
or whatever world generator but I think

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.800 
or whatever world generator but I think
that's<00:03:40.320> cool<00:03:41.070> if<00:03:41.850> you<00:03:42.060> don't<00:03:42.299> then<00:03:42.480> you're

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
there's another cave over here right

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.720 
there's another cave over here right
here<00:03:59.880> down<00:04:00.090> here<00:04:00.120> so<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:01.620> why<00:04:02.220> is<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.400> random

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
here down here so and why is it random

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.020 
here down here so and why is it random
light<00:04:03.060> oh<00:04:03.269> just<00:04:03.660> for<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:03.900> but<00:04:04.430> this<00:04:05.430> is<00:04:05.670> what

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
light oh just for that but this is what

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.360 
light oh just for that but this is what
I<00:04:06.060> would<00:04:06.390> have<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:06.660> say<00:04:06.690> is<00:04:07.170> probably<00:04:07.530> at<00:04:08.010> eight

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
I would have to say is probably at eight

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.970 
I would have to say is probably at eight
out<00:04:08.970> of<00:04:09.030> 10<00:04:09.660> for<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:10.200> seed<00:04:10.410> review<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:10.890> then

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
out of 10 for a seed review and then

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.069 
out of 10 for a seed review and then
it's<00:04:11.310> really<00:04:11.670> random<00:04:11.820> it<00:04:12.120> goes<00:04:12.299> flat<00:04:12.720> on<00:04:12.989> the

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
it's really random it goes flat on the

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.050 
it's really random it goes flat on the
back<00:04:13.230> which<00:04:14.130> is<00:04:14.310> something<00:04:14.519> really<00:04:14.880> odd<00:04:15.030> i

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
back which is something really odd i

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.880 
back which is something really odd i
don't<00:04:15.359> know<00:04:15.420> if<00:04:15.510> that's<00:04:15.660> useful<00:04:15.989> in<00:04:16.560> anything

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
but i really like the seed especially

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.790 
but i really like the seed especially
just<00:04:20.729> this<00:04:20.940> part<00:04:21.180> but<00:04:22.140> i<00:04:22.320> don't<00:04:22.530> know<00:04:22.620> if<00:04:22.680> you

like<00:04:51.480> this<00:04:51.630> mountain<00:04:52.380> it's<00:04:53.040> pretty<00:04:53.280> close<00:04:53.430> to

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
like this mountain it's pretty close to

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.000 
like this mountain it's pretty close to
the<00:04:53.610> sky<00:04:53.940> limit<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:54.660> I<00:04:54.930> think<00:04:55.590> you<00:04:55.860> could

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
the sky limit so I think you could

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.860 
the sky limit so I think you could
really<00:04:56.070> build<00:04:56.580> some<00:04:56.880> pretty<00:04:57.120> legit<00:04:57.420> stuff<00:04:57.540> on

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870
