00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.710
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.730
 I promised you 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.040
 the ultras tnt sparkle series yes 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.620
 try and test if that 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.910
 it really does hold what it does 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.150
 promises 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.940
 yes I have worn quite so often now 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.670
 and I'll do it in part 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.820
 Show up here so well here 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.309
 and yes, what can I tell you so 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.309
 the order was very easy 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.860
 So the first layer is this lowest one 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.379
 escapes already base code was within 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.530
 I dried myself from seconds 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:07.750
 then a few colors of the 9th 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:11.210
 patrice short of looking this hot 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.880
 ultimate mail exact and email 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.440
 Acker selected 11 there were those now 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.229
 new came into the assortment and I have mine 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.420
 just picked ten of them and now 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.909
 you focus as you look at the 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.890
 painted nails and have the whole then 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.130
 really let it dry very well 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.080
 I believe 15 minutes at least until the 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.680
 laquer was really dry 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:39.140
 and yes, then I'm with the whole thing 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:42.440
 the 3 lowest charge level wins so 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.680
 seen and I have to say yes the whole 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.660
 has kept very well so good to very 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.760
 well i'll show you the result now 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.900
 what has become of it now 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.900
 after six days 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.520
 and since you can now see again 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.079
 that I used all the colors and 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.530
 there you see here once index finger and 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.140
 middle finger 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.590
 yes, I'm important to yes 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.239
 somewhere against covered but in the big 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.630
 and all I have to say is that the whole 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.040
 The whole thing is very good 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.650
 so kinda gone a bit 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.310
 but from the durability he finds me 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.440
 that was very good please 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.180
 Forgive my nails or something like that 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.870
 He painted it quickly 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.150
 go 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.549
 Nevertheless, I think that the 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.319
 products are really good now 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.090
 a lot says they hold up to eight 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.580
 days up to eight days is always one 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.630
 a bit dangerous because yes that could 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.910
 be a day 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 up to eight 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.790
 that's not exactly what it means 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.890
 days but up to eight days and at 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.799
 It has kept me for six whole days 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.310
 on the sixth day that's just here 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.849
 a little bit of water rinsed off but not 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.220
 a lot of 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.640
 you see so little at the front of the 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.709
 tips and find it in any case yes 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.320
 well I would recommend it to you and them: 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.359
 not that it is the visit in the 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.739
 Nail Studio somehow replaces it 's on 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.739
 any case a super cool alternative 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.049
 and a cheaper alternative 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.840
 it always depends on how yours 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.549
 nail board itself is holding nail polish 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.870
 in a good mood or not so with me 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.480
 that anyway so that once said 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.420
 really relatively good holds so with me 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.269
 splinter nail ag only if at all 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.579
 after three days off and yes unless 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.819
 I think I now somewhere around 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:35.019
 logically yes the gloss I know it 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.769
 not maybe it's just me 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.750
 so can not be so extreme now 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.150
 promised that should be so high gloss 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.489
 I do not have that effect now 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.109
 but I have it with others 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.639
 also already googled a bit 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.900
 I saw that was already one 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.760
 bit more glamorous maybe it 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.019
 really what to do with the nail or 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.209
 with the colors like me now 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.410
 chose by and large 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.410
 I can recommend it to you 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.269
 With 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.830
 Write me your comments like you 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.220
 So you find these products 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.840
 already tested or not yet 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.790
 so if you just ask me 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.850
 I would say yes is okay but 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.950
 I do not know if it's a normal base 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.230
 code and normal top coat not synonymous 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.150
 Did you know what I mean so 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.930
 you really need these two 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.940
 Products or cats on a normal 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.980
 top coat and normal base done well 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.480
 I hope you understand what I mean yes 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.710
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.340
 and we'll see another one again 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.340
 bye
