00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:13.129
 it is possible that the employer 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.179
 neither to him nor to the worker the compensation in money from the sale of 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:18.560
 your holidays 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.659
 sources 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.569
 or better game as it should proceed 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:24.119
 the worker 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.279
 here we run 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.069
 milic it is mandatory that the company 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:30.470
 with silk 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.840
 the money is the cash compensation of half of these when they entered 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.200
 the request a company can tell the sr I'm leaving fifteen days 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.960
 integers to work this saga 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.219
 and how would the worker's 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:46.850
 the answer 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.790
 nothing directly article 189 of the labor code 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.370
 article that has just been modified 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.620
 article 20 of law 14 29 of 2010 as I have said many times the law 14 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.300
 29 of 2010 or also called leguía formalización has employment pension 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.100
 and some people have popularly given it the qualification 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.770
 of first job law because 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.640
 this law modified the 189 of the labor code 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.570
 how are the documents of article 189 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.359
 I'm going to let you read it 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.300
 before that he clarified 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.740
 until December 2010 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.930
 in Colombia it could not be compensated 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.530
 in money the holidays 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.500
 except 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.720
 the work contract will end 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.320
 and the worker would not have 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.400
 harnessed the mese physically enjoyed throughout the contract 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.500
 work 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.540
 the norm said earlier you can not 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.979
 but the ministry of labor jose to the labor inspector 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.750
 could authorize if harm was shown 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.930
 for the national economy by industry 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.200
 illogical situation pretend that a worker 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.569
 let it be vacations 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.720
 was going to collapse the economy of the country accordingly and in practice 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.139
 legal 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:16.719
 In Colombia, vacations could not be compensated 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.849
 in the middle of the work contract if not in the end 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.379
 when the worker had not enjoyed them and his work contract 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:24.979
 it ended 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.089
 but it turns out that that discussion 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:28.389
 it's over 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:34.679
 since last December 29, 2010 with the law 14 29 if it can be compensated 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:35.450
 the money 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.659
 until half the holidays 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.389
 and the other half was noted and the employment contract is still valid 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.269
 that said rule will allow me to read article 189 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:49.949
 the employer and if worker 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:51.699
 he talks to me about the two 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:53.629
 employer and worker 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.349
 all 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.869
 may agree in writing 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.259
 upon request of the worker 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:04.309
 that money is paid until half of the holidays 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.659
 the norm is clear 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:08.929
 all 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:11.739
 what does that mean 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.159
 that the worker 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.489
 the worker 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.929
 it's time he puts it to the company 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:21.419
 who does not want to go and 15 days a month to rest 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.149
 who wants only to rest the sight 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:26.840
 they have obviously paid silver 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.230
 and that the other half 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.219
 give him the money but he goes back to work 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:32.579
 who asks for it 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.809
 the worker but who give it last 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:38.629
 the company 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.659
 then the fact that a worker asks me 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.169
 half of the vacation in money thing that we are compensated for money is not 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.169
 public bull for the company to accede to this request 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:56.910
 It is optional for the company if you tell or compensate the view 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.669
 by your request previously obviously 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.489
 today to chile 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.259
 those of legality I want you to go to rest for fifteen days avilés and 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.850
 point I do not want to see it to the company the next 15 days 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.709
 go rest 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.369
 3 returns it repeated it requested the worker but who grants it the 

00:04:16.369 --> 00:04:18.369
 compensation is finally the company
