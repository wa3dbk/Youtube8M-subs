00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:13.830
 hello this is a lemon variety before you 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:20.600
 old carts old old 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:23.039
 old variety fruits are beginning to turn yellow 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.359
 can already cut 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:31.710
 you see the jester were cut here on when 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.739
 twigs i gave dads logic because 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:41.129
 but they can not violate when they bloom 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:46.520
 as a bunch of grapes throws a bunch 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:50.090
 literally color and leave one raft 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:55.469
 the rest of the logic should be cut off 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:59.359
 here cut tore hard so I 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:03.359
 peas garden shears and neatly 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:07.520
 cut off a raft already can safely 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.580
 tea to use cool sho 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.549
 if he does not cut the fruit off first 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:19.140
 will turn yellow and here will be yellow 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.159
 here and then gradually begin to reverse 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.290
 process to go 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:30.329
 it will turn green but the taste is already 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:33.650
 fetus I would not say good 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.840
 there will be such fruits can be tied 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.290
 put on the next two to three days 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.100
 it will cut and small but it should still 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.530
 hang on it 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.790
 hang at least three weeks four four 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.020
 so that he gained strength 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.500
 but when you remove the fruits of this 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.500
 the last will be the best 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.439
 ripen because time plants 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:06.600
 switch to it will be less juice 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.550
 pull and go crumbs grow up here from 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.370
 dry twig from here it is 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:17.210
 my now neatly remove 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:24.030
 so she's here flush here 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:29.210
 do well but if the plant is up to you, I 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:33.150
 feel it so dry twig here it is 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:35.600
 just delete it all you see everything 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.600
 plants 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:45.350
 we bend constantly goes forming 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.480
 in the future will be under this twig 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.630
 turn up and so it turned up 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.670
 let's make a bowl 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.210
 for the plant to go so grow 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:03.140
 and we will form a small bush like 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:04.880
 see here is the very beginning of the plant I 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:10.040
 twigs 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:15.720
 did not cut the basics of swamps knot cut off 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:19.290
 here she is bent and well then 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.660
 form otherwise plants constantly 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.790
 will grow 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.790
 seeing him from one bud grew 3 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:31.500
 branches 1 2 3 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:36.090
 grew up here 2 when you die but 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:38.270
 now it is desirable for us to get the twigs in 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:43.880
 at the expense of here went to grow 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:47.790
 so she was beautiful and shaped 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:52.340
 plants and now I will show you how 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:57.510
 lemon love swimming thing is that 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:00.900
 when driving through the leaves with fertilizer 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:07.250
 feed up and get such a raid 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:09.420
 it can be seen here it is on the ice fertilizer 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.930
 some greens all 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:17.640
 and for toshiba plants especially the beginning 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:20.390
 We grow let young shoots need to 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:24.960
 old leaves were clean like that 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:26.010
 not allowed so she was then she 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.370
 there will be more 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:34.370
 photosynthesis go and preferably I wash 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:40.550
 old tooth brush 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:44.940
 water soaked and so here below 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:48.810
 holding a second hand just 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.510
 so you wash the leaves and several times you can 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.730
 even a little soap 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.060
 diluted use but must 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:01.190
 then you need to wash it off to be 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.190
 neat little leaves 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:25.930
 aluminum tag is never lost 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:25.930
 tied thanks
