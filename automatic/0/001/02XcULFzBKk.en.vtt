 look at the jumbo is signed olivier best olivier monnot

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.439
 1 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.470
 stÃ©phane is what makes the show sense 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.509
 this former French number 3 discovered the storer one day at the 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.680
 TV he took a passion for the sport to the point of doing today 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.730
 his job he is the first in France to live smic robillard and to 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.030

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.500
 and percent and the storer and the goal for the sydom key competition facing 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.310
 the euro in safe place these guys game 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.810
 and what differentiates the storer is that seated much larger 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.530
 the material is different but especially it is the suspense of the matches but 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.960
 which we are attending 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.070
 it's a very interesting show to watch and that even appeals to 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.620
 people who do not play 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.870
 the goal of the game is to score points with the bears where I colored them 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.320
 propelling in what the players call the pockets 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.850
 the winner is the one with the most points

 19th century metro in the worst British men 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.150
 the storer is very common in the UK where its popularity is 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.290
 exceeded by that of football the people children 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.320
 or not among the best 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.290
 in work but the world is a little behind the compared to some 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.950
 country like china in the ter that's why it has no professionals 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.320
 in France 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.040
 so we try to develop% 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.750
 discipline through actions towards young people 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.680
 that in a few years but new champions money but that we can 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.040
 compete with these countries 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.320
 Stephane dreams of one day seeing a Frenchman in the championship final 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.880
 world 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.439
 which is why no way of his son it's been a few years since 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.260
 this child plays with his unusual 10 years 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.200
 in their championship after 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.200
 we still do not know if 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.620
 labatut of adults 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.730
 alain ginies iron usually practices the American billiards that night there 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.990
 tests the sculptor for the first time it changes a lot of good 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.780
 but no clarification because 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.800
 these troubles are not paired boullier are not my jurisdiction 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.290
 and because of Thanksgiving Thursday in Montreal it's not quite the same 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.159
 this sport which is very very 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.439
 calm posed of very thoughtful 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.609
 must therefore 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:18.609
 you have to get used to it a little bit different 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.719
 and when we start to master the discipline 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:23.549
 we can have fun
