00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
hi guys alright today we're going to

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.000 
hi guys alright today we're going to
take<00:00:02.220> a<00:00:02.250> look<00:00:02.550> at<00:00:05.930> the<00:00:06.930> new<00:00:07.109> Cobalt<00:00:07.589> extreme

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
take a look at the new Cobalt extreme

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.870 
take a look at the new Cobalt extreme
access<00:00:08.630> cycle<00:00:09.630> set<00:00:09.950> so<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> 20<00:00:11.639> sound

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
access cycle set so this is a 20 sound

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.180 
access cycle set so this is a 20 sound
piece<00:00:12.150> set<00:00:12.620> and<00:00:14.420> includes<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.719> 3/8<00:00:16.230> inch<00:00:16.260> socket

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
piece set and includes a 3/8 inch socket

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.890 
piece set and includes a 3/8 inch socket
it's<00:00:17.490> quarter<00:00:17.850> inch<00:00:17.970> socket<00:00:18.180> wrap<00:00:18.690> your

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
it's quarter inch socket wrap your

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.630 
it's quarter inch socket wrap your
handles<00:00:19.550> coupled<00:00:20.550> after<00:00:20.939> screwdriver<00:00:21.630> bits

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
handles coupled after screwdriver bits

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.179 
handles coupled after screwdriver bits
alright<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:25.199> pass-through<00:00:25.560> design

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
alright so it's a pass-through design

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.710 
alright so it's a pass-through design
meaning<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.240> could<00:00:27.869> put<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:29.720> longer

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
meaning I could put this on to longer

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.470 
meaning I could put this on to longer
bolts<00:00:31.140> or<00:00:31.349> splurt<00:00:31.740> rod<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.309> it'll<00:00:33.030> go<00:00:33.149> through

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
bolts or splurt rod and it'll go through

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.350 
bolts or splurt rod and it'll go through
it<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.989> get<00:00:34.110> access<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.469> fastener<00:00:35.180> now<00:00:36.180> these

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
it to get access to fastener now these

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.479 
it to get access to fastener now these
sockets<00:00:36.660> are<00:00:36.899> also<00:00:36.989> combination<00:00:37.860> inch<00:00:38.190> and

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
sockets are also combination inch and

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.049 
sockets are also combination inch and
metric<00:00:39.770> for<00:00:40.770> example<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.160> one<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.430> three

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
metric for example this one is three

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.930 
metric for example this one is three
quarter<00:00:42.420> inch<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:44.690> 19<00:00:45.690> millimeters<00:00:46.309> and<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
quarter inch and 19 millimeters and the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.520 
quarter inch and 19 millimeters and the
supply<00:00:48.180> design<00:00:48.390> means<00:00:48.809> they<00:00:49.050> could<00:00:49.230> fit

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
supply design means they could fit

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.639 
supply design means they could fit

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.920 
axis damaged fasteners around it okay
it's<00:01:04.830> also<00:01:05.070> thin<00:01:05.369> wall<00:01:05.580> which<00:01:06.000> actually<00:01:06.810> you

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
it's also thin wall which actually you

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.740 
it's also thin wall which actually you
liked<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.409> overall<00:01:08.280> quality<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.760> pretty<00:01:09.030> good

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
liked and overall quality is pretty good

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.230 
liked and overall quality is pretty good
I'm<00:01:10.530> not<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> fan<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.070> universal<00:01:11.700> sockets<00:01:12.119> at

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
I'm not a fan of universal sockets at

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.420 
I'm not a fan of universal sockets at
all<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.720> believe<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.590> separate<00:01:13.950> inch<00:01:14.130> and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
all I believe in separate inch and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.010 
all I believe in separate inch and
metric<00:01:14.600> but<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:16.320> can't<00:01:17.009> deny<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.400> these<00:01:18.020> are

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
metric but I can't deny that these are

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.310 
metric but I can't deny that these are
well<00:01:19.320> built<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:21.210> entire<00:01:21.450> set<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.930> pretty

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
well built and the entire set is pretty

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.350 
well built and the entire set is pretty
well<00:01:22.530> thought-out<00:01:22.830> I'm<00:01:23.159> happy<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.460> they

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
comfortable test it on a couple of small

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.450 
comfortable test it on a couple of small
projects<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.759> it's<00:01:35.759> fairly<00:01:36.000> strong<00:01:39.049> now<00:01:40.460> if

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
projects and it's fairly strong now if

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.950 
projects and it's fairly strong now if
you<00:01:41.579> want<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.850> use<00:01:41.939> these<00:01:42.060> smaller<00:01:42.390> sockets

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you want to use these smaller sockets

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.359 
you want to use these smaller sockets
you<00:01:43.140> gotta<00:01:43.409> pull<00:01:43.740> out<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:44.360> little<00:01:45.360> adapter<00:01:46.369> and

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
you gotta pull out a little adapter and

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.850 
you gotta pull out a little adapter and
then<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.790> can<00:01:47.970> pop<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.899> actually<00:01:49.350> like

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
then you can pop it on so actually like

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.110 
then you can pop it on so actually like
so<00:01:51.950> alright<00:01:53.299> we<00:01:54.299> also<00:01:54.450> have

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120

that's<00:01:58.120> where<00:01:58.990> drive<00:01:59.230> adaptor<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.970> use<00:02:01.180> the

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
that's where drive adaptor to use the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.230 
that's where drive adaptor to use the
ratchet<00:02:01.630> with<00:02:02.100> regular<00:02:03.100> sockets<00:02:03.580> also<00:02:04.120> is<00:02:04.180> a

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
ratchet with regular sockets also is a

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.470 
ratchet with regular sockets also is a
quick<00:02:04.540> least<00:02:04.780> fun

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480
