00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
thoughts about about that he certainly

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.020

been<00:01:49.649> one<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.130> most<00:01:50.189> success<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.759> think<00:01:50.939> he

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
been one of the most success I think he

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.480 
been one of the most success I think he
had<00:01:51.149> been<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.570> most<00:01:51.780> successful<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.619> bond<00:01:53.280> at

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
had been the most successful a bond at

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.639 
had been the most successful a bond at
least<00:01:53.640> at<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> box<00:01:54.060> office<00:01:54.270> well<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.930> think<00:01:55.140> so

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
least at the box office well I think so

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.490 
least at the box office well I think so
you<00:01:55.710> see<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.310> thought<00:01:56.909> Sean<00:01:57.390> was<00:01:57.420> terrific<00:01:58.110> when

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you see I thought Sean was terrific when

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.100 
you see I thought Sean was terrific when
he<00:01:58.590> started<00:01:59.040> out<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.939> didn't<00:02:00.270> think<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
he started out and I didn't think the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.190 
he started out and I didn't think the
the<00:02:01.560> following<00:02:02.040> bonds<00:02:02.369> ever<00:02:02.610> quite<00:02:03.299> got<00:02:03.689> close

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
the following bonds ever quite got close

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.590 
the following bonds ever quite got close
to<00:02:04.590> Sean<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.430> thought<00:02:05.700> Pierce<00:02:06.210> was<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
to Sean and I thought Pierce was the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.410 
to Sean and I thought Pierce was the
first<00:02:06.899> guy<00:02:07.229> who<00:02:07.860> was<00:02:07.890> really<00:02:08.640> up<00:02:08.879> there<00:02:09.209> with

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
first guy who was really up there with

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.900 
first guy who was really up there with
sean<00:02:09.690> i<00:02:09.959> think<00:02:09.989> he's<00:02:10.319> terrific<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.220> he<00:02:11.640> brings

sean i think he's terrific and he brings

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.710 
sean i think he's terrific and he brings
in<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.270> short

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
in a short

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.080 
in a short
I<00:02:12.750> had<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.990> wonderful<00:02:13.230> danger<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.550> but

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
I had a wonderful danger to it but

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.360 
I had a wonderful danger to it but
Pierce's<00:02:15.780> girls<00:02:16.080> have<00:02:16.320> got<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.740> elegance

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
Pierce's girls have got that elegance

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.770 
Pierce's girls have got that elegance

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
because if you go back to the books

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.320 
because if you go back to the books
which<00:02:19.110> you're<00:02:19.320> not<00:02:19.500> half<00:02:19.740> bad<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.910> will<00:02:21.090> find
