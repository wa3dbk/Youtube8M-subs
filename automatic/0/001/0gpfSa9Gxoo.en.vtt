00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:22.140
 ntt rendered smare space not to do right 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.780
 Detect the force and place t Use this position and value 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:30.020
 And I am applied to the love 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.020
 For example, release the lock to hold the whole 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.280
 For example, if you are on the right hand, I think this browser, but for example I can not open it . 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.490
 right 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.350
 For example, such a button that can not be pressed 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.350
 By substitute by holding 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:51.719
 We think in the wind that we improve convenience when we operate with one hand 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.890
 in green pure application to do in Figure 4 a 6 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.399
 All Earth Stoneway 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.740
 in this term Installation Woodoo browser 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:06.900
 google doodle bar 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:09.360
 Dister Ca mayu 4 agent ajp with ga magag one point 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:16.560
 Echie 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:23.130
 I just still browser is started and only say hold now if Chase but, for example, 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:28.799
 By not a relationship to a separate quarrel is the act itself and the Toka touch panel that hold 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:31.950
 And Dari gave birth to another shortcut yesterday by touching the grip of + touch panel 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.479
 It looks like it's all round while pressing you control key on your computer 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.880
 It is the same friend as 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.609
 In after you open in this way Pupumaku is 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.780
 In Ah 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:45.510
 By swiping on 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:52.140
 For example, we support pour another app called schedule 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:53.160
 The sensor itself senses in milliseconds, so it does not feel its own slowness 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.590
 I think only 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:02.750
 Too is Nantes hypersensitivity to take to customers even if too fast 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:06.130
 In addition good feelings with the adjustment because there is a case where usability is worse on the contrary irritable too 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:11.310
 Is it necessary to look for a place or there? 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:14.880
 As future development, for example, there is no hard t now 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:19.730
 You can also change when you signed 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.940
 Since but can not be seen only is if, for example, strength hard p 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:27.450
 It can not be the Tteyuu with the continuity of conversion 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:32.330
 Why not use such sensors instead of hard keys, for example 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.200
 I think it would be possible to add a cell of a smooth, really beautiful form 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.250
 I think that way 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.250
