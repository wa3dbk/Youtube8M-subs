gonna put the air idle adjusting needle

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.870 
gonna put the air idle adjusting needle
in<00:00:06.919> this<00:00:08.599> controls<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.809> amount<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.290> air

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.750 
got your tractor on idle hmm we may have
to<00:00:26.130> use<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.460> old<00:00:26.670> spring<00:00:28.189> new<00:00:29.189> spring<00:00:29.550> too

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
to use that old spring new spring too

00:00:29.760 --> 00:01:15.359 
to use that old spring new spring too
stiff<00:00:30.090> must<00:00:30.750> be

how hot you type that this slightly it
says<00:01:19.990> turn<00:01:20.990> needle<00:01:21.440> in<00:01:21.590> lightly<00:01:22.190> until<00:01:22.430> seated

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
says turn needle in lightly until seated

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.540 
says turn needle in lightly until seated
then<00:01:23.540> back<00:01:23.810> out<00:01:24.050> one<00:01:24.259> turn<00:01:24.590> see<00:01:25.100> this<00:01:25.310> means

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
then back out one turn see this means

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.440 
then back out one turn see this means
it's<00:01:25.759> all<00:01:25.940> the<00:01:26.060> way<00:01:26.180> in

much one turn another thing you don't
want<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:34.850> force<00:01:35.030> this<00:01:35.240> on<00:01:35.450> in<00:01:35.660> there<00:01:35.869> because

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
want to force this on in there because

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.639 
want to force this on in there because
it'll<00:01:37.280> I've<00:01:38.240> had<00:01:38.479> I've<00:01:38.690> taken<00:01:38.960> them<00:01:39.110> out<00:01:39.320> or

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
it'll I've had I've taken them out or

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.430 
it'll I've had I've taken them out or
these<00:01:40.000> around<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.149> Sandford<00:01:41.720> edge<00:01:41.899> there'll

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
these around the Sandford edge there'll

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.900 
these around the Sandford edge there'll
be<00:01:42.470> a<00:01:42.619> groove<00:01:42.920> where<00:01:43.190> somebody's<00:01:43.700> really

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
be a groove where somebody's really

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.469 
be a groove where somebody's really
forced<00:01:44.300> one<00:01:44.479> in<00:01:44.660> there<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:45.880> that'll<00:01:46.880> affect

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
forced one in there and that'll affect

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.930 
forced one in there and that'll affect
the<00:01:47.869> air<00:01:48.020> mixture<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:49.130> you<00:01:49.190> back<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.580> out<00:01:49.670> one

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
the air mixture so you back it out one

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:57.010 
the air mixture so you back it out one
turn<00:01:52.000> right<00:01:53.000> there<00:01:53.259> now<00:01:54.880> this<00:01:55.880> screw<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.300> this

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
turn right there now this screw and this

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.560 
turn right there now this screw and this
screw<00:01:57.350> you'll<00:01:58.130> have<00:01:58.369> to<00:01:58.580> adjust<00:01:58.670> when<00:01:59.299> you<00:01:59.390> get

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
screw you'll have to adjust when you get

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.570 
screw you'll have to adjust when you get
it<00:01:59.659> on<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.930> tractor<00:02:00.320> to<00:02:00.439> get<00:02:01.040> it<00:02:01.159> to<00:02:01.280> run<00:02:01.369> it

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
it on the tractor to get it to run it

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.450 
it on the tractor to get it to run it
swings<00:02:02.110> but<00:02:03.110> it<00:02:03.259> should<00:02:03.470> start<00:02:03.830> with<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.340> way

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
swings but it should start with the way

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.920 
swings but it should start with the way
that<00:02:04.640> they<00:02:04.759> are<00:02:04.880> right<00:02:05.119> now<00:02:05.299> when<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:05.689> put<00:02:05.840> it

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
that they are right now when you put it

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.530 
that they are right now when you put it
on<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.140> trailer<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:07.610> just<00:02:07.970> once<00:02:08.209> you<00:02:08.299> get<00:02:08.450> the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
on the trailer you just once you get the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:21.070 
on the trailer you just once you get the
tractor<00:02:08.780> start<00:02:09.170> it<00:02:16.720> now<00:02:17.720> we<00:02:18.019> can<00:02:18.200> put

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:31.330 

put<00:02:21.650> all<00:02:21.800> of<00:02:21.830> these<00:02:25.930> back<00:02:26.930> in<00:02:27.140> er<00:02:28.360> now<00:02:30.340> your

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
put all of these back in er now your

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.190 
put all of these back in er now your
gasoline<00:02:31.820> from<00:02:32.090> your<00:02:32.300> tank<00:02:32.510> goes<00:02:32.720> in<00:02:32.930> here

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
gasoline from your tank goes in here

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.800 
gasoline from your tank goes in here
through<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.620> strainer<00:02:34.060> fills<00:02:35.060> up<00:02:35.330> this<00:02:35.510> bowl

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
through the strainer fills up this bowl

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.180 
through the strainer fills up this bowl
because<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.320> float<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.800> letting<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.790> gas<00:02:38.030> in

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
because the float is letting the gas in

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.270 
because the float is letting the gas in
the<00:02:40.190> gas<00:02:41.050> will<00:02:42.050> go<00:02:42.080> through<00:02:42.410> this<00:02:42.560> jet<00:02:42.920> down

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
the gas will go through this jet down

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.320 
the gas will go through this jet down
here<00:02:43.580> by<00:02:44.480> just<00:02:44.540> above<00:02:45.140> this<00:02:45.230> needle<00:02:46.150> go<00:02:47.150> figure

here by just above this needle go figure

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:54.070 
here by just above this needle go figure
out<00:02:47.450> though<00:02:47.570> like<00:02:48.350> we<00:02:48.500> use<00:02:48.740> this<00:02:50.050> that<00:02:52.840> we<00:02:53.840> use

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
out though like we use this that we use

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.010 
out though like we use this that we use
that<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.740> make<00:02:55.130> sure<00:02:55.160> that<00:02:55.370> jet<00:02:55.910> main<00:02:56.540> jet<00:02:56.840> was

that to make sure that jet main jet was

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.400 
that to make sure that jet main jet was
open<00:02:58.330> and<00:02:59.330> you<00:02:59.420> go<00:02:59.540> through<00:02:59.780> that<00:02:59.900> metering

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410
