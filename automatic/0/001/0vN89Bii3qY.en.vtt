here's the first prototype of a smoking
rod<00:00:04.770> that<00:00:05.580> I've<00:00:05.670> been<00:00:05.819> trying<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.529> come<00:00:07.529> up

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
rod that I've been trying to come up

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.740 
rod that I've been trying to come up
with<00:00:07.740> for<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.189> while<00:00:08.250> because<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.240> wanted<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.570> be

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
with for a while because I wanted to be

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.120 
with for a while because I wanted to be
able<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.230> hang<00:00:12.650> bacon<00:00:13.650> from<00:00:14.400> meat<00:00:14.580> hooks<00:00:14.820> or

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
able to hang bacon from meat hooks or

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.359 
able to hang bacon from meat hooks or
Pam<00:00:17.930> turkey<00:00:18.930> breasts<00:00:19.140> whatever<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:20.160> they

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
Pam turkey breasts whatever so they

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.920 
Pam turkey breasts whatever so they
don't<00:00:20.550> sit<00:00:20.760> on<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.880> great<00:00:21.210> because<00:00:21.779> they're

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
don't sit on the great because they're

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.400 
don't sit on the great because they're
great<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.199> get<00:00:22.289> really<00:00:22.529> really<00:00:22.740> hot<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.189> they

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
great to get really really hot and they

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.470 
great to get really really hot and they
tend<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.439> cook<00:00:26.430> especially<00:00:26.880> like<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.300> bacon

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
tend to cook especially like the bacon

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.120 
tend to cook especially like the bacon
they<00:00:27.779> cook<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.109> bacon<00:00:28.230> when<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.650> just<00:00:28.890> wanted

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
they cook the bacon when you just wanted

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.519 
they cook the bacon when you just wanted
smoke<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.820> thought<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.599> hanging<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.170> would

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
smoke so I thought that hanging it would

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.180 
smoke so I thought that hanging it would
be<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> much<00:00:32.040> better<00:00:32.450> way<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.480> doing<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.989> so

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
be a much better way of doing it so

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.069 
be a much better way of doing it so
friend<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.250> mine<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.579> really<00:00:35.820> good<00:00:36.000> at<00:00:36.149> welding

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
friend of mine is really good at welding

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.220 
friend of mine is really good at welding
and<00:00:37.380> metal<00:00:37.559> fabrication<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.930> got<00:00:39.930> tossed

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
and metal fabrication and got tossed

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.380 
and metal fabrication and got tossed
around<00:00:40.469> some<00:00:40.860> ideas<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.969> one<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
around some ideas and this is one of the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.069 
around some ideas and this is one of the
ones<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.750> he<00:00:42.840> came<00:00:43.050> up<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:44.809> based<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:46.050> a

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
ones that he came up with based on a

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.790 
ones that he came up with based on a
very<00:00:46.559> simple<00:00:46.710> design<00:00:48.350> sound<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.590> swing

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
very simple design sound like a swing

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.110 
very simple design sound like a swing
set<00:00:50.750> it's<00:00:51.750> welded<00:00:52.520> down<00:00:53.520> here<00:00:54.710> right<00:00:55.710> there

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
set it's welded down here right there

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.630 
set it's welded down here right there
with<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> slide<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.350> slides<00:00:59.280> back<00:00:59.609> and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
with a slide so this slides back and

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.500 
with a slide so this slides back and
forth<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.260> actually<00:01:02.149> change<00:01:03.149> this

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
forth so you can actually change this

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.570 
forth so you can actually change this
depending<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.170> size<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.739> your<00:01:04.799> your<00:01:05.309> grill

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
depending on the size of your your grill

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.719 
depending on the size of your your grill
and<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.840> take<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.490> slides

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
and you can take just this just slides

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.670 
and you can take just this just slides
right<00:01:08.970> out<00:01:11.720> and<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.900> can<00:01:13.080> easily<00:01:13.229> photo<00:01:13.530> you

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
right out and you can easily photo you

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.990 
right out and you can easily photo you
can<00:01:13.740> use<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.010> camera<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.760> stainless

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
can use a camera and it's stainless

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.380 
can use a camera and it's stainless
steel<00:01:15.420> it'll<00:01:16.080> never<00:01:16.200> rust<00:01:16.790> and<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.060> hold<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
steel it'll never rust and it can hold a

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.200 
steel it'll never rust and it can hold a
lot<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.600> weight<00:01:19.400> so<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.729> one<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
lot of weight so this is one of the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.469 
lot of weight so this is one of the
first<00:01:21.330> trials<00:01:22.400> I'm<00:01:23.400> not<00:01:23.610> gonna<00:01:23.790> actually<00:01:24.090> cook

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
first trials I'm not gonna actually cook

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.420 
first trials I'm not gonna actually cook
anything<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.049> yet<00:01:25.290> because<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.040> want<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.280> see

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
anything on it yet because I want to see

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.990 
anything on it yet because I want to see
how<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.700> holds<00:01:27.030> up<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.659> heat<00:01:28.850> got<00:01:31.970> keep<00:01:32.970> going

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
how it holds up to heat got keep going

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.870 
how it holds up to heat got keep going
got<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> fire<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:33.990> got<00:01:34.350> some<00:01:34.729> wood<00:01:35.729> in

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
got the fire going got some wood in

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.420 
got the fire going got some wood in
there<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.479> start<00:01:36.689> smoking<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.229> now<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.310> the

there to start smoking it now one of the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.140 
there to start smoking it now one of the
problems<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:39.049> with<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.460> we<00:01:41.460> will<00:01:41.880> correct

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
problems is with this we will correct

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.080 
problems is with this we will correct
this<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:43.229> was<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.530> first<00:01:43.560> try<00:01:44.090> this

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
this but this was the first try this

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.690 
this but this was the first try this
little<00:01:45.299> piece<00:01:45.659> right<00:01:45.780> here<00:01:46.430> actually<00:01:47.430> caused

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
little piece right here actually caused

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.990 
little piece right here actually caused
this<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.119> go<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:49.500> bump<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.520> lid<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> little

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
this to go up to bump the lid a little

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.139 
this to go up to bump the lid a little
bit<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.570> needs<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.700> half<00:01:54.000> an

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
bit so this needs is just this half an

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.819 
bit so this needs is just this half an
inch<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.840> we're<00:01:54.990> gonna<00:01:55.110> have<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.350> cut<00:01:55.560> out<00:01:55.740> off

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
inch so we're gonna have to cut out off

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.410 
inch so we're gonna have to cut out off
a<00:01:55.950> half<00:01:56.189> an<00:01:56.280> inch<00:01:56.430> from<00:01:56.520> these<00:01:56.850> legs<00:01:57.149> because

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
a half an inch from these legs because

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.510 
a half an inch from these legs because
this<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.409> supposed<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.799> be<00:01:58.860> 18<00:01:59.310> inches

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
this is this is supposed to be 18 inches

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.450 
this is this is supposed to be 18 inches
from<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.030> bottom<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.840> here<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.219> it<00:02:02.219> turned

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
from the bottom up to here and it turned

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.660 
from the bottom up to here and it turned
out<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.850> 18<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.600> half<00:02:03.810> inches<00:02:04.229> so

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
out to be 18 and a half inches so

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.550 
out to be 18 and a half inches so
although<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:06.299> does<00:02:06.540> close<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.170> lid<00:02:07.320> does

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
although it does close the lid does

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.600 
although it does close the lid does
close

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
close

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.660 
close
it<00:02:08.670> doesn't<00:02:09.030> close<00:02:09.270> completely<00:02:10.580> just<00:02:11.580> a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
it doesn't close completely just a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.570 
it doesn't close completely just a
slight<00:02:12.270> slight<00:02:12.870> air<00:02:13.650> gap<00:02:13.980> right<00:02:14.280> there<00:02:16.580> that
