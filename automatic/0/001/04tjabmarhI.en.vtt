00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
it's the fugitive far yeah I don't think

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.060 
it's the fugitive far yeah I don't think
that<00:00:33.180> were<00:00:33.450> built<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:34.170> obviously<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:34.710> based

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
that were built but obviously it's based

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.040 
that were built but obviously it's based
it's<00:00:35.460> based<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.850> an<00:00:36.030> old<00:00:36.360> beetle

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
it's based on an old beetle

as you can see back reg and I've got an
issue<00:00:40.590> with<00:00:40.770> wiring<00:00:41.719> and<00:00:42.719> if<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.960> look<00:00:43.140> at

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
issue with wiring and if you look at

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.590 
issue with wiring and if you look at
this<00:00:43.670> you'll<00:00:44.670> see<00:00:44.700> what's<00:00:45.059> not<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.329> sure<00:00:45.480> of

this<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.490> not<00:01:47.670> good<00:01:47.939> it's<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.689> masking<00:01:49.140> tip

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
this is not good it's a masking tip

this is not good it's a masking tip
it's<00:01:51.950> no<00:01:52.100> good<00:01:52.220> share<00:01:52.490> is<00:01:52.610> it<00:01:53.140> so<00:01:54.140> basically

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
it's no good share is it so basically

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.830 
it's no good share is it so basically
this<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:54.950> gonna<00:01:55.160> need<00:01:55.370> it

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
this is gonna need it
