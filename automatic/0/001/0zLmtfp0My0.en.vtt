you could also get iron or anything you
want<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.460> will<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:53.909> go<00:01:54.090> automatically

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
want and this will just go automatically

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.880 
want and this will just go automatically
and<00:01:56.810> what's<00:01:57.810> nice<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.680> leave

and what's nice is you can just leave
your<00:01:59.130> computer<00:01:59.280> alone<00:01:59.850> like<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.780> it

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
your computer alone like this and it

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.630 
your computer alone like this and it
will<00:02:00.930> continue<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.710> do<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.310> could<00:02:02.520> just

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
will continue to do it so you could just

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.389 
will continue to do it so you could just
like<00:02:02.850> walk<00:02:03.119> off<00:02:03.469> go<00:02:04.469> away<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.890> while<00:02:05.009> if<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
like walk off go away for a while if the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.370 
like walk off go away for a while if the
server<00:02:05.640> if<00:02:06.000> you're<00:02:06.149> like<00:02:06.329> if<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.049> know<00:02:07.200> you're

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
server if you're like if you know you're

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.260 
server if you're like if you know you're
not<00:02:07.469> going<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.770> die<00:02:07.890> via<00:02:08.340> PvP<00:02:08.819> someone's<00:02:09.149> not

diamonds for you

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.949 
diamonds for you
so<00:02:13.800> uh<00:02:13.830> looks<00:02:14.520> like<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.849> found<00:02:15.150> some<00:02:15.540> more<00:02:15.750> and

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
so uh looks like it found some more and

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.580 
so uh looks like it found some more and
if<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.170> x-ray<00:02:17.510> there<00:02:18.510> they<00:02:18.720> are<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.260> can<00:02:19.380> see

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
if I x-ray there they are so you can see

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.630 
if I x-ray there they are so you can see
them<00:02:19.680> with<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.890> x-ray<00:02:20.220> how<00:02:20.459> it's

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
them with the x-ray how it's

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.949 
them with the x-ray how it's
automatically<00:02:21.390> going<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.840> them<00:02:23.360> but<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.390> yeah

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
automatically going to them but I yeah

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.510 
automatically going to them but I yeah
also<00:02:25.319> in<00:02:25.410> general<00:02:25.770> it's<00:02:25.890> just<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.130> really<00:02:26.370> good

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
also in general it's just a really good

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.240 
also in general it's just a really good
client<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.870> can<00:02:28.020> type<00:02:28.410> on<00:02:28.709> dudes<00:02:28.950> doing

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
client and you can type on dudes doing

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.570 
client and you can type on dudes doing
this<00:02:29.810> so<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:31.380> think<00:02:31.560> I'll<00:02:31.830> demo<00:02:32.040> some<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.489> the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
this so I think I'll demo some of the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.270 
this so I think I'll demo some of the
other<00:02:32.700> commands<00:02:33.090> that's<00:02:33.480> in<00:02:33.660> here<00:02:33.870> or<00:02:34.100> can<00:02:35.100> do

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
other commands that's in here or can do

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.270 
other commands that's in here or can do
this<00:02:35.880> um<00:02:36.750> Ted<00:02:37.709> um<00:02:38.810> 20<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.500> as<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.100> can<00:02:41.250> see

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
this um Ted um 20 and as you can see

this um Ted um 20 and as you can see
just<00:02:41.400> spam<00:02:41.940> chat<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:43.140> we<00:02:44.040> could<00:02:44.310> do<00:02:45.140> commands

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
just spam chat and we could do commands

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.180 
just spam chat and we could do commands
again<00:02:46.290> could<00:02:46.830> do<00:02:47.010> um<00:02:48.319> let's<00:02:49.319> see<00:02:49.590> PS<00:02:50.840> 20<00:02:51.840> and

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
again could do um let's see PS 20 and

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.520 
again could do um let's see PS 20 and
yeah<00:02:53.239> all<00:02:54.239> right<00:02:54.660> so<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:54.989> looks<00:02:55.049> like<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.290> did

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
yeah all right so it looks like a did

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.920 
yeah all right so it looks like a did
fat<00:02:55.799> find<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.250> diamonds<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:56.790> it's<00:02:57.750> going<00:02:57.870> to

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
fat find the diamonds and it's going to

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.009 
fat find the diamonds and it's going to
gather<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.440> diamonds<00:02:59.390> the<00:03:00.390> developer<00:03:00.720> also

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
gather the diamonds the developer also

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.890 
gather the diamonds the developer also
said<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.650> in<00:03:02.010> beta<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.900> things

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
said that this is in beta so things

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.680 
said that this is in beta so things
might<00:03:04.170> go<00:03:04.410> wrong<00:03:04.440> but<00:03:05.010> um<00:03:05.220> for<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.269> most<00:03:06.480> part

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
might go wrong but um for the most part

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.750 
might go wrong but um for the most part
that<00:03:07.110> I've<00:03:07.260> seen<00:03:07.560> everything<00:03:07.860> works<00:03:08.160> fine<00:03:08.370> so

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
that I've seen everything works fine so

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.039 
that I've seen everything works fine so
it<00:03:08.970> looks<00:03:09.030> like<00:03:09.209> i<00:03:09.299> just<00:03:09.390> found<00:03:09.660> more<00:03:09.870> done

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
it looks like i just found more done

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.530 
it looks like i just found more done
than<00:03:10.080> sin<00:03:10.440> phi<00:03:10.620> x<00:03:10.799> ray<00:03:10.980> alright<00:03:11.670> so<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.150> was

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
than sin phi x ray alright so that was

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.170 
than sin phi x ray alright so that was
pretty<00:03:12.780> close<00:03:13.049> and<00:03:13.760> it's<00:03:14.760> going<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:14.970> go<00:03:15.120> ahead

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
pretty close and it's going to go ahead

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
auto dig oops I think actually at the

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.250 
auto dig oops I think actually at the
disc<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.769> from<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.070> server<00:03:32.280> so<00:03:33.019> yeah<00:03:34.019> as<00:03:34.140> you

disc I from the server so yeah as you

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.750 
disc I from the server so yeah as you
can<00:03:34.380> see<00:03:34.500> right<00:03:34.530> there<00:03:34.829> it<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.130> one<00:03:35.400> point<00:03:35.640> two
