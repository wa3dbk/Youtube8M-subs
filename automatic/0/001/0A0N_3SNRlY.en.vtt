00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.910
 like lingonberry juice and why it is needed 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.820
 drink how it affects our body 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.920
 The first time I tried was 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.080
 heat me there is more than 37 and 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.910
 no pills and thought what's important 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.740
 drink the crawler marsik because i 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.619
 I know that he has antipyretic 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.750
 property and really guys papillon 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.019
 will be one two times a day I do not remember and 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.640
 very quickly I came again ok 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.829
 consistency temperature decreased 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.309
 all beginner signs 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.460
 colds of his typical time y they came 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.090
 if they feel it became good and so far I 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.320
 I regularly drink such a badger, I will show you how 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.510
 do it as I drink regularly a little 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.610
 temperature a little bit i just feel 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.860
 some kind of excitement that I suddenly can 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.379
 get sick or blown me there and i 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.870
 I think were just in case drank Morsik 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.640
 and indeed the condition is improving and 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.329
 It does not give this one exactly morsik 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.280
 get sick 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.500
 and then I started to just drink and time 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.210
 in front just because he didn't like 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.299
 and they can feel very good 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.880
 and here let us show you how you are 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.280
 cook I usually make lingonberry 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.170
 juice in such a big mug but you can 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.619
 do in the ordinary which you have me 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.619
 like to do more and you can take 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.420
 lingonberries or cranberries and lingonberries just 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.460
 could i love myself more from actually 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.500
 cranberries help the same 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.990
 properties and pour that one as 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.570
 like at the power per Detinets 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.270
 third can help him on the corolus plan 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.940
 buildings and lingonberry she sour 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.759
 so I used to add a spoonful of sugar 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.920
 or now bought a dark agave syrup 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.149
 which have low glycemic 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.009
 an index which means that the sugar level in 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.289
 blood rises very slowly well as 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.539
 would need passed here therefore 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.450
 I present sweetness as she serves me 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.929
 as an alternative to sugar so well steamed 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.459
 spoons add do not recommend adding honey 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.500
 lingonberry because honey we raise 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.640
 on the contrary, the temperature of the browser decreases and 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.810
 all this is poured just boiling water and cook 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.310
 first flooding and about here by 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.780
 berries to so how do we use 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.100
 they must be frozen a little bit 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.680
 so unfrozen 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.220
 and when they literally have a couple of seconds about 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.310
 swam 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.890
 and heel we start so on the wall 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:35.880
 take off very carefully because they 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:41.239
 sometimes splashing and bright splashes therefore 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.239
 kurana so we need to stretch all the berries 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.010
 all how we finished 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:52.040
 knead our berries we just add 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:56.480
 vodichku the hot 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.480
 all names just need to mix 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.930
 all and you can drink but due to the fact that 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.640
 our berries were cold and water 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.940
 hot it turns out just like that 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.220
 average warm temperatures and you can already 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.379
 Immediately it is convenient to wait for Beijing like this 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.260
 you can simply cook the morsik and drink 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.849
 when you have some first signs 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.310
 illness temperature or just what 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.840
 malaise well, just advise 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.400

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.209
