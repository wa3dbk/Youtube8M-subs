00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
I'm over here and what I do is I just

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.609 
I'm over here and what I do is I just
drown<00:01:30.930> myself<00:01:32.299> repeatedly<00:01:33.299> until<00:01:34.200> I

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
drown myself repeatedly until I

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.429 
drown myself repeatedly until I
eventually<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.490> zero<00:01:35.700> studs<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:37.229> takes

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
eventually have zero studs and it takes

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.620 
eventually have zero studs and it takes
forever<00:01:37.680> because<00:01:38.369> every<00:01:39.240> time<00:01:39.420> you're<00:01:39.540> gonna

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
forever because every time you're gonna

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.990 
forever because every time you're gonna
pick<00:01:39.930> up<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.170> few<00:01:40.380> studs<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.670> you're<00:01:41.880> not

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
pick up a few studs so you're not

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.550 
pick up a few studs so you're not
actually<00:01:42.180> losing<00:01:42.780> all<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:42.960> them<00:01:43.170> every<00:01:43.380> time

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
actually losing all of them every time

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.130 
actually losing all of them every time
but<00:01:43.860> eventually<00:01:44.540> after<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.600> do<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:45.930> for

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
but eventually after you do this for

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.010 
but eventually after you do this for
like<00:01:46.259> ten<00:01:46.770> hours<00:01:47.240> you're<00:01:48.240> going<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.630> lose<00:01:48.810> all

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
like ten hours you're going to lose all

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.999 
like ten hours you're going to lose all
your<00:01:49.110> studs<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:51.320> hop<00:01:52.320> back<00:01:52.350> up<00:01:52.680> here<00:01:52.920> and
