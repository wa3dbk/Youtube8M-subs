00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:09.120
 Hello dear friends with you by God 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.070
 and start with the fact that this is the fifth 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.019
 Attempt to shoot this video as were 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.440
 various problems and hopefully this time 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.630
 nothing will happen today we have a review 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.020
 mouse photo 7 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.609
 Yes, and I have again a new mouse 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.550
 so lucky for a year and a half 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.779
 me it will be 5 mouse here such 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.810
 lucky constantly some problems 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.780
 happens in lucky course in 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.290
 quotes, and so let's unpack it I 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.000
 just packaged back packing it 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.340
 there were various problems recorded already 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.219
 video but again I noticed that not 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.940
 hooked up microphone microphone 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.770
 it happens and so this mouse is very similar to 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.770
 my here is this mouse which I had 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.090
 which bought about a year ago and and 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.840
 video review you can find on the channel 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:04.110
 this mouse is 750 bk 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.760
 it costs a little more than a mouse 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.580
 which on which is going today 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.020
 she me understand she me like you already 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.549
 I could not guess Neustroeva 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.670
 arranged a few moments 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.860
 what I was sharing video operating experience 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.280
 this mouse which by the way in 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.720
 comments a lot of bathert well not 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.270
 it's always like that if you criticize 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.729
 some product did not suit me 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.100
 coated as she started to get off 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.170
 very active after half a year 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.540
 use does not like the fact that here 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.280
 This button did not start triggering 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.320
 first time and did not like the fact that 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.399
 my hand which is small enough 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.689
 it's too big because when 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.430
 I use a computer and basically I 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.250
 convenient enough but to get to 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.770
 ring I have to intercept that is 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.950
 here is such a movement my she does not 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.640
 arranged and but after used this mouse 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.100
 but trouble happened to her 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.960
 jump the cursor that is for example i 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.970
 I use a computer and 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.209
 sometimes the speed of the cursor can just like that 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.090
 jump on the floor screen and it's nothing 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.920
 does not depend on how I understood, I don't know, maybe 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.540
 be there are some certain 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.900
 certain factors that make 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.720
 him 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.560
 but I personally did not notice these and 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.200
 So here is such a box, but here everything 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.360
 in English that is, it is budget 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.640
 gaming mouse is all in English 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.560
 so see no particular meaning not 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.750
 narrate 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.750
 let's proceed to unpacking 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.500
 open the box here on the links 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.280
 Here are such as say platforms like 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:54.540
 triangles 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:57.080
 let's get them out and everything in the box 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.290
 nothing else is empty 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:05.840
 so here we have the muscles written here 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:10.140
 8x report raid yuzbi full speed and 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.829
 here we have the mouse itself stuck here 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.570
 we have such an ass that fixes and 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:22.739
 holds the mouse wire down here 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:26.180
 any rubbish such as some 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.650
 a piece of paper and I understand that I donâ€™t know what 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.290
 it says bullshit that you 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.670
 no benefit will bring replaceable legs 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.850
 oscar driver disk using 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.910
 whom you can write different 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.570
 macros for example on mouse data 7 in general 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.890
 on any mouse exe and quick start guide 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.320
 user 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.850
 gaming mice of this xin series which 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:56.280
 exactly the same for all mice 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.709
 but I see no reason to show anything like that 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.609
 there is no interesting let's go 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:05.590
 to the mouse itself this mouse we have autocheck 7 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:08.599
 710 m to 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:12.769
 small mouse that is let's compare 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:17.930
 by the size of the s750 bull and you already see 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:21.079
 how they have a huge difference in my hand 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.350
 small enough to me 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.770
 and in my opinion I watch enough 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.870
 with a small hand, it was very close 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.169
 would we be my fingers there for design 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:36.500
 centimeter big was no longer really 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.870
 convenient to use but suitable for now 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.660
 for later it can be wide when 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.639
 grow up and yet a teenager may be 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.580
 when I grow up with my hands will be 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.870
 uncomfortable let's compare it in size 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.729
 just want to show it 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.690
 Dimensions, that is, this is iphone5 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.110
 branded case 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:58.330
 apple well then there it is 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:06.560
 even less an iPhone 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:09.200
 ipad mini well, so does the mouse 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.070
 has all the functions that 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.110
 possesses and and here it is like a girlfriend 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.639
 You can tell all the instructions that is 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.479
 it is not cut down despite the fact that 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:22.760
 she is small 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:25.639
 there are buttons back forward there are two 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:29.120
 the main buttons are of course the scroll wheel and 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:33.080
 here it is pressed on the wheel so 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.150
 there is a button like a triple click on 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.419
 translates to sends three shots to 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:42.110
 games without a cursor shift and button 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:44.120
 switch dipyai cover me with her 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.639
 here is just plastic and that of course 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:50.180
 plus since the cover with the pattern she 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:53.270
 actively active will not say 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.500
 about such coverage is also a plus 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.250
 what lead her 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.590
 rubber well for me personally + for 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.980
 some it may be 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.410
 and minus the wire she has 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.730
 as you see the rubber is not tissue 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:12.110
 braid like my previous mouse and all 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.080
 because she's braided in general 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.780
 does not bend clings to the cross and 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.110
 it becomes very very uncomfortable here 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.900
 such a mouse will be used if 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:25.060
 I want to share some of her 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.760
 features from its operating experience 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.740
 maybe even take a video about and experience 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.200
 exploitation as I did with this 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:38.360
 with the mouse you can find on my channel if 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:40.880
 you might be interested 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.960
 sometime video and share it 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:49.670
 features and may be disadvantages 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:51.560
 but I do not promise as it may not be 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:55.460
 reason to shoot her video 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:58.840
 I promise nothing and so here such 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:04.690
 the mouse and here is the check 7 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:07.640
 710 m to the principle I will use 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:10.010
 maybe the future will tell about it yet 

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.040
 anything but this is our video 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.450
