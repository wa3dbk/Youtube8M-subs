the<00:01:05.489> Assembly<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.240> turnbuckles<00:01:06.750> was<00:01:06.900> done

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the Assembly of the turnbuckles was done

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.590 
the Assembly of the turnbuckles was done
in<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.350> last<00:01:07.560> episode<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.330> one<00:01:09.540> we

in the last episode but on this one we
actually<00:01:10.080> installed<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.979> turnbuckles<00:01:11.549> so

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
actually installed the turnbuckles so

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.210 
actually installed the turnbuckles so
got<00:01:12.360> all<00:01:12.540> four<00:01:12.810> turnbuckles<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.560> there<00:01:13.799> we

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220

steering assembly installed the new
high-tech<00:01:20.310> servo<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.240> then<00:01:21.780> also<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.229> top

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
high-tech servo and then also the top

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.200 
high-tech servo and then also the top
plate<00:01:22.740> went<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.070> with<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.700> little<00:01:23.850> center

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
plate went in with the little center

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.740 
plate went in with the little center
pulley<00:01:24.509> right<00:01:24.780> there<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:26.270> pretty<00:01:27.270> much<00:01:27.509> this

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
pulley right there so pretty much this

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.240 
pulley right there so pretty much this
car<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.080> really<00:01:28.409> coming<00:01:28.860> together

thing<00:02:19.790> on<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.510> flip<00:02:20.720> side<00:02:20.750> right<00:02:21.080> here<00:02:21.350> let's

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
thing on the flip side right here let's

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.920 
thing on the flip side right here let's
check<00:02:21.980> this<00:02:22.160> out<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:23.270> we're<00:02:23.510> gonna<00:02:23.600> look<00:02:23.810> at

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
check this out and we're gonna look at

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.740 
check this out and we're gonna look at
7.4<00:02:24.830> volt<00:02:25.070> point<00:02:25.580> zero<00:02:25.820> seven<00:02:26.210> seconds<00:02:26.630> which

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
7.4 volt point zero seven seconds which

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.770 
7.4 volt point zero seven seconds which
is<00:02:26.780> damn<00:02:27.350> fast<00:02:27.770> and<00:02:28.100> then<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:29.030> hundred<00:02:29.690> and

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
is damn fast and then a hundred and

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.470 
is damn fast and then a hundred and
eighty<00:02:29.960> one<00:02:30.350> ounce<00:02:31.220> inches<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.910> torque<00:02:32.240> so

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
eighty one ounce inches of torque so

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.590 
eighty one ounce inches of torque so
it's<00:02:32.990> gonna<00:02:33.110> be<00:02:33.260> plenty<00:02:33.650> for<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:34.040> particular

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
it's gonna be plenty for this particular

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.680 
it's gonna be plenty for this particular

team Durango for doing this one so the

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.110 
team Durango for doing this one so the
first<00:03:33.290> step<00:03:33.500> here<00:03:33.530> on<00:03:34.010> when<00:03:34.430> I<00:03:34.459> started<00:03:34.550> doing

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
first step here on when I started doing

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.150 
first step here on when I started doing
build<00:03:35.510> update<00:03:35.750> number<00:03:35.959> two<00:03:36.140> was<00:03:36.860> putting

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
build update number two was putting

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.660 
build update number two was putting
together<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.760> CDs<00:03:38.180> now<00:03:38.510> one<00:03:39.500> kind<00:03:39.890> of<00:03:40.040> not<00:03:40.640> a

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
together the CDs now one kind of not a

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.310 
together the CDs now one kind of not a
negative<00:03:41.300> but<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:43.239> the<00:03:44.239> part<00:03:44.570> concept<00:03:45.140> is

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
negative but the the part concept is

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.560 
negative but the the part concept is
awesome<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:46.100> what<00:03:46.370> it<00:03:46.459> uses<00:03:46.850> is<00:03:47.060> this<00:03:47.239> kind<00:03:47.510> of

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
awesome and what it uses is this kind of

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.990 
awesome and what it uses is this kind of
little<00:03:48.910> for<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.030> front<00:03:51.070> CV<00:03:52.070> DS<00:03:52.190> it<00:03:52.730> actually

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
little for the front CV DS it actually

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.360 
little for the front CV DS it actually
uses<00:03:53.150> this<00:03:53.450> double-jointed<00:03:54.200> union<00:03:55.190> right

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
uses this double-jointed union right

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.940 
uses this double-jointed union right
here<00:03:55.610> so<00:03:55.880> you<00:03:56.330> have<00:03:56.360> a<00:03:56.540> pivot<00:03:56.870> point<00:03:56.900> at<00:03:57.320> the

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
here so you have a pivot point at the

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.670 
here so you have a pivot point at the
stub<00:03:58.610> axle<00:03:58.760> you<00:03:59.480> also<00:03:59.630> have<00:03:59.780> a<00:03:59.870> pivot<00:04:00.080> point<00:04:00.200> at

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
stub axle you also have a pivot point at

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.570 
stub axle you also have a pivot point at
this<00:04:01.070> cvd<00:04:01.550> so<00:04:02.320> really<00:04:03.320> cool<00:04:03.530> design<00:04:03.860> it<00:04:04.310> took

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
this cvd so really cool design it took

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.820 
this cvd so really cool design it took
me<00:04:04.760> a<00:04:04.790> while<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.209> get<00:04:05.750> this<00:04:05.900> thing<00:04:06.140> all<00:04:06.320> seated

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
me a while to get this thing all seated

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.530 
me a while to get this thing all seated
in<00:04:06.980> to<00:04:07.580> where<00:04:07.700> everything<00:04:08.180> was<00:04:08.330> moving

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
in to where everything was moving

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.720 
in to where everything was moving
fluidly<00:04:09.110> so<00:04:09.500> make<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.070> note<00:04:10.160> of<00:04:10.340> that<00:04:10.430> when

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
fluidly so make a note of that when

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.100 
fluidly so make a note of that when
you're<00:04:10.880> when<00:04:11.120> you're<00:04:11.150> doing<00:04:11.270> it<00:04:11.690> it's<00:04:11.870> kind<00:04:12.080> of

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
you're when you're doing it it's kind of

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.630 
you're when you're doing it it's kind of
hard<00:04:12.380> to<00:04:12.440> get<00:04:12.620> these<00:04:12.709> little<00:04:13.010> set<00:04:13.160> screws<00:04:13.489> in

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
hard to get these little set screws in

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.659 
hard to get these little set screws in
here<00:04:13.970> but<00:04:14.840> once<00:04:14.989> you<00:04:15.080> get<00:04:15.290> it<00:04:15.440> in<00:04:15.709> it'll

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
here but once you get it in it'll

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.310 
here but once you get it in it'll
probably<00:04:16.850> take<00:04:17.090> you<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.239> while<00:04:17.510> took<00:04:18.140> me<00:04:18.290> a

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
probably take you a while took me a

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.250 
probably take you a while took me a
while<00:04:18.560> so<00:04:18.919> I've<00:04:19.730> probably<00:04:19.940> spent<00:04:20.270> a<00:04:20.419> good<00:04:20.660> half

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
while so I've probably spent a good half

that<00:06:18.770> I've<00:06:18.919> seen<00:06:19.190> they're<00:06:20.029> very<00:06:20.419> tight<00:06:20.719> going

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
that I've seen they're very tight going

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.899 
that I've seen they're very tight going
on<00:06:21.199> but<00:06:21.469> once<00:06:21.680> they're<00:06:21.889> on<00:06:21.919> they<00:06:22.310> got<00:06:22.460> plenty

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:22.909 
on but once they're on they got plenty

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:25.059 
on but once they're on they got plenty
of<00:06:23.120> movement<00:06:23.300> in<00:06:23.539> there<00:06:23.719> but<00:06:24.560> nothing<00:06:24.770> no

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:25.069 
of movement in there but nothing no

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:27.279 
of movement in there but nothing no
wiggle<00:06:25.370> room<00:06:25.400> so<00:06:25.789> also<00:06:26.659> got<00:06:26.840> the<00:06:26.960> cutout<00:06:27.259> right

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:27.289 
wiggle room so also got the cutout right

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:28.930 
wiggle room so also got the cutout right
there<00:06:27.620> so<00:06:27.889> if<00:06:28.129> you<00:06:28.250> need<00:06:28.430> to<00:06:28.580> you<00:06:28.699> can<00:06:28.819> actually

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
there so if you need to you can actually

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.050 
there so if you need to you can actually
just<00:06:29.949> disassemble<00:06:30.949> just<00:06:31.159> the<00:06:31.340> ball<00:06:31.819> stead

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
just disassemble just the ball stead

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.809 
just disassemble just the ball stead
instead<00:06:32.449> of<00:06:32.539> having<00:06:32.719> to<00:06:32.900> pop<00:06:33.310> these<00:06:34.310> ball<00:06:34.580> cups

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:34.819 
instead of having to pop these ball cups

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:38.980 
instead of having to pop these ball cups
out<00:06:34.940> so<00:06:35.569> pretty<00:06:36.259> cool<00:06:36.529> design<00:06:37.779> very<00:06:38.779> nice

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
out so pretty cool design very nice

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.560 
out so pretty cool design very nice
design<00:06:39.469> inside<00:06:39.949> here<00:06:40.339> as<00:06:40.460> far<00:06:40.639> as<00:06:40.699> the

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 
design inside here as far as the

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:42.940 
design inside here as far as the
tensioner<00:06:42.080> you<00:06:42.200> can<00:06:42.320> kind<00:06:42.470> of<00:06:42.500> see<00:06:42.650> little

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
tensioner you can kind of see little

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.370 
tensioner you can kind of see little
clicks<00:06:43.250> right<00:06:43.430> there<00:06:43.660> if<00:06:44.660> your<00:06:44.810> belt<00:06:44.990> happens

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:46.670 
to start stretching out you can actually

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.880 
to start stretching out you can actually
just<00:06:47.030> you<00:06:47.570> know<00:06:47.690> a<00:06:47.720> couple<00:06:47.990> screw<00:06:48.350> points<00:06:48.740> and

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
just you know a couple screw points and

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.490 
just you know a couple screw points and
you're<00:06:49.040> moving<00:06:49.970> your<00:06:50.090> belt<00:06:50.300> around<00:06:50.630> at<00:06:51.230> least

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500

prepped all of the exterior edges of all

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.250 
prepped all of the exterior edges of all
of<00:07:16.100> the<00:07:16.310> carbon<00:07:16.760> including<00:07:17.660> the<00:07:17.780> top<00:07:17.990> plate

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:18.260 
of the carbon including the top plate

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.750 
of the carbon including the top plate
went<00:07:18.590> ahead<00:07:18.650> and<00:07:18.920> did<00:07:19.010> all<00:07:19.250> of<00:07:19.280> those<00:07:19.520> edges

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:19.760 
went ahead and did all of those edges

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.000

right<00:07:20.120> there<00:07:20.270> with<00:07:20.450> some<00:07:20.630> CA<00:07:20.870> glue<00:07:21.110> and<00:07:21.500> you

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.010 
right there with some CA glue and you

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.530 
right there with some CA glue and you
can<00:07:22.160> check<00:07:22.340> out<00:07:22.550> build<00:07:22.820> up<00:07:22.940> date<00:07:23.090> number<00:07:23.240> one

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:23.540 
can check out build up date number one

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.420 
can check out build up date number one
for<00:07:23.780> the<00:07:23.930> specifics<00:07:24.530> on<00:07:24.680> how<00:07:24.800> I<00:07:24.830> did<00:07:24.980> that
