 I grew up quickly and a lot 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.690
 things taken over very early I believe 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.270

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.800

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.450
 at a given moment than the last time 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:58.110

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.750

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.500
 yes then you still have a cell and you separate it 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.070
 maybe even worse than for a ten 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.500
 we still specify to live 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.620
 yes back to scratch r this is just 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.220
 not just wanted to quit 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:47.760
 and then tap google 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.930
 settle to come when I also have an ounce 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.110

00:02:48.930 --> 00:03:00.810
 so yes i come a prince and i still saw 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:03.930
 not how bad it actually was until 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.730
 I specified mint according to conversation 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:12.750
 you can get there the psychiatrist and and 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:18.860
 including those groups saw was doing media 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.860
 was and so and then when then I realized 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.140
 well my very simple posted how bad 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.140
 it was 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.960
 and the fabric that believe so well 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.780
 keep hidden 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:49.000
 I think they would be the one but yes 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.000
 just don't hurt or anything 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.470
 yes dear you will never hit so high 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.730
 he will laughed and and you can't 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.320
 may say yes it is actually good 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.470
 I've done a lot 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:09.020
 just nice on that you don't have to 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:15.110
 really doing that constant light and yet 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:19.430
 now I have to go back in time and me 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:21.200
 really just the someone who says the costs 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.930
 whole meal if not in that way 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.480
 garden otherwise you know I could just do it 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:31.670
 tell yeah I'm actually going to that man 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.160
 it really all alone I done 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.440
 give up windlass then you are ready my white one 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.620
 you will receive a certificate and treatment 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.770
 then I was so terribly proud of that 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.890
 she late then got very well too 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.419
 I have no notion of this is no longer possible 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.120
 people dare not have that 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:53.000
 you noticed that everyone is mine 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:58.160
 needed psychological help 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.160
 yes only talisha indeed i really like 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.830
 she did not know her father 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.230
 so you don't really have to pay attention to that 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.570
 to spend and 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.980
 well that is so horribly wrong 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.250
 been 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.500
 it also really shaped me 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.920
 and especially that I asked myself fairly early 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.430
 have to learn 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.170
 and just had to start again 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.970
 just 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.570
 I think that that is also just strong 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.570
 has made 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.220
 Oh 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.969
 no 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:44.620
 No
