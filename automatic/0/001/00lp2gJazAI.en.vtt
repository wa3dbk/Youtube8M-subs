00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870

 I'm going hannes krÃ¶ger today 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.020
 Many people ask for the bad banker 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.580
 what is the ba drinking? 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.940
 and actually eating so bad now 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.670
 say the male and then I'll show you 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.160
 one more fix we get what's in here 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.180
 bad banks will be so first of all 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:29.910
 what is the batteries 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:33.930
 if you please under the pole if you 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.190
 in the squat then goes down with quasi 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.989
 the back 1 round so where I with the 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.120
 dosed correctly completely and law 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.820
 that means you already see here like here 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.300
 the vertebrae come out again 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.280
 backstage here come the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.100
 vertebrae out that means he has 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.079
 no decent loose no single 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.989
 rohkost he now with the doctor 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.579
 First comes up even further on with 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.750
 marsch because so marsch and the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.100
 Upper body is bent so far forward 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.350
 he is now almost up again 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.869
 lives in the knee bend in the straight to 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.729
 comes that is almost super worm 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.590
 that is the bettringer you can do that 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.930
 beard ring once in a normal 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.930
 squat fast demonstrate please 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.930
 as has just below the buttocks a 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.610
 rounded again with buttocks a rounded 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.650
 and then come up first and that 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.439
 upper body tilts too far over that 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.439
 is first that's just the times 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.439
 Batteries problem at the whole 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.140
 For one thing, history is just that 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.229
 that that the spine is down 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.659
 a rounded which is not a problem though 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.310
 you make one first yes we are to 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.170
 created to bend in the deep 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.880
 give and there is the spine 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.960
 flexible enough for that too 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.250
 that's no problem at all 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.659
 but if you weight the whole thing 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.380
 The whole game is changing 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.149
 Usually it is up to us 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.040
 90 degree angle approximately to here 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.570
 we would have come straight without problems 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.700
 back and then there are just people 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.200
 they come complete straight back 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.569
 story it down and engels people 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.410
 can not do this for example the 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.200
 means I could 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.170
 Although so wonderful and must here 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.700
 chill but thus a weight on the 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.150
 back is pretty shitty for the 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.240
 move 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.790
 There are also exceptions here 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.250
 you all know her any 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.050
 world-elite lifter otherwise what has with 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.590
 his back is rocking or weights 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.310
 do 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.410
 as a rule, people already have 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.480
 five or six started along the way 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.250
 you in the construction phase and in the 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.710
 growth phase are that means they have 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.360
 from the beginning this movement so there the 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.670
 means the whole bone and in the passive 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.760
 structures like bender and cartilage and 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.760
 yearn and 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.730
 this is what they have 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.980
 everyone is completely on this move 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.420
 tuned and are virtually in this 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.159
 direction and become strong 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.530
 because they are in this all the time 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.840
 already got weight 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.840
 but if you 're kind of involved now 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.459
 20 beginning 30 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.480
 At first I'm doing cross we find 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.859
 a bit weighty and squats 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.689
 and then you do that 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.739
 squat farmer that the 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:19.359
 most likely in one 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.200
 catastrophe may end today 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.540
 maybe not tomorrow but a few 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.590
 years that means he should be on everyone 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.909
 Make sure you always with 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.609
 straight back squats power works 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:32.799
 not with a mirror but works 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.689
 with the spot or film through and then 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.939
 look at how you squat 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:40.090
 makes only goes so deep down woe 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:42.040
 could stay straight and then 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.199
 works anna mobility that they lower 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.449
 come you can go wrong but 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:48.489
 But it is not absolutely necessary 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:50.519
 that they are much deeper than with the 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.449
 hips just so on knee height 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.699
 thighs paradise to ground 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:56.650
 you do not have to go deeper if you are 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.479
 not in the capable of being able to 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.739
 to do that motion yes 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:01.629
 So it is weightlifting me already 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.019
 I'm just getting into this movement 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.120
 purely 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:08.859
 that's about as deep as that 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.530
 but you do not have to do it that is 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.840
 if you only go down first and 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.489
 but then completes a round because it 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.099
 sure he had those batteries and 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.380
 endangered by that means that 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:22.720
 problem is actually one time that one 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.909
 round the back and the second one is 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.080
 but why even if you move straight 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:31.570
 one often sees that people 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.970
 Nevertheless, it is only one thing to come up that high 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.680
 geiler dan smith knows her from the 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:41.800
 beautiful girls in the dance here 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.370
 that means that we are our disadvantage 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.310
 the weak thigh muscles 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.409
 to make us advantage that we 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.250
 the stronger ashram could do it 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:57.190
 try hit raced with your delusional rm 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.659
 in squats how many pretty it 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.740
 managed to guarantee you will be so 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:04.660
 to be ten pieces 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.120
 probably ten pieces with yours 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.550
 name squats and you will then 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.229
 these ten pieces are still working 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.430
 at least a second break up that 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.750
 the buttocks are called the whole time 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.729
 tense is easy because the opponent 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.139
 Buttock muscle has the strongest thing you do 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:23.979
 So you compare it in your body 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.509
 and if you are in the 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.180
 thigh muscles are too weak 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:30.669
 then that's exactly what happens 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.310
 here first without this here 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:36.849
 Significantly the weight comes up 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.319
 stretches her first thighs and 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.599
 Of course the back of the buttocks continues to stretch 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:42.340
 and then you come here from the 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.020
 Strong buttocks and come here again 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.509
 above 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.159
 That's why a beard is often a 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:50.800
 mistakes of people the weak 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:51.419
 thigh front weak quads 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.430
 to have 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.080
 that means not only as one 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.569
 round nissen bartling but also too 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.550
 that we come up with the ass 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:02.560
 even if the back is straight he is 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.060
 comes only with the ass is high 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.909
 because the thighs are too weak 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.139
 have to work from here that 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:09.789
 I already stretch here stretch 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:13.060
 stretch and the buttocks come here 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:15.190
 ok and if we want to make that clear 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.159
 we just do not have such a position in 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.139
 the coburg but want accordingly 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:21.610
 stay here and come up from here 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:21.880
 knee go back after shoulder 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.099
 behind 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:28.479
 but I want to scare myself here 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:31.840
 and that means failure steps bulgaria 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:33.280
 split briefly, a bulgarian spliss works 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.120
 Course and then step out to you 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.780
 dizzy 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:40.990
 then you want to be better with this 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.430
 bartling because you are exactly in one 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.880
 Failure step work in exactly the same 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.680
 here clearly the buttocks stretched but the 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.210
 works here completely in the route 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.009
 push up here push up 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:55.449
 hochtouren that means exactly where you the 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:57.520
 most power transmission has here 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:58.060
 where most of the power needs to get high 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.280
 get 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.680
 because you work out super 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.630
 disappear down and exactly in that 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.310
 area works great with the out 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.370
 fresh smell to come or do 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:12.400
 bulgaria's press corps are the same 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:14.020
 again on stretching that is to say 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.660
 get rid of the beard 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:19.690
 works in a deep before her 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.610
 back so is that she just stays and 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.020
 second strengthens and strong 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.849
 thighs front 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:28.300
 You can do that until you 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:30.340
 the agility is published 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.819
 It's also a great exercise 

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:36.940
 strengthen the thighs on the front 

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:38.979
 That was it to strengthen the topic of patrick 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.770
 could we be able to get rid of him and what 

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:44.139
 at all, jack is the other videos 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.490
 shows the video again, all people 

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:49.560
 should know what is actually bringing 

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.560
 and subscribe no skin in
