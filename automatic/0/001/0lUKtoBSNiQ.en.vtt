00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.350
 she is on motorcycle 50 en today 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.870
 we find ourselves for boxing between 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.210
 various of what I received so for 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.599
 up 70 so I'll make a 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.789
 little overview and we will look 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.260
 his room by room 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.430
 then I would say to you what I have 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.539
 taken it will be later I took two 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.980
 types 70 so the room r as we sell 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:31.080
 so this is the little 70's here we are 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.669
 see there this one so I have not yet 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.809
 open I left in the packaging for 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.300
 moment because I lie all this this 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.440
 afternoon with all the stuff there 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.129
 inside I do not know if we have to 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.129
 very much 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.760
 so there's nobody here we see well and 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.899
 it's still a big big cylinder 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.680
 so we can see that it's a good choice 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:57.239
 while here with the normal hawk one 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:01:02.510
 finally all we need we see well in 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:05.790
 loop to the quiet little street is here 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.030
 that's it and beat all the joints between the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.869
 all join them share between special 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.450
 when a cylinder could have gone 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.200
 see on forums that think that the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.360
 people thought of ski 70 ben 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.939
 apparently people are really very 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.229
 very happy for for acceleration 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.580
 because he's apparently really a 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.540
 very very good acceleration so that you 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.240
 please a lot but question speed of 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.710
 tip take 1,610 what good these 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.479
 goods are distanced but that's it for 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.079
 finally for a title 70 is not no 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.759
 more huge we will say but that's me 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.170
 go 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.549
 especially with the round was all 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.579
 the floors but I will win what then 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.490
 that's pretty cool and besides he says 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.950
 no bullshit I got for 354 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.860
 euros with the term he does with the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.469
 potting purpose for shots of 8.21 the 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.689
 here are two referees 21 is a friend of mine 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:04.829
 it's a friend of mine who told me 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.240
 sold 55 euros instead of 80 and ben on 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.680
 can we say that it is expensive for 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.970
 an original derby so I know where it 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.080
 just 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.480
 I know it does not pay 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.920
 finally this post there he is really pro 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.760
 very far from everything mechanical 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:22.740
 motorcycle I really trust 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:27.300
 leaves to sing a carburetor of Dall'Orto 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.370
 21 mm 9 it's worth around 80 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.780
 euros 55 euros I thought it was 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.220
 still it's not too bad what it is 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.260
 really here it is rather a good vintage 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.240
 then we'll go to the pot so I 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.540
 you told me I was not excused 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.010
 me that I hesitated between the between the gdm 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.040
 said what already between the way has benefited 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.470
 barrel that was everything and ben berka lcr 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.120
 yes just like that and yesterday club room 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.070
 at I ended up being more reasonable 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.740
 take the r it was going to do it but I 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.090
 would like to talk about an artery dough alba 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:01.470
 and age and leicester face the O 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.610
 there is a very beautiful aluminum cartridge 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.230
 You really have enough stuff 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.480
 experiencing it is really a very good 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.620
 on it and it's cool it's an island 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.360
 it's really very very good 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.209
 quality but the fact that it is not 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.860
 homologated bah you did that it's 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.780
 really not proud for for stuff from 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.459
 this quality frankly if we look 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.100
 everything that is soldering and everything about 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.000
 skins that's really stuff got 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.769
 really very beautiful 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.400
 sold out destroyed it's really very 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.560
 very well he notes with the most for the 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.930
 small and serves here that's it and that's it 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.250
 really beautiful 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.080
 and so I ended up taking the passage 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.230
 the passage to because there is no 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.660
 a long time I realized that 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.340
 I had a little boots under a 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.950
 pop attal bac I had to take on a 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.170
 donkey and during the composite or on 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.430
 on a sidewalk 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.600
 finally taking a sidewalk a little too much 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.440
 quickly realize and I 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.930
 said like the epo at 70 cm suffer but 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.209
 his biggest down I still have more 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.870
 chance to take something so that would have 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.730
 was really a shame to spoil my pot 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.070
 the balls even new so why 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.959
 is suddenly shared obadia found 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.770
 that there is really no risk that the 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.940
 paste bimbo so because ben because 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.770
 what does a transition to simply 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.040
 and he has not he has no contact with 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.470
 the ground he did not here anything there 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.730
 no risk need to take by the 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.990
 patrouille de france about that with 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.669
 pathologies is that it does in 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.480
 below the saddle is usually when 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.950
 we are below the quiet head where 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.360
 after one thing that will have to be done 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.500
 spoil my passengers who do not go 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.770
 the least when they try to catch 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.479
 a frieze because his head has arrived 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.419
 with one of the passengers when I was 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.800
 of origin is currently from pasta to 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.970
 the water of the blow there was bryan well 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.640
 that it was well burnt hand so 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:50.720
 it was that left him room in the hall 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:54.320
 to suffer finally good here I am going to do 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.620
 a little video a boxing is 177 to 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.990
 the outside and airbus have lost because seen 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.650
 two clear occasions indicated m thabeet 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.270
 I'm going to go to the end of my sentence 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.270

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.640
 aerated video and then I'll do a 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.900
 small camera embedded by time 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.780
