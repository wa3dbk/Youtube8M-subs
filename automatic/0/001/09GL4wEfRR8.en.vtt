stuff<00:04:06.229> not<00:04:07.229> random<00:04:07.590> stuff<00:04:07.829> but<00:04:08.040> what<00:04:08.340> like<00:04:08.729> the

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
stuff not random stuff but what like the

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.659 
stuff not random stuff but what like the
title<00:04:09.269> of<00:04:09.389> your<00:04:09.620> video<00:04:10.620> and<00:04:10.859> it<00:04:11.099> does<00:04:11.280> that<00:04:11.489> and

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
title of your video and it does that and

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:15.619 
title of your video and it does that and
your<00:04:12.269> bitrate<00:04:12.720> of<00:04:13.970> basically<00:04:14.970> chooses<00:04:15.479> the

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
your bitrate of basically chooses the

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.029 
your bitrate of basically chooses the
rate<00:04:15.810> of<00:04:16.340> your<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:18.359> upload<00:04:19.139> speed<00:04:19.169> so<00:04:20.009> the

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
rate of your the upload speed so the

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.909 
rate of your the upload speed so the
live<00:04:20.549> streaming<00:04:20.940> speed<00:04:21.409> make<00:04:22.409> sure<00:04:22.440> it's<00:04:22.800> not

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
live streaming speed make sure it's not

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.010 
live streaming speed make sure it's not
too<00:04:23.190> high<00:04:23.400> that<00:04:23.700> it's<00:04:23.849> not<00:04:24.060> if<00:04:24.330> your<00:04:24.659> internet

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
too high that it's not if your internet

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.010 
too high that it's not if your internet
connection<00:04:25.050> it<00:04:25.590> is<00:04:25.800> a<00:04:26.370> pretty<00:04:27.210> bad<00:04:27.450> you<00:04:27.659> want

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
connection it is a pretty bad you want

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.830 
connection it is a pretty bad you want
like<00:04:28.139> really<00:04:28.440> low<00:04:28.740> but<00:04:29.129> if<00:04:29.280> it's<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:29.729> good<00:04:30.569> then

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
like really low but if it's a good then

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.869 
like really low but if it's a good then
you<00:04:30.930> probably<00:04:31.169> want<00:04:31.500> it<00:04:31.590> at<00:04:31.830> least<00:04:32.190> one

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:32.879 
you probably want it at least one

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:36.260 
you probably want it at least one
megabyte<00:04:33.840> per<00:04:34.050> second<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:34.590> then<00:04:35.190> you<00:04:36.120> can

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
megabyte per second and then you can

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.820 
megabyte per second and then you can
also<00:04:36.419> still<00:04:36.960> record<00:04:37.560> um<00:04:38.479> just<00:04:39.479> record<00:04:40.319> it<00:04:40.409> by

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
also still record um just record it by

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.860 
also still record um just record it by
itself<00:04:41.190> so<00:04:41.669> you<00:04:41.729> can<00:04:41.940> upload<00:04:42.150> it<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.509> youtube

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
itself so you can upload it to youtube

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.990 
itself so you can upload it to youtube
later<00:04:43.110> during<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:44.009> live<00:04:44.190> stream<00:04:44.520> it<00:04:44.699> doesn't

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
later during the live stream it doesn't

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.899 
later during the live stream it doesn't
really<00:04:45.090> matter<00:04:45.330> and<00:04:45.720> of<00:04:46.560> course<00:04:46.699> there's<00:04:47.699> down

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:47.909 
really matter and of course there's down

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:49.460 
really matter and of course there's down
here<00:04:48.270> where<00:04:48.479> you<00:04:48.569> make<00:04:48.810> the<00:04:48.930> title<00:04:49.259> all<00:04:49.319> your

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
here where you make the title all your

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.499 
here where you make the title all your
