00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:05.040
 in this first generation of Iraq and conditions we will study 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.229
 the next problem 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:10.519
 the equation of the line 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:11.330
 the x 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.899
 - in the poly - 2 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:15.529
 equal to zero 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:17.390
 continent in everything 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.919
 - two 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.669
 the question 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.470
 the value of g 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.999
 we do not know yet what is the equation of the straight 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.730
 however we have a strong contact of what it means 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.550
 because a point 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.670
 but that never 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.770
 to a graphic 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.840
 so 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.520
 that if the -2 we replace it 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.040
 the athletic 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.040
 and before 8 will replace moss the indigo 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.010
 this value 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.890
 should give in effect 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.000
 that is, at this point I should meet 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.800
 this relationship 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.530
 here raises 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.620
 chopped then 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.950
 - two in the x 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.950
 - two 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.100
 mx the one that appears here 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.190
 Kiev to the A-8 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.770
 - two 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.170
 All this 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.170
 It does not matter 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.340
 this is a minus eight m that we can pass to the other side 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.890
 as 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.460
 8m 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.510
 - 2-2 this is 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.490
 - 4 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.750
 can we come in 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.509
 He led group 8 m is equality 2-4 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.560
 match with eight 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.480
 and these simplified monterÃ­a - 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.990
 merino 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.660
 that is, n 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.660
 it's equality - mexico 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.030
 and with this we have finished our first application
