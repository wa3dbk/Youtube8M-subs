00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.679
 you usually had a terrible i just 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.479
 I never interviewed than Morocco 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:44.829
 over 5 why earlier 

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:46.870
 somewhere you usually write poetry is me when 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.659
 I thought where to shoot you I thought where you 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.350
 usually do it all here I write 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:53.260
 poems 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.289
 Well, I have no life I write poetry 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.229
 so strange because here 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:02.769
 for example this collection of small he me 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:05.619
 It turned out literally there for the year Alina 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:08.440
 Generally we will write anything, everything depends 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.360
 from my creative rise if around 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.890
 I am surrounded by interesting people 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:18.940
 if they are full of love and i start here like 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.850
 I read all the creatures of the spirit exhale here 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.060
 too there when i can break from 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.130
 the fact that it is a lot of where 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.580
 going on here you just sit you 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.619
 properly you wrote once there and 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.340
 this time I wrote a song 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.950
 cars really at the traffic lights 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.580
 just that i stop turning on 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:46.830
 emergency gang and frantically looking for a handle to 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.830
 quickly forget the unusual place where 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:57.420
 paper wrote up to 1 time wrote 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.420
 it was not difficult 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.909
 once wrote sheathed angel oyster mushroom it 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.070
 broke through and commits memory 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.979
 when memorizing the packages that are here in 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.020
 my head is like this 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.500
 I write sing for example I know this will be 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.680
 hit 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.340
 i'm here in general about the topic of men and women and 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:22.730
 or 2 can talk a lot about women 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:28.280
 I can spend hours on men smaller growth 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:31.069
 women they are more real 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.799
 although 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:38.859
 so few real women standing and 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:43.730
 in general it seems to me that men are 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:44.749
 die out because of these 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.689
 midshipmen 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:51.620
 for which the Decembrist like that 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:55.579
 I wanted to run, I don't know, drop everything and and 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.379
 not thinking about anything so few of them left 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:03.829
 and such units that if you suddenly 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:07.189
 find something real need for it 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:10.100
 holding on to just my love is missing her 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:13.700
 on many 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.600
 but I can not say that at all because 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.600
 what sometimes 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:26.840
 here I am separating all the same and when the most 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:26.840
 close and peacefully yes cost legends 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.850
 and the main thing is 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.320
 the line of faith itself in your own way 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.580
 with 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.370
 time to eat 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.370
 but only you 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.540
 as 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.900
 mute 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.900
 listen to 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:08.030
 I am a woman in all perceptions understand 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:13.960
 despite the fact that I was dressed to 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:19.200
 I never said how I always stay 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.200
