00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 unity3d 100 tease how to create 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.250
 games hello team for game 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.000
 free 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.679
 I am one of the free programmers 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.570
 sites and game free 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.620
 I want to show you a short video lesson 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.719
 unity 3d 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.050
 tournament I will tell you and for using this 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.850
 programs I will tell you how to build 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.519
 the player's light source plane is 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.550
 very happy very simple lesson and he 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.199
 oriented to beginners 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.420
 users for beginners who 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.000
 just run unity and don't know what's where 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.739
 click I will tell him how to use 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.460
 this program with a minimum of knowledge 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.680
 what can be done here and in general I will show 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.760
 how to create something but obviously if you 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.200
 see this lesson 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:56.430
 you probably didn't create anything yet 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:58.620
 so on let's start create 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.469
 ordinary plane which will serve 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.090
 for us, the floor is widely used 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.869
 game object with other cube just to 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.540
 create something 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.970
 use game of jack kreed others 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.420
 there is a particle system camera gui 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.150
 text smoke texture and crash 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.850
 also there is a directional light 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.159
 it is a source of light like the sun does not 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.330
 commented on the sun point light it 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.520
 light source in the form of a sphere and spotlight 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.130
 this direction oozes it also here 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.190
 there are geometric shapes cube sphere 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.220
 the target capsule the tara plane is also here 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.670
 you can make clothes class like 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.930
 the cloth 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.470
 imitates fabric audiorecord zones this you 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.840
 until you need randall 3 and wreath it too 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.190
 it is not necessary yet we then about this somehow 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.000
 let's tell let's create a cube and 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:02:00.420
 put it at the origin 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.310
 x0 y0 is taken but we do it in order 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.580
 to all of our objects 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.110
 you wondered in one place and will not 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.019
 They are not scattered around the scene for later 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.700
 did not have to collect them in a pile so 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.500
 slightly modified with 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.410
 Scale modifier here is also 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:23.640
 protection rotation and guf movement 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.420
 cancellation young man here and regarded along the x-axis 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.930
 on 100 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.349
 eric also left and 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.840
 and for it more accurate to put even on the table 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:37.250
 how would our floor be created and it got bigger 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.819
 looks like a plane what happens if we 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.739
 let's start the game now 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.150
 we will not actually see anything 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.629
 because we are looking for what they did here 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.969
 dark nothing nothing happens nothing 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:52.180
 let's create a light source of light 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:54.099
 so it was not so dark for this 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.290
 click game object create other's and 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.310
 choose point light we can play 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.930
 directional light 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.969
 well this is for more big prices for more 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.519
 for higher quality graphics so on 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:10.060
 then you can adjust the shadows as long as we 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:13.750
 enough he know here he give it too 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.560
 place the origin of the coordinates like this 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.599
 zeros a little you raise along the y axis 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.739
 taller well is it so as ours 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.799
 the plane is very big 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:27.120
 and light radius lighting is very small 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:32.049
 change it range change to 100 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.030
 there we can set up shadows here but those 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.859
 no web online is not supported here 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.379
 as if the standard light settings window 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:41.439
 for directional light light bathe 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.870
 so if you press like a from step then 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:45.430
 have it will not be supported 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.609
 written about navi directional light 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.310
 idol hedge informer you about the world so 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:55.090
 our home here can also change the type 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.239
 light color may be red blue 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:02.109
 Anyone here is the whole palette, depending on what you are 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:04.560
 want to achieve also we can swap 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.840
 light intensity 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:14.069
 contrast here and so put on 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:16.410
 standard 11 all in the general world we 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.859
 created let's run our game here 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.410
 as you can see it is more illuminated and here already 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.930
 more like our level here though 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.870
 something seen well, until there is nothing in 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.700
 us lit it is already good now 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.110
 let's create our own 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:37.380
 player in the standard set of unity3d us 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.930
 An example of standard and sites is given 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.050
 character controller here two 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.300
 as if the management is the goal of the songs 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.190
 controller and first person controller for 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.820
 games from the third person and for games from 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.970
 first person 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.760
 let's create a person controller we 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:57.979
 just drag it out of the price too 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.689
 steel panels go to it and 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:04.039
 raise 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:06.470
 that's how we raised now if we 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:11.870
 run our game 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:13.970
 we can already beat everything when 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.420
 this lesson is over thanks for your attention 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.420
 goodbye
