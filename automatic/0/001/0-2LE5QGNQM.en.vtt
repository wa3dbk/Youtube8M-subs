00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:08.429
 Are you thinking so much today about the kitchen? 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.269
 We are going to learn how to make souffle from 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.750
 codfish 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.750
 well of course 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.730
 if you leave everything more or less ready 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.000
 this recipe is easy to make 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.210
 big pot you throw olive oil and 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.449
 people throw potatoes gol 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.970
 the trick is to not let the crisp 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.680
 gilded africa can not stand a 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.300
 very important thing for the recipe 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.199
 for whatever recipe you've been making 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.820
 is to always try to cut the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.860
 same thickness 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.740
 because that's what you do not cut a 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.520
 little one great she does not cook by 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.220
 equal 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.830
 There you get a bite a thing. 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.940
 reduced and in the other a very crude thing 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.240
 And then it gets in the way. 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.119
 Let's play the onion, too. 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.470
 pull a little bit now that the onion has already 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.759
 the xoom pocinho 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.759
 we added olive the cod 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.520
 cod shredded people I made with 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.890
 this shredded cod 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.430
 When you buy the cod you have 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.140
 to pay it if you do it if you 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.259
 ask in the comments 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.630
 I only do one video about it showing 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.369
 as a cod is said to target but only to 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.890
 give a small explanation as said 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.680
 somebody that cod was already 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.579
 shredded each type of cod for 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.939
 example imposed are large averages 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.940
 it changes the time for you to anoint him 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:13.230
 That 's how you get cod 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.920
 if you spin it, you can salt it in six hours 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.370
 you pick it up it does not bowl with 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.720
 ice water and ice inside the refrigerator 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.450
 three hours later you remove the water and 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.900
 puts another ice water and returns 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.019
 for refrigerator you make that change 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.989
 you put and make change once in 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.150
 six hours your battalion already lawyer 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.879
 because he is 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.409
 it is cooled but if you ask 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.269

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.689

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.200
 This time, I hung up my fire and 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:58.260
 we take it by adding the white sauce 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.120

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.340

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.629

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.939
 You can not make a white sauce on 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.159
