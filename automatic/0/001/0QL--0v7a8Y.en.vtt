I'm<00:00:14.559> an<00:00:14.740> interventional<00:00:15.249> cardiologist<00:00:15.280> and

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.030 
I'm an interventional cardiologist and

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.580 
I'm an interventional cardiologist and
we<00:00:16.150> treat<00:00:16.660> patients<00:00:16.900> with<00:00:17.170> heart<00:00:17.470> problems

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
we treat patients with heart problems

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.999 
we treat patients with heart problems
without<00:00:18.429> doing<00:00:19.300> open-heart<00:00:19.599> surgery<00:00:20.170> we<00:00:20.349> put

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.009 
without doing open-heart surgery we put

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.130 
without doing open-heart surgery we put
little<00:00:21.130> tubes<00:00:21.490> and<00:00:21.759> arteries<00:00:22.179> and<00:00:22.420> veins<00:00:22.480> and

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
little tubes and arteries and veins and

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.810 
little tubes and arteries and veins and
pass<00:00:23.589> them<00:00:23.830> through<00:00:23.859> the<00:00:24.099> body<00:00:24.279> to<00:00:24.400> the<00:00:24.580> heart

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
pass them through the body to the heart

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.300 
pass them through the body to the heart
normally<00:00:25.570> when<00:00:25.869> people<00:00:25.900> have<00:00:26.320> severe<00:00:26.769> damage

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
normally when people have severe damage

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.099 
normally when people have severe damage
to<00:00:27.339> one<00:00:27.580> of<00:00:27.699> their<00:00:27.789> heart<00:00:27.939> valves<00:00:28.330> they<00:00:28.929> would

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
to one of their heart valves they would

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.710 
to one of their heart valves they would
have<00:00:30.099> to<00:00:30.310> think<00:00:30.699> about<00:00:30.910> having<00:00:31.060> open-heart

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
have to think about having open-heart

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.980 
have to think about having open-heart
surgery<00:00:32.140> which<00:00:32.320> is<00:00:32.470> a<00:00:32.500> pretty<00:00:32.770> big<00:00:32.950> procedure

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990 
surgery which is a pretty big procedure

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.620 
surgery which is a pretty big procedure
still<00:00:34.990> these<00:00:35.140> days<00:00:35.410> and<00:00:35.680> we<00:00:35.950> have<00:00:36.630> been

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
still these days and we have been

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.130 
still these days and we have been
involved<00:00:37.870> in<00:00:38.050> developing<00:00:38.200> a<00:00:38.860> way<00:00:39.490> of

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
involved in developing a way of

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.000 
involved in developing a way of
replacing<00:00:41.140> our<00:00:41.290> thoughts<00:00:41.530> without<00:00:41.740> doing

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
implantation and over the years we've

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.980 
implantation and over the years we've
you<00:01:06.550> know<00:01:06.580> developed<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.210> techniques<00:01:07.690> and

you know developed the techniques and

you know developed the techniques and
taught<00:01:08.530> many<00:01:08.800> other<00:01:08.980> groups<00:01:09.190> how<00:01:09.430> to<00:01:09.490> do<00:01:09.700> this

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
taught many other groups how to do this

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.780 
taught many other groups how to do this
and<00:01:10.210> and<00:01:10.780> publish<00:01:11.200> pretty<00:01:11.440> extensively<00:01:12.070> on<00:01:12.190> on

and and publish pretty extensively on on
the<00:01:13.060> results<00:01:13.780> of<00:01:13.930> this<00:01:14.050> and<00:01:14.350> follow<00:01:14.800> up

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
the results of this and follow up

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.670 
the results of this and follow up
following<00:01:15.400> up<00:01:15.550> hundreds<00:01:16.330> of<00:01:16.450> patients<00:01:16.620> but<00:01:17.620> I

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
following up hundreds of patients but I

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.870 
following up hundreds of patients but I
think<00:01:17.890> things<00:01:18.070> are<00:01:18.220> changing<00:01:18.610> very<00:01:18.640> rapidly

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
think things are changing very rapidly

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.240 
think things are changing very rapidly
for<00:01:19.510> instance<00:01:19.780> with<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.170> aortic<00:01:20.860> valve<00:01:20.890> which

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
for instance with the aortic valve which

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.390 
for instance with the aortic valve which
is<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.490> one<00:01:21.640> were<00:01:21.790> most<00:01:21.820> involved<00:01:22.360> with<00:01:23.400> these

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
is the one were most involved with these

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.860 
is the one were most involved with these
patients<00:01:24.850> are<00:01:24.970> often<00:01:25.120> elderly<00:01:25.659> and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
patients are often elderly and

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.240 
patients are often elderly and
open-heart<00:01:26.230> surgery<00:01:26.650> really<00:01:26.860> takes<00:01:27.130> a<00:01:27.220> lot

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
open-heart surgery really takes a lot

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.460 
open-heart surgery really takes a lot
out<00:01:27.550> of<00:01:27.580> them<00:01:27.760> so<00:01:28.600> this<00:01:28.870> is<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.170> procedure

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
out of them so this is a procedure

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.260 
out of them so this is a procedure
that's<00:01:29.860> much<00:01:30.100> less<00:01:30.340> invasive<00:01:30.550> patients

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
that's much less invasive patients

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.330 
that's much less invasive patients
mobilize<00:01:31.720> quicker<00:01:31.990> it<00:01:32.620> looks<00:01:32.830> as<00:01:33.010> though<00:01:33.040> the

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
mobilize quicker it looks as though the

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.820 
mobilize quicker it looks as though the
outcomes<00:01:33.880> are<00:01:34.090> comparable<00:01:34.960> or<00:01:35.200> maybe<00:01:35.710> even

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
outcomes are comparable or maybe even

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.399 
outcomes are comparable or maybe even
better<00:01:36.190> with<00:01:36.820> an<00:01:36.909> open<00:01:37.180> heart<00:01:37.330> surgery<00:01:37.780> with<00:01:37.960> a

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
better with an open heart surgery with a

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.990 
better with an open heart surgery with a
lot<00:01:38.830> less<00:01:39.960> downtime<00:01:40.960> for<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.229> patients<00:01:41.620> I

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
lot less downtime for the patients I

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.510 
lot less downtime for the patients I
felt<00:01:43.000> great<00:01:43.350> ten<00:01:44.350> minutes<00:01:44.680> after<00:01:45.010> the<00:01:45.040> surgery

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
felt great ten minutes after the surgery

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.180 
felt great ten minutes after the surgery
was<00:01:45.729> finished<00:01:46.120> I<00:01:46.450> know<00:01:47.020> repercussion<00:01:48.010> from

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
was finished I know repercussion from

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.520 
was finished I know repercussion from
that<00:01:48.370> part<00:01:48.640> of<00:01:48.760> it<00:01:48.850> at<00:01:48.970> all<00:01:49.150> I<00:01:49.450> joined<00:01:50.409> the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
that part of it at all I joined the

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.450 
that part of it at all I joined the
healthy<00:01:50.650> heart<00:01:50.979> program<00:01:51.100> again<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:54.280> was

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
healthy heart program again and that was

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.100 
healthy heart program again and that was
six<00:01:54.760> months<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:55.930> I've<00:01:56.110> also<00:01:56.770> now<00:01:57.250> back

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
six months but I've also now back

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.890 
six months but I've also now back
playing<00:01:59.110> golf<00:01:59.380> and<00:02:00.510> hopefully<00:02:01.510> in<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.720> fall

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
playing golf and hopefully in the fall

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.890 
playing golf and hopefully in the fall
I'll<00:02:02.110> curl<00:02:02.409> again<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:03.430> I<00:02:03.670> curl<00:02:03.970> and<00:02:04.180> and<00:02:04.510> golf

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
I'll curl again and I curl and and golf

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.740 
I'll curl again and I curl and and golf
three<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:05.590> four<00:02:05.799> days<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.010> week

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
three to four days a week

three to four days a week
this<00:02:07.750> procedure<00:02:08.590> started<00:02:09.069> in<00:02:09.299> Vancouver<00:02:10.299> but

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
this procedure started in Vancouver but

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.270 
this procedure started in Vancouver but
really<00:02:10.810> it's<00:02:10.929> expanded<00:02:11.439> around<00:02:11.529> the<00:02:11.799> world

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
really it's expanded around the world

many centers in Canada in this in the

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.119 
many centers in Canada in this in the
major<00:02:15.810> cities<00:02:16.290> anyway<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:18.140> there's<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:20.069> know

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
major cities anyway and there's you know

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.369 
major cities anyway and there's you know
over<00:02:20.430> 25,000<00:02:21.420> these<00:02:21.510> procedures<00:02:21.989> performed

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
over 25,000 these procedures performed

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.960 
over 25,000 these procedures performed
around<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.680> world<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.040> date<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:23.519> it's<00:02:23.670> become

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
around the world to date so it's become

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.869 
around the world to date so it's become
become<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.510> very<00:02:24.810> widely<00:02:25.590> accepted<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.370> much

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
become a very widely accepted a much

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.759 
become a very widely accepted a much
more<00:02:27.060> common<00:02:27.330> procedure<00:02:27.780> than<00:02:28.080> just<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.410> couple

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
more common procedure than just a couple

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.460 
more common procedure than just a couple
of<00:02:28.920> years<00:02:29.069> ago<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.640> think<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.510> impact<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.290> his

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
of years ago I think the impact of his

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.550 
of years ago I think the impact of his
research<00:02:31.920> has<00:02:32.190> already<00:02:32.340> been<00:02:32.670> tremendous<00:02:33.560> I'm

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
research has already been tremendous I'm

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.559 
research has already been tremendous I'm
told<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.099> in<00:02:35.280> Europe<00:02:35.640> more<00:02:35.819> than<00:02:36.030> half<00:02:36.390> of

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
told that in Europe more than half of

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.670 
told that in Europe more than half of
all<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.959> cases<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:38.910> valve<00:02:39.299> replacement<00:02:39.810> are

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
all the cases of a valve replacement are

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.979 
all the cases of a valve replacement are
done<00:02:40.920> now<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:42.239> technique<00:02:42.629> that<00:02:42.840> was

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
done now the technique that was

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.650 
done now the technique that was
pioneered<00:02:43.049> by<00:02:43.620> dr.<00:02:43.709> Webb<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.519> believe<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.450> same

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
pioneered by dr. Webb I believe the same

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.110 
pioneered by dr. Webb I believe the same
will<00:02:45.930> happen<00:02:46.230> in<00:02:46.560> North<00:02:46.769> America<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.819> maybe

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
will happen in North America and maybe

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.839 
will happen in North America and maybe
at<00:02:48.360> one<00:02:48.599> take<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.500> open<00:02:50.099> heart<00:02:50.280> surgery<00:02:50.670> will

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
at one take the open heart surgery will

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.160 
at one take the open heart surgery will
no<00:02:51.030> longer<00:02:51.239> be<00:02:51.480> necessary

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.600 

the<00:02:55.170> reason<00:02:55.470> this<00:02:55.620> program<00:02:55.980> has<00:02:56.130> succeeded

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
the reason this program has succeeded

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.880 
the reason this program has succeeded
because<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.090> teamwork<00:02:57.540> involved<00:02:58.410> with<00:02:58.769> that

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
because the teamwork involved with that

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.430 
because the teamwork involved with that
great<00:02:59.190> support<00:02:59.610> from<00:02:59.870> nursing<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.019> surgery

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
great support from nursing and surgery

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.770 
great support from nursing and surgery
and<00:03:01.500> administration<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:03.329> think<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.690> be

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
and administration and I think to be

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.170 
and administration and I think to be
honest<00:03:04.079> that<00:03:04.430> developing<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.610> program<00:03:05.819> in

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
honest that developing a program in

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.759 
honest that developing a program in
these<00:03:06.299> procedures<00:03:06.870> would<00:03:07.349> not<00:03:07.500> have<00:03:07.650> been

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
these procedures would not have been

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.280 
these procedures would not have been
possible<00:03:07.980> without<00:03:08.340> this<00:03:08.700> this<00:03:09.299> foundation<00:03:10.049> of

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
possible without this this foundation of

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.740 
possible without this this foundation of
support<00:03:10.920> within<00:03:11.510> Providence<00:03:12.510> healthcare

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750
