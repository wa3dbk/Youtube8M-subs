00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.280
 hey people what is already ten heads will 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.380
 to further becomes the gdf honda must 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.809
 after watching the new video in the last video 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.699
 presented apartments of the 1 fcs 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.380
 Let's move on to the new ones today 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.359
 vehicles and I'm going to still 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.070
 on asking one namely was asked if 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.050
 you can now save more vehicle 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.880
 as a previous year you can now have two 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.949
 Apartments own sum can be maximum 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.810
 Store 20 vehicles 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.700
 In addition, a few words for you 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.040
 to introduce the vehicles in detail 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.719
 The vehicles all have extremely many 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.090
 tuning possibilities what I right 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.219
 think cool and at the beginning I stood the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.020
 Vehicles yes rather negative than 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.149
 I've seen the first image that had 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.649
 I said then as I the dlc 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.239
 I have to say now 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.070
 has changed my opinion 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.629
 I think the vehicles are much better 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.489
 when I introduced myself and 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.989
 now I still go out in detail 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.699
 the individual vehicles 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.469
 First of all we have the motorcycle with us 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.539
 the name dinker almost water one 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.609
 community is hanged by 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.899
 some youtube but also many of them 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.650
 spectator and I can do that at all 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.049
 do not understand 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.760
 many see as a critic that you as 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.200
 tuning options saddlebags has the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.850
 you can make back clean 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.260
 but you do not have to do it 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.540
 Find this with saddlebags 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.920
 vehicle really shit out though 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.960
 if you do not turn it on then you have 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.729
 A real cool from which the motorcycle 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.990
 that looks pretty futuristic 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.119
 Definitely on it too 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.040
 I liked it better than he asked the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.479
 It has a top top speed 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.310
 The acceleration is not that great 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.960
 but that can still open and on the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.880
 bring maximum and then you have it 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.200
 Definitely a motorcycle that the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.840
 Partie also competitive in the race 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.689
 Next we have the one in going on 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.850
 angeles the first suv on the legendary 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.890
 motorsports side you can already see that 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.350
 car looks really monstrous and so on 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.119
 It is also recognizable on the road 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.290
 other vehicle then flies first 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.850
 get out of the way and you can quite 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.189
 continue to drive normally what in any case 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.810
 That's why the car is pretty awesome 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.790
 is really into it when it comes to it 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.009
 to push other vehicles out of the way 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.390
 acceleration top speed 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.759
 Pretty much so that can be different from 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.130
 the suv not expect anyway who 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.119
 a suv fans of music vehicle easy 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.610
 down 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.890
 next to a sports car namely 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.629
 which the industry masako and sees 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.500
 I think that's pretty cool 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.600
 have 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.920
 wins the vehicles all many tuning 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.840
 options may already have 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.730
 most and belongs in the category 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.620
 sports cars already to my absolute 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.360
 favorite one sees one in the background 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.280
 subtle acceleration had on everyone 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.660
 case is like a sports car can top 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.700
 probably already in the area with 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.080
 the supercar also keep up with his 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.300
 top speed is not bad 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.430
 its braking power is in the frame 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.630
 and its handling I think that's ok 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.130
 with the handling has in between 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.990
 times problems but if that a bit 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.120
 high and then it works in any case 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.709
 I think all right and therefore no 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.390
 bad vehicle what with this 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.020
 Vehicle in the game newly added 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.180
 is 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.340
 next we have the absolute 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.160
 Highlight of the DLC in the area of ​​vehicles 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.980
 the fix it center no a supercar 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.500
 I think it's really cool 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.209
 Looks like they all have it like that 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.459
 glamorous futuristic style and the 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.860
 stands out a bit more and 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.810
 he also has it right on the box 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.760
 maybe by instead with the best 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.560
 The vehicle is going to be that way 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.150
 secret tip for the races in next 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.340
 time his work in any case the 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.140
 bugatti stuck in his pocket his 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.060
 acceleration that has me really positive 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.830
 surprised I stood there at the traffic light 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.870
 he pressed two and the first 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.190
 suddenly it was solved and was 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.540
 Almost directly on 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.880
 top speed has me positive 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.530
 surprised I found the top right 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.630
 handling you like the vehicle into 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.120
 altogether just a right one 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.680
 cool car it looks great it has it 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.810
 that's what you have to do in any case 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.070
 if you can do it now 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.470
 decide which of the four 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.299
 Vehicles you would have to get because you 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.980
 just pick up the money for one of them 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.420
 you definitely this vehicle is 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.500
 probably even better than 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.019
 if you are one of the new ones 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.340
 the vehicle threatens the vehicle is the 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.320
 hammer and belonged to the best 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.180
 Vehicles in the online mode of gta 5 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.700
 there are in any case all in the 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.840
 gta community agree that was it too 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.459
 already to this video I have to go 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.160
 look if I have another one today 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.750
 examine the category of the new dlc 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.459
 become like the new weapon, for example 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.019
 In the near future there will definitely be a video 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.340
 with the patch notes still on a channel 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.970
 uploaded you think this will be today 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.140
 nothing more 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.070
 definitely has the video for you 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.540
 I like my thumb 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.540
 down out no more people 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.959
 the 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.669
 I'm still young for the boys
