00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
I was a librarian million pounds and I

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.530 
I was a librarian million pounds and I
essentially<00:02:10.160> for<00:02:10.820> some<00:02:10.970> reason<00:02:11.299> I<00:02:11.390> thought

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
essentially for some reason I thought

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.090 
essentially for some reason I thought
that<00:02:11.600> was<00:02:11.810> brilliant<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.290> I<00:02:12.650> came<00:02:12.799> back<00:02:12.950> to

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
that was brilliant and I came back to

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.530 
that was brilliant and I came back to
him<00:02:13.190> like<00:02:13.340> about<00:02:13.580> two<00:02:13.820> months<00:02:14.030> later<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.390> said

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
him like about two months later and said

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.140 
him like about two months later and said

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
think everything is being viewed on

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.949 
think everything is being viewed on
multiple<00:04:17.000> platforms<00:04:17.479> like<00:04:17.630> people<00:04:17.870> are

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
multiple platforms like people are

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.479 
multiple platforms like people are
watching<00:04:18.289> feature<00:04:18.859> films<00:04:19.250> on<00:04:19.400> their<00:04:19.519> iPhones

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
watching feature films on their iPhones

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.400 
watching feature films on their iPhones
and<00:04:20.579> you<00:04:21.419> know<00:04:21.539> people<00:04:21.780> are<00:04:21.959> watching<00:04:22.019> TV

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
and you know people are watching TV

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.550 
and you know people are watching TV
online<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:22.979> so<00:04:23.789> as<00:04:23.880> a<00:04:23.910> result<00:04:24.090> I<00:04:24.569> think<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.289> I

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
online and so as a result I think the I

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.290 
online and so as a result I think the I
think<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.800> accountability<00:04:26.250> foot<00:04:27.030> in<00:04:27.150> front

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
think the accountability foot in front

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.640 
think the accountability foot in front
of<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.479> audience<00:04:27.600> is<00:04:27.840> really<00:04:27.960> good<00:04:28.169> I<00:04:28.410> hope

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
of the audience is really good I hope

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.080 
of the audience is really good I hope
that<00:04:28.830> becomes<00:04:29.280> something<00:04:29.490> that<00:04:29.639> becomes<00:04:29.940> more

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
that becomes something that becomes more

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.330 
that becomes something that becomes more
apparent<00:04:30.210> in<00:04:30.599> bigger<00:04:31.500> productions<00:04:31.979> and<00:04:32.160> stuff

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
apparent in bigger productions and stuff

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.629 
apparent in bigger productions and stuff
and<00:04:33.020> yeah<00:04:34.020> I<00:04:34.050> mean<00:04:34.380> I<00:04:34.560> think<00:04:34.800> yeah<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.460> only

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
and yeah I mean I think yeah the only

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:36.800 
and yeah I mean I think yeah the only
way<00:04:35.729> I<00:04:35.759> can<00:04:35.849> say<00:04:36.060> is<00:04:36.210> I<00:04:36.270> really<00:04:36.479> hope<00:04:36.599> it<00:04:36.720> all
