00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 
believe it's the board tiller the

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:51.289 
believe it's the board tiller the
downhill<00:06:48.899> when<00:06:49.529> I<00:06:49.829> about<00:06:50.399> those<00:06:50.699> recovering

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:51.299 
downhill when I about those recovering

00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:53.839 
downhill when I about those recovering
you<00:06:52.019> know<00:06:52.469> to<00:06:52.529> do<00:06:52.769> that<00:06:52.799> and<00:06:53.249> wait<00:06:53.579> for<00:06:53.789> the

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:53.849 
you know to do that and wait for the

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:57.379 
you know to do that and wait for the
side<00:06:54.029> be<00:06:54.269> it<00:06:55.309> basically<00:06:56.309> covers<00:06:56.699> all<00:06:56.939> options

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:57.389 
side be it basically covers all options

00:06:57.389 --> 00:06:58.729 
side be it basically covers all options
because<00:06:57.599> then<00:06:57.779> if<00:06:57.929> he<00:06:57.989> decides<00:06:58.229> to<00:06:58.409> recover

00:06:58.729 --> 00:06:58.739 
because then if he decides to recover

00:06:58.739 --> 00:07:01.009 
because then if he decides to recover
low<00:06:59.009> you<00:06:59.459> can<00:06:59.609> bungee<00:06:59.939> jump<00:07:00.209> or<00:07:00.359> grab<00:07:00.689> the<00:07:00.719> edge

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:01.019 
low you can bungee jump or grab the edge

00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:03.199 
low you can bungee jump or grab the edge
but<00:07:01.679> that's<00:07:02.189> that's<00:07:02.519> from<00:07:02.759> his<00:07:02.879> point<00:07:03.029> of<00:07:03.149> view

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:03.209 
but that's that's from his point of view

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:04.489 
but that's that's from his point of view
so<00:07:03.509> what<00:07:03.629> do<00:07:03.689> you<00:07:03.749> think<00:07:03.869> about<00:07:03.899> that<00:07:04.139> the

00:07:04.489 --> 00:07:04.499 
so what do you think about that the

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:07.539 
so what do you think about that the
problem<00:07:04.859> with<00:07:04.979> that<00:07:05.009> is<00:07:05.339> the<00:07:06.289> one<00:07:07.289> I<00:07:07.319> fought

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:07.549 
problem with that is the one I fought

00:07:07.549 --> 00:07:11.299 
problem with that is the one I fought
DHF<00:07:08.569> each<00:07:09.569> oh<00:07:09.839> you<00:07:10.049> oftentimes<00:07:10.379> use<00:07:11.159> the

00:07:11.299 --> 00:07:11.309 
DHF each oh you oftentimes use the

00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:13.339 
DHF each oh you oftentimes use the
illusion<00:07:11.669> so<00:07:11.849> whenever<00:07:12.269> I<00:07:12.329> was<00:07:12.509> near<00:07:12.749> him<00:07:12.869> it

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:13.349 
illusion so whenever I was near him it

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:14.929 
illusion so whenever I was near him it
would<00:07:13.469> be<00:07:13.559> the<00:07:13.589> invincible<00:07:14.159> part<00:07:14.369> of<00:07:14.489> it<00:07:14.579> so<00:07:14.909> I

00:07:14.929 --> 00:07:14.939 
would be the invincible part of it so I

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:16.159 
would be the invincible part of it so I
never<00:07:15.029> got<00:07:15.299> a<00:07:15.359> chance<00:07:15.389> to<00:07:15.629> really<00:07:15.809> hit<00:07:15.929> him<00:07:16.019> out

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:16.169 
never got a chance to really hit him out

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:17.719 
never got a chance to really hit him out
of<00:07:16.289> it<00:07:16.409> I<00:07:16.529> always<00:07:16.649> had<00:07:16.829> to<00:07:16.889> predict<00:07:17.189> it<00:07:17.309> or<00:07:17.579> he

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:17.729 
of it I always had to predict it or he

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.569 
of it I always had to predict it or he
had<00:07:17.849> to<00:07:17.969> mess<00:07:18.119> up<00:07:18.649> alright<00:07:19.649> well<00:07:20.069> that<00:07:20.309> is<00:07:20.459> the

had to mess up alright well that is the

00:07:20.579 --> 00:07:23.509 
had to mess up alright well that is the
best<00:07:20.729> fellow<00:07:21.499> he<00:07:22.499> probably<00:07:22.859> would<00:07:23.159> know<00:07:23.309> how

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:23.519 
best fellow he probably would know how

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:28.549
