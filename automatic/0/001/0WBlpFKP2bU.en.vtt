we have a choice to make there's a

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.060 
we have a choice to make there's a
choice<00:00:31.390> is<00:00:31.599> either<00:00:31.750> gonna<00:00:32.050> be<00:00:32.290> you<00:00:32.590> know<00:00:32.860> we

choice is either gonna be you know we

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.870 
choice is either gonna be you know we
continue<00:00:33.250> to<00:00:33.460> be<00:00:33.520> dependent<00:00:33.790> on

petrochemical products for the future or
we<00:00:35.980> learn<00:00:36.130> a<00:00:36.160> different<00:00:36.400> business<00:00:36.610> system

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
we learn a different business system

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.000 
we learn a different business system
there's<00:00:37.870> a<00:00:37.960> better<00:00:38.110> way<00:00:38.260> we<00:00:38.590> can<00:00:38.710> do<00:00:38.829> things

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
there's a better way we can do things

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.620 
there's a better way we can do things
for<00:00:39.130> renewables<00:00:39.700> well<00:00:40.210> that<00:00:40.360> means<00:00:40.450> we're

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
for renewables well that means we're

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.600 
for renewables well that means we're
gonna<00:00:40.690> have<00:00:40.840> to<00:00:40.899> grow<00:00:41.079> stuff<00:00:41.380> we<00:00:41.829> believe<00:00:42.160> that

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
gonna have to grow stuff we believe that

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.880 
gonna have to grow stuff we believe that
growing<00:00:43.210> stuff<00:00:43.540> and<00:00:43.840> using<00:00:44.170> it<00:00:44.470> for<00:00:44.739> food

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
growing stuff and using it for food

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:45.479 
growing stuff and using it for food
first

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
first

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:46.950 
first
and<00:00:45.579> what's<00:00:46.180> food<00:00:46.359> about<00:00:46.600> that's<00:00:46.809> about

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
and what's food about that's about

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.840 
and what's food about that's about
nutrition<00:00:47.530> that's<00:00:47.710> about<00:00:47.920> protein<00:00:48.430> so<00:00:48.820> you

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
nutrition that's about protein so you

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.369 
nutrition that's about protein so you
want<00:00:49.030> to<00:00:49.090> capture<00:00:49.300> the<00:00:49.570> protein<00:00:49.899> off<00:00:50.019> the<00:00:50.170> land

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
want to capture the protein off the land

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:51.720 
want to capture the protein off the land
and<00:00:50.590> be<00:00:50.710> able<00:00:50.800> to<00:00:50.920> sell<00:00:51.219> that<00:00:51.250> and<00:00:51.579> use<00:00:51.699> that

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
and be able to sell that and use that

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.560 
and be able to sell that and use that
that's<00:00:52.539> good<00:00:53.820> carbohydrates<00:00:54.820> can<00:00:55.269> be<00:00:55.480> in

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
that's good carbohydrates can be in

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.090 
that's good carbohydrates can be in
excess<00:00:55.690> and<00:00:56.109> we<00:00:56.260> want<00:00:56.410> to<00:00:56.500> use<00:00:56.590> those<00:00:56.769> for

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
excess and we want to use those for

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.270 
excess and we want to use those for
fuels<00:00:57.789> and<00:00:57.940> chemicals<00:00:58.030> we<00:00:58.809> know<00:00:59.079> that<00:00:59.410> we<00:01:00.100> can

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
fuels and chemicals we know that we can

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.340 
fuels and chemicals we know that we can
improve<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:01.210> efficiencies<00:01:01.719> of<00:01:01.870> farming<00:01:02.260> we

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
improve the efficiencies of farming we

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.350 
improve the efficiencies of farming we
know<00:01:02.500> it<00:01:02.679> can<00:01:02.829> have<00:01:03.070> better<00:01:03.370> crops<00:01:03.730> available

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
know it can have better crops available

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.240 
know it can have better crops available
we<00:01:04.930> know<00:01:05.110> that<00:01:05.290> we<00:01:05.350> can<00:01:05.500> do<00:01:05.620> without<00:01:05.800> polluting

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
we know that we can do without polluting

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.790 
we know that we can do without polluting
the<00:01:06.310> water<00:01:06.520> or<00:01:06.790> ruining<00:01:07.120> the<00:01:07.240> soil<00:01:07.650> we've<00:01:08.650> got

the water or ruining the soil we've got

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.550 
the water or ruining the soil we've got
to<00:01:08.920> make<00:01:09.040> that<00:01:09.160> system<00:01:09.460> very<00:01:10.240> widespread<00:01:10.560> one

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
to make that system very widespread one

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.870 
to make that system very widespread one
of<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:11.740> best<00:01:11.890> practices<00:01:12.070> and<00:01:12.640> make<00:01:12.730> them

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
of the best practices and make them

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.640

to<00:01:14.680> do<00:01:14.920> that<00:01:15.070> is<00:01:15.310> connect<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:16.360> growers<00:01:17.020> the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
to do that is connect the growers the

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.600 
to do that is connect the growers the
farmers<00:01:17.680> all<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.010> way<00:01:18.070> to<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.250> marketplace

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
several years we have struggled out here

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.610 
several years we have struggled out here
as<00:04:19.220> farmers<00:04:19.729> to<00:04:19.880> make<00:04:20.060> a<00:04:20.090> living<00:04:20.600> in<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:21.019> a<00:04:21.410> lot

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
as farmers to make a living in and a lot

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.990 
as farmers to make a living in and a lot
of<00:04:21.739> us<00:04:21.859> because<00:04:22.010> of<00:04:22.130> low<00:04:22.370> commodity<00:04:22.729> prices

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
of us because of low commodity prices

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.540 
of us because of low commodity prices
and<00:04:23.720> we<00:04:23.810> were<00:04:23.870> dependent<00:04:24.350> on<00:04:24.440> exports<00:04:25.190> all<00:04:25.400> the

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
and we were dependent on exports all the

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.430 
and we were dependent on exports all the
time<00:04:25.789> and<00:04:26.090> that<00:04:26.630> isn't<00:04:26.870> always<00:04:27.140> the<00:04:27.410> best

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
time and that isn't always the best

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.870 
time and that isn't always the best
market<00:04:28.160> and

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
market and

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.940 
market and
and<00:04:28.970> it<00:04:29.360> kind<00:04:29.570> of<00:04:29.660> kept<00:04:29.870> our<00:04:30.020> green<00:04:30.230> prices<00:04:30.740> low

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
and it kind of kept our green prices low

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.530 
and it kind of kept our green prices low
but<00:04:31.220> we<00:04:31.370> were<00:04:31.490> looking<00:04:31.760> at<00:04:31.850> how<00:04:32.090> we<00:04:32.120> can<00:04:32.360> work

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
but we were looking at how we can work

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.140 
but we were looking at how we can work
together<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:33.290> grow<00:04:33.860> corn<00:04:34.250> and<00:04:34.550> get<00:04:34.670> more<00:04:34.820> value

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150
