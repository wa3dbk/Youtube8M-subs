recently purchased this because I roll

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.420 
recently purchased this because I roll
my<00:00:29.039> stampedes<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.359> often<00:00:30.900> because<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.289> hit<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
my stampedes so often because I hit the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.600

craziest jumps and all of my legs and
bodies<00:00:35.969> even<00:00:36.870> though<00:00:37.110> they're<00:00:37.320> reinforced

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
bodies even though they're reinforced

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.600

with<00:00:39.260> certain<00:00:40.260> types<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.590> compounds<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
with certain types of compounds and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.000 
with certain types of compounds and
tapes<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.300> always<00:00:42.570> break<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.800> what<00:00:43.920> I'm

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
tapes they always break so what I'm

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.090 
tapes they always break so what I'm
going<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.789> use<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.899> really<00:00:46.770> cool

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
going to do is use this really cool

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.510 
going to do is use this really cool
under<00:00:47.969> tray<00:00:48.300> along<00:00:48.899> with<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.469> roll<00:00:49.829> cage<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
under tray along with a roll cage and

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.630

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
breaking any more body mounts either

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.100 
breaking any more body mounts either

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
upgrade them to some piggyback shots

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.420 
upgrade them to some piggyback shots
eventually<00:04:39.790> the<00:04:39.910> shocks<00:04:40.210> eventually<00:04:41.040> but<00:04:42.040> but

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
eventually the shocks eventually but but

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.750 
eventually the shocks eventually but but
right<00:04:42.610> now<00:04:42.850> I'm<00:04:43.240> rather<00:04:43.420> than<00:04:43.590> 42.5<00:04:44.590> way<00:04:45.370> oil

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
right now I'm rather than 42.5 way oil

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.530 
right now I'm rather than 42.5 way oil

I<00:05:26.290> really<00:05:26.650> like<00:05:26.890> the<00:05:27.100> way<00:05:27.250> that<00:05:27.280> they<00:05:27.610> set<00:05:28.090> even

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
I really like the way that they set even

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.790 
I really like the way that they set even
though<00:05:28.660> they<00:05:28.810> kind<00:05:29.020> of<00:05:29.080> take<00:05:29.320> away<00:05:29.560> from<00:05:29.770> that

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
though they kind of take away from that

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.860 
though they kind of take away from that
monster<00:05:30.250> truck<00:05:30.790> look<00:05:31.090> because<00:05:31.600> they're

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
monster truck look because they're

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.730 
monster truck look because they're
thinner<00:05:32.880> they<00:05:33.880> kind<00:05:34.060> of<00:05:34.120> give<00:05:34.240> it<00:05:34.270> a<00:05:34.740> druggie

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
thinner they kind of give it a druggie

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.150 
thinner they kind of give it a druggie
feel<00:05:36.100> I<00:05:36.520> guess<00:05:37.440> which<00:05:38.440> is<00:05:38.590> really<00:05:38.830> nice<00:05:38.950> but

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
feel I guess which is really nice but

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.380 
feel I guess which is really nice but
the<00:05:39.280> tread<00:05:39.550> on<00:05:39.580> him<00:05:39.820> is<00:05:39.940> kind<00:05:40.090> of<00:05:40.210> like<00:05:40.360> a

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
the tread on him is kind of like a

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.659 
the tread on him is kind of like a
motorcycle<00:05:40.900> tread<00:05:42.120> which<00:05:43.120> just<00:05:43.360> gets<00:05:43.720> the

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
motorcycle tread which just gets the

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.220 
motorcycle tread which just gets the
most<00:05:45.669> awesome<00:05:46.330> grip<00:05:46.600> ever<00:05:47.230> that's<00:05:47.980> very<00:05:48.280> nice

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
most awesome grip ever that's very nice

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.070 
most awesome grip ever that's very nice
they<00:05:50.230> have<00:05:50.410> they<00:05:51.190> came<00:05:51.430> pre-mounted<00:05:51.910> which<00:05:52.810> I

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
they have they came pre-mounted which I

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.909 
they have they came pre-mounted which I
like<00:05:53.680> because<00:05:54.840> they<00:05:55.840> seem<00:05:56.050> to<00:05:56.200> never<00:05:56.440> come<00:05:56.770> off

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
like because they seem to never come off

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:58.350 
like because they seem to never come off
it<00:05:57.160> seems<00:05:57.280> like<00:05:57.520> they<00:05:57.669> glue<00:05:57.910> them<00:05:58.060> on<00:05:58.180> there

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
it seems like they glue them on there

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.730 
it seems like they glue them on there
really<00:05:58.540> well<00:05:58.690> and<00:06:00.960> you<00:06:01.960> know<00:06:02.080> they<00:06:02.260> just<00:06:02.470> stay

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
really well and you know they just stay

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.450 
really well and you know they just stay
forever

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
forever

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.700 
forever
they<00:06:03.790> also<00:06:03.940> come<00:06:04.210> on<00:06:04.240> the<00:06:04.419> Durango<00:06:05.169> rims<00:06:05.440> I

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
they also come on the Durango rims I

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.990 
they also come on the Durango rims I
believe<00:06:06.390> all<00:06:07.390> black<00:06:07.900> and<00:06:08.580> they're<00:06:09.580> very<00:06:09.730> nice

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
believe all black and they're very nice

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.420 
believe all black and they're very nice
I<00:06:10.240> like<00:06:10.390> them<00:06:10.540> very<00:06:10.930> much<00:06:11.560> they've<00:06:12.010> seemed<00:06:12.280> to

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
I like them very much they've seemed to

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.240 
I like them very much they've seemed to
last<00:06:12.640> through<00:06:13.290> you<00:06:14.290> know<00:06:14.380> winter<00:06:14.680> summer

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
last through you know winter summer

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.010 
last through you know winter summer
anything<00:06:15.910> I<00:06:16.000> want<00:06:16.240> to<00:06:16.330> do<00:06:16.450> they<00:06:16.660> seem<00:06:16.840> like<00:06:16.900> a

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
anything I want to do they seem like a

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.680 
anything I want to do they seem like a
great<00:06:17.200> tire<00:06:17.880> they<00:06:18.880> do<00:06:18.940> give<00:06:19.210> you<00:06:19.300> a<00:06:19.330> little<00:06:19.510> bit

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
great tire they do give you a little bit

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.360 
great tire they do give you a little bit
of<00:06:19.780> extra<00:06:19.990> clearance<00:06:20.560> because<00:06:20.800> they<00:06:21.220> are

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
of extra clearance because they are

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.690 
of extra clearance because they are
slightly<00:06:21.730> taller<00:06:22.150> than<00:06:22.510> the<00:06:22.600> stock<00:06:22.840> ones

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.700 
slightly taller than the stock ones

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.400 
slightly taller than the stock ones
again<00:06:24.700> they're<00:06:24.910> slightly<00:06:25.270> thinner<00:06:25.510> which<00:06:25.960> I

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
again they're slightly thinner which I

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.830 
again they're slightly thinner which I
mean<00:06:27.130> changes<00:06:27.490> the<00:06:27.640> whole<00:06:27.790> feel<00:06:28.210> of<00:06:28.240> the<00:06:28.630> car

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
mean changes the whole feel of the car

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.370 
mean changes the whole feel of the car
but<00:06:29.230> I<00:06:29.260> really<00:06:29.860> enjoy<00:06:30.100> it<00:06:30.810> current<00:06:31.810> bill<00:06:32.020> for

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
but I really enjoy it current bill for

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.760 
but I really enjoy it current bill for
