00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello guys with you drive and 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.690
 we will have two race plans I try 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.370
 more or less diversify the video on 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.139
 channel that is i first loading the race 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.139
 then what is your trunk whist and 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.869
 focus on quick start well in 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.170
 General, yes, today we have two according to plan 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.570
 the race is not so i'm on the way in third place 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.670
 By the way, the race did contactless mode. 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.539
 because initially she was in gta 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.960
 mode 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.880
 Th I thought that I was blown up again and 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.340
 again get crap so neat 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.910
 land normally though on the very 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.640
 business 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.719
 1 varnish can do the second in gta mode 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.910
 for example contactless 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:47.160
 but I wanted to do this race without contact 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.780
 because here is a big springboard and I 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.199
 I wanted to fly up on it without any 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.030
 problems there without explosions and although in another 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.969
 pity in the side of the booster and still no 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.980
 but without that, by the way, high enough 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:04.559
 we take off so the main thing is not turned over 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.720
 the main thing oh can not hold for sure now 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.110
 explode no and exploded true 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.530
 turned over normally then typewriter 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.560
 also just today bought the same wanted 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.920
 just variety and to be honest this 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.330
 I never had a car like 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.479
 she quickly especially if put on 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.990
 it turbo but so nothing special 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.450
 in principle on tuning it so so much 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.729
 what you will not put but will come down 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.840
 de facto for the race come down so if one 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.600
 here I will lift up less for example for example well 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.479
 wrong wrong wrong well I'm on the second 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.220
 position hold siberia on therefore 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.320
 I finish probably on her brakes 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.840
 it was necessary if the world is not here now 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.270
 forget somewhere 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.710
 what is basically possible 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.950
 so much speed we do not type again 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.280
 turns me over what is it now 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.500
 zasyplyu si flip here's what I 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:10.860
 feared and so i'm already in third place but 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.650
 nothing to be done exploded right here so 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.650
 guys often finish and we'll see you 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.840
 next race and here are the guys race in 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.129
 mode somewhere again I'm afraid again and not 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.150
 knows what will come of it but you know 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:28.290
 why not try now 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:32.819
 fry someone oh look falls 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:36.870
 something falls so well drove fast 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:40.349
 start and count here did not do so 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:45.959
 neatly grabbed me speed enough 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:49.620
 enough or not or not yes everything is so clear 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.970
 now we fall to the mark and why 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.540
 we do not put yes here for example minutes 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:01.769
 I have not yet taken the demolition of the name then undermine a 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:04.500
 no one blew up but you know i became 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.150
 more so roughly about the stale 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.040
 that I was all undermined and for some reason I 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.940
 initially tried not to blow anyone 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.310
 okay, I will now 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.750
 all the more so kind of cheerful Odessa 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.459
 Of course guys do not be offended at me 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.420
 just a race game 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.790
 I did not notice the evidence 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.280
 here will be 3 round and now by the way 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.290
 saying we again approach this 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.359
 I can't say a huge miracle frame 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.599
 to pronounce today we are approaching 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:38.160
 there are no springboards 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:42.599
 I understand that there is not much speed 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.519
 need to carefully drive around here yes yes yes 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.139
 otherwise there was to be a great speed to you 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.680
 would just fly on the turn so 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.200
 tag took 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.549
 well now it remains to fall so well 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.550
 so so trying to psycho no well not so well 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.660
 here I think 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.730
 will without any difficulties in accurately 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.140
 even the glass didn't fly out perfect 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:12.370
 touchdowns and drive and second lap while on 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:16.209
 first place yes ok we will hold 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.280
 a little bit on the side a little bit 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.170
 to go because and what min 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.530
 ponastavili here a lot 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:26.320
 so I also have one left me alone 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.970
 I have a non - contact mine and let's 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.800
 put here mashkova day we blow it up 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.200
 us 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:39.640
 Christmas trees-stick absolutely impossible let's 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:42.180
 try to drive around here now here i'm 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:47.860
 I'm afraid to learn already on the road 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:50.410
 so took the usual bomb velcro wanted 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.930
 what to start okay now can 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.600
 he will go tear it off so here goes 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:02.550
 the guy you blew no no no not ripped off 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.550
 its so soon now smaller one less 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:10.440
 it is great with her still here so 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.419
 neatly neat 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.419
 before we drove clearly the idea is not guys 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.730
 It should be mine and I'm on the ground 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.940
 place and it only remains to get this 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:25.840
 circle how many min are you still here 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:28.030
 I hope that there will be no more so Mamba 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.580
 Velcro just in case you will 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:35.980
 resistance 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:37.750
 we will use force so focused 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:43.860
 looking looking 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:43.860
 these bombs are suddenly still here 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:51.050
 so what do we put bombs here 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:56.210
 stickies 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:58.850
 try to blow blew no no 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.560
 blew well ok anyway we have a finish 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:04.190
 and we finish 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.710
 and we will finish yes and we 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.600
 finish first excellent 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.970
 asking for the race to finish though strange 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:14.150
 the race in the mode of the year as I still drove to 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.040
