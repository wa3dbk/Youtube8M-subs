00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.440
 you saw that the world of football every 

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:07.630
 it seems less like the amateur and every 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.270
 Once it looks more like the businessman as 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:13.840
 understands that is not always the other 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.700
 day I do everything I say most of 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.580
 the things I say do not belong to me 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.690
 laws somewhere and I describe them 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.990
 it would seem that they were their own, they are not 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.820
 they are all copied but here 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.770
 I remember who the copy is going to 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.780
 say come to pierre said 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.050
 entrepreneurs who take over the 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:36.380
 football they think the fans are 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.250
 assimilated to the 30,000 workers that 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:44.930
 they have working and an amateur is not 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.750
 an operator an operator works a 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.950
 amateur feels 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.380
 you should not treat the amateur with the 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.970
 codes of an operator understands me 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.070
 then but like the world of 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.920
 entrepreneurs what entrepreneur the world of 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.140
 football is like the rest of the world from 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.449
 We entrepreneurs entrepreneurs 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.090
 they deal only with the 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.950
 productivity that we are capable of 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.390
 provide precise that evaluation 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.520
 that is to say one but still to alge the 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:22.460
 manager tells the foreman that this 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:25.640
 you have to turn x quantity of pieces 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.690
 but my mom died yesterday that was 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.420
 yesterday you have to turn x amount 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:35.690
 means that no matter what 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.690
 justifications implies that the quantity 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.229
 of pieces in football rules the same 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.830
 logic but a very dangerous logic by 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.840
 what 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:53.490
 much measures if you do not reward a process 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:57.440
 who got less than what he got if 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:01.820
 it does not reward it there is not much risk 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.570
 but if you reward a process that what 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.300
 got 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.130
 he did it undeservedly if there 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.280
 a lot of risk 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.650
 does not understand the difference that the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.320
 contemporary world that mattered 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.860
 mercedes benz uphill but look 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.380
 that I said I won it in the lottery 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.620
 but in my neighborhood there was also 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.230
 prostitutes who had a bmw me 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.710
 understood there were also lifters 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.350
 game that they had bmw w you understand me 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.000
 I put the mildest example because because 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.150
 the mildest example is the most 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.240
 representative things do not matter 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.160
 because the one who won the lottery is fine 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.020
 he did not do anything bad he won the lottery but 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.870
 it does not deserve what it has 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.270
 then for me the message in a 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:56.130
 scenario as is the football of similar 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:58.740
 repercussion should be we reward the 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.980
 look what you get deservedly and 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.800
 with legal resources to defend is not a 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.720
 illicit recourse to speculation is not a 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.150
 illicit remedy now 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.420
 if you through that other things 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.630
 who values ​​the press 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.610
 and never attacked 100% effectiveness 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.920
 the other team had the ball all the 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.270
 Kneeling match goals won the most 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.920
 pragmatic is not that logic allowed them 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.630
 winning that good match can not be a 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.000
 logic applies the you have and that then 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.610
 you have to make the rival have the 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.010
 ball that kicks you 20 bs to the bow that you 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:42.340
 regulate that good attack never and so on 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:45.980
 etcetera the team that wins through 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.690
 wait for the opposite error 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.610
 because it is one thing to wait for the error 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.519
 opposite and another thing is to provoke the 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:56.780
 The opposite error is no longer authorized 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:59.000
 to success is less authorized is less 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.629
 likely to happen that's why I tell him 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.239
 look do not worry if you do not reward a 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:09.080
 process that got less than what 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:12.470
 deserved that should not generate us 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:16.160
 concerns injustice is very 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:19.250
 common but when it is rewarded as good 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.729
 something that is not good that is casual that 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.520
 yes it is very harmful for everyone because 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.490
 teaches all who observe that a 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.699
 Shortcut takes you to the objective and a shortcut 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.830
 normally it does not take you to the target myself 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:36.949
 I always tell the player the angle of 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.680
 90 degrees that cross the garden poetry 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:43.030
 Menotti avoiding the 90 degree angle 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.610
 step on the flower and the one that arrives faster 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.650
 travels the 90 degree angle takes longer 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.110
 that does not harm the flowers understand me 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.600
 obviously I already know what 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.030
 this is cheap philosophy said by a 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.030
 Argentine who has the opportunity to 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.180
 express myself understand me but I believe in 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:05.210
 that kind of thing I believe in that in that 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:09.860
 you have to value what you deserve and you have to 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:13.120
 ignore or at least not deify that 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.120
 that was not deservedly obtained
