we're using our innovative out well wind
stabilizer<00:00:59.820> systems<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:01.019> this<00:01:01.170> does<00:01:01.379> is

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
stabilizer systems what this does is

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.560 
stabilizer systems what this does is

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
going to be a very very stable structure

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.980 
going to be a very very stable structure
even<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> really<00:01:20.070> windy<00:01:20.100> day<00:01:20.689> all<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.750> the

even on a really windy day all of the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.840 
even on a really windy day all of the
guidelines<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.650> we<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:22.829> are<00:01:23.280> all<00:01:23.340> luminous

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
guidelines that we have are all luminous

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.670

all<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> way<00:01:24.479> around<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> tent<00:01:25.079> so<00:01:25.500> that's

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
all the way around the tent so that's

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.719 
all the way around the tent so that's
going<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.860> stop<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.189> from<00:01:26.280> tripping<00:01:26.670> over

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.020 
them and then each one has its own
retainer<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.520> when<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.729> comes<00:01:29.850> to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
retainer so that when it comes to

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.819 
retainer so that when it comes to
packing<00:01:30.210> down<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.659> tent<00:01:30.899> we<00:01:31.259> can<00:01:31.380> simply<00:01:31.649> wrap

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
packing down the tent we can simply wrap

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
here that we have a large ventilation

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.709 
here that we have a large ventilation
panel<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.549> side<00:01:59.759> there<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.240> another<00:02:00.570> one

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
panel on the side there is another one

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.270 
panel on the side there is another one
on<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.930> other<00:02:01.020> side<00:02:01.110> obviously<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.920> also<00:02:02.070> on

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
on the other side obviously and also on

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.039 
on the other side obviously and also on
the<00:02:02.369> back<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.909> just<00:02:03.090> allows<00:02:03.180> cool<00:02:03.570> fresh<00:02:03.840> air

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
the back this just allows cool fresh air

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.929 
the back this just allows cool fresh air
into<00:02:04.289> the<00:02:04.380> tent<00:02:04.619> when<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.579> little<00:02:05.820> bit

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
into the tent when it's a little bit

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.789 
into the tent when it's a little bit
warmer<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:06.390> if<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.570> get<00:02:06.719> too<00:02:06.869> chilly<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.530> we

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
warmer but if you get too chilly and we

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.529 
warmer but if you get too chilly and we
can<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.160> simply<00:02:08.460> close<00:02:08.789> down<00:02:09.000> these<00:02:09.180> vents

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
can just simply close down these vents

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.130 
can just simply close down these vents
like<00:02:10.230> so<00:02:11.450> when<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:12.540> come<00:02:12.690> around<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.020> front

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
like so when we come around to the front

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.900 
like so when we come around to the front
of<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.470> tent<00:02:13.680> you'll<00:02:13.860> see<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.520> even<00:02:14.790> though

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
of the tent you'll see that even though

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:15.820 
of the tent you'll see that even though
it's<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.120> relative

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
it's a relative

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.350 
it's a relative
the<00:02:15.890> compact<00:02:16.310> tent<00:02:16.640> we<00:02:16.790> still<00:02:16.970> have<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.150> real

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
the compact tent we still have a real

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.510 
the compact tent we still have a real
good<00:02:17.630> size<00:02:17.870> front<00:02:18.140> opening<00:02:18.440> here<00:02:18.710> so<00:02:19.130> you<00:02:19.250> can

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
good size front opening here so you can

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.310 
good size front opening here so you can
classify<00:02:19.760> certainly<00:02:20.240> as<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.360> walk-in<00:02:20.630> tent<00:02:21.110> and

is<00:02:44.000> where<00:02:44.180> we<00:02:44.270> were<00:02:44.330> famed<00:02:44.570> at<00:02:44.750> the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
is where we were famed at the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.540 
is where we were famed at the
ventilation<00:02:45.290> panels<00:02:45.620> that<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.310> said

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
ventilation panels that I said

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.700 
ventilation panels that I said
correspond<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.690> outside<00:02:48.110> ventilation

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
correspond to the outside ventilation

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.950 
correspond to the outside ventilation
panels<00:02:48.860> on<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.340> tent<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:50.480> ground<00:02:50.690> treat<00:02:50.870> that

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
panels on the tent the ground treat that

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.510 
panels on the tent the ground treat that
we<00:02:51.080> use<00:02:51.260> in<00:02:51.410> here<00:02:51.440> is<00:02:51.770> a<00:02:51.800> double<00:02:52.070> coated

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
we use in here is a double coated

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.250 
we use in here is a double coated
polyethylene<00:02:53.180> material<00:02:53.270> so<00:02:53.990> it's<00:02:54.110> really

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
polyethylene material so it's really

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.050 
polyethylene material so it's really
tough<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:54.740> really<00:02:54.830> durable<00:02:55.459> then<00:02:55.820> it<00:02:55.910> has<00:02:56.030> a

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
tough and really durable then it has a

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.520 
tough and really durable then it has a

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
to back and side to side so that's going

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.800 
to back and side to side so that's going
to<00:03:01.430> stop<00:03:01.640> any<00:03:01.790> rush<00:03:02.060> from<00:03:02.240> coming<00:03:02.540> in<00:03:02.660> and
