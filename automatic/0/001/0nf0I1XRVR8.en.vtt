this<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.220> years<00:01:29.460> before<00:01:29.869> Xbox

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
this is in the in the years before Xbox

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.020 
this is in the in the years before Xbox
and<00:01:31.140> Playstation<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.159> all<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.490> stuff<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:32.759> we

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
and Playstation and all that stuff so we

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.560 
and Playstation and all that stuff so we
just<00:01:33.210> wrote<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.020> played<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.920> then<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.570> I

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
just wrote we just played and then and I

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.520 
just wrote we just played and then and I
was<00:01:37.320> always<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.650> bad<00:01:37.920> guy<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.220> some<00:01:38.460> reason

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
was always the bad guy for some reason

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.990 
was always the bad guy for some reason
so<00:01:40.820> nothing's<00:01:41.820> changed<00:01:42.439> and<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:44.220> think<00:01:44.460> I'm

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
so nothing's changed and I think I'm

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.130 
so nothing's changed and I think I'm
pretty<00:01:45.210> sure<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.329> played<00:01:45.570> hook<00:01:45.720> at<00:01:45.840> one<00:01:45.990> point

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
pretty sure I played hook at one point

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.719 
pretty sure I played hook at one point
we<00:01:46.380> did<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> version<00:01:46.740> our<00:01:47.070> own<00:01:47.250> version<00:01:47.640> of

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
we did a version our own version of

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.870 
we did a version our own version of
Peter<00:01:47.880> Pan<00:01:48.210> which<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.229> think<00:01:49.290> involved<00:01:49.880> this

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
Peter Pan which I think involved this

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.450
