individual<00:00:39.629> birds<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.110> believe<00:00:40.559> if<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.739> buy

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.340 
individual birds I believe if you buy
the<00:00:40.980> ones<00:00:41.570> that<00:00:42.570> come<00:00:42.690> with<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.870> cages<00:00:43.230> which

the ones that come with the cages which

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.569 
the ones that come with the cages which
obviously<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> little<00:00:43.890> bit<00:00:43.980> more<00:00:44.100> expensive<00:00:44.520> if

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
obviously a little bit more expensive if

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.920 
obviously a little bit more expensive if
they<00:00:44.670> don't<00:00:44.850> come<00:00:45.030> with<00:00:45.149> batteries<00:00:45.270> included

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930
