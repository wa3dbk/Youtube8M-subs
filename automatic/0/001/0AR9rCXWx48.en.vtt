part of air of the garment and then it

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.099 
part of air of the garment and then it
gives<00:00:27.630> back<00:00:28.050> fullness<00:00:28.949> or<00:00:29.130> volume<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
lower part of the stitching so there we

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.560 
lower part of the stitching so there we
have<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.250> took<00:00:37.489> here<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.940> pattern<00:00:39.149> piece

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
have a took here is the pattern piece

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.430 
have a took here is the pattern piece
and<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.280> area<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:42.030> which<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
once I've actually put these markings

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:58.069 
once I've actually put these markings
onto<00:00:50.579> my<00:00:50.730> fabric<00:00:51.000> piece<00:00:53.239> like<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:56.420> whether<00:00:57.420> I

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
onto my fabric piece like so whether I

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.310 
onto my fabric piece like so whether I
am<00:00:58.649> going<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.210> fold<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.930> order<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.800> meet<00:01:02.039> and

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
am going to fold it in order to meet and

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.320 
am going to fold it in order to meet and
then<00:01:04.320> I'm<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.070> stitch<00:01:05.400> from<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
then I'm going to stitch from the

I'm<00:01:19.590> working<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.100> piece<00:01:20.370> of<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.790> sample

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
I'm working on a piece of a sample

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.240 
I'm working on a piece of a sample
fabric<00:01:21.750> here<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.230> I'm<00:01:22.710> going<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.950> make<00:01:23.100> sure

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
fabric here and I'm going to make sure

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.550 
fabric here and I'm going to make sure
my<00:01:23.460> little<00:01:23.550> circles<00:01:24.090> meet<00:01:24.270> each<00:01:24.420> other<00:01:27.560> and

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
my little circles meet each other and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.870 
my little circles meet each other and
put<00:01:28.770> pin<00:01:29.040> there<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:30.080> another<00:01:31.080> one<00:01:31.820> at<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
put pin there and another one at the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.510 
put pin there and another one at the
other<00:01:33.090> point<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:36.140> then<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.440> will<00:01:37.860> stitch<00:01:38.130> from

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
other point and then I will stitch from

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.969 
other point and then I will stitch from
that<00:01:39.150> point<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.290> end<00:01:40.440> of<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.220> talk<00:01:42.979> I'm

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
that point to the end of the talk I'm

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.210 
that point to the end of the talk I'm
going<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.220> start<00:01:44.400> sewing<00:01:44.580> from<00:01:44.990> circle<00:01:45.990> a

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
going to start sewing from circle a

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.690 
going to start sewing from circle a
let's<00:01:47.220> call<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.610> down<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> circle<00:01:48.900> be<00:01:49.700> put

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
let's call that down to a circle be put

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.660 
let's call that down to a circle be put
on<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.030> Machine<00:01:52.009> get<00:01:53.009> down

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
on to the Machine get down

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.200 
on to the Machine get down
needle<00:01:54.390> down<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:55.580> then<00:01:56.580> couple<00:01:56.910> of<00:01:57.030> stitches

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
needle down and then couple of stitches

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:06.050 
needle down and then couple of stitches
forward<00:01:57.680> and<00:01:58.680> then<00:01:58.800> reverse<00:02:04.399> pin<00:02:05.399> up<00:02:05.580> on<00:02:05.880> that

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
forward and then reverse pin up on that

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:15.620 
forward and then reverse pin up on that
so<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.600> my<00:02:06.720> pins<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.959> reverse<00:02:12.709> take<00:02:13.709> away<00:02:14.630> and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
so the my pins and reverse take away and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.160 
so the my pins and reverse take away and
then<00:02:15.870> put<00:02:20.180> now<00:02:21.180> just<00:02:21.390> got<00:02:21.510> one<00:02:21.720> more<00:02:21.750> row<00:02:22.050> of

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
then put now just got one more row of

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.710 
then put now just got one more row of
stitching<00:02:22.739> so<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.370> need<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:24.000> point<00:02:24.360> here<00:02:24.690> to

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
stitching so I need this point here to

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.740 
stitching so I need this point here to
meet<00:02:25.230> with<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.739> point<00:02:26.100> there<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.980> just

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
meet with that point there so I just

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.500 
meet with that point there so I just
place<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.780> along<00:02:31.019> there<00:02:33.860> owed<00:02:34.860> me<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.130> minute

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
place it along there owed me a minute

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.539 
place it along there owed me a minute
and<00:02:36.510> there<00:02:37.140> we<00:02:37.230> have<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:37.799> it<00:02:38.310> looks<00:02:38.459> like

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
and there we have it so it looks like

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.990 
and there we have it so it looks like
that<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:39.660> then<00:02:40.340> put<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.370> couple<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.640> pins<00:02:41.850> in

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
that and then put a couple of pins in

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.590 
that and then put a couple of pins in
there<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:44.610> last<00:02:44.850> bit<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.090> stitching<00:02:45.330> that

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
there and the last bit of stitching that

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.690 
there and the last bit of stitching that
you<00:02:45.720> will<00:02:45.840> do<00:02:47.360> how<00:02:48.360> about<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.720> just<00:02:49.670> show<00:02:50.670> you
