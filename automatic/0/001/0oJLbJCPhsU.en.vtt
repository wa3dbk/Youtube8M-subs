00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.660 
they're easy to see and follow along
with<00:02:10.630> but<00:02:11.320> only<00:02:11.590> during<00:02:11.920> these<00:02:12.250> simple

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
with but only during these simple

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.190 
with but only during these simple
lessons<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.299> that<00:02:13.329> the<00:02:13.570> case<00:02:13.750> when<00:02:13.959> you<00:02:14.019> start

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.460 
combining with rhythm
melody<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:16.120> lessons<00:02:16.450> become<00:02:16.810> very<00:02:17.110> difficult

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
melody the lessons become very difficult

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.260
