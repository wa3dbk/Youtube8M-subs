00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.289
 hi i am alisa moore sprint art 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.750
 secrets and if you are really interested 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.910
 in learning spray art then 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.220
 that is going to love you because I'm going to 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.710
 make a painting for you and you can 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.789
 just listen and continue while 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.730
 I explain step by step and if there is something 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.940
 here that fascinates him then he returns to 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.070
 watch the video again and again and then 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.949
 try to do it with some spray cans 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.200
 and please notice how it went 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.090
 let's start well then what 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.050
 I'm doing here is marking where they're going 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.050
 to go my planets 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.969
 using the layers and some frets that 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.120
 I have and then I'm filling those 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.640
 areas being from light to dark then 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.800
 I'm using pink yellow white 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.230
 orange and metallic blue and it's blue 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.879
 metallic is a bit transparent that 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.739
 It works very well with the color orange 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.470
 because one is a complement to the other 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.410
 then I will use newspaper create 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.220
 the design squeezing it and going up 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.800
 my hand 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.440
 then I will use my black I use 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.600
 a color mark place in the USA if you 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.200
 live in mexico or some other countries 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.470
 Latinos can buy at the comex brand 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.270
 which is the best thing that is not sold in the USA 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.910
 so I use pre color is it a color 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.410
 very soft black I buy it not to the sea other 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.780
 mark that can serve for that is 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.730
 Molotov then I will put there my 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.190
 planets where they visit pitas and 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.620
 around I will fill in colors for 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.750
 do the earth equal being declared 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:47.310
 dark and in the sky I put a little 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.250
 of light declared dark equal and behind 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.560
 each planet I will put a little bit of 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.740
 blue because I want those plants 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.750
 reduce with a blue light back and all 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.790
 the places where light will not go 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.950
 filled with black and that's a black 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.320
 different I'm using to 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.880
 interstate but you can use the same 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:12.540
 comexi can get it or also 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.500
 moloto montana in usa then it goes 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.590
 to put a little bit of blue 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.080
 and will reaffirm and a little bit of blue 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.750
 metallic and a little bit of red that's 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.270
 because I want that down where is the 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.340
 earth that is very bright I'm going to put 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.250
 a rainbow and to put the rainbow 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.130
 He needs a little bit of tino with his 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.990
 hand and it is necessary to make the boat a 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.120
 little to one side because that's how you get 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.740
 a very very thin line 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.110
 to make the stars is important 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.850
 talk hard because the painting 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.190
 it's wet then it's going to expand a 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.989
 little are going to be bigger than 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.360
 can you believe then throwing the 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.700
 very strong stars become tiny 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.459
 not that I'm going to remove my caps already 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.100
 my planets what I'm going to do here is 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.480
 a ring around the planet in the middle 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.200
 and first I put transparent there 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.569
 and then with a little bit of poster board 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.840
 drew the ring is a little corner of 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:12.269
 poster word poster board in mexico and in 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.190
 other parts is called cable or sulfated 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.680
 those are other names basically it's a 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.510
 paper that has a little bit of brightness 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.510
 so that the paint is not absorbed there 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.510
 with a paper is like magazine paper or 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.000
 of those things that arrive in the mail 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.459
 the one who does not want it or can be used 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.879
 newspaper also that is not very very 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.130
 absorbing nor very stiff that's all I'm going 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.620
 to draw in with my hand and I do the 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.840
 earth and I step up and step up 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.840
 and every time I remove trained layers 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.800
 and a mountain is revealed and made 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.290
 transparent and again more land for 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.540
 keep sliding and there is another video in my 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.260
 channel that shows how to do is towards 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.260
 the slippery 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.950
 I put a little black and a 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.080
 little red again red for 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.150
 bring a bit of perspective to the 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.330
 bottom part and again sliding to 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.130
 hand 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.130
 there I will put a city 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.729
 all that is explained in a lot of detail 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.770
 inside the area of ​​the members of 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.330
 thorn boys we have many many 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.689
 videos 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.270
 what can you download that you can see and learn 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:35.969
 in detail each step how is this for 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.800
 that comes out perfectly ok for 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:41.260
 draw with the spatula there are several 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.480
 ways to draw and handle the spatula 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.280
 there we have many videos that he teaches 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.780
 how to do that because it is necessary 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.480
 do it very fast to do the 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.320
 cities and the stairs that give you 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.320
 back to the mountain 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.950
 and everything we explain to you 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.820
 and there I am throwing a little bit of 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:09.470
 transparent below 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.470
 the hunt my hand 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.879
 to create as a little bit of effect 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.159
 watery and I can add some colors to 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:24.080
 the corner so it 's brighter 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:27.700
 towards the center because it goes up a 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.070
 little bit of black and it looks pretty 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.130
 and now I'm going to take a piece of paper 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.050
 I've done holes with a pencil there and what 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.110
 I'm using with my white face 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.940
 leo montana molotov or comex i am 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.100
 grabbing a few inches above me 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.990
 painting and I 've done it through the 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.150
 holes and has been the stars and 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.190
 I simply flip the boat and 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.690
 I can make myself a comet where I go to 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.940
