00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
p39 to speed very maneuverable but they

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.389 
p39 to speed very maneuverable but they
can<00:00:28.529> i'll<00:00:29.279> dive<00:00:29.640> a6m2<00:00:30.300> all<00:00:30.660> day<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.949> i'll<00:00:32.250> run

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.580 
it so see their tactic here is mainly
just<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.460> run<00:00:35.670> away<00:00:35.760> but<00:00:35.910> i<00:00:36.600> wanted<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.380> talk<00:00:37.559> to

you<00:00:37.770> guys<00:00:37.800> about<00:00:38.750> was<00:00:39.750> ramming<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.379> war

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
you guys about was ramming in war

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.000 
you guys about was ramming in war
thunder<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:42.020> when<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.050> think<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:43.710> acceptable

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
thunder and when I think it's acceptable

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.670 
thunder and when I think it's acceptable
and<00:00:44.550> what<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.730> think<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.510> mean<00:00:46.469> for<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
and what I think it's not I mean for the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.160 
and what I think it's not I mean for the
most<00:00:46.800> part<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.550> think<00:00:48.510> ramming<00:00:49.050> is

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
most part I think ramming is

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.569 
most part I think ramming is
unacceptable<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.870> general<00:00:52.070> there<00:00:53.070> are<00:00:53.129> some

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
unacceptable in general there are some

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.970 
unacceptable in general there are some
situations<00:00:54.059> where<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.809> feel<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.710> used

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
situations where I feel it can be used

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.049 
situations where I feel it can be used
and<00:00:56.250> should<00:00:56.699> be<00:00:56.789> used<00:00:57.559> such<00:00:58.559> as<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.789> example

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
and should be used such as the example

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.869 
and should be used such as the example

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
this Ferris forwarded right now but I

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.990 
this Ferris forwarded right now but I
chased<00:01:51.750> him<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.049> game<00:01:52.229> 4<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.740> don't<00:01:53.610> know<00:01:53.670> seven

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
chased him in game 4 I don't know seven

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.630 
chased him in game 4 I don't know seven
or<00:01:54.270> ten<00:01:54.479> minutes<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.439> just<00:01:56.070> do<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.280> same<00:01:56.340> thing

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
or ten minutes it just do the same thing

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.639 
or ten minutes it just do the same thing
over<00:01:56.729> he'd<00:01:56.909> fly<00:01:57.149> way<00:01:57.479> way<00:01:58.020> way<00:01:58.229> way<00:01:58.380> out<00:01:58.409> there

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
over he'd fly way way way way out there

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.649 
over he'd fly way way way way out there
get<00:01:59.130> his<00:01:59.219> out<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.670> turn<00:01:59.939> around<00:02:00.060> pretty<00:02:00.540> much

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
get his out to turn around pretty much

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.510 
get his out to turn around pretty much
do<00:02:00.840> nothing<00:02:00.869> except<00:02:01.469> fly<00:02:01.560> past<00:02:01.920> me<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.159> then

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
do nothing except fly past me and then

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.090 
do nothing except fly past me and then
do<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.790> again<00:02:03.469> it<00:02:04.469> was<00:02:04.770> getting<00:02:04.979> pretty

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
do it again it was getting pretty

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.380

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.960 
you and by the time I finally catch up
to<00:02:18.120> him<00:02:18.240> he's<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.810> last<00:02:19.020> guy<00:02:19.170> in<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.470> game<00:02:19.650> and

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
to him he's the last guy in the game and

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
to him he's the last guy in the game and
everybody<00:02:20.970> I'm<00:02:21.120> teams<00:02:21.330> trying<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.660> catch<00:02:21.810> up

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
everybody I'm teams trying to catch up

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.440 
everybody I'm teams trying to catch up
this<00:02:22.110> idiot<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.620> most<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:23.150> everybody<00:02:24.150> on<00:02:24.330> my

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
this idiot and most of everybody on my

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.730 
this idiot and most of everybody on my
team<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.720> flying<00:02:25.280> slower<00:02:26.280> Japanese<00:02:27.180> aircraft

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
team is flying slower Japanese aircraft

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.840 
team is flying slower Japanese aircraft
so<00:02:28.740> we're<00:02:28.890> pretty<00:02:29.190> much<00:02:29.310> never<00:02:29.580> going<00:02:29.790> to

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
so we're pretty much never going to

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.310 
so we're pretty much never going to
catch<00:02:29.940> them<00:02:30.150> unless<00:02:30.480> he<00:02:30.630> makes<00:02:30.750> mistake<00:02:31.140> if

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
catch them unless he makes mistake if

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.810 
catch them unless he makes mistake if
you<00:02:31.530> know<00:02:31.680> turn<00:02:31.920> too<00:02:32.130> much<00:02:32.310> losing<00:02:32.580> all<00:02:32.760> his

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
you know turn too much losing all his

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.090 
you know turn too much losing all his
energy<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.320> give<00:02:34.320> me<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.500> altitude<00:02:34.860> vantage

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
energy and give me the altitude vantage

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.430 
energy and give me the altitude vantage
which<00:02:35.220> eventually<00:02:35.730> does<00:02:36.060> right<00:02:36.300> here<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.720> I

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
which eventually does right here and I

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.130 
which eventually does right here and I
end<00:02:38.370> up<00:02:38.430> catching<00:02:38.670> up<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.030> him<00:02:39.120> right<00:02:39.480> as<00:02:39.660> he's

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
end up catching up to him right as he's

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.479
