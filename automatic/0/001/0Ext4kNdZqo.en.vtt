00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.010 

the<00:01:13.100> rational<00:01:13.670> numbers<00:01:14.030> are<00:01:14.210> all<00:01:14.570> numbers

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
the rational numbers are all numbers

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.150 
the rational numbers are all numbers
that<00:01:15.050> can<00:01:15.410> be<00:01:15.440> written<00:01:15.710> as<00:01:16.100> a<00:01:16.700> ratio<00:01:18.160> notice

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
that can be written as a ratio notice

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.980 
that can be written as a ratio notice
the<00:01:19.340> first<00:01:19.640> five<00:01:20.060> letters<00:01:20.330> of<00:01:20.660> that<00:01:20.810> word

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
the first five letters of that word

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.730 
the first five letters of that word
rational<00:01:21.550> ratio<00:01:22.750> that's<00:01:23.750> how<00:01:23.930> I<00:01:23.960> remember<00:01:24.440> it

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
rational ratio that's how I remember it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.840 
rational ratio that's how I remember it
for<00:01:25.370> instance<00:01:25.730> is<00:01:25.970> to<00:01:26.630> a<00:01:26.660> ratio<00:01:27.410> a<00:01:27.850> rational

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
for instance is to a ratio a rational

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.450 
for instance is to a ratio a rational
number<00:01:28.880> of<00:01:29.330> course<00:01:30.200> it<00:01:30.380> is<00:01:30.530> you<00:01:30.830> can<00:01:30.980> write<00:01:31.160> 2

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
number of course it is you can write 2

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.880 
number of course it is you can write 2
as<00:01:31.760> 2<00:01:32.180> over<00:01:32.210> 1<00:01:32.900> how<00:01:33.620> about<00:01:33.890> 0.1<00:01:35.350> yep<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:36.740> can

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
as 2 over 1 how about 0.1 yep you can

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.360 
as 2 over 1 how about 0.1 yep you can
write<00:01:37.100> that<00:01:37.250> as<00:01:37.400> 1<00:01:37.790> over<00:01:38.240> 10<00:01:38.710> how<00:01:39.710> about<00:01:40.070> let's

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
write that as 1 over 10 how about let's

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.480 
write that as 1 over 10 how about let's
say<00:01:40.760> PI<00:01:42.460> now<00:01:43.460> Pi<00:01:44.330> is<00:01:44.390> not<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:44.990> rational<00:01:45.490> number

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
say PI now Pi is not a rational number

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.450 
say PI now Pi is not a rational number
because<00:01:46.730> a<00:01:47.390> first<00:01:48.050> of<00:01:48.230> all<00:01:48.350> it's<00:01:48.710> a<00:01:48.860> constant

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
because a first of all it's a constant

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.790 
because a first of all it's a constant
and<00:01:49.670> B<00:01:50.450> you<00:01:50.630> can't<00:01:50.960> really<00:01:51.170> write<00:01:51.410> that<00:01:51.440> as<00:01:51.770> a

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
and B you can't really write that as a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.610 
and B you can't really write that as a
fraction<00:01:51.980> the<00:01:52.910> closest<00:01:53.360> you<00:01:53.480> can<00:01:53.630> get<00:01:53.810> is<00:01:54.050> 22

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
fraction the closest you can get is 22

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.690 
fraction the closest you can get is 22
over<00:01:55.100> 7<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:55.880> that's<00:01:56.390> not<00:01:56.600> really<00:01:57.520> it's<00:01:58.520> not

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
over 7 and that's not really it's not

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.719 
over 7 and that's not really it's not
really<00:01:58.760> pi<00:01:59.330> so<00:01:59.750> you<00:02:00.260> can't<00:02:00.530> as<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:01.310> can<00:02:01.490> guess

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
really pi so you can't as you can guess

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.780 
really pi so you can't as you can guess
an<00:02:02.030> irrational<00:02:02.900> number<00:02:03.530> is<00:02:03.710> a<00:02:03.800> number<00:02:04.760> that

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.810 
it is not irrational because the square
root<00:02:40.940> of<00:02:41.000> 64<00:02:41.420> is<00:02:41.660> 8<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:42.680> can<00:02:42.830> write<00:02:42.950> 8<00:02:43.190> as<00:02:43.220> 8

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
root of 64 is 8 and you can write 8 as 8

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.340 
root of 64 is 8 and you can write 8 as 8

over 1 how about PI of course it is

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.080 
over 1 how about PI of course it is

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
because it can't be written as a ratio

irrational number and pi is of course
equal<00:02:56.750> to<00:02:57.850> 3.14159<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.290> it<00:03:00.290> continues<00:03:00.739> on

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
square root of negative one well I

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.140 
square root of negative one well I
equals<00:03:32.320> negative<00:03:32.500> one<00:03:32.920> so<00:03:33.340> of<00:03:33.400> course<00:03:33.670> this<00:03:34.090> is

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
equals negative one so of course this is

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.190 
equals negative one so of course this is
imaginary

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200

how about 789 that has the real part but
it<00:03:40.330> doesn't<00:03:40.630> have<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.050> imaginary<00:03:41.740> part<00:03:42.100> so<00:03:42.700> it

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
it doesn't have the imaginary part so it

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.390 
it doesn't have the imaginary part so it
is<00:03:42.970> not<00:03:43.360> considered<00:03:44.140> a<00:03:44.440> complex<00:03:45.010> number
