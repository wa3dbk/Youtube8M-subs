guitar or anything I'm just putting a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.730 
guitar or anything I'm just putting a
couple<00:01:10.490> of<00:01:10.550> blocks<00:01:10.729> in<00:01:11.140> in<00:01:12.140> between<00:01:12.620> the

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
couple of blocks in in between the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.030 
couple of blocks in in between the
bracing<00:01:13.190> gluing<00:01:14.090> them<00:01:14.240> in<00:01:14.659> which<00:01:15.049> shouldn't

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
bracing gluing them in which shouldn't

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.690 
bracing gluing them in which shouldn't
affect<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.640> tone<00:01:16.850> of<00:01:16.880> it

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.840 

still<00:01:21.390> nice<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.780> resonant<00:01:22.620> and<00:01:23.520> then<00:01:23.760> it

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
still nice and resonant and then it

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.420 
still nice and resonant and then it
works<00:01:24.030> off<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.330> strap<00:01:24.860> off<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.159> little

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
works off the strap off of this little

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.090 
works off the strap off of this little
deal<00:01:26.550> right<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.409> you<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.560> tune<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.979> with

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
deal right here and you can tune it with

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.930 
deal right here and you can tune it with
that<00:01:29.430> tuner<00:01:29.790> point<00:01:30.630> right<00:01:30.869> there<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.760> don't

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
that tuner point right there and I don't

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.850 
that tuner point right there and I don't
know<00:01:33.030> can<00:01:33.300> you<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.810> see<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.260> mechanism

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
know can you can you see the mechanism

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.760 
know can you can you see the mechanism
in<00:01:35.010> there<00:01:35.810> that'll<00:01:36.810> give<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.440> little<00:01:37.650> bit

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
in there that'll give you a little bit

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.050 
in there that'll give you a little bit
of<00:01:37.860> an<00:01:37.950> idea<00:01:38.070> what<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.520> looks<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
of an idea what it looks like on the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.780 
of an idea what it looks like on the
inside<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:42.350> there's<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.640> there's<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.700> few

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
inside and there's a there's a few

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.219 
inside and there's a there's a few
screws<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.330> there<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.690> can<00:01:45.810> adjust<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
screws in there so you can adjust the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.160 
screws in there so you can adjust the
springs<00:01:47.180> if<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.300> want<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> tension<00:01:48.900> a<00:01:48.960> little

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
springs if you want the tension a little

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.359 
springs if you want the tension a little
tighter<00:01:49.380> or<00:01:49.650> a<00:01:49.680> little<00:01:49.979> lighter<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:52.369> it's

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
tighter or a little lighter and it's

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.529 
tighter or a little lighter and it's
just<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:53.820> really<00:01:53.880> cool<00:01:54.210> for<00:01:54.390> doing

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
just it's really cool for doing

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.020 
just it's really cool for doing
everything<00:01:55.080> I<00:01:55.320> mean<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.700> first<00:01:56.700> time<00:01:56.880> I

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
everything I mean the first time I

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.480 
everything I mean the first time I
played<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.330> I<00:01:57.509> played<00:01:57.960> E<00:01:58.710> minor<00:01:58.950> chord<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:02.100> it

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
played it I played E minor chord and it

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.770 
played it I played E minor chord and it
just<00:02:02.700> sounded<00:02:02.880> really<00:02:03.030> cool<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.479> kept

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
just sounded really cool so I just kept

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:15.679 
just sounded really cool so I just kept
on<00:02:03.869> going

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.849 

therefore<00:02:16.689> songs<00:02:16.900> you're<00:02:17.140> playing<00:02:17.379> if<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.709> if
