you<00:00:13.290> stand<00:00:13.590> from<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.860> golf<00:00:14.089> it's<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.179> question

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
you stand from the golf it's a question

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.090 
you stand from the golf it's a question
we<00:00:15.570> get<00:00:15.660> asked<00:00:15.960> quite<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.289> lot<00:00:16.379> going<00:00:16.500> Academy

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
we get asked quite a lot going Academy

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.740 
we get asked quite a lot going Academy
golfers<00:00:17.460> are<00:00:17.580> very<00:00:17.789> very<00:00:17.940> unsure<00:00:18.119> about<00:00:18.510> how

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
golfers are very very unsure about how

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.090 
golfers are very very unsure about how
far<00:00:19.080> right<00:00:19.230> from<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.439> golf<00:00:19.619> ball<00:00:19.800> they<00:00:19.890> should

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
far right from the golf ball they should

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.980 
far right from the golf ball they should
stand<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:21.119> often<00:00:21.449> they<00:00:21.539> come<00:00:21.750> with<00:00:21.900> these

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
stand and often they come with these

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.200 
stand and often they come with these
ideas<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.769> they've<00:00:22.890> been<00:00:23.039> given<00:00:23.460> about<00:00:23.580> sort

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
ideas that they've been given about sort

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.029 
ideas that they've been given about sort
of<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:25.050> know<00:00:25.109> checkpoints<00:00:25.740> or<00:00:25.859> ways<00:00:26.010> that

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
of you know checkpoints or ways that

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.529 
of you know checkpoints or ways that
they<00:00:26.250> can<00:00:26.400> test<00:00:26.640> whether<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.060> right<00:00:27.210> distance

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
they can test whether the right distance

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.540 
they can test whether the right distance
to<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.689> ball<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.650> by<00:00:28.769> doing<00:00:28.980> these<00:00:29.189> they<00:00:29.490> can

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
to the ball and by doing these they can

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.550 
to the ball and by doing these they can
sort<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.090> help<00:00:30.480> somewhere<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.140> game<00:00:31.380> but

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
sort of help somewhere is the game but

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.410 
sort of help somewhere is the game but
maybe<00:00:31.679> maybe<00:00:32.340> not<00:00:32.550> help<00:00:32.759> other<00:00:32.910> heirs<00:00:33.149> again

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
maybe maybe not help other heirs again

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.080 
maybe maybe not help other heirs again
so<00:00:33.770> the<00:00:34.770> key<00:00:35.040> thing<00:00:35.340> here<00:00:35.370> would<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.790> there<00:00:35.969> is

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
so the key thing here would be there is

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.850 
so the key thing here would be there is
no<00:00:36.329> correct<00:00:36.690> distance<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.350> shunt<00:00:37.620> sorry

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
no correct distance that you shunt sorry

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.740 
no correct distance that you shunt sorry
there<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.129> no<00:00:38.160> one<00:00:38.730> distance<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.450> stand

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
there is no one distance that you stand

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.290 
there is no one distance that you stand
from<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.170> golf<00:00:40.350> ball<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:41.040> will<00:00:41.340> vary<00:00:41.760> as<00:00:42.000> you

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
from the golf ball it will vary as you

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.810 
from the golf ball it will vary as you
change<00:00:42.629> clubs<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.559> as<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.800> change<00:00:43.829> shots<00:00:44.520> and

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
change clubs and as you change shots and

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.069 
change clubs and as you change shots and
that's<00:00:45.120> really<00:00:45.360> really<00:00:45.510> important<00:00:46.020> to

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
that's really really important to

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.869 
that's really really important to
understand<00:00:46.469> okay<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:46.829> any<00:00:47.250> checkpoints

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
understand okay so any checkpoints

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.150 
understand okay so any checkpoints
you've<00:00:48.090> maybe<00:00:48.480> been<00:00:48.719> given<00:00:49.110> we're<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
you've maybe been given we're going to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.200 
you've maybe been given we're going to
go<00:00:50.250> through<00:00:50.430> some<00:00:50.640> other<00:00:50.670> what<00:00:50.940> some<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.120> those

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
go through some other what some of those

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.330 
go through some other what some of those
might<00:00:51.449> be<00:00:51.480> will<00:00:52.230> maybe<00:00:52.469> work<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:52.770> some<00:00:53.070> clubs

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
might be will maybe work with some clubs

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.010 
might be will maybe work with some clubs
that<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.579> can't<00:00:53.879> apply<00:00:54.180> those<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.629> all<00:00:54.750> clubs

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
that we can't apply those to all clubs

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.110 
that we can't apply those to all clubs
so<00:00:55.440> I've<00:00:55.710> got<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.160> section<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.670> golf<00:00:56.789> clubs<00:00:56.879> here

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
so I've got a section of golf clubs here

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.330 
so I've got a section of golf clubs here
I've<00:00:57.180> got<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> six<00:00:57.539> line<00:00:57.680> I've<00:00:58.680> got<00:00:59.039> one<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.309> my

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
I've got a six line I've got one of my

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.599 
I've got a six line I've got one of my
wedges<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.120> I've<00:01:00.390> got<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> driver<00:01:01.070> so<00:01:02.070> if<00:01:02.340> I

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
wedges and I've got the driver so if I

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.440 
wedges and I've got the driver so if I
take<00:01:02.760> my<00:01:02.820> set<00:01:03.120> up<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.420> 6-iron<00:01:05.270> then<00:01:06.270> I

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
take my set up with a 6-iron then I

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.330 
take my set up with a 6-iron then I
certainly<00:01:06.990> would<00:01:07.229> want<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.770> little<00:01:08.130> bit<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.310> a

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
certainly would want a little bit of a

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.100 
certainly would want a little bit of a
gap<00:01:08.549> between<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.210> butt<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.750> club<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:10.020> my

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
gap between the butt of the club in my

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.320 
gap between the butt of the club in my
legs<00:01:10.320> now<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.280> past<00:01:11.520> some<00:01:11.909> golfers<00:01:12.210> have

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
legs now in the past some golfers have

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.550 
legs now in the past some golfers have
been<00:01:12.450> told<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.900> should<00:01:12.930> be<00:01:13.229> able<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.409> get

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
been told that you should be able to get

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.469 
been told that you should be able to get
your<00:01:13.680> hand<00:01:13.890> through<00:01:14.250> there<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.729> that's<00:01:15.210> not<00:01:15.420> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
your hand through there and that's not a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.120 
your hand through there and that's not a
bad<00:01:15.720> guide<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.020> would<00:01:16.320> say<00:01:16.439> that's<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.740> pretty

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
bad guide I would say that's a pretty

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.190 
bad guide I would say that's a pretty
standard<00:01:17.670> way<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.880> tech<00:01:18.180> saying<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.960> should

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
standard way of tech saying you should

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.570 
standard way of tech saying you should
be<00:01:19.320> able<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.530> get<00:01:19.710> your<00:01:19.830> hand<00:01:20.100> between<00:01:20.280> your

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
be able to get your hand between your

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.700 
be able to get your hand between your
legs<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.960> grip<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.350> club<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.650> that's

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
legs and the grip of the club and that's

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.530 
legs and the grip of the club and that's
going<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> put<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.430> roughly<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.420> right

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
going to put you roughly the right

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.969 
going to put you roughly the right
distance<00:01:24.869> away<00:01:25.049> from<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.320> golf<00:01:25.530> ball<00:01:25.770> with

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
distance away from the golf ball with

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.620 
distance away from the golf ball with
that<00:01:26.189> six<00:01:26.490> side<00:01:26.670> okay<00:01:27.240> however<00:01:27.810> if<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.680> change

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
that six side okay however if I change

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.170 
that six side okay however if I change
and<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.810> pick<00:01:31.079> up<00:01:31.229> my<00:01:31.460> one<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.549> my<00:01:32.610> wedges<00:01:32.759> here

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
and I pick up my one of my wedges here

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.210 
and I pick up my one of my wedges here
and<00:01:33.509> let's<00:01:33.869> say<00:01:34.079> I'm<00:01:34.200> going<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.380> play<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.950> little

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
and let's say I'm going to play a little

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.960 
and let's say I'm going to play a little
shot<00:01:35.939> over<00:01:36.299> about<00:01:36.479> 30<00:01:36.780> or<00:01:37.020> 40<00:01:37.049> yards

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
shot over about 30 or 40 yards

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.679 
shot over about 30 or 40 yards
obviously<00:01:38.970> not<00:01:39.090> Littlewood<00:01:39.450> off<00:01:39.570> this

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
obviously not Littlewood off this

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.910 
obviously not Littlewood off this
particular<00:01:39.990> hole<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:40.409> if<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.590> was<00:01:40.680> trying<00:01:40.860> to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
particular hole but if I was trying to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.160 
particular hole but if I was trying to
hit<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> shot<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.400> 30<00:01:41.549> or<00:01:41.729> 40<00:01:42.030> yards<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.570> would

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
hit a shot of 30 or 40 yards I would

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.590 
hit a shot of 30 or 40 yards I would
take<00:01:43.350> my<00:01:43.500> set<00:01:43.740> up<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:45.329> would<00:01:45.390> be

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
take my set up like this and I would be

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.420 
take my set up like this and I would be
much<00:01:45.840> much<00:01:46.049> closer<00:01:46.350> now<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.649> cannot<00:01:47.100> get<00:01:47.310> my

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
much much closer now I cannot get my

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.429 
much much closer now I cannot get my
hand<00:01:47.700> between<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.720> butt<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.049> club<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.380> my

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
hand between the butt of the club and my

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.020 
hand between the butt of the club and my
legs<00:01:49.649> there<00:01:49.860> okay<00:01:50.070> I've<00:01:50.189> got<00:01:50.369> no<00:01:50.670> gap<00:01:50.909> but

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
legs there okay I've got no gap but

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.490 
legs there okay I've got no gap but
probably<00:01:51.299> only<00:01:51.360> got<00:01:51.540> about<00:01:51.780> two<00:01:52.020> inches<00:01:52.320> so

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
probably only got about two inches so

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.740 
probably only got about two inches so
I'm<00:01:52.950> much<00:01:53.220> much<00:01:53.490> closer<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.360> golf<00:01:54.630> ball

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
I'm much much closer to that golf ball

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.630 
I'm much much closer to that golf ball
than<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.259> was<00:01:55.470> with<00:01:55.829> my<00:01:55.950> 6-iron

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
than I was with my 6-iron

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.280 
than I was with my 6-iron
the<00:01:57.000> reason<00:01:57.329> for<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.810> allows<00:01:58.110> my

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the reason for that is that allows my

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.630 
the reason for that is that allows my
arms<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.680> sit<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> little<00:01:59.040> bit<00:01:59.159> more<00:01:59.369> under<00:01:59.549> my

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
arms to sit a little bit more under my

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.080 
arms to sit a little bit more under my
ribcage

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
ribcage

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.880 
ribcage
that<00:02:00.750> allows<00:02:00.990> me<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.140> get<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.380> little<00:02:01.500> more<00:02:01.710> in

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
that allows me to get a little more in

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.410 
that allows me to get a little more in
close<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.310> ball<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.700> allows<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.149> play

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
close to the ball it allows you to play

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.480 
close to the ball it allows you to play
more<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.259> field<00:02:04.500> shot<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:04.950> I'm<00:02:05.070> much<00:02:05.280> much

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
more of a field shot so I'm much much

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.069 
more of a field shot so I'm much much
closer<00:02:05.820> with<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.390> shot<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.719> would<00:02:06.780> struggle

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
closer with that shot I would struggle

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.469 
closer with that shot I would struggle
to<00:02:07.259> play<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.710> shot<00:02:08.090> with<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.300> much

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
to play that shot with that much

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.880 
to play that shot with that much
distance<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:10.110> wouldn't<00:02:10.410> look<00:02:10.530> particularly

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
distance that wouldn't look particularly

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.320 
distance that wouldn't look particularly
Orthodox<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.550> we<00:02:11.610> wouldn't<00:02:11.790> see<00:02:11.849> many<00:02:12.120> good

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
Orthodox and we wouldn't see many good

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.420 
Orthodox and we wouldn't see many good
players<00:02:12.569> adopting<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.140> possess

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
players adopting that possess

players adopting that possess

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
if we then go into the driver so I'm

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.430 
if we then go into the driver so I'm
just<00:02:17.320> going<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.500> peg<00:02:18.130> this<00:02:18.670> one<00:02:18.880> up<00:02:19.170> okay<00:02:20.170> we're

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
checkpoint the most common one we hear

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.380 
checkpoint the most common one we hear
is<00:03:03.400> that<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.610> should<00:03:03.850> be<00:03:03.940> able<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.180> get<00:03:04.300> your

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.790 
hand between the golf club and the legs
it<00:03:07.060> does<00:03:07.330> apply<00:03:07.570> to<00:03:07.660> certain<00:03:08.260> clubs<00:03:08.500> but<00:03:08.680> it

it does apply to certain clubs but it

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.590 
it does apply to certain clubs but it

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
really help you adopt a good starting

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.580 
really help you adopt a good starting
position<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.300> if<00:03:34.780> we<00:03:34.870> can<00:03:34.990> adopt<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.410> good

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
position and if we can adopt a good

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
of making a better goal swing and

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.840 
of making a better goal swing and
obviously<00:03:38.380> hitting<00:03:38.560> better<00:03:38.980> shots<00:03:39.280> so<00:03:39.700> I'm

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
obviously hitting better shots so I'm

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.130 
obviously hitting better shots so I'm
going<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.000> go<00:03:40.120> ahead<00:03:40.210> and<00:03:40.390> hit<00:03:40.540> this<00:03:40.720> circus

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
going to go ahead and hit this circus

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.190 
going to go ahead and hit this circus
driver<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:42.910> you<00:03:42.970> should<00:03:43.390> see<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.810> arms

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
driver so you should see the arms

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.440 
driver so you should see the arms
certainly<00:03:45.100> hanging<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.550> little<00:03:45.850> further<00:03:46.060> away

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
certainly hanging a little further away

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.500 
certainly hanging a little further away
than<00:03:47.050> made<00:03:47.290> what<00:03:47.500> they<00:03:47.620> would<00:03:47.800> with<00:03:47.920> a<00:03:47.980> 6-iron

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
than made what they would with a 6-iron

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.150 
than made what they would with a 6-iron
so<00:03:49.510> if<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:49.900> take<00:03:50.110> my<00:03:50.170> starting<00:03:50.620> position<00:03:50.709> there

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
so if I take my starting position there

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.610 
so if I take my starting position there
you<00:03:51.820> can<00:03:51.970> see<00:03:52.150> there's<00:03:52.330> a<00:03:52.390> good<00:03:52.690> distance<00:03:53.110> it's

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
you can see there's a good distance it's

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.050 
you can see there's a good distance it's
certainly<00:03:54.070> more<00:03:54.220> than<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:54.430> hands<00:03:54.760> width

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
certainly more than a hands width

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.060 
certainly more than a hands width
my<00:03:55.390> arms<00:03:55.720> are<00:03:55.840> maybe<00:03:56.050> hanging<00:03:56.650> a<00:03:56.709> little<00:03:56.950> bit

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
my arms are maybe hanging a little bit

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.340 
my arms are maybe hanging a little bit
more<00:03:57.220> outward<00:03:57.580> in<00:03:57.850> this<00:03:58.420> particular<00:03:58.720> setup<00:03:59.080> so

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
more outward in this particular setup so

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:09.440 
more outward in this particular setup so
let's<00:03:59.530> give<00:03:59.680> it<00:03:59.709> a<00:03:59.830> go<00:04:01.320> okay

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.790 

okay<00:04:10.450> pretty<00:04:10.720> dry<00:04:10.930> pretty<00:04:11.200> good<00:04:11.380> drive<00:04:11.560> I'm

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
okay pretty dry pretty good drive I'm

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.790 
okay pretty dry pretty good drive I'm
happy<00:04:12.040> with<00:04:12.130> that<00:04:13.260> came<00:04:14.260> up<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.470> middle<00:04:14.680> and

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
happy with that came up the middle and

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.170 
happy with that came up the middle and
that<00:04:14.860> allowed<00:04:15.190> me<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.370> get<00:04:15.580> some<00:04:15.790> good<00:04:16.000> speed

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
that allowed me to get some good speed

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.120 
that allowed me to get some good speed
into<00:04:16.660> that<00:04:16.780> Golf<00:04:16.989> Club<00:04:17.080> more<00:04:17.440> rotation<00:04:18.040> the

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
into that Golf Club more rotation the

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.860 
into that Golf Club more rotation the
arms<00:04:18.400> work<00:04:18.580> a<00:04:18.670> little<00:04:18.730> bit<00:04:18.880> more<00:04:19.060> out<00:04:19.209> that

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
arms work a little bit more out that

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.240 
arms work a little bit more out that
helped<00:04:20.080> me<00:04:20.170> hit<00:04:20.290> the<00:04:20.410> center<00:04:20.769> I<00:04:20.860> would<00:04:21.040> not

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
helped me hit the center I would not

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.010 
helped me hit the center I would not
adopt<00:04:21.489> that<00:04:21.640> setup<00:04:21.910> with<00:04:22.120> a<00:04:22.180> 6-iron<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:22.780> would

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
adopt that setup with a 6-iron I would

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.810 
adopt that setup with a 6-iron I would
certainly<00:04:23.200> be<00:04:23.350> a<00:04:23.440> bit<00:04:23.620> closer<00:04:23.830> and<00:04:24.190> certainly

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
certainly be a bit closer and certainly

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.340 
certainly be a bit closer and certainly
for<00:04:24.970> a<00:04:25.030> 3040<00:04:25.600> hour<00:04:25.690> pitch<00:04:25.870> shot<00:04:26.050> I'd<00:04:26.140> be<00:04:26.230> much

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
for a 3040 hour pitch shot I'd be much

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.200 
for a 3040 hour pitch shot I'd be much
much<00:04:26.560> closer<00:04:26.740> still<00:04:27.130> okay<00:04:27.400> so<00:04:27.730> it's<00:04:28.000> something

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
much closer still okay so it's something

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.180 
much closer still okay so it's something
which<00:04:28.450> we<00:04:28.600> really<00:04:28.780> need<00:04:28.990> to<00:04:29.050> understand<00:04:29.440> is

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
which we really need to understand is

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.560 
which we really need to understand is
something<00:04:30.490> we<00:04:30.580> should<00:04:30.610> see<00:04:30.820> golfers<00:04:31.300> get

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
something we should see golfers get
