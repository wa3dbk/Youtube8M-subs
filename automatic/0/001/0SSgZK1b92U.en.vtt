00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
already measured exactly in half and

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.120 
already measured exactly in half and
with<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> ruler<00:00:44.790> i<00:00:44.910> drew<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> line<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:46.130> then

with the ruler i drew a line and then
again<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.969> you're<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.050> measure<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
again so you're going to measure in the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.790 
again so you're going to measure in the
middle<00:00:50.190> where<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:51.030> scores<00:00:51.540> so<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.649> is

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
middle where it's scores so this is

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
going to be where we cut it in half and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.229 
going to be where we cut it in half and
this<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.320> going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.649> be<00:00:55.739> where<00:00:56.040> it<00:00:56.129> scores<00:00:56.489> so

would<00:02:23.280> go<00:02:23.370> like<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.080> before<00:02:25.080> we<00:02:25.260> put<00:02:25.350> the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
would go like that so before we put the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.449 
would go like that so before we put the
ribbon<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.830> bottom<00:02:25.920> we're<00:02:26.160> going<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.340> put

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
ribbon on the bottom we're going to put

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.770 
ribbon on the bottom we're going to put
our<00:02:26.550> number<00:02:28.459> so<00:02:29.459> using<00:02:30.180> another<00:02:30.420> piece<00:02:30.750> of

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
our number so using another piece of

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.600 
our number so using another piece of
glitter<00:02:31.110> paper<00:02:31.319> I'm<00:02:31.620> using<00:02:31.650> Brown<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:32.459> there's

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
glitter paper I'm using Brown so there's

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.440 
glitter paper I'm using Brown so there's
a<00:02:32.670> contrast<00:02:33.150> all<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.720> did<00:02:34.200> was<00:02:34.410> take<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.620> stencil

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
a contrast all I did was take a stencil

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.120 
a contrast all I did was take a stencil
turn<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.540> paper<00:02:36.690> over<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.410> traced<00:02:37.769> the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
turn the paper over and I traced the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.120 
turn the paper over and I traced the
stencils<00:02:39.000> on<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.260> paper<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.680> make<00:02:40.860> sure

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
stencils on to the paper and make sure

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.650 
stencils on to the paper and make sure
that<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.489> trace<00:02:41.760> them<00:02:41.940> backwards<00:02:42.420> because

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
that you trace them backwards because

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.690 
that you trace them backwards because
we're<00:02:43.530> cutting<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:43.950> backwards<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.550> if<00:02:44.610> you

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
we're cutting it backwards so if you

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.890 
we're cutting it backwards so if you
trace<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.000> right-side<00:02:45.300> up

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
trace it right-side up

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.390 
trace it right-side up
your<00:02:46.200> number<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.500> going<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.739> be<00:02:46.800> backwards<00:02:47.250> on

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
your number is going to be backwards on

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.600 
your number is going to be backwards on
the<00:02:47.459> glitter<00:02:47.670> paper<00:02:47.850> so<00:02:48.630> turn<00:02:48.900> them<00:02:49.050> over<00:02:49.610> and

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
the glitter paper so turn them over and

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.360 
the glitter paper so turn them over and
with<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.850> pencil<00:02:51.980> you're<00:02:52.980> just<00:02:53.160> going<00:02:53.310> to

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
with the pencil you're just going to

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.449 
with the pencil you're just going to
trace<00:02:53.610> around<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.970> numbers<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:56.250> get<00:02:56.370> them

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
trace around the numbers and get them

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:04.449 
trace around the numbers and get them
really<00:02:56.670> close<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.120> sheet<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:58.350> save<00:02:58.560> space

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.480 

trace<00:03:05.000> around

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.440 

and<00:03:10.390> you'll<00:03:10.510> cut<00:03:10.690> them<00:03:10.840> all<00:03:10.960> out

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.190 

you<00:03:15.080> want<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.349> cut<00:03:15.590> straight<00:03:16.010> as<00:03:16.310> possible<00:03:17.200> so

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
you want to cut straight as possible so

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.440 
you want to cut straight as possible so
you<00:03:18.290> get<00:03:18.410> a<00:03:18.440> clean<00:03:19.010> edge<00:03:19.250> on<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.610> numbers<00:03:22.450> some

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
you get a clean edge on the numbers some

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.910 
you get a clean edge on the numbers some
people<00:03:23.750> make<00:03:23.930> these<00:03:24.080> glitter<00:03:24.349> numbers<00:03:24.739> with

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
people make these glitter numbers with

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.240 
people make these glitter numbers with
actual<00:03:25.370> glitter<00:03:25.610> and<00:03:25.879> just<00:03:25.940> glue<00:03:27.040> what<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.069> like

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
actual glitter and just glue what I like

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.680 
actual glitter and just glue what I like
about<00:03:28.370> this<00:03:28.550> glitter<00:03:28.790> paper<00:03:29.000> is<00:03:29.300> it<00:03:29.450> already

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
about this glitter paper is it already

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.380 
about this glitter paper is it already
comes<00:03:30.019> glittered<00:03:30.739> obviously<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:31.550> it's<00:03:32.030> thick

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
comes glittered obviously and it's thick

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.880 
comes glittered obviously and it's thick
and<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.870> glitter<00:03:33.080> doesn't<00:03:33.440> flake<00:03:33.680> off

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
and the glitter doesn't flake off

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.350 
and the glitter doesn't flake off
everywhere<00:03:34.310> when<00:03:34.489> you<00:03:34.519> use<00:03:34.819> your<00:03:34.940> own<00:03:34.970> glitter

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
everywhere when you use your own glitter

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.589 
everywhere when you use your own glitter
it's<00:03:35.630> always<00:03:36.080> all<00:03:36.230> over<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.560> place<00:03:36.769> so<00:03:37.599> I

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
it's always all over the place so I

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.360 
it's always all over the place so I
trace<00:03:39.050> my<00:03:39.080> numbers<00:03:39.530> and<00:03:39.830> all<00:03:39.980> I<00:03:40.010> would<00:03:40.160> do

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
trace my numbers and all I would do

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.059 
trace my numbers and all I would do
after<00:03:40.790> this<00:03:41.269> is<00:03:41.480> cut<00:03:41.690> them<00:03:41.810> out<00:03:41.959> so<00:03:42.590> I<00:03:42.860> have<00:03:43.040> a

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
after this is cut them out so I have a

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.610 
after this is cut them out so I have a
pile<00:03:43.310> already<00:03:43.730> here<00:03:44.030> of<00:03:44.180> cut<00:03:44.840> numbers<00:03:45.200> that

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
pile already here of cut numbers that

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.690 
pile already here of cut numbers that
I'm<00:03:45.739> going<00:03:45.980> to<00:03:46.069> show<00:03:46.220> you<00:03:48.160> I'm<00:03:49.160> going<00:03:49.340> to<00:03:49.489> put

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
I'm going to show you I'm going to put

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.309 
I'm going to show you I'm going to put
one<00:03:49.819> of<00:03:49.849> the<00:03:49.970> numbers<00:03:50.299> on<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.579> table<00:03:52.910> tent

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
one of the numbers on to the table tent

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.589 
one of the numbers on to the table tent
so<00:03:54.319> to<00:03:54.410> do<00:03:54.620> this<00:03:54.860> you<00:03:55.700> can't<00:03:55.940> use<00:03:56.120> glue<00:03:56.360> when

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
so to do this you can't use glue when

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:57.880 
so to do this you can't use glue when
you<00:03:56.690> use<00:03:56.840> glue<00:03:57.079> on<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.290> back<00:03:57.410> of<00:03:57.560> this<00:03:57.650> glitter

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
you use glue on the back of this glitter

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.130 
you use glue on the back of this glitter
paper<00:03:58.069> it<00:03:58.400> curls<00:03:58.760> up<00:03:58.970> and<00:03:59.239> it<00:03:59.720> doesn't<00:03:59.930> look

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
paper it curls up and it doesn't look

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.490 
paper it curls up and it doesn't look
good

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
good

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.910 
good
so<00:04:00.799> I<00:04:00.829> have<00:04:01.569> right<00:04:02.569> here<00:04:02.650> double-sided<00:04:03.650> tape

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
so I have right here double-sided tape

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.490 
so I have right here double-sided tape
this<00:04:04.700> is<00:04:04.880> foam<00:04:05.209> tape<00:04:05.569> so<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:05.930> number<00:04:06.200> sticks

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
this is foam tape so the number sticks

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.140 
this is foam tape so the number sticks
out<00:04:06.680> a<00:04:06.709> little<00:04:07.069> bit<00:04:07.280> from<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:08.000> card<00:04:08.209> stock<00:04:08.450> and

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
out a little bit from the card stock and

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:17.990 
out a little bit from the card stock and
I'm<00:04:11.150> going<00:04:11.269> to<00:04:11.299> cut<00:04:11.480> this<00:04:11.569> in<00:04:11.750> half

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.700 

I'm<00:04:18.570> going<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:18.780> use<00:04:18.930> two<00:04:19.170> pieces<00:04:21.380> peel<00:04:22.380> off<00:04:22.560> the

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
I'm going to use two pieces peel off the

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.520 
I'm going to use two pieces peel off the
backer<00:04:22.920> this<00:04:23.520> couldn't<00:04:23.970> be<00:04:24.060> more<00:04:24.480> simple

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.500 

you're<00:04:28.530> going<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:28.800> stick<00:04:29.130> it<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.970> center

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
you're going to stick it to the center

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.830 
you're going to stick it to the center
of<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.950> table<00:04:32.250> tent<00:04:32.460> just<00:04:32.730> get<00:04:33.480> it<00:04:33.570> right<00:04:33.720> in

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
of the table tent just get it right in

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:42.020 
of the table tent just get it right in
the<00:04:33.930> center<00:04:34.490> just<00:04:35.490> press<00:04:35.670> down<00:04:39.680> alright<00:04:41.030> so
