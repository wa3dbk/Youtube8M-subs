00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
level and you're trying to hit that

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.450 
level and you're trying to hit that
those<00:00:24.420> two<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.439> middle<00:00:25.560> with<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.250> white

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
those two in the middle with this white

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.529 
those two in the middle with this white
bird<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.539> go<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:29.420> hit<00:00:30.420> in

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
bird so you go like this and you hit in

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.450 
bird so you go like this and you hit in
the<00:00:30.630> middle<00:00:30.960> but<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.289> find<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:32.430> happens<00:00:34.460> as

the middle but you find this happens as

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.180 
the middle but you find this happens as
you<00:00:35.610> can<00:00:35.730> see<00:00:35.989> there<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> bird<00:00:37.500> there<00:00:37.739> which

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
you can see there is a bird there which

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.580 
you can see there is a bird there which
is<00:00:38.370> practically<00:00:38.969> impossible<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.660> get<00:00:39.930> with

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
is practically impossible to get with

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.500 
is practically impossible to get with
the<00:00:40.890> two<00:00:41.190> birds<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.730> have<00:00:41.879> remaining<00:00:42.180> and

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the two birds that I have remaining and

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.860 
the two birds that I have remaining and
hoffa<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.170> also<00:00:43.680> these<00:00:44.430> two<00:00:44.730> birds<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.629> what

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
hoffa and also these two birds so what

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.170 
hoffa and also these two birds so what
you<00:00:45.989> think<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.410> common<00:00:47.100> sense<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.760> will<00:00:48.059> it

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
you think is common sense that will it

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.450 
you think is common sense that will it
should<00:00:48.390> work<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:49.350> not<00:00:49.620> always<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.100> case<00:00:50.160> in

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
should work it's not always the case in

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.279 
should work it's not always the case in

I'm trying to get to in this tip is if

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.789 
I'm trying to get to in this tip is if
you're<00:01:25.950> stuck<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.330> you're<00:01:27.570> you're<00:01:28.320> trying<00:01:28.590> to

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
you're stuck and you're you're trying to

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.050 
you're stuck and you're you're trying to
do<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.100> same<00:01:29.310> thing<00:01:29.490> over<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.759> over<00:01:29.850> again

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
do the same thing over and over again

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.969 
do the same thing over and over again
well<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:30.990> think<00:01:31.200> maybe<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.740> same

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
well just think maybe that the same

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.980 
well just think maybe that the same
thing<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.520> shouldn't<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.479> doesn't<00:01:33.869> really

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
thing it shouldn't it doesn't really

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.929 
thing it shouldn't it doesn't really
work<00:01:34.229> because<00:01:34.650> you've<00:01:35.040> been<00:01:35.189> doing<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.610> so

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
work because you've been doing it so

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.109 
work because you've been doing it so
much<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.200> much<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.340> try<00:01:38.790> something

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
much so so much so just try something

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.749 
much so so much so just try something
else<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.630> might<00:01:39.780> not<00:01:40.020> work<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.890> broke<00:01:41.159> drop

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
else that might not work like broke drop

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.350 
else that might not work like broke drop
it<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.090> place<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:43.140> up<00:01:43.259> sure<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:44.729> it

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
it in a place that it's up sure and it

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.460 
it in a place that it's up sure and it
will<00:01:45.570> probably<00:01:45.869> work<00:01:47.270> alright<00:01:48.270> next<00:01:48.479> tip<00:01:48.750> now

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
will probably work alright next tip now

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.980 
will probably work alright next tip now
