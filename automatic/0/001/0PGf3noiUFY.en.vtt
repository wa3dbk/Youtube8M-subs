00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:29.880
 longline fishing is a typical Mediterranean fishing is fishing 

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:31.539
 artisan 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.809
 percent that there were dot that is at the time of crisis by pla the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.710
 industrialization of some fisheries and especially the fishery 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.330
 of bluefin tuna 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.760
 The use of other fishing gears has brought extinction to the edge 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.950
 of this species also other tuna species the swordfish is is another 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.120
 species that is currently in danger 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.920
 And at the same time it's a problem to get away from the fishing stocks 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.920
 but it's a problem for these artisanal fishermen 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.350
 the main problem is this day in this region I am convinced that a 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.399
 the areas with the highest density of torture 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:30.370
 i 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.810
 island the protests this is done very close to the surface 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.470
 the hooks will be very close was the turtles detect them detect 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.630
 Afros visually and smooth nearby 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.610
 to them 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.780
 with which we obtain very high accidental capture rates among 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.790
 two or three intruders four turtles camila fueros 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.530
 in which as important as knowing the number of turtles that sign Santander 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.080
 is to know the injuries that cause are was light is the only thing that will tell us 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.960
 the probability of being spoiled then survives the interaction later or not 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.400
 They are also 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.920
 studying different in handling methods the turtles of 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.810
 extraction of hooks to be able to then train them fishermen in the best 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.889
 techniques 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:16.479
 and it is testing different tools to be able to determine 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.479
 which are the most useful for fishermen 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.149
 toms dressage that are 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:39.339
 It is a fishing boat built in Ireland 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.599
 It is a very solid ship boat of exceptional work 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:48.430
 efe that aena does not serve now as a laboratory we have space for 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.149
 to have 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:51.219
 blood analysis laboratory 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:54.089
 but also a lot of covered space to make brand cd 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:55.419
 of turtles 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.979
 we have a boat that takes a long time and the Mediterranean area kessel 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:00.629
 tost age 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.420
 i with which we go been I shrugged off the wild turtles to put 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:08.419
 in satellite transmitters 

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:19.599
 the most interesting aspects this campaign 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:20.759
 sd 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:23.619
 this collaboration between different groups 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:26.329
 And above all at the international level 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.180
 this this problem that we are dealing with that the mediterranean is a problem 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.419
 which is also common in others - the world 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:37.419
 i the international collaboration especially promoted by groups such as how 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:38.659
 do not 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.389
 to allow progress much more quickly in science but also 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.389
 the in the dif and song and the testing of mitigation measures 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.150
 others believe that this one in 12 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.150
 from within this project s 

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:57.889
 see the effect of stress related to bycatch 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:59.669
 about turtles 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.940
 stress in animals just like in humans 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.560
 can produce very severe physiological changes that can even end 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.579
 with his life the animal 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.909
 of you want like that if the fact of staying up raised is fighting for 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.769
 that cassidz fishhook to rise to the surface to breathe 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.569
 how much it affects 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:20.639
 to the animal and if stress can be enough to even reach 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.840
 kill him after he has released the animal 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.110
 to this what is being done is to work on the longliner all the 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.409
 turtles that are caught 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:31.809
 blood is drawn to assess different around a chair and parameters that 

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:33.490
 they indicate stress 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.000
 and to serve as control let's say to know what is normal in a turtle is 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.550
 is also capturing percent in ten wild turtles 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.150
 which are resting on the surface of the sea are heavier animals that are not 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.830
 you should compare 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.029
 they are also 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:50.099
 ana putting satellite transmitters in both captured turtles 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.199
 propaganda and like normal turtle smuggling 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.180
 to see what happens with them that of veladas if you have years and do not live 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.389
 and be able to relate this to the changes that he has suffered 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.590
 the minimum values ​​and this would give us that stress or stress average and it can be 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.590
 enough to kill the animals 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:13.339
 taking advantage of 

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:16.749
 the work with sea turtles in are being taken samples for others 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:18.370
 research fronts 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.020
 for example with the University of Siena in Italy 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.610
 He is also collaborating for a study that has toxicology 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.809
 stand we love to carapace and skin blood 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:32.379
 that is why it is believed that a state of health of the 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:35.050
 populations of turtles in the Mediterranean relate it to 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.659
 levels of pollutants that the organism has 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.750
 and at the same time this serves to bring us an idea of ​​the levels of 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:44.090
 toxic pollutants that in the Mediterranean Sea through the species 

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.759
 who live in it
