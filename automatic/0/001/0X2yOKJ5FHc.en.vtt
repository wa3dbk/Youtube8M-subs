welcome back to block-by-block this
episode<00:00:02.280> we<00:00:02.580> are<00:00:02.610> looking<00:00:03.149> into<00:00:03.330> the<00:00:03.750> advanced

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
episode we are looking into the advanced

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.980 
episode we are looking into the advanced
pipes<00:00:04.710> in<00:00:05.160> red<00:00:06.000> power<00:00:06.240> we<00:00:06.600> looked<00:00:06.779> at<00:00:06.899> the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
pipes in red power we looked at the

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.799 
pipes in red power we looked at the
basic<00:00:07.140> pneumatic<00:00:07.740> tubes<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:09.480> trans

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
basic pneumatic tubes and the trans

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.470 
basic pneumatic tubes and the trans
posers<00:00:10.340> last<00:00:11.340> episode<00:00:11.849> so<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.269> episode

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
posers last episode so this episode

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.089 
posers last episode so this episode
we're<00:00:12.870> going<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.139> look<00:00:13.259> into<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.950> other

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
we're going to look into the other

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.129 
we're going to look into the other
flavours<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.700> tubes<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.330> come<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:15.719> red<00:00:15.870> power

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
flavours of tubes that come in red power

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.429 
flavours of tubes that come in red power
now<00:00:16.920> we<00:00:17.340> use<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.670> system<00:00:18.029> last<00:00:18.210> episode<00:00:18.779> when

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
now we use the system last episode when

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.859 
now we use the system last episode when
we<00:00:19.590> were<00:00:19.740> discussing<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.640> tubes<00:00:21.300> send

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
we were discussing that tubes send

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.630 
we were discussing that tubes send
inventories<00:00:22.470> based<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:22.859> length<00:00:23.100> basically

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
inventories based on length basically

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.740 
inventories based on length basically
we'll<00:00:23.760> send<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> first<00:00:24.510> available

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
we'll send it to the first available

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.990 
we'll send it to the first available
inventory<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:26.160> talked<00:00:26.369> about<00:00:26.490> how<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.760> one

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
inventory we talked about how this one

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.970 
inventory we talked about how this one
was<00:00:27.119> full<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.480> chests<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.470> won't<00:00:28.680> be<00:00:28.769> able<00:00:28.920> to

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
was full of chests so won't be able to

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.519 
was full of chests so won't be able to
receive<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.279> piece<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.640> cobble<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:31.050> one<00:00:31.289> was

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
receive a piece of cobble this one was

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.959 
receive a piece of cobble this one was
receiving<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.099> piece<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.460> cobble<00:00:32.730> because<00:00:32.880> it

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
receiving the piece of cobble because it

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.520 
receiving the piece of cobble because it
was<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.180> closest<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:33.930> one's<00:00:34.110> empty<00:00:34.260> cos

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
was the closest and this one's empty cos

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.220 
was the closest and this one's empty cos
it<00:00:34.649> didn't<00:00:34.860> receive<00:00:35.100> anything<00:00:36.020> well<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.079> can

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
it didn't receive anything well you can

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.260 
it didn't receive anything well you can
see<00:00:37.410> since<00:00:37.739> then<00:00:37.950> I've<00:00:38.070> put<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.730> pipe<00:00:39.030> on

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
see since then I've put this pipe on

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.389 
see since then I've put this pipe on
this<00:00:39.600> chest<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.989> has<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.350> weird<00:00:40.649> grey<00:00:41.070> band

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
this chest that has this weird grey band

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.790 
this chest that has this weird grey band
now<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.540> called<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.840> restriction<00:00:43.200> tube<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
now this is called a restriction tube a

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.889 
now this is called a restriction tube a
restriction<00:00:44.430> tube<00:00:44.789> counts<00:00:45.239> as<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> thousand

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
restriction tube counts as a thousand

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.830 
restriction tube counts as a thousand
blocks<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.800> basically<00:00:47.399> when<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.059> send<00:00:48.600> this

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
blocks so basically when I send this

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.119 
blocks so basically when I send this
piece<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.230> cobble<00:00:49.500> through<00:00:49.620> here<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:49.980> going

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
piece of cobble through here it's going

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.010 
piece of cobble through here it's going
which<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.309> schroeder<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.820> thousand<00:00:51.420> blocks<00:00:51.719> or

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
which is schroeder a thousand blocks or

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.990 
which is schroeder a thousand blocks or
three<00:00:52.710> blocks<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.430> course<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:53.789> going<00:00:53.940> to

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
three blocks and of course it's going to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.180 
three blocks and of course it's going to
go<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.270> three<00:00:54.510> blocks<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.800> restriction

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
go for three blocks so this restriction

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.700 
go for three blocks so this restriction
tube<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.670> an<00:00:56.789> easy<00:00:57.059> way<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.690> set<00:00:58.230> up<00:00:58.260> something

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
tube is an easy way to set up something

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.830 
tube is an easy way to set up something
like<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.890> fail-safe<00:00:59.250> chest<00:00:59.850> basically<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.719> you

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
like a fail-safe chest basically if you

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.689 
like a fail-safe chest basically if you
only<00:01:01.050> want<00:01:01.379> items<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.949> go<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.340> inventory

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
only want items to go to this inventory

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.880 
only want items to go to this inventory
if<00:01:03.090> all<00:01:03.239> else<00:01:03.449> fails<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.470> set<00:01:04.650> up<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.769> nice

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
if all else fails you can set up a nice

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.350 
if all else fails you can set up a nice
little<00:01:04.920> restriction<00:01:05.610> tube<00:01:05.820> for<00:01:06.060> something

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
little restriction tube for something

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.789 
little restriction tube for something
like<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:07.220> now<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.549> next<00:01:08.880> one<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.799> redstone

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
like that now the next one is redstone

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.460 
like that now the next one is redstone
tube<00:01:11.130> now<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:12.360> talked<00:01:12.570> previously<00:01:12.659> about<00:01:13.170> how

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
tube now we talked previously about how

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.280 
tube now we talked previously about how
you<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.040> send<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.549> redstone<00:01:15.270> signal<00:01:15.390> into

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
you have to send a redstone signal into

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.960 
you have to send a redstone signal into
these<00:01:16.439> transposes<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.520> get<00:01:17.640> them<00:01:17.820> working

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
these transposes to get them working

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.789 
these transposes to get them working
well<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> whole<00:01:19.350> system<00:01:19.680> of

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
well if you have a whole system of

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.920 
well if you have a whole system of
transposes<00:01:20.430> would<00:01:20.549> be<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> real<00:01:20.970> pain<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.780> try

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
transposes would be a real pain to try

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.440 
transposes would be a real pain to try
to<00:01:22.049> wire<00:01:22.560> up<00:01:22.830> something<00:01:23.189> convoluted<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.390> you

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
to wire up something convoluted so you

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.820 
to wire up something convoluted so you
can<00:01:24.630> actually<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:25.049> use<00:01:25.200> these<00:01:25.350> pipes<00:01:25.650> that

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
can actually just use these pipes that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.399 
can actually just use these pipes that
feel<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.670> themselves<00:01:26.970> carry<00:01:27.840> redstone

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
feel that themselves carry redstone

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.230 
feel that themselves carry redstone
signal<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:29.250> can<00:01:29.310> actually<00:01:29.759> see<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.090> these

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
signal you can actually see that these

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.660 
signal you can actually see that these
pipes<00:01:30.659> are<00:01:31.020> look<00:01:31.619> as<00:01:31.860> if<00:01:32.070> they're<00:01:32.220> connected

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
pipes are look as if they're connected

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.039 
pipes are look as if they're connected
to<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.880> button<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.390> that's<00:01:33.540> because<00:01:33.869> they

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
to this button and that's because they

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.319 
to this button and that's because they
are<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.920> if<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.070> push<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.430> button<00:01:35.640> you'll<00:01:36.240> see

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
are so if I push this button you'll see

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.510 
are so if I push this button you'll see
it<00:01:36.509> lights<00:01:36.720> up<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.680> activates<00:01:37.979> both<00:01:38.220> of

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
it lights up and it activates both of

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.480 
it lights up and it activates both of
these<00:01:38.640> transposes<00:01:39.390> which<00:01:39.990> send<00:01:40.560> Kabul<00:01:41.040> out<00:01:41.189> of

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
these transposes which send Kabul out of

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.149 
these transposes which send Kabul out of
their<00:01:41.880> inventories<00:01:42.659> out<00:01:43.009> of<00:01:44.009> these

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
their inventories out of these

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.460 
their inventories out of these
inventories<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.030> into<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.049> one<00:01:46.320> down<00:01:46.560> here

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
inventories and into this one down here

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.710 
inventories and into this one down here
now<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.890> final<00:01:50.280> new<00:01:50.640> pipe<00:01:50.909> we<00:01:51.299> have<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.540> talk

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
now the final new pipe we have to talk

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.660 
now the final new pipe we have to talk
about<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:52.110> slightly<00:01:52.320> more<00:01:52.560> complicated<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.399> is

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
about is slightly more complicated it is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.760 
about is slightly more complicated it is
the<00:01:54.299> mag<00:01:54.869> tube<00:01:55.500> pipe<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:57.350> you<00:01:58.350> can<00:01:58.469> see<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:58.680> have

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
the mag tube pipe so you can see we have

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.959 
the mag tube pipe so you can see we have
some<00:01:58.920> cobble<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.430> there<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.759> if<00:01:59.850> you're

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
some cobble in there and if you're

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.120 
some cobble in there and if you're
traveling<00:02:00.390> long<00:02:00.540> distances<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.860> don't<00:02:02.009> want

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
traveling long distances you don't want

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.830 
traveling long distances you don't want
the<00:02:02.189> item<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.579> take<00:02:02.610> forever<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.329> using<00:02:03.630> mag

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
the item to take forever so using mag

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.260 
the item to take forever so using mag
pipes<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.380> accelerators<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.100> can<00:02:05.340> go<00:02:05.520> whoosh

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
pipes and accelerators you can go whoosh

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.609 
pipes and accelerators you can go whoosh
see<00:02:07.079> how<00:02:07.229> fast<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.710> flew<00:02:07.950> by<00:02:07.979> us<00:02:08.340> right<00:02:08.369> there

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
see how fast that flew by us right there

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.610 
see how fast that flew by us right there
let's<00:02:10.569> let's<00:02:11.569> try<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:11.810> again<00:02:11.959> and<00:02:12.260> watch<00:02:12.440> it

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
let's let's try it again and watch it

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.479 
let's let's try it again and watch it
from<00:02:12.739> down<00:02:12.980> here<00:02:13.459> so<00:02:14.290> see<00:02:15.290> flies<00:02:15.980> by<00:02:16.160> super

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
from down here so see flies by super

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.210 
from down here so see flies by super
fast<00:02:16.700> in<00:02:16.910> these<00:02:17.000> mag<00:02:17.330> tubes<00:02:18.129> so<00:02:19.129> basically

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
fast in these mag tubes so basically

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.670 
fast in these mag tubes so basically
these<00:02:22.220> mag<00:02:22.519> tubes<00:02:22.879> are<00:02:23.120> basically<00:02:23.680> magnetic

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
these mag tubes are basically magnetic

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.940 
these mag tubes are basically magnetic
tubes<00:02:25.160> they<00:02:25.700> create<00:02:26.450> frictionless<00:02:27.319> motion

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
tubes they create frictionless motion

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.140 
tubes they create frictionless motion
and<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:30.080> do<00:02:30.319> this<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:31.040> need<00:02:31.250> an<00:02:31.430> accelerator

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
and to do this you need an accelerator

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.289 
and to do this you need an accelerator
you<00:02:32.690> have<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:33.319> attach<00:02:33.980> an<00:02:34.340> accelerator<00:02:35.030> to

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
you have to attach an accelerator to

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.210 
you have to attach an accelerator to
normal<00:02:35.629> tubes<00:02:35.900> because<00:02:36.440> these<00:02:36.590> mag<00:02:36.860> tubes

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
normal tubes because these mag tubes

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.100 
normal tubes because these mag tubes
don't<00:02:37.459> even<00:02:37.730> connect<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.360> inventories<00:02:38.989> and

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
don't even connect to inventories and

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.720 
don't even connect to inventories and
they<00:02:39.170> also<00:02:39.319> don't<00:02:39.650> connect<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.010> normal<00:02:40.430> tubes

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
they also don't connect to normal tubes

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.420 
they also don't connect to normal tubes
so<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.599> get<00:02:41.750> them<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:41.989> go<00:02:42.170> into<00:02:42.380> mag<00:02:42.620> pipes<00:02:42.950> you

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
so to get them to go into mag pipes you

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.390 
so to get them to go into mag pipes you
have<00:02:43.549> to<00:02:43.670> use<00:02:43.819> an<00:02:43.940> accelerator<00:02:44.299> and<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:46.220> can

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
have to use an accelerator and you can

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.949 
have to use an accelerator and you can
see<00:02:46.610> if<00:02:46.819> you<00:02:46.940> through<00:02:47.120> an<00:02:47.239> accelerator<00:02:47.690> down

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
see if you through an accelerator down

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.100 
see if you through an accelerator down
like<00:02:48.200> this<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.299> it<00:02:50.450> doesn't<00:02:50.630> even<00:02:50.750> light

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
like this and that it doesn't even light

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.839 
like this and that it doesn't even light
up<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:51.530> we'll<00:02:51.650> just<00:02:51.769> go<00:02:51.890> ahead<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.310> throw<00:02:52.640> down

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
up so we'll just go ahead and throw down

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:59.350 
up so we'll just go ahead and throw down
our<00:02:53.180> tubes<00:02:55.959> like<00:02:56.959> so<00:02:57.500> oh<00:02:57.879> okay<00:02:58.879> so<00:02:59.090> this<00:02:59.239> is

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
our tubes like so oh okay so this is

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.850 
our tubes like so oh okay so this is
facing<00:02:59.569> the<00:02:59.750> wrong<00:02:59.989> way<00:03:00.049> and<00:03:00.470> this<00:03:00.530> is<00:03:00.590> where

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
facing the wrong way and this is where

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.569 
facing the wrong way and this is where
screw<00:03:01.099> drivers<00:03:01.489> come<00:03:01.670> in<00:03:01.790> handy<00:03:02.379> for<00:03:03.579> rotating

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
screw drivers come in handy for rotating

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:16.530 
screw drivers come in handy for rotating
the<00:03:05.420> direction<00:03:06.110> of<00:03:06.230> your<00:03:06.890> machine<00:03:12.099> come<00:03:13.099> on

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:24.809 

okay<00:03:17.540> let's<00:03:17.569> try<00:03:17.959> this<00:03:18.079> again

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:31.500 

what<00:03:25.819> is<00:03:26.000> your<00:03:26.209> problem

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:39.100 

there<00:03:32.510> we<00:03:32.690> go<00:03:32.810> okay<00:03:34.360> so<00:03:36.850> you<00:03:37.850> have<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.030> put<00:03:38.930> your

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
there we go okay so you have to put your

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.320 
there we go okay so you have to put your
mag<00:03:39.380> tube<00:03:39.710> down<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.370> right<00:03:40.610> click<00:03:40.880> to<00:03:40.910> connect

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
mag tube down and right click to connect

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.710 
mag tube down and right click to connect
it<00:03:41.420> like<00:03:41.570> that<00:03:41.840> and<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.980> get<00:03:43.220> these<00:03:43.970> little

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
it like that and you get these little

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.210 
it like that and you get these little
fancy<00:03:45.020> mag<00:03:45.440> tube<00:03:45.770> in<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.220> middle<00:03:46.640> and<00:03:48.070> like<00:03:49.070> I

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
fancy mag tube in the middle and like I

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.860 
fancy mag tube in the middle and like I
said<00:03:49.280> mag<00:03:49.670> tubes<00:03:49.970> don't<00:03:50.270> connect<00:03:50.660> to

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
said mag tubes don't connect to

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.670 
said mag tubes don't connect to
inventories<00:03:51.830> or<00:03:52.070> normal<00:03:52.730> pipes<00:03:53.030> so<00:03:53.990> you<00:03:54.050> have

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
inventories or normal pipes so you have

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.730 
inventories or normal pipes so you have
to<00:03:55.130> you<00:03:55.370> have<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.760> you<00:03:56.150> have<00:03:56.330> to<00:03:56.930> use<00:03:57.530> these

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
to you have to you have to use these

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.210 
to you have to you have to use these
accelerators<00:03:58.610> in<00:03:58.910> between<00:03:59.540> mag<00:03:59.810> pipes<00:04:00.220> normal

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
accelerators in between mag pipes normal

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.400 
accelerators in between mag pipes normal
pipes<00:04:01.459> and<00:04:01.670> inventories<00:04:02.360> to<00:04:02.390> accelerate<00:04:03.260> the

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
pipes and inventories to accelerate the

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.470 
pipes and inventories to accelerate the
items<00:04:03.800> and<00:04:04.130> then<00:04:04.340> to<00:04:04.520> decelerate<00:04:04.910> them<00:04:05.330> back

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
items and then to decelerate them back

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.960 
items and then to decelerate them back
into<00:04:05.720> this<00:04:05.840> pipe<00:04:06.110> now<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:07.130> question<00:04:07.610> is<00:04:07.730> what

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
into this pipe now the question is what

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.340 
into this pipe now the question is what
is<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.270> texture<00:04:08.600> difference<00:04:08.930> why<00:04:09.050> is<00:04:09.110> this

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
is the texture difference why is this

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.020 
is the texture difference why is this
one<00:04:09.530> all<00:04:09.650> dull<00:04:09.920> looking<00:04:10.280> and<00:04:10.489> why<00:04:10.580> is<00:04:10.640> this<00:04:10.820> one

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
one all dull looking and why is this one

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.150 
one all dull looking and why is this one
all<00:04:11.150> cool<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:11.660> lit<00:04:11.989> up<00:04:12.140> well<00:04:12.709> that<00:04:12.739> is<00:04:13.010> because

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
all cool and lit up well that is because

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.270 
all cool and lit up well that is because
these<00:04:13.640> fancy<00:04:14.420> accelerators<00:04:14.989> use<00:04:15.170> power<00:04:15.500> so<00:04:16.250> I

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
these fancy accelerators use power so I

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.920 
these fancy accelerators use power so I
just<00:04:16.459> have<00:04:16.609> a<00:04:16.640> bat<00:04:16.940> box<00:04:17.209> set<00:04:17.510> up<00:04:17.660> with<00:04:17.900> some

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
just have a bat box set up with some

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.900 
just have a bat box set up with some
solar<00:04:18.350> panels<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:19.010> a<00:04:19.100> bat<00:04:19.250> box<00:04:19.459> set<00:04:19.700> up<00:04:19.790> with

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
solar panels and a bat box set up with

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.600 
solar panels and a bat box set up with
some<00:04:19.940> solar<00:04:20.239> panels<00:04:20.299> here<00:04:20.660> to<00:04:20.810> power<00:04:21.049> them<00:04:21.350> and

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
some solar panels here to power them and

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.440 
some solar panels here to power them and
actually<00:04:24.250> they<00:04:25.250> only<00:04:25.580> need<00:04:26.030> power<00:04:26.300> to

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
actually they only need power to

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.440 
actually they only need power to
accelerate<00:04:27.230> on<00:04:27.560> items<00:04:28.100> not<00:04:28.340> to<00:04:28.550> D<00:04:28.850> accelerate

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
accelerate on items not to D accelerate

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.200 
accelerate on items not to D accelerate
items<00:04:29.750> so<00:04:30.380> if<00:04:30.500> I<00:04:30.590> get<00:04:30.770> rid<00:04:30.919> of<00:04:30.950> this<00:04:31.340> put<00:04:31.970> an

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
items so if I get rid of this put an

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.360 
items so if I get rid of this put an
accelerator<00:04:32.900> back<00:04:33.140> in<00:04:35.830> come<00:04:36.830> on<00:04:36.950> there<00:04:37.220> we<00:04:37.340> go

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
accelerator back in come on there we go

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.270 
accelerator back in come on there we go
and<00:04:38.770> then<00:04:39.770> send<00:04:40.070> an<00:04:40.160> item<00:04:40.460> out<00:04:41.440> whoosh<00:04:42.440> you<00:04:43.130> can

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
and then send an item out whoosh you can

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.760 
and then send an item out whoosh you can
see<00:04:43.430> it's<00:04:43.580> still<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.600> accelerates<00:04:45.229> the<00:04:45.440> item

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
see it's still the accelerates the item

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.520 
see it's still the accelerates the item
without<00:04:45.950> having<00:04:46.430> to<00:04:46.520> be<00:04:46.640> powered<00:04:47.150> so<00:04:47.870> if<00:04:48.200> you

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
without having to be powered so if you

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.060 
without having to be powered so if you
aren't<00:04:49.330> using<00:04:50.330> an<00:04:50.570> accelerator<00:04:51.200> for<00:04:51.590> both

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
aren't using an accelerator for both

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.800 
aren't using an accelerator for both
acceleration<00:04:52.700> and<00:04:52.880> D<00:04:53.000> acceleration<00:04:53.660> and

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
acceleration and D acceleration and

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.480 
acceleration and D acceleration and
you're<00:04:53.900> only<00:04:54.020> using<00:04:54.410> it<00:04:54.530> for<00:04:54.740> D<00:04:54.830> acceleration

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
you're only using it for D acceleration

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.550 
you're only using it for D acceleration
you<00:04:56.030> don't<00:04:56.210> necessarily<00:04:56.390> have<00:04:56.810> to<00:04:57.110> power<00:04:57.320> it

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
you don't necessarily have to power it

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.210 
you don't necessarily have to power it
but<00:04:57.800> come<00:04:58.070> on

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
but come on

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.350 
but come on
who<00:04:58.370> doesn't<00:04:58.700> want<00:04:58.850> this<00:04:59.210> cool<00:04:59.810> glowing<00:05:00.710> ring

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
who doesn't want this cool glowing ring

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.340 
who doesn't want this cool glowing ring
so<00:05:02.360> that<00:05:03.169> is<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:04.390> advanced<00:05:05.390> type<00:05:05.870> of<00:05:06.080> pipes

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
so that is the advanced type of pipes

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.790 
so that is the advanced type of pipes
that<00:05:07.310> red<00:05:07.700> power<00:05:07.970> has<00:05:08.300> to<00:05:08.330> offer<00:05:08.810> for<00:05:09.440> item

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
that red power has to offer for item

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.320 
that red power has to offer for item
