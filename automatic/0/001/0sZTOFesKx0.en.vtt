00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.200
 The perfect understanding of this principle enables us to change the 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.160
 own polarity as well as that of others if one takes the time and 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.160
 studied necessary to master this art 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.549
 the beginning of the rhythm 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.259
 everything flows and flows 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:21.029
 everything has its periods of advance and backward everything ascends and descends 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.510
 everything moves like a pendulum the measure of its movement to the right is the 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.349
 same as that of its movement to the left the pace is the compensation 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.350
 what they were worth 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.190
 this principle contains the truth that everything manifests in a certain 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.120
 back and forth movement 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.720
 a ebb and flow 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.740
 an oscillation of the pendulum between the two poles that exist according to the 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.130
 polarity principle 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.880
 described a moment ago 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.230
 there is always an action and a reaction an advance and a regression an ascension 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.900
 and a decline 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.790
 and this law applies to everything 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.840
 Suns 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.250
 2 animals mind energy matter 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.320
 this law and the same manifests itself in creation as in the destruction of 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.910
 worlds 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.490
 in progress as in the decadence of nations in life in things 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.350
 all 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.880
 finally in the mental states of man and it is often to this 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.200
 last that the hermetisms believe that this principle is the most important 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.500
 the hermetisms have discovered this principle finding it of application 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.580
 Universal also discovered certain methods to escape their 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.800
 effects through the use of appropriate formulas and methods 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.860
 they use for this the mental law of neutralization 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.729
 can not override the principle to prevent it from operating 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.180
 but they have learned to evade its effects to a certain degree depending on 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.720
 of the domain that you have of said principle 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.900
 They know how to use it instead of being used by him 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.130
 in this and in other similar methods consists the hermetic science 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.590
 the teacher also polarizes at the point where he wants to stay and then 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.759
 neutralizes the pendular rhythmic oscillation that would tend to drag it 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.000
 towards the other pole 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.030
 all those who have acquired some degree of mastery over themselves execute 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.590
 this to some extent 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.209
 consciously or unconsciously but the master consciously effects it 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.879
 and for that reason the power of his will reaches such a degree of stability and 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.239
 mental firmness almost impossible to conceive for that immense crowd that 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.560
 it comes and goes in a continuous wave motion driven by that principle 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.779
 of rhythm 

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:30.029
 this as well as that of polarity has been carefully studied by the 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:33.099
 hermetisms and contraband methods before them 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.540
 neutralize those and employ them form one of the most important parts of the 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.369
 hermetic mental alchemy 

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:41.459
 6 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.769
 the cause and effect principle 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.569
 every cause has its effect 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.150
 every effect has its cause everything happens according to the law 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.900
 the luck is not more than the name that is given to the law and not recognized there is 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.339
 many planes of causality but nothing escapes the law 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:59.579
 what they were worth 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.139
 this principle contains the truth that every effect has its cause and all cause 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:05.199
 its effect 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:09.199
 affirms that nothing happens by chance and that everything happens according to the law 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:14.090
 luck is a vain word and while there are many planes of causes and 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.730
 effects 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.510
 dominating superiors to inferiors still none escapes 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.989
 totally to the law 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.739
 the hermetisms know the means and methods by which it can be 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.279
 extend beyond the ordinary plan of causes and effects to some degree 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:32.499
 and reaching mentally the higher plane become causes instead 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:33.609
 of effects 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.449
 the crowds get carried away dragged by the environment that 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.520
 envelops them or by the wishes and wills of others 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.959
 If these are superior to theirs 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.639
 the inheritance the suggestions and other multiple external causes push them 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.419
 as automata in the great stage of life 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.819
 but the masters having reached the top plane 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.700
 Their characteristics, their qualities and powers, as well as their 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.409
 environment that surrounds them thus becoming 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.179
 leaders instead of being directed 

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:09.739
 help the masses and individuals to have fun in the game of life instead 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.969
 of being them the players or the automatons moved by other people's wills 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:17.739
 they use the principle instead of being their instruments 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.500
 the teachers obey the causality of the higher planes in which 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.059
 they find but they lend their collaboration to regulate and govern in their own plan 

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:30.029
 in what has been said, a very valuable hermetic knowledge is condensed 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:34.259
 that the one who is able to read between the lines discover it is our desire 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.819
 the generation principle 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:44.639
 the generation exists everywhere everything has its masculine and feminine principle 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.889
 Generation manifests in all planes 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.080
 what they were worth 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.470
 this principle contains the truth that the generation manifests itself in all 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.430
 being always in action the masculine and feminine principles 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.110
 this is true not only in the physical plane but also in the mental and in 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.270
 the spiritual 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.610
 in the physical world this principle manifests as sex and in the planes 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.839
 higher takes higher forms 

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:13.650
 but the principle always remains the same 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.979
 no mental or spiritual physical creation is possible without this principle 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.770
 understanding of it illuminates many of the problems that have 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.909
 confused the mind of men 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:29.849
 this creative principle always works in the sense of generating regenerate and create 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:33.979
 each being contains in itself the two elements of this principle 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.240
 If you want to know the philosophy of creation generation and regeneration 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.669
 mental and spiritual you must study this hermetic principle as it contains 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:45.580
 the solution of many of the mysteries of life 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.590
 we warn you that this principle has nothing to do with the pernicious and 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.580
 degrading theories teachings and practices 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.759
 that are advertised with eye-catching titles 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.960
 those that are nothing more than a prostitution of the great natural principle 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.330
 of generation 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.110
 such theories and practices are nothing but the resurrection of the ancient 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.419
 phallic doctrines 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:08.180
 that can only produce the ruin of the mind of the soul and of the body 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.330
 and the Hermetic philosophy has always reached its protest verb against 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.330
 those licenses and perversions of natural principles 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.430
 if what you want and are such teachings you should go find them elsewhere 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.129
 the hermeticism contains nothing about them 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:25.650
 for the pure all things are pure 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.320
 for edwin all are ruins
