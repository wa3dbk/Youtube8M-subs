 terrifying ready in the cinema continue 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.830
 being the most acclaimed characters by 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.710
 the public that pays the prisoner for a 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.440
 entry to die of mine we have a 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.440
 long note because the attention list 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.269
 no doubt that horror movies will 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.609
 they become the favorites of many 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:33.570
 the time to go to the cinema or enjoy them in 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.570
 the comfort of home 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.670
 good 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.739
 the error has allowed the public 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.540
 explore all kinds of emotions 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.309
 terrifying through fear the 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.949
 which manifest themselves in the presence 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.690
 of the fantastic unknown and 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.690
 supernatural 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.809
 sometimes for some reason we do not have 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.320
 completely clear a connection occurs 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.860
 with the person who is watching 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.780
 that vehicle 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.060
 If a connection does not occur, we are 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.390
 we mean that a channel is produced 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.700
 through which 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.700
 demons come out he and dark things 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.230
 and that is that in horror movies we have 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.240
 had characters and monsters that have 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.100
 remained in the collective unconscious by 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.100
 the impact and fear that have caused 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.700
 tell me what was never scared with the clown 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.590
 killer the doll that appears in the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.320
 spell movie since the doll 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.970
 diabolical chucky's girlfriend or the 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.840
 girls coming out of a television in the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.840
 movie the hoop 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.810
 but also the monsters have caused 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.240
 furor in the remembered horror movies 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.280
 with godzilla king kong alien versus 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.210
 predator and others that have scared 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.210
 the viewer 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.610
 but what about these monsters and 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.210
 characters that produce the sensation 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.430
 of fear and fear will be because many of 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.760
 horror movies are inspired 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.510
 in real events the subject is fascinating 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.380
 of what the devils of the devils 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.120
 of the dark 'ere is fascinating in the 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.240
 sense that when one gets into a 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.380
 movie does makes a concession of 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.720
 supposes that what is 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.220
 happening to the assumption that there 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.740
 these beings that are invading the 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.080
 earth since there is this demon that 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.420
 attacks people that girls are 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.840
 they form stigmas and fall to the ground 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.840
 bleeding out 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.950
 they are just some of the monsters and 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.110
 scary characters that invade the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.510
 horror movies and what will happen to 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.960
 review in depth with Juan Andres 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.960
 salfate 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.630
 of a character is a raid character 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.700
 and we are going with an absolute classic based 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.310
 in stephen king's novel and here 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.830
 translated as that for the unnameable is 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.950
 the clown pennywise us as the 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.870
 killer clown attention that things more 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.030
 contrasting that cheaper things 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.710
 than a clown who is invented with 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.430
 people that to create some kind of 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.100
 happiness 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.960
 it's true to take out looks until the first 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.120
 image where through the culvert 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.700
 or this strange creature could be changed 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.890
 so a chip see how it's done in 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.959
 English that but through these 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.390
 balloons through this image and a 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.310
 nice clown finally became 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.440
 in a kind of cannibal monster and 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.020
 began to pursue a group of 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.790
 friends and that already more adults returns to 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.820
 recover the childhood terror when 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.280
 return to join them for the death of one 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.250
 of them and I start to dig in the 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.110
 most terrible so the the sweet the 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.760
 that it was the most timid child that 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.130
 I had a certain degree of stuttering 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.170
 finally that I gave him to fight only 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.180
 so that no one would give the clown 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.230
 obviously responsible for doing the 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.230
 encerrona 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.879
 to obviously tell the face all 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.100
 those fears that you do not dare to 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.260
 confess was like a psychological tenor 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.150
 physical obviously for all 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.190
 prodigies that you just did but 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.949
 I am confronted with your fears more than 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.560
 confess that it was terrible as I say 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:30.270
 past one of the masterpieces 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.790
 a tremendously voluminous book and 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:37.380
 great characters typical validity the 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:41.090
 devil in legend 80's movie is very 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:44.419
 similar to when the novel was published 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.419
 what a lot 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.120
 and notice that it was very clever stephen king 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.550
 and obviously the cinematographic version 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.590
 which is actually a telefilm of two 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.169
 chapters made for television where 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.510
 there are still people who do not know well 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.370
 children how to confront a clown who does not 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.780
 find too crazy then the 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.860
 clown while it is supposed to be a 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.810
 loading a ton of joy 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.750
 because he is the only adult that children 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.639
 they can not trust at all because it goes with 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.500
 anything is like unstable 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.050
 personality then that psychology 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.790
 makes the clown image for a lot 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.919
 the child causes them fear there are children 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.900
 they are afraid bodies do not know if a 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.280
 animal a monkey 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.990
 so when you have to say it, you have to 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.130
 reed and how to take pictures with him there are children 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.990
 who are afraid of him 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.780
 and obviously the clowns are not 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.169
 exempt from those childhood terrors and 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.800
 here 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.870
 exploited to the maximum good now the one that 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.879
 I face the favorite movie of 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.779
 a lot and that he had a new version in 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:47.909
 this year is already the diabolical doll 

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:49.919
 that also plays with the contrast is 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:51.930
 known as looking for certain hello I am 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.210
 jackie I want to be your friend but in 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.520
 reality in a murderous psychopath who with 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.939
 the powers of voodoo pierced his soul 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.069
 this doll is that he obviously needs 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:04.020
 transfer the child again because 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:06.090
 if he is not going to be trapped in that body 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.770
 plastic forever 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.529
 and before they want the best because this 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.749
 another child chamber explodes that is 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:13.830
 when the child does not believe him when seen 

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:15.449
 something terrifying 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.759
 imagine you are told I speak with my 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:20.099
 doll and I doll forces me to kill 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:21.749
 people the mom obviously think that 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:23.969
 is missing he thinks he has some 

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:27.449
 psychological trauma until the soul in 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:29.370
 person decides to talk about the death of 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:32.849
 wax grant and also how it changed the 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.740
 face and the innocent face that carries a 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:39.020
 smile see very well scene salfate this 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:42.169
 it's better this implies blood has a 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.599
 I thought of visceral bet as really 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:46.400
 terrifying escarole was no more 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:48.770
 psychological the clown anyway 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.720
 touch a little more the caricature but that 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.729
 Caricature also allows your ex-partner 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.580
 as you well say this the logo 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:57.620
 sanguinolienta or betting say with 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.629
 the liters of hemoglobin that are missing 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.599
 the camera obviously so that one more longer 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:04.580
 that later only says good eye and 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:06.080
 because of this doll that can 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.159
 start about three myths like those of 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.159
 pep or do not remember 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:19.250
 and that's when the little girls also 

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:21.740
 We started taking a little honey or 

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.810
 doll is true because imagine that 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.159
 the children with regard to the movie 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.930
 we are seeing since the doll of 

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:29.240
 Bólico that has several soft films 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.219
 and a remake ma over that finally in 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.889
 the children and Serbs are my friends and what 

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:36.560
 they leave him sitting obviously near his 

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:39.199
 home but finally when really 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.940
 some children and they literally fall asleep 

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:43.020
 wake up and come and a lot or dolls 

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.910
 looking 

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.039
 because that's really why there's the child that 

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:49.139
 it will cost us and they would go around 

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:51.780
 imagine the feeling the show 

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:53.909
 terrible to wake up an infant away 

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.069
 your father's piece and suddenly had 

00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:58.669
 an army of dolls all watching with 

00:07:56.069 --> 00:07:58.669
 face the logo 

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:02.849
 that is also expensive that the goalkeeper 

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:04.470
 there was this clown who suddenly 

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:06.690
 cover it has a jacket but not what 

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.069
 look until one day disappears 

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:10.470
 within this list that he manages 

00:08:08.069 --> 00:08:12.930
 teacher there is a special doll that is 

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:15.659
 tremendously terrifying of you and that 

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:19.310
 also and that keeps a secret that 

00:08:15.659 --> 00:08:19.310
 you will reveal us around the corner
