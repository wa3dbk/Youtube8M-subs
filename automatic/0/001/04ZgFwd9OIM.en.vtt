today<00:00:06.120> as<00:00:06.330> well<00:00:07.080> as<00:00:07.259> I<00:00:07.290> talked<00:00:07.649> about<00:00:07.770> the

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
today as well as I talked about the

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.209 
today as well as I talked about the
pocket<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.340> put<00:00:08.370> in<00:00:08.610> them<00:00:08.730> so<00:00:09.450> first<00:00:09.719> one<00:00:09.960> is

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
pocket I put in them so first one is

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.890 
pocket I put in them so first one is
this<00:00:11.219> red<00:00:11.490> one<00:00:11.519> they<00:00:12.269> only<00:00:12.389> had<00:00:12.509> red<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.780> blue

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
this red one they only had red and blue

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.330 
this red one they only had red and blue
so<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.139> snagged<00:00:13.469> three<00:00:13.679> red<00:00:13.889> ones<00:00:14.099> there<00:00:14.280> are

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
so I snagged three red ones there are

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.810 
so I snagged three red ones there are
twenty<00:00:14.549> bucks<00:00:14.670> apiece<00:00:15.049> so<00:00:16.049> figure<00:00:16.199> why<00:00:16.410> not

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
twenty bucks apiece so figure why not

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.859 
twenty bucks apiece so figure why not
decent<00:00:17.820> lacrosse<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.449> actually<00:00:18.570> really

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
decent lacrosse and I actually really

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:19.790 
decent lacrosse and I actually really
like<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.109> way<00:00:19.140> they<00:00:19.320> string<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.619> would<00:00:19.740> be

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
like the way they string I would be

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.679 
like the way they string I would be
stringing<00:00:20.130> right<00:00:20.279> but<00:00:21.060> anyway<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.330> first<00:00:21.539> one

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
stringing right but anyway the first one

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.960 
stringing right but anyway the first one
is<00:00:21.720> an<00:00:21.840> Iroquois<00:00:22.170> top<00:00:22.350> string<00:00:22.760> if<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.880> look

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
is an Iroquois top string if you look

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.700 
is an Iroquois top string if you look
closely<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.539> can<00:00:24.570> kind<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.930> notice<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.410> do<00:00:25.470> mind

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
closely you can kind of notice I do mind

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.170 
closely you can kind of notice I do mind
a<00:00:25.769> bit<00:00:25.890> differently<00:00:26.310> than<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.609> average<00:00:27.150> bear

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
a bit differently than the average bear

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.300 
a bit differently than the average bear
so<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.260> not<00:00:28.349> like<00:00:28.500> going<00:00:28.650> straight<00:00:29.039> up<00:00:29.070> and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
so it's not like going straight up and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.700 
so it's not like going straight up and
down<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.760> come<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.539> side<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.080> then<00:00:31.560> when<00:00:31.679> I

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
down I come to the side and then when I

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.200 
down I come to the side and then when I
go<00:00:31.859> through<00:00:32.099> here<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.309> go<00:00:32.520> through<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.759> top<00:00:33.000> of

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
go through here I go through the top of

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.569 
go through here I go through the top of
the<00:00:33.300> mesh<00:00:33.450> kind<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.780> similar<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.579> triangle

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the mesh kind of similar to a a triangle

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.490 
the mesh kind of similar to a a triangle
top<00:00:35.730> string<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.120> do<00:00:36.300> when<00:00:37.140> you're<00:00:37.230> doing<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
top string you do when you're doing the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.760 
top string you do when you're doing the
actual<00:00:37.890> triangle<00:00:38.340> part<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.329> what<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.020> feel<00:00:40.590> that

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
actual triangle part so what I feel that

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.680 
actual triangle part so what I feel that
does<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.340> gets<00:00:41.430> more<00:00:41.670> attention<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.329> it

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
does is it gets more attention and it

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.990 
does is it gets more attention and it
keeps<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.320> from<00:00:43.440> slacking<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.070> lot<00:00:44.219> more<00:00:44.399> it's

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
keeps it from slacking a lot more it's

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.430 
keeps it from slacking a lot more it's
like<00:00:45.120> with<00:00:45.270> use<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.719> Iroquois<00:00:46.020> top<00:00:46.200> string

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
like with use the Iroquois top string

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.020 
like with use the Iroquois top string
and<00:00:46.590> string<00:00:46.649> itself<00:00:47.129> Nashville<00:00:47.670> start<00:00:47.910> to

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
and string itself Nashville start to

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.940 
and string itself Nashville start to
slack<00:00:48.270> out<00:00:48.510> well<00:00:49.110> if<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.260> do<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.890> you

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
slack out well if you do this and you

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.950 
slack out well if you do this and you
keep<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.700> tight<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.059> first<00:00:51.300> three<00:00:51.629> or<00:00:51.780> four

being so shallow it's actually got a

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.380 
being so shallow it's actually got a
good<00:01:09.630> amount<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.900> whip<00:01:10.220> just<00:01:11.220> from<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> style

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
good amount of whip just from the style

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.020 
good amount of whip just from the style
of<00:01:12.600> stringing<00:01:13.320> i<00:01:13.380> did<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.729> so<00:01:14.729> there's<00:01:14.909> that

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
of stringing i did on it so there's that

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.390 
of stringing i did on it so there's that
one<00:01:15.320> I'll<00:01:16.320> do<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> tutorial<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.890> how<00:01:16.979> i<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:17.310> my

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
one I'll do a tutorial on how i do my

one I'll do a tutorial on how i do my
Iroquois<00:01:17.790> top<00:01:17.970> string<00:01:18.180> here<00:01:18.360> shortly<00:01:18.710> maybe

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
Iroquois top string here shortly maybe

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.910 
Iroquois top string here shortly maybe
in<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.890> different<00:01:19.979> head<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:22.380> others<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.799> if

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
in a different head the others that if

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.140 
in a different head the others that if
anyone's<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> patterns<00:01:23.640> let<00:01:23.850> me<00:01:23.909> know<00:01:24.030> i'll

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
anyone's the patterns let me know i'll

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.020 
anyone's the patterns let me know i'll
post<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> description<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:26.009> last<00:01:26.280> well

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
post the description and then last well

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.940 
post the description and then last well
I<00:01:27.180> guess<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> segment<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.900> third<00:01:28.080> one<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
I guess the segment of third one is the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.580 
I guess the segment of third one is the
