00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
at the phone yourself so let's take this

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.570 
at the phone yourself so let's take this
off<00:04:52.810> normally<00:04:53.650> this<00:04:54.280> is<00:04:54.520> a<00:04:55.500> two<00:04:56.500> piece<00:04:56.710> where

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
off normally this is a two piece where

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.910 
off normally this is a two piece where
these<00:04:58.300> stickers<00:04:58.540> i<00:04:58.720> revisited<00:04:59.170> normally<00:04:59.740> is

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
these stickers i revisited normally is

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.860 
these stickers i revisited normally is
at<00:05:00.040> the<00:05:00.130> front<00:05:00.280> and<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.610> back<00:05:00.790> this<00:05:01.600> time<00:05:01.840> I

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
at the front and the back this time I

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.300 
at the front and the back this time I
think<00:05:02.200> is<00:05:02.290> just<00:05:02.320> one<00:05:02.590> piece<00:05:02.770> and<00:05:02.950> it<00:05:03.040> comes<00:05:03.190> off

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
think is just one piece and it comes off

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.250 
think is just one piece and it comes off
like<00:05:03.460> the<00:05:03.610> iPad<00:05:03.940> does<00:05:04.120> and<00:05:04.780> let's<00:05:04.930> just<00:05:05.020> do

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
like the iPad does and let's just do

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:13.370 
like the iPad does and let's just do
this<00:05:05.380> now<00:05:05.530> then<00:05:05.740> oh<00:05:07.500> yeah<00:05:08.669> good<00:05:09.669> stuff<00:05:09.820> nice

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.940 

there<00:05:13.980> you<00:05:14.100> go<00:05:15.260> that's<00:05:16.260> the<00:05:16.350> phone<00:05:16.590> itself

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
there you go that's the phone itself

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.400 
there you go that's the phone itself
let's<00:05:17.400> just<00:05:17.460> do<00:05:18.390> a<00:05:18.420> run<00:05:18.660> drove<00:05:18.780> all<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.110> ports

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
let's just do a run drove all the ports

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.720 
let's just do a run drove all the ports
so<00:05:20.100> we've<00:05:20.460> got<00:05:20.730> the<00:05:21.510> Lightning<00:05:22.290> port

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
so we've got the Lightning port

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.280 
so we've got the Lightning port
microphone<00:05:23.730> port<00:05:24.000> and<00:05:24.150> the<00:05:24.290> three-and-a-half

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
microphone port and the three-and-a-half

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.650 
microphone port and the three-and-a-half
millimeter<00:05:25.620> headphone<00:05:26.070> jack<00:05:26.480> this<00:05:27.480> is<00:05:27.630> a

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
millimeter headphone jack this is a

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.780 
millimeter headphone jack this is a
speaker<00:05:28.080> grill<00:05:28.260> now<00:05:28.500> on<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.800> iphone<00:05:28.830> 5s<00:05:29.520> the

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
speaker grill now on the iphone 5s the

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.210 
speaker grill now on the iphone 5s the
they<00:05:30.300> had<00:05:30.480> a<00:05:30.510> larger<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:31.230> think<00:05:31.770> they<00:05:31.830> had<00:05:31.950> more

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
they had a larger I think they had more

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.710 
they had a larger I think they had more
so<00:05:32.460> of<00:05:32.490> drilled<00:05:32.910> holes<00:05:33.150> for<00:05:33.360> the<00:05:33.390> microphone

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
so of drilled holes for the microphone

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.990 
so of drilled holes for the microphone
and<00:05:33.990> this<00:05:34.980> time<00:05:35.190> they're<00:05:35.400> just<00:05:35.550> gone<00:05:35.670> with<00:05:35.700> the

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
and this time they're just gone with the

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.770 
and this time they're just gone with the
one<00:05:36.210> holder<00:05:38.030> you<00:05:39.030> know<00:05:39.150> i<00:05:39.270> think<00:05:39.330> it's<00:05:39.600> i<00:05:39.720> don't

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
one holder you know i think it's i don't

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.410 
one holder you know i think it's i don't
i<00:05:40.050> don't<00:05:40.080> know<00:05:40.260> why<00:05:40.410> but<00:05:40.440> i<00:05:40.650> think<00:05:40.830> he's<00:05:41.420> just

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
i don't know why but i think he's just

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.300 
i don't know why but i think he's just
doesn't<00:05:42.720> look<00:05:42.780> finished<00:05:42.930> to<00:05:43.200> me<00:05:43.290> but<00:05:43.650> that's

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
doesn't look finished to me but that's

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.450 
doesn't look finished to me but that's
just<00:05:44.400> my<00:05:44.550> opinion<00:05:44.580> anyway<00:05:45.060> on<00:05:45.420> the<00:05:46.380> left<00:05:47.310> hand

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
just my opinion anyway on the left hand

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.250 
just my opinion anyway on the left hand
side<00:05:47.520> of<00:05:47.700> the<00:05:47.760> device<00:05:47.970> you've<00:05:48.180> got<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:48.930> volume

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
side of the device you've got the volume

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.840 
side of the device you've got the volume
rocker<00:05:49.320> so<00:05:49.650> it's<00:05:49.770> oblong<00:05:50.160> buttons<00:05:50.520> this<00:05:50.640> time

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
rocker so it's oblong buttons this time

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.980 
rocker so it's oblong buttons this time
rather<00:05:51.060> than<00:05:51.150> the<00:05:51.300> circular<00:05:51.690> ones<00:05:51.840> on<00:05:51.930> the

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
rather than the circular ones on the

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.620 
rather than the circular ones on the
other<00:05:52.020> phone<00:05:52.290> 5s<00:05:52.680> you<00:05:53.370> got<00:05:53.520> the<00:05:53.700> mute<00:05:54.390> switch

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
other phone 5s you got the mute switch

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.930 
other phone 5s you got the mute switch
there<00:05:54.870> as<00:05:54.960> well<00:05:55.110> which<00:05:55.710> I<00:05:56.010> can't<00:05:56.580> live<00:05:56.700> without

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
there as well which I can't live without

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.520 
there as well which I can't live without
I<00:05:57.090> mean<00:05:57.300> I've<00:05:57.480> tried<00:05:57.780> going<00:05:58.110> to<00:05:58.260> android

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
I mean I've tried going to android

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.850 
I mean I've tried going to android
phones<00:05:58.770> and<00:05:59.960> they<00:06:00.960> don't<00:06:01.080> have<00:06:01.290> this<00:06:01.440> which<00:06:01.770> I

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
phones and they don't have this which I

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.110 
phones and they don't have this which I
know<00:06:01.950> it's<00:06:02.100> just<00:06:02.160> a<00:06:02.280> tiny<00:06:02.460> switch<00:06:02.700> but<00:06:02.880> it<00:06:02.970> does

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
know it's just a tiny switch but it does

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.210 
know it's just a tiny switch but it does
make<00:06:03.480> a<00:06:03.540> hell<00:06:03.750> of<00:06:03.780> a<00:06:03.900> difference<00:06:04.050> on<00:06:04.860> the<00:06:05.010> top

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
make a hell of a difference on the top

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.270 
make a hell of a difference on the top
now<00:06:05.490> there's<00:06:05.820> nothing<00:06:06.060> there<00:06:06.500> because<00:06:07.500> on<00:06:07.830> the

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
now there's nothing there because on the

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.560 
now there's nothing there because on the
right-hand<00:06:08.730> side<00:06:08.760> of<00:06:08.910> the<00:06:08.970> device<00:06:09.210> you<00:06:09.240> but

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
right-hand side of the device you but

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.670 
right-hand side of the device you but
the<00:06:10.610> sleep/wake<00:06:11.610> button<00:06:11.640> there<00:06:12.000> and<00:06:12.680> you've

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
the sleep/wake button there and you've

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.120 
the sleep/wake button there and you've
got<00:06:13.830> these<00:06:14.040> sim<00:06:14.400> tray<00:06:14.940> there<00:06:15.150> as<00:06:15.240> well<00:06:16.130> right

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
got these sim tray there as well right

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.910 
got these sim tray there as well right
so<00:06:17.280> on<00:06:17.400> to<00:06:17.490> the<00:06:17.580> back<00:06:17.760> we<00:06:18.180> have<00:06:18.210> the<00:06:18.960> 8

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:19.920 
so on to the back we have the 8

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.620 
so on to the back we have the 8
megapixel<00:06:20.160> camera<00:06:20.880> which<00:06:21.060> i<00:06:21.240> think<00:06:21.300> is<00:06:21.510> the

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
megapixel camera which i think is the

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.390 
megapixel camera which i think is the
same<00:06:21.780> sensor<00:06:22.200> as<00:06:22.230> the<00:06:22.410> iphone<00:06:23.480> 5s<00:06:24.860> I<00:06:25.860> think

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
same sensor as the iphone 5s I think

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.010 
same sensor as the iphone 5s I think
it's<00:06:26.550> just<00:06:26.580> got<00:06:26.880> better<00:06:27.090> features<00:06:27.270> like<00:06:27.540> focus

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
it's just got better features like focus

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.050 
it's just got better features like focus
pixels<00:06:28.230> and<00:06:29.120> you've<00:06:30.120> also<00:06:30.240> got<00:06:30.510> the<00:06:30.720> true<00:06:32.060> true

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
pixels and you've also got the true true

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.360 
pixels and you've also got the true true
tone<00:06:33.240> flash<00:06:33.270> that's<00:06:33.900> what<00:06:34.020> is<00:06:34.110> called<00:06:34.320> here<00:06:34.470> it

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
tone flash that's what is called here it

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.670 
tone flash that's what is called here it
is<00:06:35.490> now<00:06:35.610> a<00:06:35.640> circular<00:06:36.450> flash<00:06:37.110> rather<00:06:37.410> than<00:06:37.560> an

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
is now a circular flash rather than an

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.310 
is now a circular flash rather than an
oblong<00:06:38.010> 105's<00:06:38.910> and<00:06:39.600> you've<00:06:39.810> also<00:06:39.930> got<00:06:40.170> the

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
oblong 105's and you've also got the

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.960 
oblong 105's and you've also got the
microphone<00:06:40.830> piece<00:06:41.400> there<00:06:41.640> which<00:06:41.790> is<00:06:41.820> the

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
microphone piece there which is the

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.410 
microphone piece there which is the
noise<00:06:42.090> cancellation<00:06:42.660> microphone<00:06:44.420> that's

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:45.420 
noise cancellation microphone that's

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.170 
noise cancellation microphone that's
pretty<00:06:45.720> much<00:06:45.840> it<00:06:45.900> I<00:06:46.140> hope<00:06:46.410> you<00:06:46.590> got<00:06:46.680> all<00:06:46.740> the

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
pretty much it I hope you got all the
