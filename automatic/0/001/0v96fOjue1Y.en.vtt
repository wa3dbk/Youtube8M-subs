00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.370
 hello dear friends swami jazz you 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.080
 today you make up theories about the facts of the game 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.279
 five nights at freddys 3 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.920
 drove let's remember the scott secrets 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.330
 before the release of the third part, remember 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.779
 ten teaser guess who so teaser 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.130
 From the map fnaf 3 appeared 12 numbers 12 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.270
 minus 10 equals 2 2 numbers the game is out 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.329
 it turns out we could not guess it 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.829
 such a simple task 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.860
 still this teaser can be read as 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.559
 guess who 10 may be from meant 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.700
 what will be 10 animatronic springtrap 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.969
 phantom chica 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.300
 fantasies foxy phantom balun bout phantom 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.489
 Freddy Phantom Puppet Phantom Mangle and 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.570
 another puppet which is not phantom 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.800
 appears on camera and then who is 10 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.840
 I would also like to explain what is in the game 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.960
 golden freddie they are shadow of freddie 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.939
 sense scott add the shadow of freddy and that 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.729
 Freddy who walks outside the window is 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.450
 usual they can be golden 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.060
 in the extra well and now we go to 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.830
 he didnâ€™t become a little scott 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.340
 recycle the mascot view from second 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.259
 pieces that are phantoms in 3 he 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.210
 did not make a separate phantom model 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.400
 foxy and just took her starting points 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.400
 in the second part 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.860
 repainted and removed the hand to make 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.900
 Freddie's phantom he took the model gold 2 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.770
 parts and also repainted removed foot 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.979
 so Freddie is limping with 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.409
 all the other phantoms like everything is fine 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:49.079
 the same Scott menu wrote fnaf 3 that is 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.659
 five nights at freddys 3 but cut 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.399
 he did not openly write that this game with 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.360
 freddie because the main role takes 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.100
 in it springtrap many were interested 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.290
 why springtrap behaves very 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.450
 aggressively and does not always go to the sounds 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.880
 balun battlefield do not forget that inside 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.550
 him a purple man who has become 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.470
 cyborg by the way just his death 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.160
 there were rumors that the game and sound 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.840
 their files 2 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.160
 I do not know how true it is but to me 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.100
 for some reason it seems that this is something 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.230
 fan however can you listen i 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.510
 turn on now but if you are nervous 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.880
 it's better to just unplug or clear 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.880
 this moment carefully drove 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.640
 I wonder what most of the movement 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.629
 coincided so fifty fifty 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.909
 true or not well for today 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.469
 this is all thanks to all for watching 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:40.090
