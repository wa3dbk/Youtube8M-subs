00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.150
 We look here again, I'm recording. 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.700
 water web videos as I said before 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.070
 from Internet 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.490
 speaking so low by a person who 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.490
 conveys the linen shame 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:25.050
 Anyway, people, I want to thank you first. 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.470
 people who have visited the channel that 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.840
 has left in a line that has left 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.550
 Very happy comments I'm very 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.399
 grateful for knowing that 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.809
 you so hot that afternoon giving 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.719
 tips I give 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:50.059
 and finally today 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.059
 today I saw this video is dedicated to this 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:59.520
 this video in a comment it was yesterday 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:05.300
 taking advantage of the internet driver 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.300
 posting the videos because 1907 at home 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.150
 But anyway this video after you you me 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.270
 asked for this he asked to make a video 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.540
 giving tips on how to take care of your iphone 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.790
 The first tip I give is essential. 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.590
 what if you say worked like him 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:29.130
 even if it is not 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:31.939
 turn back because already with the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.770
 public he already has a small telephone 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:40.979
 because of that hand Genius day 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:43.530
 game is not entering a 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:58.140
 I think you identify 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:02:00.899
 with a good in hand and vote on the 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.640
 finally, ends up taking a 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.079
 Do you want too much because with 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.680
 skin with a beginner is this get worse 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.680
 so then 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.140
 I quite like the movie. 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.569
 of that transparent policy but I 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:26.180
 recommend the sap for fans with a chance that 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:27.830
 everybody playing because Argentina is 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.970
 a little thinner than the force is 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.370
 thicker 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.650
 but even so there you leave your 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.090
 phone fell to the ground and scratched a stone 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.770
 in something like that 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.570
 and if she makes a neighbor a little bit 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.270
 stronger with transparent film 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.830
 one that is totally smooth it can 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.440
 end up winning the phone screen 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:50.000
 It may also be that it happens but it may 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:55.450
 whatever happens and with this song 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.890
 because it has no reflection right 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.420
 matt the chance of that happening is very 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:05.660
 minor may constitute in another year 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.480
 The day I give is in relation to the capinha. 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.930
 if you say light up how I do not use the 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.680
 your iphone 5 to 15 always with weasels and 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:20.120
 preferably always there 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:22.160
 speck and those balls only stay 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.680
 that fits phones right into a 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.870
 kit because they protect 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.930
 but not these two lines that I can 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.060
 I'm using ice it's hard, ball is 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:41.840
 well fininha only she more static 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:44.810
 even in a stand there so she could end 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.790
 no Finally a book that the car then 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.980
 well I always prefer the weeds 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.640
 polka dots but fit well into the 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.310
 speck the avaÃ­ made them feel 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.360
 missing an appliance 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:02.150
 're taking the physical aesthetic TripAdvisor 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.980
 phone indicates that I will give it to you 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.739
 which I recommend we always 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:11.090
 appearing an update of your iphone 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:13.640
 the towel because the updates were 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.410
 made precisely to improve 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.840
 device performance if you do not 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.840
 may end up worsening performance 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:44.660
 update phone people at last 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.940
 I always tried to update your phone 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:51.199
 because it will improve performance then 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.479
 this is a good tip and the second tip in 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.540
 charge of the appliance and explained the 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:58.490
 for you in the previous video that is 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.490
 It is preferable that you should be so 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.940
 50% you recharge again 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:09.320
 cycles I've already explained in the video 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.240
 but you have to leave it at 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.950
 least once a month he says to carry 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.270
 totally totally knows how to turn off 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:20.389
 because the team before that in another 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.930
 video on a tape brothers theory 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.789
 video and nan leave at least once 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.710
 per month and fully discharge the 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.539
 battery is very important for 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.169
 improve phone life 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:38.660
 iphone battery by global 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:41.570
 so that's right now for a tip 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.780
 more precise because there is a lot in 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.599
 relation to the care of the iphone is to look for 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.340
 always kept well protected from draw 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:52.039
 every once in a while you know they're cops 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.710
 who had the life of that box of 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:57.320
 glasses 11 degree glasses know one 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.720
 passadinha in the iphone from time to time a pipe by 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:10.690
 least once a month will always be 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:10.690
 in me forget to enjoy
