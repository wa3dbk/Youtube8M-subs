00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
road time I get this Haiti is this a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.050 
road time I get this Haiti is this a
case<00:01:26.119> where<00:01:26.150> it<00:01:26.420> higher<00:01:26.600> is<00:01:26.869> good<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:28.820> lower

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
case where it higher is good the lower

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.800 
case where it higher is good the lower
the<00:01:29.360> number<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.990> less<00:01:30.979> dissolved<00:01:31.690> solids<00:01:32.690> in

the number the less dissolved solids in
the<00:01:32.900> water<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:34.130> this<00:01:34.280> one<00:01:34.460> has<00:01:34.640> so<00:01:34.940> much<00:01:35.180> it's

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
the water and this one has so much it's

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.030 
the water and this one has so much it's
it's<00:01:35.750> off<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.110> scale<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:37.040> scale<00:01:37.310> is<00:01:37.369> it

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
it's off the scale and the scale is it

it's off the scale and the scale is it
goes<00:01:40.040> up<00:01:40.190> to<00:01:40.340> 999<00:01:42.940> so<00:01:43.940> this<00:01:44.119> one<00:01:44.330> has<00:01:44.509> over<00:01:44.990> a

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
goes up to 999 so this one has over a

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.940 
goes up to 999 so this one has over a

glasses of wine the one on the left is
the<00:02:31.810> original<00:02:32.200> one<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.800> one<00:02:32.980> on<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.220> right<00:02:33.489> is

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
the original one the one on the right is

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.410 
the original one the one on the right is
the<00:02:34.030> filter<00:02:34.390> so<00:02:34.720> what<00:02:34.870> did<00:02:34.959> we<00:02:35.080> learn<00:02:36.420> don't

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
the filter so what did we learn don't

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.780 
the filter so what did we learn don't
say<00:02:37.600> that<00:02:37.780> by<00:02:38.320> filtering<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.100> widening<00:02:39.430> zero

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
say that by filtering the widening zero

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.729 
say that by filtering the widening zero
water<00:02:40.030> you're<00:02:40.810> removing<00:02:41.080> everything<00:02:41.590> I

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
water you're removing everything I

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.650 
water you're removing everything I
couldn't<00:02:42.100> even<00:02:42.190> taste<00:02:42.489> alcohol<00:02:42.730> in<00:02:43.180> this<00:02:43.330> and

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
couldn't even taste alcohol in this and

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.680 
couldn't even taste alcohol in this and
this<00:02:43.840> wine<00:02:44.080> so<00:02:44.440> at<00:02:45.130> this<00:02:45.310> point<00:02:45.550> we<00:02:46.480> thought

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
this wine so at this point we thought

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.840 
this wine so at this point we thought
would<00:02:46.989> actually<00:02:47.350> come<00:02:47.560> out<00:02:47.680> clear<00:02:48.069> and<00:02:48.430> have

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
would actually come out clear and have

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.670 
would actually come out clear and have
nothing<00:02:49.420> there<00:02:49.600> but<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:49.959> actually<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.380> little

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
nothing there but it actually a little

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.970 
nothing there but it actually a little
bit<00:02:50.830> through<00:02:51.720> on<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.840> way<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:53.350> think<00:02:53.470> it's<00:02:53.739> just

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
bit through on the way I think it's just

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.280 
bit through on the way I think it's just
because<00:02:54.220> there's<00:02:54.580> so<00:02:54.730> much<00:02:55.090> dissolved<00:02:55.750> in<00:02:56.110> the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
because there's so much dissolved in the

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.400 
because there's so much dissolved in the
wine<00:02:56.470> it<00:02:56.739> just<00:02:56.950> couldn't<00:02:57.310> handle<00:02:57.459> all<00:02:57.850> that<00:03:01.410> so

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
wine it just couldn't handle all that so

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.809 
wine it just couldn't handle all that so
it<00:03:02.470> looks<00:03:02.620> like<00:03:02.680> this<00:03:02.950> your<00:03:03.130> water<00:03:03.370> picture

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
it looks like this your water picture

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.580 
it looks like this your water picture
did<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.090> trick<00:03:04.360> pros<00:03:04.900> well<00:03:05.080> my<00:03:05.200> father<00:03:05.440> always

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
did the trick pros well my father always

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.620 
did the trick pros well my father always
