00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.140 

I<00:00:03.529> purchased<00:00:04.529> this<00:00:04.830> time<00:00:05.100> around<00:00:05.640> 20<00:00:06.029> years

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
I purchased this time around 20 years

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.000 
I purchased this time around 20 years
ago<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.690> lot<00:00:06.839> of<00:00:06.960> these<00:00:07.049> fields<00:00:07.500> as<00:00:07.589> you<00:00:07.620> can<00:00:07.830> see

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
ago a lot of these fields as you can see

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.459 
ago a lot of these fields as you can see
here<00:00:08.250> were<00:00:08.519> formed<00:00:09.059> into<00:00:09.240> beds<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.870> they<00:00:10.320> also

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
here were formed into beds and they also

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.940 
here were formed into beds and they also
continued<00:00:11.460> up<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.880> face<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.480> hill<00:00:12.660> there

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
continued up the face of the hill there

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.129 
continued up the face of the hill there
I<00:00:14.150> found<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.389> this<00:00:15.570> wasn't<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:16.020> very

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
I found that this wasn't a very

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.730 
I found that this wasn't a very
successful<00:00:16.760> way<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.789> handle<00:00:18.300> them<00:00:18.740> these

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
successful way to handle them these

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.480 
successful way to handle them these
fields<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:21.230> put<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> drain<00:00:22.800> at<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.100> bottom<00:00:23.369> of

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
fields so I put a drain at the bottom of

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.820 
fields so I put a drain at the bottom of
the<00:00:23.640> fields<00:00:24.570> there<00:00:24.949> put<00:00:25.949> some<00:00:25.980> trees<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.670> Andry

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
the fields there put some trees in Andry

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.429 
the fields there put some trees in Andry
forest<00:00:28.830> rated<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.369> area<00:00:30.289> reducing<00:00:31.289> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
forest rated that area reducing the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.660 
forest rated that area reducing the
actual<00:00:31.830> runoff<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:33.239> heavy<00:00:34.399> downpours

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
actual runoff in heavy downpours

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.840 
actual runoff in heavy downpours
I<00:00:35.930> then<00:00:36.930> laser<00:00:37.200> level<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.770> fields<00:00:38.190> put

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
I then laser level the fields put

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.280 
I then laser level the fields put
underground<00:00:39.770> pipes<00:00:40.770> where<00:00:41.070> required<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:42.290> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
underground pipes where required and the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.369 
underground pipes where required and the
end<00:00:43.410> result<00:00:43.770> here<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.010> there<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
end result here is there that in in the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.650 
end result here is there that in in the
20<00:00:46.680> years<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:46.950> I've<00:00:47.070> owned<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.520> place<00:00:47.660> this

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
20 years that I've owned the place this

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.170 
20 years that I've owned the place this
is<00:00:48.840> my<00:00:48.870> second<00:00:49.379> crop<00:00:49.710> cycle<00:00:50.190> which<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.670> now<00:00:50.850> on

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
is my second crop cycle which is now on

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.569 
is my second crop cycle which is now on
a<00:00:51.480> three<00:00:51.750> tune<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.260> looks<00:00:52.890> like<00:00:53.070> it'll<00:00:53.309> go<00:00:53.399> for

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
a three tune and looks like it'll go for

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.410 
a three tune and looks like it'll go for
another<00:00:53.760> couple<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.149> years<00:00:54.210> yet<00:00:56.420> fertilize

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
another couple of years yet fertilize

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.170 
another couple of years yet fertilize
has<00:00:57.660> been<00:00:57.899> applied<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:59.190> still<00:00:59.460> leathers<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
has been applied it still leathers the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.439 
has been applied it still leathers the
whole<00:01:00.329> crop<00:01:00.870> cycle<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.550> see<00:01:02.730> here<00:01:02.940> it

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
whole crop cycle and you can see here it

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.050 
whole crop cycle and you can see here it
was<00:01:03.629> done<00:01:03.870> last<00:01:04.199> week<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.710> with<00:01:05.580> very<00:01:05.850> little

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
was done last week and with very little

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.109 
was done last week and with very little
damage<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.900> set<00:01:07.520> like<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.670> mean<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.939> still

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
damage to the set like I mean you still

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.520 
damage to the set like I mean you still
get<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> baby<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.720> work<00:01:09.900> down<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.350> dagger

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
get a baby to work down to the dagger

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.010 
get a baby to work down to the dagger
you're<00:01:10.799> doing<00:01:10.979> three<00:01:11.250> rows<00:01:11.460> at<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> time<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:12.240> lot

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
you're doing three rows at a time a lot

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.570 
you're doing three rows at a time a lot
of<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.170> guys<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.380> are<00:01:13.710> putting<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.130> out<00:01:14.310> on

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
of the guys that are putting it out on

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.100 
of the guys that are putting it out on
the<00:01:14.790> top<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.180> ground<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.630> was<00:01:15.689> still<00:01:15.900> using

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the top of the ground I was still using

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.050 
the top of the ground I was still using
an<00:01:16.350> old<00:01:16.530> applicator<00:01:17.220> which<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.580> need<00:01:17.729> those<00:01:17.880> two

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
an old applicator which I need those two

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.420 
an old applicator which I need those two
rows<00:01:18.299> any<00:01:18.540> here<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.530> they're<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.830> twice<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
rows any here so they're going twice the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.520 
rows any here so they're going twice the
speed<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:21.450> they're<00:01:21.570> not<00:01:21.659> getting<00:01:22.020> any<00:01:22.320> more

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
speed but they're not getting any more

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.740 
speed but they're not getting any more
done<00:01:22.770> by<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.250> end<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.640> day<00:01:23.820> putting<00:01:24.509> your

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
done by the end of the day putting your

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.480 
done by the end of the day putting your
ear<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.020> top<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.500> ground<00:01:25.680> at<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.130> time<00:01:26.369> of

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
ear on top of the ground at this time of

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.149 
ear on top of the ground at this time of
the<00:01:26.520> year<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.790> mean<00:01:27.060> it's<00:01:27.600> not<00:01:27.829> not<00:01:28.829> really<00:01:29.009> a

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the year I mean it's not not really a

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.920 
the year I mean it's not not really a
good<00:01:29.340> policy<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.820> don't<00:01:30.060> think<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.689> see

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
good policy I don't think but see

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.740 
good policy I don't think but see
volatility<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.890> wind<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:33.090> Sun<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.570> if<00:01:33.630> you

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
volatility the wind the Sun and if you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.960 
volatility the wind the Sun and if you
the<00:01:34.020> worst<00:01:34.229> thing<00:01:34.470> about<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:35.009> if<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.220> get<00:01:35.460> a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
the worst thing about it is if you get a

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.649 
the worst thing about it is if you get a
small<00:01:36.810> amount<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.470> rain<00:01:37.820> it's<00:01:38.820> worse<00:01:39.270> than<00:01:39.509> no

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
small amount of rain it's worse than no

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.289 
small amount of rain it's worse than no
rain<00:01:39.900> because<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.710> melted<00:01:41.159> enough<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:42.180> then

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
rain because it melted enough and then

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.880 
rain because it melted enough and then
when<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.750> go<00:01:42.899> past<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.290> field<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.710> all<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
when you go past the field and all the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.560 
when you go past the field and all the
Consuela's<00:01:44.369> are<00:01:44.490> nitrogen<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:45.149> up<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
Consuela's are nitrogen going up in the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.929 
Consuela's are nitrogen going up in the
air<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.619> no<00:01:46.799> one<00:01:46.920> really<00:01:47.159> knows<00:01:47.399> how<00:01:47.640> much<00:01:47.759> you

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
air and no one really knows how much you

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:48.350 
air and no one really knows how much you
lose

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
lose

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.929 
lose
I<00:01:48.390> mean<00:01:48.750> they've<00:01:48.899> tried<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:50.250> can<00:01:50.399> lose<00:01:50.579> you

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
I mean they've tried to you can lose you

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.730 
I mean they've tried to you can lose you
know<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.180> 50<00:01:51.630> percent<00:01:51.750> they<00:01:52.439> claim

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
know up to 50 percent they claim

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.600 
know up to 50 percent they claim
so<00:01:55.180> hopefully<00:01:56.180> I'll<00:01:56.570> have<00:01:57.140> all<00:01:57.320> moved<00:01:57.560> to<00:01:57.890> this

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
so hopefully I'll have all moved to this

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.550 
so hopefully I'll have all moved to this

either side of the road and they're at
an<00:02:13.900> angle<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.530> we<00:02:15.190> place<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.610> fertilizer

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
an angle and we place the fertilizer

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.900 
an angle and we place the fertilizer
behind<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:17.350> groove<00:02:17.650> in<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.310> groove<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.880> the

we<00:04:37.480> will<00:04:37.660> find<00:04:37.890> fertilizer<00:04:38.890> it<00:04:39.520> is<00:04:39.640> the<00:04:40.390> reason

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
we will find fertilizer it is the reason

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.710 
we will find fertilizer it is the reason
we<00:04:40.990> apply<00:04:41.350> the<00:04:41.410> fertilizer<00:04:42.360> under<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.480> trash

a certain percentage loss to the

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.150 
a certain percentage loss to the
atmosphere<00:05:05.380> because<00:05:05.800> of<00:05:05.920> our<00:05:06.300> humid<00:05:07.300> climate

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160
