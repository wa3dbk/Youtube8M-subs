but basically what we're going to want
to<00:00:20.010> do<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.310> we're<00:00:20.609> going<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.760> tune<00:00:21.000> our<00:00:21.150> guitar

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
to do is we're going to tune our guitar

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.109 
to do is we're going to tune our guitar
to<00:00:22.170> where<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.439> goes<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:23.160> sixth<00:00:23.519> string<00:00:23.789> will

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
to where it goes the sixth string will

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.250 
to where it goes the sixth string will
be<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.269> C<00:00:24.859> the<00:00:25.859> fifth<00:00:26.130> string<00:00:26.580> will<00:00:26.880> be<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> G<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
be a C the fifth string will be a G the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.189 
be a C the fifth string will be a G the
fourth<00:00:28.650> string<00:00:29.070> will<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> C<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.900> third

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
fourth string will be a C the third

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.310 
fourth string will be a C the third
string<00:00:31.590> will<00:00:31.980> remain<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.610> G<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.540> second<00:00:34.050> string

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
string will remain a G the second string

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.200 
string will remain a G the second string
we're<00:00:34.590> going<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.770> tune<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> G<00:00:35.579> as<00:00:35.730> well<00:00:35.910> and

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
we're going to tune to a G as well and

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.450 
we're going to tune to a G as well and
then<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.870> first<00:00:37.440> string<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.160> be<00:00:38.340> an

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
then the first string is going to be an

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.790 
then the first string is going to be an
E<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.690> way<00:00:39.780> we're<00:00:39.930> going<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.110> get<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.590> is

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
E and the way we're going to get that is

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.619 
E and the way we're going to get that is
we're<00:00:41.430> going<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.610> drop<00:00:41.940> our<00:00:42.239> low<00:00:42.960> string<00:00:43.020> first

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
we're going to drop our low string first

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.299 
we're going to drop our low string first
so<00:00:45.629> right<00:00:45.870> now<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.230> an<00:00:46.350> E<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.070> we're<00:00:47.190> going

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
so right now it's an E and we're going

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.400 
so right now it's an E and we're going
to<00:00:47.340> drop<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.760> here's<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.030> D<00:00:48.329> we're<00:00:48.960> going<00:00:49.230> to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
to drop it here's the D we're going to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.270 
to drop it here's the D we're going to
as<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:49.770> did<00:00:49.950> before

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.580 

and<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.240> then<00:00:53.480> we're<00:00:53.630> going<00:00:53.750> to<00:00:53.780> go<00:00:53.990> all<00:00:54.320> the

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
and and then we're going to go all the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.170 
and and then we're going to go all the
way<00:00:54.620> down<00:00:54.950> we're<00:00:55.190> going<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:55.370> keep<00:00:55.490> going<00:00:55.550> below

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
way down we're going to keep going below

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.370 
way down we're going to keep going below
that<00:00:56.510> so<00:00:57.350> that<00:00:57.500> we<00:00:57.620> can<00:00:57.650> get<00:00:57.920> ourselves<00:00:58.040> a<00:00:58.430> C

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
that so that we can get ourselves a C

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.630 
that so that we can get ourselves a C
but<00:01:00.380> I'm<00:01:00.470> not<00:01:00.590> actually<00:01:00.980> going<00:01:01.100> to<00:01:01.160> tune<00:01:01.460> it

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
but I'm not actually going to tune it

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.190 
but I'm not actually going to tune it
right<00:01:01.670> now<00:01:02.000> I'm<00:01:02.239> just<00:01:02.450> going<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:02.660> get<00:01:02.870> it<00:01:02.989> down

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
right now I'm just going to get it down

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.869 
right now I'm just going to get it down
there<00:01:03.530> just<00:01:03.739> for<00:01:03.950> tension<00:01:04.220> sake<00:01:04.580> on<00:01:04.760> the

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
there just for tension sake on the

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:05.469 
there just for tension sake on the
guitar

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
guitar

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.690 
guitar
just<00:01:05.930> because<00:01:06.290> you<00:01:06.920> really<00:01:07.190> kind<00:01:07.400> of<00:01:07.460> want<00:01:07.640> to

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
just because you really kind of want to

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.670 
just because you really kind of want to
keep<00:01:07.910> everything<00:01:08.210> distributed<00:01:08.690> evenly<00:01:09.350> and

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
keep everything distributed evenly and

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.859 
keep everything distributed evenly and
so<00:01:10.130> if<00:01:10.369> we<00:01:10.520> loosen<00:01:10.940> this<00:01:11.090> up<00:01:11.150> we're<00:01:11.660> going<00:01:11.780> to

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
so if we loosen this up we're going to

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.870 
so if we loosen this up we're going to
be<00:01:11.990> able<00:01:12.080> to<00:01:12.350> get<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.770> G<00:01:13.040> a<00:01:13.220> little<00:01:13.580> bit<00:01:13.700> better

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
be able to get the G a little bit better

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.960 
be able to get the G a little bit better
where<00:01:14.300> we<00:01:14.479> drop<00:01:14.750> our<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:15.170> but<00:01:15.860> finding<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.400> G<00:01:16.729> is

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
where we drop our a but finding the G is

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.760 
where we drop our a but finding the G is
just<00:01:17.240> going<00:01:17.330> to<00:01:17.390> be<00:01:17.600> as<00:01:17.840> if<00:01:18.080> we<00:01:18.110> were<00:01:18.320> to<00:01:18.500> drop

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
just going to be as if we were to drop

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.940 
just going to be as if we were to drop
the<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.880> sixth<00:01:20.270> string<00:01:20.510> from<00:01:20.960> an<00:01:21.080> e<00:01:21.229> to<00:01:21.410> a<00:01:21.440> D<00:01:21.740> is

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
the the sixth string from an e to a D is

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.520 
the the sixth string from an e to a D is
the<00:01:22.160> same<00:01:22.400> concept<00:01:22.729> of<00:01:23.119> driving<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.840> fifth

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
the same concept of driving the fifth

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.790 
the same concept of driving the fifth
string<00:01:24.830> a<00:01:25.009> to<00:01:25.580> a<00:01:25.610> G<00:01:26.300> it's<00:01:26.540> just<00:01:27.200> in<00:01:27.440> a<00:01:27.770> different

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
string a to a G it's just in a different

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.520 
string a to a G it's just in a different
position<00:01:28.399> on<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:28.820> guitar<00:01:29.210> so<00:01:29.500> we're<00:01:30.500> just

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
position on the guitar so we're just

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:38.179 
position on the guitar so we're just
going<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:30.830> drop<00:01:31.220> this<00:01:31.280> down

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.469 

and<00:01:39.189> again<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:39.579> can<00:01:39.700> do<00:01:39.789> the<00:01:39.909> seventh<00:01:40.270> fret

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
and again you can do the seventh fret

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.300 
and again you can do the seventh fret
routine<00:01:40.930> seventh<00:01:41.409> fret<00:01:41.590> on<00:01:41.649> the<00:01:41.770> 5th<00:01:42.009> string

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
routine seventh fret on the 5th string

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.200 
routine seventh fret on the 5th string
that<00:01:43.060> should<00:01:43.270> give<00:01:43.450> you<00:01:43.570> the<00:01:43.869> 4th<00:01:44.140> string

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
that should give you the 4th string

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.749 
that should give you the 4th string
pretty<00:01:46.870> close<00:01:47.080> there

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.789 

so<00:01:51.360> now<00:01:51.539> we<00:01:51.600> have<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.110> seventh<00:01:52.500> fret

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
so now we have the seventh fret

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.550 
so now we have the seventh fret
available<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.299> low<00:01:54.539> string<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:55.229> sixth

string or the fourth string down to a C
so<00:02:16.580> we're<00:02:16.670> going<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.819> take<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.300> I'm<00:02:17.690> going<00:02:17.840> to

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
so we're going to take that I'm going to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.949 
so we're going to take that I'm going to
take<00:02:18.050> our<00:02:18.200> low<00:02:18.440> seat<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.819> our<00:02:20.000> fourth<00:02:20.599> string

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.840 

and<00:02:25.930> again<00:02:26.500> we<00:02:26.650> can<00:02:26.830> check<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.220> by<00:02:27.400> having<00:02:27.580> the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.780 
and again we can check it by having the
fifth<00:02:28.090> fret<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.990> fifth<00:02:29.770> string

fifth fret of the fifth string

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.290 
fifth fret of the fifth string
sort<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.850> check<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.300> way

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.729 

there<00:02:37.300> we<00:02:37.390> go<00:02:37.569> I'm<00:02:38.200> going<00:02:38.349> to<00:02:38.379> leave<00:02:38.530> this

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
there we go I'm going to leave this

there we go I'm going to leave this
string<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.099> same<00:02:39.340> although<00:02:39.640> since<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.060> did<00:02:40.239> all

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
string the same although since I did all

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.670 
string the same although since I did all
that<00:02:40.420> stuff<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:40.930> might<00:02:41.049> be<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.230> little<00:02:41.470> bit<00:02:41.590> out

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
that stuff it might be a little bit out

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.760 
that stuff it might be a little bit out
of<00:02:41.709> whack

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.040

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.890 
there we go so now I'm going to take my
B<00:02:53.680> string<00:02:54.130> or<00:02:54.340> my<00:02:54.610> second<00:02:55.060> string<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:55.600> I'm

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
B string or my second string and I'm

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.540 
B string or my second string and I'm
gonna<00:02:55.990> drop<00:02:56.200> that<00:02:56.230> all<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.890> way<00:02:56.980> down<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.460> G

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
gonna drop that all the way down to a G

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.640 
gonna drop that all the way down to a G
matching<00:02:58.390> this<00:02:58.510> string<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:59.290> they're<00:02:59.500> going<00:02:59.590> to

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
matching this string so they're going to

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:09.790 
matching this string so they're going to
have<00:02:59.800> the<00:03:00.010> same<00:03:00.190> tuning

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.110 

there<00:03:10.800> we<00:03:10.950> go<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.370> now<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.520> first<00:03:11.850> room<00:03:12.030> is

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120

going<00:03:12.270> to<00:03:12.330> remain<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.690> same<00:03:13.130> so<00:03:14.130> now<00:03:14.160> I<00:03:14.340> have

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
going to remain the same so now I have

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.860 
going to remain the same so now I have
my<00:03:15.420> open<00:03:15.930> C<00:03:16.200> tuning

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.930
