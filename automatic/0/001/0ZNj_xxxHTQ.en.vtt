00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:11.950
 We roots between visits in the windscreen also bring together decision 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.530

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.630
 It is 2 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:46.390
 Kitchen set alcohol stove and key 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.370
 Together normally also tentatively Well burner Pat and cutting board to end the tongs to the emergence multi-tool 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.490
