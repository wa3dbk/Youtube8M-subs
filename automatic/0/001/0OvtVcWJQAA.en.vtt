faction of people who eat zombie flesh
and<00:00:43.020> they<00:00:43.140> feel<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.649> because<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.129> zombies<00:00:44.309> eat

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.029 
and they feel so because the zombies eat
them<00:00:45.090> they<00:00:45.660> must<00:00:45.840> complete<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.410> cycle<00:00:46.860> and

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
them they must complete the cycle and

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.420

zombie<00:00:50.940> flesh<00:00:51.239> he<00:00:51.480> didn't<00:00:51.780> do<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:51.930> because<00:00:52.199> he

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
zombie flesh he didn't do it because he

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.500 
zombie flesh he didn't do it because he
was<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> member<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> flesh<00:00:53.670> he<00:00:54.000> just<00:00:54.270> ate

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
was a member of the flesh he just ate

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.299 
was a member of the flesh he just ate
zombie<00:00:55.050> flesh<00:00:55.289> there<00:00:55.559> wasn't<00:00:55.890> really<00:00:55.980> much<00:00:56.250> of

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
zombie flesh there wasn't really much of

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.010 
zombie flesh there wasn't really much of
an<00:00:56.610> explanation<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.480> although<00:00:57.660> we<00:00:57.899> can

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
an explanation to it although we can

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.760 
an explanation to it although we can
assume<00:00:58.289> maybe<00:00:59.070> he<00:00:59.399> was<00:00:59.550> hungry<00:00:59.760> or<00:01:00.480> maybe<00:01:01.050> she

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
assume maybe he was hungry or maybe she

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.889 
assume maybe he was hungry or maybe she
just<00:01:01.800> went<00:01:02.250> insane<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.149> drove<00:01:03.449> him<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.750> eat

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
just went insane and I drove him to eat

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.570 
just went insane and I drove him to eat
zombie<00:01:04.320> flesh<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:04.739> don't<00:01:04.890> exactly<00:01:05.220> know<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
zombie flesh we don't exactly know the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.030 
zombie flesh we don't exactly know the
reasons<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.720> know<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.200> he<00:01:07.439> did<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.740> so

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
reasons we just know that he did it so

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.490 
reasons we just know that he did it so
he<00:01:08.280> never<00:01:08.640> exactly<00:01:09.000> joined<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.659> flesh<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.229> as

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
he never exactly joined the flesh and as

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.679 
he never exactly joined the flesh and as
a<00:01:10.530> result<00:01:11.010> he<00:01:11.159> was<00:01:11.280> never<00:01:11.549> really<00:01:11.909> separated

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
a result he was never really separated

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.530 
a result he was never really separated
from<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.049> flesh<00:01:13.350> they<00:01:14.159> are<00:01:14.580> two<00:01:14.939> separate

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
from the flesh they are two separate

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.539 
from the flesh they are two separate
entities<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.439> have<00:01:16.470> suing<00:01:17.100> or<00:01:17.220> who's<00:01:17.340> being

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
controlled by Richthofen and then we had

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.510 
controlled by Richthofen and then we had
the<00:01:19.229> flesh<00:01:19.470> who<00:01:19.680> are<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.890> group<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.340> people
