00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.319
 Learn to release an LG 7 by email on 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.880
 code needed to release it what 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.800
 We provide in the mail address 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.740

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.830
 live.com or else by whatsapp on 6 26 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.779
 22 7 352 well once we have the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.250
 Congo of liberation what we have to 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.810
 do is turn on the phone without 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.810
 no card without inside 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.679
 this method is totally safe not 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.390
 invalid the manufacturer's warranty does not 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:36.340
 causes any type of terminal failure 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.340
 and did not delete any data 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.859
 tell you that some of you write to us that if 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.170
 the terminal is blocked by email is 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.250
 say that he does not stop making calls 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.559
 we can not help us 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.879
 unlock this is the release 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.269
 to be able to use it with any 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.269
 partner 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.500
 they have served unblock we have 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.140
 to open the bookmark as if we were to 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.720
 call a number 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:29.990
 and now we have to mark the next 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:33.450
 sequence 2945 asterisk pad 700 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.000
 pad well this code gives us 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.590
 access to this hidden menu in which 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.960
 we must press the first option 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.960
 network blocking 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.520
 well as you see now he asks us for a code 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.159
 of release this is the code the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.990
 logically provided the code you 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.200
 I'm going to put now it only serves for this 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.200
 terminal 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.860
 we close the keyboard and click on 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.860
 to unlock 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.280
 and how it exposes the unlocking has been 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.160
 correctly made the phone is 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.960
 restart automatically and you're done 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.730
 to be used with any operator 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.990
 which we could be able to with any 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.990
 card and it would already work
