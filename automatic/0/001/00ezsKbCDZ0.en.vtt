 option that was not disclosed and was part 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.420
 LOTAU or as a weapon I picked blÃ© 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.480

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.790

 the magnum and the plasma gun very 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.040
 well now I will give you a list of other 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.110

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.830
 elites will only come out in the campaign 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.050
 they will no longer appear in the multiplayer 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.460
 there will only be spartans the skills of 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.680
 armor that will return will be the 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.690
 hologram the jetpack the invisibility and 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.910
 Now running or sprinter is a skill 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.489
 that will have all there will be a new way of 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.070
 game called all away and side way and it 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.840
 suicide thinks how it occurs that 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.640
 will consist of the player with the 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.680
 higher score will become the 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.690
 leader or king and every time he kills 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.370
 someone will increase their value so the 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.440
 other players besides killing each other 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.300
 yes they can kill him to get a 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.460
 reward of points equal to the amount 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.100
 of players that killed the leader now 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.620

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.880
 that there will no longer be that classic counting of 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.070

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.340
 the rockets or sniper will appear 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.400
 randomly on the map through 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.770
 eggs props as in invasions laws of 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.330
 halo reach or pilot of gears of war or 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.160
 be after starting the game 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.500
 will appear after a certain time 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.090
 every time you finish a game there will be 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.040
 an animation where the 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.840

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.350

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.740
 new that they will give you when you distract 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.600
 someone with the hologram this cloth 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.780
 could walk if they shoot the hologram 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.030
 that you threw or maybe if you shoot him and 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.820
 then you kill the one who shot achieving 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.980
 think and finally now people can 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.830
 join games in progress so if 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.600
 you stay alone against four players or 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.420
 something like that with time 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.640
 would join more people to your team well 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.900
 that was all thanks for watching the video

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.289
 image analysis I hope they have 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.479
 found something that 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.009
 have not heard in other videos and if 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.779
 it was not because no way yet of 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.830
 many people will receive information 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:01.349
 that they did not know 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.550
