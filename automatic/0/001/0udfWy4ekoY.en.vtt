00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
so ride and handling pretty much what

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.030

you'd<00:00:39.210> expect<00:00:39.270> from<00:00:39.630> the<00:00:39.840> car<00:00:40.050> as<00:00:40.230> well<00:00:40.410> it's

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
you'd expect from the car as well it's

you'd expect from the car as well it's
definitely<00:00:41.670> softer<00:00:42.090> than<00:00:42.330> a<00:00:42.420> Golf<00:00:42.660> GTI<00:00:43.430> and<00:00:44.430> I

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
definitely softer than a Golf GTI and I

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.820 
definitely softer than a Golf GTI and I
think<00:00:44.790> that's<00:00:44.910> kind<00:00:45.150> of<00:00:45.210> refreshing<00:00:45.570> but<00:00:46.260> you

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
think that's kind of refreshing but you

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.040 
think that's kind of refreshing but you
know<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.010> can't<00:00:47.280> expect<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.970> be<00:00:48.120> as<00:00:48.480> number

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
know you can't expect it to be as number

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.350 
know you can't expect it to be as number
through<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> corners<00:00:49.710> either
