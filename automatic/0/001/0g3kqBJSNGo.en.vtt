might want to notice is that it's very

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.800

now<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.539> most<00:01:33.630> part<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.929> just<00:01:33.959> regular

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
now for the most part is just regular

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.870 
now for the most part is just regular
controller<00:01:34.739> minus<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> looks<00:01:35.399> except<00:01:35.849> for

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
controller minus the looks except for

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.540 
controller minus the looks except for
one<00:01:36.179> key<00:01:36.479> feature<00:01:36.720> which<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.830> the<00:01:38.250> d-pad<00:01:38.640> now

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
one key feature which is the d-pad now

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.249 
one key feature which is the d-pad now
as<00:01:41.550> you<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.119> see<00:01:42.179> a<00:01:42.300> normal<00:01:42.479> controller<00:01:42.929> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
as you can see a normal controller the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.979 
as you can see a normal controller the
d-pad<00:01:43.560> looks<00:01:43.830> like<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.780> however<00:01:45.780> i<00:01:45.840> miss

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:45.989 
d-pad looks like this however i miss

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:47.990 
d-pad looks like this however i miss
controller<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:46.920> change<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.399> up<00:01:47.520> by

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
controller you can change it up by

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.660 
controller you can change it up by
simply<00:01:48.360> turning<00:01:48.959> the<00:01:49.530> four<00:01:50.250> directional

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
simply turning the four directional

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.529 
simply turning the four directional
button<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.599> can<00:01:52.050> raise<00:01:52.319> itself<00:01:53.330> so<00:01:54.330> you<00:01:54.420> can

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
button it can raise itself so you can

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.180 
button it can raise itself so you can
see<00:01:54.660> how<00:01:54.690> it's<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.929> bit<00:01:55.080> higher<00:01:55.259> as<00:01:55.560> opposed<00:01:55.890> to

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
see how it's a bit higher as opposed to

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.830 
see how it's a bit higher as opposed to
the<00:01:57.030> regular<00:01:58.729> controller<00:01:59.729> which<00:02:00.539> is<00:02:00.660> about

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
the regular controller which is about

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.279 
the regular controller which is about
that<00:02:02.660> you<00:02:03.660> can<00:02:03.780> see<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.899> little<00:02:04.020> bit<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.200> a

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
that you can see a little bit of a

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.800 
that you can see a little bit of a
difference<00:02:04.560> there<00:02:05.209> so<00:02:06.209> you<00:02:06.300> can<00:02:06.420> choose<00:02:06.599> which

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
difference there so you can choose which

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.020 
difference there so you can choose which
one<00:02:06.989> you<00:02:07.140> like<00:02:07.319> it<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.340> very<00:02:08.459> nice<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.940> it

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
one you like it is very nice that it

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.919 
one you like it is very nice that it
comes<00:02:09.179> with<00:02:09.239> its<00:02:09.450> own<00:02:09.509> set<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.750> batteries

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
comes with its own set of batteries

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.390 
comes with its own set of batteries
right<00:02:10.229> off<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.470> bat<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.979> can<00:02:11.099> just<00:02:11.129> pop

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
right off the bat so you can just pop

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.180 
right off the bat so you can just pop
them<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.640> start<00:02:11.970> playing<00:02:12.560> it<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.800> know<00:02:13.890> it's

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190
