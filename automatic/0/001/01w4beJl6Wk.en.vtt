some<00:03:13.410> kind<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:13.680> cool<00:03:13.890> about<00:03:14.069> a<00:03:14.130> long<00:03:14.340> pipe<00:03:14.610> huh

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.090 

one<00:03:18.420> thing<00:03:18.600> good<00:03:18.630> about<00:03:18.990> these<00:03:19.200> long<00:03:19.530> pipes<00:03:19.860> is

one thing good about these long pipes is

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.100 
one thing good about these long pipes is
it<00:03:20.280> seems<00:03:20.520> they<00:03:20.670> seem<00:03:21.240> to<00:03:21.360> smoke<00:03:21.569> a<00:03:21.690> lot<00:03:21.720> cooler

a<00:03:24.800> lot<00:03:25.800> farther
