anyway<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:40.079> figure<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:41.090> personally<00:00:42.090> I

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
anyway this figure I personally I

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.060 
anyway this figure I personally I
thought<00:00:42.960> jen<00:00:43.170> was<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.350> really<00:00:43.590> cool<00:00:43.739> character

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
thought jen was a really cool character

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.459 
thought jen was a really cool character
in<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.309> game<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.809> probably<00:00:45.809> didn't<00:00:46.289> think<00:00:46.410> he

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
in the game I probably didn't think he

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.930 
in the game I probably didn't think he
was<00:00:46.559> as<00:00:46.710> cool<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.010> character<00:00:47.370> as<00:00:47.579> some<00:00:47.850> of

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
was as cool of a character as some of

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.100 
was as cool of a character as some of
the<00:00:48.030> people<00:00:48.300> thought<00:00:48.510> because<00:00:48.780> some<00:00:48.930> people

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
the people thought because some people

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.180 
the people thought because some people
think<00:00:49.200> he's<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> new<00:00:49.649> Boba<00:00:49.980> Fett<00:00:50.160> or

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
think he's like the new Boba Fett or

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.670 
think he's like the new Boba Fett or
something<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:50.940> he<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.120> still<00:00:51.360> cool<00:00:51.649> now<00:00:52.649> I

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
something but he is still cool now I

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.959 
something but he is still cool now I
think<00:00:52.920> one<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.160> problems<00:00:53.190> was<00:00:53.520> he<00:00:53.730> didn't

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
think one of the problems was he didn't

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.970 
think one of the problems was he didn't
get<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.090> lot<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.329> character<00:00:55.199> development<00:00:55.620> time

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
get a lot of character development time

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.830 
get a lot of character development time
is<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.399> George<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.940> Carter<00:00:57.239> did<00:00:57.420> so

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
is like George and Carter did so

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.930 
is like George and Carter did so
probably<00:00:58.649> if<00:00:58.859> he<00:00:58.949> would<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.190> had<00:00:59.340> more<00:00:59.609> time

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
probably if he would have had more time

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.349 
probably if he would have had more time
in<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.989> game<00:01:01.199> he'll<00:01:01.559> reach<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.039> kind<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.359> be

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
in the game he'll reach to kind of be

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.570 
in the game he'll reach to kind of be
described<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.229> shown<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.739> stuff<00:01:04.920> he

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
described and shown and stuff he

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
described and shown and stuff he
probably<00:01:05.790> would<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.030> been<00:01:06.150> an<00:01:06.270> even<00:01:06.360> cooler

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
probably would have been an even cooler

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.570 
probably would have been an even cooler
character<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.530> he<00:01:07.590> was<00:01:07.770> one<00:01:08.040> heck<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.369> shot

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
character but he was one heck of a shot

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.460 
character but he was one heck of a shot
except<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:09.689> time<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.900> shot<00:01:10.229> me<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
except the one time that shot me in the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.620 
except the one time that shot me in the
back<00:01:10.680> while<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.700> was<00:01:11.850> playing<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.360> didn't

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
back while I was playing I didn't

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.390 
back while I was playing I didn't
appreciate<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.229> one<00:01:13.380> little<00:01:13.590> bit<00:01:13.830> but

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
appreciate that one little bit but

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.730 
appreciate that one little bit but
anyway<00:01:14.810> Jim<00:01:15.810> here<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.229> basically<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> same

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
anyway Jim here is basically the same

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.170 
anyway Jim here is basically the same
figures<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.280> we<00:01:17.340> had<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.729> previous<00:01:17.880> that

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
figures that we had in the previous that

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.820 
figures that we had in the previous that
he<00:01:18.240> was<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.450> series<00:01:18.750> 3<00:01:19.049> he<00:01:19.409> came<00:01:19.650> out

he was in series 3 he came out

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.740 
he was in series 3 he came out
originally<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.460> basically<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.820> exact<00:01:21.299> same

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
originally it's basically the exact same

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.830 
originally it's basically the exact same
body<00:01:22.140> no<00:01:22.770> battle<00:01:23.100> damage<00:01:23.340> nothing<00:01:23.850> becomes

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
body no battle damage nothing becomes

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.660 
body no battle damage nothing becomes
the<00:01:25.020> same<00:01:25.290> sniper<00:01:25.560> rifle<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.189> frag<00:01:26.400> grenade

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
the same sniper rifle and a frag grenade

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.920 
the same sniper rifle and a frag grenade
the<00:01:26.820> only<00:01:27.060> thing<00:01:27.270> that's<00:01:27.420> different<00:01:27.479> with

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
the only thing that's different with

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.660 
the only thing that's different with
this<00:01:28.080> one<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.590> get<00:01:28.799> him<00:01:29.220> without<00:01:29.430> a

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
this one is that you get him without a

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.499 
this one is that you get him without a
helmet<00:01:30.000> versus<00:01:30.570> with<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> helmet<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:32.509> some

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
helmet versus with a helmet on so some

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.640 
helmet versus with a helmet on so some
people<00:01:33.780> probably<00:01:33.930> still<00:01:34.290> prefer<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
people probably still prefer the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.870 
people probably still prefer the
helmeted<00:01:34.950> version<00:01:35.369> some<00:01:35.640> people<00:01:35.820> would

helmeted version some people would

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.490

prefer<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.390> helmeted<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.140> they<00:01:37.229> kind<00:01:37.439> of

prefer the on helmeted so they kind of

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.960 
prefer the on helmeted so they kind of

pretty good representation of taking the
video<00:02:45.770> game<00:02:46.070> character<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:46.580> making<00:02:46.820> it<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:47.000> toy

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
video game character and making it a toy

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.730 
video game character and making it a toy
I<00:02:47.450> would<00:02:47.930> say<00:02:48.050> that<00:02:48.080> they<00:02:48.260> did<00:02:48.380> a<00:02:48.440> pretty<00:02:48.470> good

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
I would say that they did a pretty good

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.860 
I would say that they did a pretty good
job<00:02:48.800> with<00:02:48.980> that<00:02:49.160> so<00:02:49.850> overall<00:02:50.360> I<00:02:50.690> would<00:02:50.750> say

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
job with that so overall I would say

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.940 
job with that so overall I would say
that<00:02:51.080> he's<00:02:51.170> going<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.350> get<00:02:51.440> a<00:02:51.500> 5<00:02:51.680> out<00:02:51.830> of<00:02:51.860> 5

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
that he's going to get a 5 out of 5

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.810 
that he's going to get a 5 out of 5
rating<00:02:52.070> as<00:02:52.550> far<00:02:52.730> as<00:02:52.850> it<00:02:53.060> looks<00:02:53.390> pretty<00:02:54.140> good<00:02:54.820> it

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
rating as far as it looks pretty good it

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.210 
rating as far as it looks pretty good it
may<00:02:56.390> not<00:02:56.420> look<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.900> most<00:02:57.140> realistic<00:02:57.530> but<00:02:58.040> you

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
may not look the most realistic but you

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.940 
may not look the most realistic but you
know<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.850> is<00:02:59.600> still<00:03:00.080> something<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:00.530> be<00:03:00.620> said<00:03:00.920> to

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
know it is still something to be said to

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.340 
know it is still something to be said to
take<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.550> character<00:03:02.330> that<00:03:02.360> was<00:03:02.570> me<00:03:02.690> oh<00:03:02.960> my

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
take a character that was me oh my

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.130 
take a character that was me oh my
goodness<00:03:03.500> in<00:03:03.920> a<00:03:04.520> video<00:03:04.730> game<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:05.390> then<00:03:06.110> make

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
goodness in a video game and then make

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.080 
goodness in a video game and then make
it<00:03:06.380> a<00:03:06.440> toy<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:07.010> expecting<00:03:07.490> to<00:03:07.610> look<00:03:07.760> just<00:03:07.970> like

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
it a toy and expecting to look just like

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.760 
it a toy and expecting to look just like
the<00:03:08.330> toy<00:03:08.540> or<00:03:08.840> just<00:03:09.200> like<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.410> video<00:03:09.590> game

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
the toy or just like the video game

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.400 
the toy or just like the video game
version<00:03:09.920> it's<00:03:10.340> just<00:03:10.520> going<00:03:10.640> to<00:03:10.670> be<00:03:10.760> difficult

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
version it's just going to be difficult

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.560 
version it's just going to be difficult
so<00:03:12.430> like<00:03:13.430> I<00:03:13.520> said<00:03:13.580> he<00:03:13.910> does<00:03:14.060> come<00:03:14.330> with<00:03:14.510> a

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
so like I said he does come with a

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.990 
so like I said he does come with a
sniper<00:03:15.020> rifle<00:03:15.170> I<00:03:15.590> wish<00:03:16.130> I<00:03:16.220> have<00:03:16.460> a<00:03:16.490> weapon<00:03:16.670> peg

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
sniper rifle I wish I have a weapon peg

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000 
sniper rifle I wish I have a weapon peg
but<00:03:17.210> you<00:03:17.300> can't<00:03:17.480> really<00:03:17.600> use<00:03:18.020> it<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.710> put<00:03:18.890> on

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
but you can't really use it to put on

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.880 
but you can't really use it to put on
his<00:03:19.130> back<00:03:19.370> because<00:03:19.850> of<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.380> extra<00:03:21.380> bits<00:03:21.740> that

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
his back because of the extra bits that

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.220 
his back because of the extra bits that
he<00:03:22.010> has<00:03:22.190> here<00:03:22.520> you<00:03:23.420> can't<00:03:23.630> kind<00:03:23.750> of<00:03:23.900> move<00:03:24.020> it<00:03:24.110> up

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
he has here you can't kind of move it up

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.570 
he has here you can't kind of move it up
and<00:03:24.380> probably<00:03:24.500> get<00:03:24.710> it<00:03:24.800> in<00:03:24.890> there<00:03:25.070> but<00:03:25.280> you

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
and probably get it in there but you

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.160 
and probably get it in there but you
know<00:03:25.640> then<00:03:26.090> he<00:03:26.180> does<00:03:26.300> also<00:03:26.450> come<00:03:26.690> with<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:26.930> frag

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170

and then you have to but anyway very

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.120 
and then you have to but anyway very
cool<00:03:37.820> figure<00:03:39.190> very<00:03:40.190> cool<00:03:40.370> figure<00:03:42.130> definitely

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
cool figure very cool figure definitely

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.410 
cool figure very cool figure definitely
worth<00:03:43.220> picking<00:03:43.280> up<00:03:43.670> if<00:03:43.820> you<00:03:43.910> really<00:03:44.150> like<00:03:44.270> this

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
worth picking up if you really like this

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.520 
worth picking up if you really like this
character<00:03:44.600> which<00:03:44.900> I<00:03:44.960> know<00:03:45.050> a<00:03:45.080> lot<00:03:45.320> of<00:03:45.380> people

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
character which I know a lot of people

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.830 
character which I know a lot of people
do<00:03:46.010> I<00:03:46.220> believe<00:03:47.030> that<00:03:47.180> there<00:03:47.300> are<00:03:47.330> two<00:03:47.570> of<00:03:47.720> these

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
do I believe that there are two of these

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.750 
do I believe that there are two of these
per<00:03:48.230> case<00:03:48.590> so<00:03:48.890> there<00:03:49.040> will<00:03:49.160> be<00:03:49.310> more<00:03:49.490> of<00:03:49.610> these

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
per case so there will be more of these

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.600 
per case so there will be more of these
going<00:03:50.000> around<00:03:50.590> so<00:03:51.590> you<00:03:52.130> have<00:03:52.250> a<00:03:52.280> very<00:03:52.490> good

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
going around so you have a very good

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.520 
going around so you have a very good
chance<00:03:52.670> of<00:03:52.970> finding<00:03:53.270> one<00:03:53.450> or<00:03:53.660> or<00:03:53.780> getting<00:03:54.410> one

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
chance of finding one or or getting one

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.440 
chance of finding one or or getting one
online<00:03:54.770> or<00:03:54.980> something<00:03:55.240> compared<00:03:56.240> to<00:03:56.270> some<00:03:56.420> of

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
online or something compared to some of

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.240 
online or something compared to some of
the<00:03:56.570> other<00:03:56.600> figures<00:03:57.020> you<00:03:57.260> know<00:03:57.350> in<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.010> case

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
the other figures you know in the case

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.680 
the other figures you know in the case

members of noble team couldn't really do

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.410 
members of noble team couldn't really do
noble<00:04:10.310> six<00:04:10.580> because<00:04:10.910> they<00:04:11.030> never<00:04:11.120> showed<00:04:11.330> his
