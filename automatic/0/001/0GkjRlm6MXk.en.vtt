hey<00:02:05.560> notice<00:02:05.860> what<00:02:05.950> I'm<00:02:06.040> doing<00:02:06.310> these<00:02:06.510> that<00:02:07.510> I

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
hey notice what I'm doing these that I

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.200 
hey notice what I'm doing these that I
wasn't<00:02:08.550> bobbing<00:02:09.550> up<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:09.729> down<00:02:09.820> with<00:02:10.060> this

that<00:02:11.980> body<00:02:12.160> as<00:02:12.490> still<00:02:13.300> as<00:02:13.330> possible<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:14.020> that

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
that body as still as possible so that

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.170 
that body as still as possible so that
you're<00:02:14.230> not<00:02:14.340> putting<00:02:15.340> your<00:02:15.700> body<00:02:15.880> down<00:02:16.000> to

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
you're not putting your body down to

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.410 
you're not putting your body down to
meet<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.330> bar<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.790> if<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.000> have<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.210> reduce

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
meet the bar and if you have to reduce

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.720 
meet the bar and if you have to reduce
the<00:02:19.570> weight<00:02:19.720> that<00:02:19.840> did<00:02:20.020> complished<00:02:20.380> that

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
the weight that did complished that

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:38.730 
the weight that did complished that
reduce<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.880> way<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.180> accomplish<00:02:22.450> it

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.510 

ah

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.250 

so<00:02:44.970> now<00:02:45.060> he's<00:02:45.210> got<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.480> full<00:02:45.630> range<00:02:45.750> reps<00:02:46.050> left

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
so now he's got the full range reps left

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.760 
so now he's got the full range reps left
to<00:02:46.380> do<00:02:46.760> remember<00:02:47.760> these<00:02:48.320> set<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.410> bar<00:02:49.560> down<00:02:49.740> on

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
to do remember these set the bar down on

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.460 
to do remember these set the bar down on
