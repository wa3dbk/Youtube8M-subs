together<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> same<00:01:19.799> day<00:01:20.009> which<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.820> known

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
together on the same day which is known

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.600 
together on the same day which is known
as<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.180> APU<00:01:21.750> by<00:01:21.990> AMD<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.860> new<00:01:22.979> technology

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
as the APU by AMD it's a new technology

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.080 
as the APU by AMD it's a new technology
which<00:01:24.090> makes<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.869> laptops<00:01:25.350> not<00:01:25.799> only<00:01:26.729> light

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
which makes the laptops not only light

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.160 
which makes the laptops not only light
and<00:01:27.450> well<00:01:27.990> performing<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:28.650> also<00:01:29.070> low<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.579> heat

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
and well performing but also low on heat

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.410 
and well performing but also low on heat
dissipation<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.650> they<00:01:31.920> run<00:01:32.189> cooler<00:01:33.150> quieter

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
dissipation so they run cooler quieter

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.080 
dissipation so they run cooler quieter
and<00:01:33.869> far<00:01:34.140> slimmer<00:01:34.380> as<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.920> see<00:01:35.159> here<00:01:35.400> this

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
and far slimmer as you can see here this

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.090 
and far slimmer as you can see here this
is<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.270> large<00:01:36.540> laptop<00:01:37.049> but<00:01:37.259> considering<00:01:37.890> that

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
is a large laptop but considering that

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.999 
is a large laptop but considering that
it<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.820> still<00:01:39.360> fairly<00:01:39.720> slim<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:40.799> we

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
it is still fairly slim this is all we

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.429 
it is still fairly slim this is all we
