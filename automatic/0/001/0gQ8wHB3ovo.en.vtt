at all and the funny thing about this
mask<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.379> not<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> Nightwing<00:00:38.129> mask<00:00:38.429> at<00:00:38.670> all

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
mask is it's not a Nightwing mask at all

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.220 
mask is it's not a Nightwing mask at all
it's<00:00:39.179> actually<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.809> Robin<00:00:40.589> mask<00:00:41.120> from<00:00:42.230> Batman

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
it's actually a Robin mask from Batman

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.099 
it's actually a Robin mask from Batman
and<00:00:43.379> Robin<00:00:43.769> so<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.370> goes<00:00:44.809> Batman<00:00:45.809> Batman

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
and Robin so it goes Batman Batman

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.770

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
Returns and forever and Batman and Robin

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.660 
Returns and forever and Batman and Robin
I<00:00:49.350> always<00:00:50.219> thought<00:00:50.339> they<00:00:50.460> should<00:00:50.640> have

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
I always thought they should have

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.189 
I always thought they should have
switched<00:00:50.969> these<00:00:51.210> two<00:00:51.420> even<00:00:51.870> though<00:00:52.019> they

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
switched these two even though they

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.860 
switched these two even though they
didn't<00:00:52.409> know<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.559> know<00:00:52.710> offhand<00:00:53.659> and<00:00:54.659> when

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
didn't know you know offhand and when

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
didn't know you know offhand and when
they<00:00:54.929> first<00:00:55.109> started<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.589> they're<00:00:55.710> going<00:00:55.800> to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
they first started that they're going to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.840 
they first started that they're going to
for<00:00:56.129> movies<00:00:56.429> but<00:00:57.239> Batman<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.839> Robin<00:00:58.109> is

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
for movies but Batman and Robin is

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.119 
for movies but Batman and Robin is
should<00:00:59.850> in<00:00:59.940> part<00:01:00.149> three<00:01:00.469> because<00:01:01.469> that's<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
should in part three because that's the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.860 
should in part three because that's the
first<00:01:02.309> time<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.579> Robin<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.089> Batman

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
first time you see Robin and Batman

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.080 
first time you see Robin and Batman
Forever

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
Forever

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.530 
Forever
it's<00:01:06.090> Batman<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.689> Batman<00:01:07.170> Forever<00:01:07.729> and<00:01:08.729> then

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
it's Batman for Batman Forever and then

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.120 
it's Batman for Batman Forever and then
just<00:01:10.259> make<00:01:10.350> sense<00:01:10.470> because<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.950> last

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
just make sense because it's the last

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.840 
just make sense because it's the last
one<00:01:11.540> but<00:01:12.540> obviously<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.460> they<00:01:14.460> didn't<00:01:14.729> know

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
one but obviously if they didn't know

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.789 
one but obviously if they didn't know
that<00:01:15.030> they're<00:01:15.180> gonna<00:01:15.299> make<00:01:15.390> four<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.049> they

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
that they're gonna make four so they

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.289 
that they're gonna make four so they
just<00:01:16.950> called<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.250> Batman<00:01:17.549> Bane<00:01:17.909> Returns

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
just called it Batman Bane Returns

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.690 
just called it Batman Bane Returns
Batman<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.500> Robin<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.009> Batman<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.549> know

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700

Batman Forever and Batman Robin see even

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.670 
Batman Forever and Batman Robin see even
I<00:01:24.180> get<00:01:24.329> confused<00:01:24.630> because<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.439> just<00:01:25.500> makes

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
I get confused because it just makes

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.850 
I get confused because it just makes
more<00:01:25.860> sense<00:01:26.070> but<00:01:26.909> yeah<00:01:27.000> um<00:01:27.229> let's<00:01:28.229> get<00:01:28.439> started

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
off of ebay

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.679 
off of ebay
it<00:01:40.439> was<00:01:40.560> around<00:01:40.680> $40<00:01:41.369> plus<00:01:42.210> shipping<00:01:42.509> and

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
it was around $40 plus shipping and

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.090 
it was around $40 plus shipping and
handling<00:01:43.670> if<00:01:44.670> you're<00:01:44.969> not<00:01:45.740> willing<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.920> pay

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.240 
handling if you're not willing to pay
that<00:01:47.310> then<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:48.530> guess<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.740> should<00:01:49.890> make<00:01:50.130> your

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
that then I guess you should make your

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.770 
that then I guess you should make your
own<00:01:50.369> mask<00:01:50.579> or<00:01:51.420> something<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:53.070> nature<00:01:53.780> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
own mask or something of that nature the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.690 
own mask or something of that nature the
most<00:01:55.020> masks<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.439> looked<00:01:55.619> up<00:01:55.799> around<00:01:56.070> $40

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
most masks I looked up around $40

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.660 
most masks I looked up around $40
there's<00:01:57.630> one<00:01:57.780> that's<00:01:57.869> $60<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:59.399> looks<00:01:59.549> like

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
there's one that's $60 that looks like

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.990 
there's one that's $60 that looks like
the<00:01:59.820> new<00:02:00.179> 52<00:02:00.420> masks<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> little<00:02:01.679> tighter
