00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.469
 hi everyone today wanted to make the video 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:11.389
 talk confession of beauty blogger has not 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.259
 wanted to call it beauty ass why not 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.360
 I feel such I wouldn't call myself manital e 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.070
 I wanted to do it a lot of time though 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.960
 I wanted to invite him in a special way 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.760
 so you will see that we are two I will do 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.920
 the questions and you will answer so I hope 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.470
 that the video vitaccia immediately begins the 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.960
 questions are 14 and I think it's a tag 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.239
 very very nice to know us better 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.370
 and to understand what lies behind that 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.370
 which then you see published on youtube 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.700
 how many hours a day you spend per 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.130
 edit your videos 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.930
 then you record the video I take 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.580
 a lot because I still do all 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.350
 things come to mind a lot of 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.450
 particular ideas therefore of meeting video 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.400
 times and to avoid on the act really 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.950
 so much because then doing the effects 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.640
 it becomes a really long thing then 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.680
 almost two days a week 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:09.030
 second question sky one who spends one 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.950
 which saves but in general I am one 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.080
 who spends too much more than what 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.229
 should therefore absolutely one that 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.630
 hangs you will have understood by now third 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.009
 asks when it is easier to film for 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.410
 it's easier for me to film in 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.710
 afternoon early afternoon then 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.960
 immediately after lunch or anyway 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.630
 mid-afternoon never after 5 o'clock 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.630
 I like to avoid at that time 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.750
 question number 4 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.460
 what is it that puts you at ease when 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.869
 film and to stay in front of one 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.119
 camera I miss my ease talking 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.550
 in front of a camera the fact of 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.420
 to know that I'm in my house anyway 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.000
 I'm calm 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.830
 I mean, I'm talking to one 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.509
 camcorder is actually not that but it is 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.190
 just a passion that expresses mine 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.929
 thoughts aloud and then puts you 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.490
 at ease to know precisely that I am alone 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:06.070
 speaking aloud 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.720
 fifth question what is your worst 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.280
 habit with regards to makeup 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:15.489
 and hair my gratitude for the 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.380
 trick I don't have a lot of reality every 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.239
 so much when I'm really tired tired 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.610
 dead I do not remove that you should not 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.110
 do instead for a no hair 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.209
 very ugly which is to wash the 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.300
 hair every day but in fact now 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.459
 to kill for this I'm already that i 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.010
 However, comments will be nasty 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.819
 this nasty habit that I can't 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.380
 take off anyway without question what it is 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.430
 the phrase that will want the world 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.739
 follow as a rule for life tip 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.819
 always at the moon at most it will happen to you 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.769
 of partners who among the seventh stars 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.150
 question how long each standing 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:57.100
 day to prepare us during the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.440
 week and maximum use 20 minutes 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.910
 to prepare myself I always try to reduce 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.650
 times because I have to go to anyway 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.840
 work and I have to hurry 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.440
 if instead I have more time to do more things 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.940
 important you see so even half an hour 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.530
 between courts of hour but never more 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.820
 quite a quick person to 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:20.350
 prepare yourself what your video is 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.780
 finished my favorite video on youtube 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.019
 on youtube there is a favorite video in 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.970
 actually here are videos they put 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.950
 together many clips for videos of 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.690
 my favorite TV series then those 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.170
 which unite the most beautiful scenes 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.630
 I don't know about won kar dare rip curl dei 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.109
 cesaroni that I watch all these by 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.870
 well surely the music videos 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.819
 question number 9 a youtuber that follows 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.540
 and that you think mary would be more kikkio 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.540
 more views 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.820
 the first girl I feel 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.130
 definitely to name the 80 hypermarket 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.690
 Federica track of Trieste that anyway 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.700
 already many subscribers and many 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.010
 views but in my opinion 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.290
 really deserves even more beds 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.750
 busy in the cups mainly but does 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.590
 I also like video blogs 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.990
 a lot and another girl I like 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.380
 a lot and that I follow gem her glam 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:20.260
 according to me not very nice 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.210
 but always very laughing even if strong a 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.400
 level of tastes has different tastes 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.590
 from mine and so I really like having 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.780
 I look at this comparison because I am 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.840
 like to hear another point of 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.600
 sight and then yet another girl who 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.970
 I think it's very good and the nick name 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.700
 I know I wrote it because I don't even know 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:44.230
 if it produces it just hopefully anyway it is 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:46.090
 ica of kauai 01 flowers I leave here in the box 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.190
 because it goes well it will surely have it 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.450
 uttered badly and instead she speaks 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.060
 of iphone 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.190
 of always giving advice and you know 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.560
 that I am fixated with apple products 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.650
 so i really like his 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.900
 video 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.500
 question number 10 what is the project for 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.640
 next year that makes you happy 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.350
 then they are however 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.840
 I definitely would like to organize a 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.880
 meeting I hope I can do this 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.500
 because you asked me so many e 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.030
 video would be a great deal succeed 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.910
 meet at least part of you 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.470
 because you are always very very kind 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.600
 and very sweet and so he would do me 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:30.490
 really glad to have the opportunity 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.470
 to meet you question number 11 which is 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.919
 the weirdest moment you filmed 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.919
 a video 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.040
 well let's say they are approached 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.919
 many because anyway recording i 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.590
 video to pin up really in my opinion 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.010
 incurs any kind of 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.900
 strangeness 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.510
 obviously the people who look at you a lot 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.330
 united or not making pasta with the mafia 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.250
 that you're putting on make-up in front of one 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.950
 camera or video camera 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.450
 then he stops a little further and looks 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.300
 to look from the mirror and to 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.550
 understand what you are all doing though 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.410
 been a hilarious scene, a sin 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.600
 that I can't phil marvel and do well 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.240
 see why you would do 4 again 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.370
 in fact definitely distracting you out to 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:17.260
 moment in which one incurs more 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:18.910
 oddities that really would really do 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.290
 really living is another 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.270
 camera because the evil that me 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:26.980
 I resume and I can show you why 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:29.020
 sail reader s a lot question number 12 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.350
 how long to stand to prepare for 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.930
 a video usually used approx 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.730
 an hour because I don't have to 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.370
 prepare all the things I need 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.410
 I have to understand how I want to make it happen e 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.320
 then I have to wear makeup if I lost e 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.840
 choose something to put on for 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:51.370
 at least, therefore, it is also possible to have two 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:54.130
 hours then depends on the video question 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:57.630
 believe in this moment you are wearing underneath 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:07:00.430
 jeans skirt or pajamas or jumpsuit 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.500
 I almost always wear the balloons of the 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.240
 suit or pajamas because I want to do 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.760
 absolutely convenient but i own 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.850
 as soon as i enter my house you put me a 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.130
 pajamas or in overalls so I could not do 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.540
 video otherwise for prison is one 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.120
 great luck not having to prepare 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:20.710
 fruit therefore absolutely pajamas 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:25.330
 occupies question 14 what makes you 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:26.050
 proud in life for sure 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.050
 my family 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:33.060
 the fact of being 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:35.370
 still managed to create a house ea 

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.889
 work to be independent in short 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.720
 yes certainly independence and in any case 

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:43.379
 makes me proud to have 

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:46.169
 always new projects and something 

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:46.560
 beautiful in meal to be realized is well or 

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:49.349
 bad 

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.629
 I always try to find the means to 

00:07:49.349 --> 00:07:54.020
 make it even when it seems to be 

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:56.610
 something achievable 

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.050
 the questions are over 

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.789
 I really hope the video is there 

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:02.750
 liked it and we'll see each other next time 

00:07:59.789 --> 00:08:02.750
 hello video
