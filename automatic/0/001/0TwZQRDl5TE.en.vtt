I rest between the towns okay good
the<00:03:09.820> last<00:03:10.030> thing<00:03:10.240> I'll<00:03:10.330> show<00:03:10.360> you<00:03:10.570> is<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.930> little

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
the last thing I'll show you is a little

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.140 
the last thing I'll show you is a little
exercise<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:12.070> slurs<00:03:12.490> throughout<00:03:12.970> your

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
exercise that slurs throughout your

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.580 
exercise that slurs throughout your
range<00:03:13.390> and<00:03:13.570> for<00:03:13.990> now<00:03:14.110> we're<00:03:14.260> calling<00:03:14.560> that

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
range and for now we're calling that

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.620 
range and for now we're calling that
usable<00:03:15.100> range<00:03:15.250> those<00:03:15.640> five<00:03:16.060> notes<00:03:16.330> that<00:03:16.540> you

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
usable range those five notes that you

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.320 
usable range those five notes that you
know<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:17.050> see<00:03:17.260> through<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.590> G<00:03:17.800> so<00:03:18.730> start<00:03:19.240> with

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
know the see through the G so start with

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:30.610 
know the see through the G so start with
the<00:03:19.450> G<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.930> slow<00:03:20.530> down<00:03:20.770> to<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:21.070> F<00:03:21.220> like<00:03:21.760> this

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.020 

ah

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:42.210 

ah

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.220 

and<00:03:42.550> then<00:03:43.180> we're<00:03:43.480> going<00:03:43.600> to<00:03:43.660> make<00:03:43.810> that<00:03:43.930> slur

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
and then we're going to make that slur

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.080 
and then we're going to make that slur
one<00:03:44.650> step<00:03:44.920> bigger<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.430> we're<00:03:45.700> going<00:03:45.820> to<00:03:45.880> slur

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
one step bigger and we're going to slur

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:53.550 
one step bigger and we're going to slur
from<00:03:46.240> the<00:03:46.390> G<00:03:46.660> down<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.530> E

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.340 

you

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
you

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.900 
you
ah

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:08.230 

Oh

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.550 

the<00:04:09.240> next<00:04:09.540> step<00:04:09.720> of<00:04:09.840> course<00:04:09.870> is<00:04:10.170> going<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.440> make

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
the next step of course is going to make

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.960 
the next step of course is going to make
that<00:04:10.680> interval<00:04:11.010> even<00:04:11.280> bigger<00:04:11.490> you'll<00:04:11.730> slur

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
that interval even bigger you'll slur

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.810 
that interval even bigger you'll slur
from<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.270> G<00:04:12.510> down<00:04:13.110> to<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.410> D<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:13.950> then

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
from the G down to the D and then

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.670 
from the G down to the D and then
finally<00:04:15.240> you'll<00:04:15.480> wrap<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:15.810> up<00:04:15.930> with<00:04:16.320> a<00:04:16.380> slur

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
finally you'll wrap it up with a slur

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.190 
finally you'll wrap it up with a slur
from<00:04:16.830> the<00:04:17.010> G<00:04:17.280> down<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.850> C<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.269> again<00:04:18.870> both

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
from the G down to the C and again both

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.380 
from the G down to the C and again both
of<00:04:19.380> those<00:04:19.500> notes<00:04:19.769> use<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.190> same<00:04:20.430> fingering<00:04:20.820> so

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
of those notes use the same fingering so

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.610 
of those notes use the same fingering so
you're<00:04:21.540> going<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:21.720> make<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:21.930> slur<00:04:22.350> with

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
you're going to make that slur with

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.860 
you're going to make that slur with
control<00:04:23.400> of<00:04:23.520> your<00:04:23.640> embouchure<00:04:23.880> and<00:04:24.180> big

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
control of your embouchure and big

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:37.050 
control of your embouchure and big
breath<00:04:25.110> like<00:04:25.680> this

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.070 

ah

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.660 

now<00:04:44.080> again<00:04:44.350> I'm<00:04:44.500> going<00:04:44.620> to<00:04:44.680> emphasize<00:04:44.860> use<00:04:45.640> a

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
now again I'm going to emphasize use a

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.850 
now again I'm going to emphasize use a
mirror<00:04:46.060> on<00:04:46.180> this<00:04:46.330> exercise<00:04:46.810> and<00:04:47.110> watch<00:04:47.680> your

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
mirror on this exercise and watch your

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.990 
mirror on this exercise and watch your
embouchure<00:04:48.130> to<00:04:48.490> make<00:04:48.610> sure<00:04:48.760> that<00:04:48.850> you're

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
embouchure to make sure that you're

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.820 
embouchure to make sure that you're
keeping<00:04:49.120> any<00:04:49.480> motion<00:04:49.960> right<00:04:50.110> there<00:04:50.170> to<00:04:50.500> a<00:04:50.530> very

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
keeping any motion right there to a very

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.520 
keeping any motion right there to a very
minimum<00:04:51.420> your<00:04:52.420> warm-up<00:04:52.750> is<00:04:52.900> going<00:04:53.080> to<00:04:53.140> span

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
minimum your warm-up is going to span

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.230 
minimum your warm-up is going to span
