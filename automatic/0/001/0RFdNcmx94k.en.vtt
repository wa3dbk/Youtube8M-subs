which they respond to were you crazy

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.209 
which they respond to were you crazy
because<00:00:33.059> archtop<00:00:33.570> guitars<00:00:34.020> are<00:00:34.290> really

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
because archtop guitars are really

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.610 
because archtop guitars are really
really<00:00:36.000> incredibly<00:00:36.930> expensive<00:00:37.290> and

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
difficult to make because you have to

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.530 
difficult to make because you have to
carve<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.649> top<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.160> back<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.579> guitars<00:00:41.940> so

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
carve the top and back of the guitars so

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.170 
carve the top and back of the guitars so

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
balance and power but there's a couple

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.190

of<00:01:13.470> other<00:01:13.650> reasons<00:01:13.890> first<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.700> also<00:01:15.540> sports<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
of other reasons first it also sports a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.060 
of other reasons first it also sports a
three-piece<00:01:16.860> back<00:01:17.240> like<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.540> D<00:01:19.020> 35<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:19.920> in

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
three-piece back like the D 35 but in

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.340 
three-piece back like the D 35 but in
this<00:01:20.220> configuration<00:01:21.119> gives<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.020> lot<00:01:22.170> of

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
this configuration gives it a lot of

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.890 
this configuration gives it a lot of
bass<00:01:22.560> response<00:01:22.939> but<00:01:23.939> one<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.420> things<00:01:24.689> that

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
bass response but one of the things that

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.940 
bass response but one of the things that

a very influential guitar for me

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.300 
a very influential guitar for me
personally<00:01:31.409> because<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.040> was<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> first

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
personally because it was the first
