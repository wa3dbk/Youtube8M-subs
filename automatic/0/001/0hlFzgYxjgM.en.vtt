minecart system so basically what this
is<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.289> you<00:00:16.289> have<00:00:16.529> blocks<00:00:17.010> place<00:00:17.430> under<00:00:17.789> mine

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
is is you have blocks place under mine

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.390 
is is you have blocks place under mine
cart<00:00:18.390> true<00:00:19.109> mine<00:00:19.710> mine<00:00:20.640> cart<00:00:21.350> mine<00:00:22.350> just<00:00:22.650> call

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
cart true mine mine cart mine just call

cart true mine mine cart mine just call
them<00:00:23.490> rails<00:00:23.760> I've<00:00:24.660> locks<00:00:24.900> place<00:00:25.260> under<00:00:25.529> rails

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
them rails I've locks place under rails

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.060 
them rails I've locks place under rails
like<00:00:26.640> I'm<00:00:26.880> gold<00:00:27.269> or<00:00:27.510> gold<00:00:27.960> blocks<00:00:28.380> there<00:00:28.920> is

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
like I'm gold or gold blocks there is

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.550 
like I'm gold or gold blocks there is
things<00:00:29.310> which<00:00:29.670> will<00:00:29.820> be<00:00:29.910> going<00:00:30.150> over<00:00:30.560> so

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
things which will be going over so

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.310 
things which will be going over so
basically<00:00:32.009> what<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.369> does<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.570> like

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
shooting the goal or losing my voice

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.600 
shooting the goal or losing my voice
gold<00:00:39.059> or<00:00:39.300> as<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.530> can<00:00:40.649> see<00:00:40.800> it's<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.010> two

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
gold or as you can see it's that two

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.600 
gold or as you can see it's that two
times<00:00:41.780> booster<00:00:42.780> block<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:44.010> when<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> mine<00:00:44.370> car

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
times booster block so when the mine car

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.580 
times booster block so when the mine car
goes<00:00:44.789> over<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.450> will<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:45.750> boosted<00:00:46.260> double

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
goes over it it will be boosted double

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.420 
goes over it it will be boosted double
it<00:00:46.680> speed<00:00:47.039> up<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> neck<00:00:48.210> speed<00:00:50.660> we<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:52.430> mean

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
it speed up to the neck speed we I mean

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.540 
it speed up to the neck speed we I mean
that's<00:00:53.850> basically<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:55.890> now<00:00:56.039> here<00:00:56.460> we

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
that's basically that so now here we

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.660 
that's basically that so now here we
have<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:57.180> gold<00:00:57.480> block<00:00:58.160> with<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.190> gold<00:00:59.489> block

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
have the gold block with the gold block

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.529 
have the gold block with the gold block
guys<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.359> an<00:01:00.570> eight<00:01:00.840> times<00:01:01.199> booster<00:01:01.890> block

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
guys is it an eight times booster block

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.640 
guys is it an eight times booster block
so<00:01:03.539> it'll<00:01:04.229> just<00:01:04.439> make<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.519> Minecraft<00:01:05.939> flat

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
so it'll just make your Minecraft flat

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:15.630 
so it'll just make your Minecraft flat
so<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:08.060> worked<00:01:09.060> well<00:01:12.260> shut<00:01:13.260> us<00:01:13.380> again

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.450 

yeah<00:01:16.630> well<00:01:17.350> of<00:01:17.470> course<00:01:17.680> there's<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:17.950> minecart

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
yeah well of course there's a minecart

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.890 
yeah well of course there's a minecart
machspeed<00:01:19.150> that<00:01:20.050> you<00:01:20.140> can't<00:01:20.380> go<00:01:21.159> over<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:22.540> well

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
machspeed that you can't go over so well

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.899 
machspeed that you can't go over so well
you<00:01:23.530> can't<00:01:23.590> actually<00:01:23.979> modify<00:01:24.550> it<00:01:24.610> with<00:01:24.729> that

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
you can't actually modify it with that

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.260 
you can't actually modify it with that
most<00:01:25.560> configuration<00:01:26.560> file<00:01:26.800> but<00:01:27.790> now<00:01:27.940> we<00:01:28.000> have

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
most configuration file but now we have

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.930 
most configuration file but now we have
here<00:01:28.720> is<00:01:28.810> we<00:01:28.840> have<00:01:29.170> these<00:01:29.940> twenty-five

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
here is we have these twenty-five

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.740 
here is we have these twenty-five
percent<00:01:31.950> slowing<00:01:32.950> down<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:34.180> brake<00:01:34.450> blocks

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
percent slowing down the brake blocks

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.280 
percent slowing down the brake blocks
and<00:01:35.310> there's<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.490> end<00:01:36.640> bill<00:01:37.509> just<00:01:37.630> each<00:01:37.930> block

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
and there's the end bill just each block

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.630 
and there's the end bill just each block
will<00:01:38.530> slow<00:01:38.740> your<00:01:38.830> car<00:01:39.040> by<00:01:39.190> twenty-five

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
will slow your car by twenty-five

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.249 
will slow your car by twenty-five
percent<00:01:40.619> not<00:01:41.619> very<00:01:41.860> noticeable<00:01:42.690> in<00:01:43.690> that<00:01:43.869> sort

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
percent not very noticeable in that sort

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.200 
percent not very noticeable in that sort
of<00:01:44.290> situation<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:47.320> then<00:01:47.830> these<00:01:48.310> soul<00:01:48.610> sands

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
of situation but then these soul sands

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.450 
of situation but then these soul sands
bit<00:01:50.050> more<00:01:50.229> noticeable<00:01:50.680> on<00:01:50.890> their<00:01:51.850> up<00:01:52.380> weird

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
bit more noticeable on their up weird

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.520 
bit more noticeable on their up weird
let's<00:01:54.460> see<00:01:54.580> you<00:01:54.640> then<00:01:55.090> yarn<00:01:55.330> years<00:01:56.850> oops<00:01:58.530> these

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
let's see you then yarn years oops these

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.240 
let's see you then yarn years oops these
all<00:01:59.770> seen<00:02:00.039> blocks<00:02:00.369> are<00:02:01.270> a<00:02:01.690> 50<00:02:02.410> times<00:02:02.679> break

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
all seen blocks are a 50 times break

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.370 
all seen blocks are a 50 times break
block<00:02:03.580> so<00:02:04.420> they'll<00:02:04.600> slow<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:04.869> down<00:02:05.050> quite<00:02:05.350> a

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
block so they'll slow you down quite a

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.859 
block so they'll slow you down quite a
bit<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.640> now<00:02:06.910> we<00:02:06.970> have<00:02:07.060> what<00:02:07.390> we<00:02:07.420> have<00:02:07.630> here<00:02:07.840> is

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
bit so now we have what we have here is

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.030 
bit so now we have what we have here is
we<00:02:07.990> have<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.350> iron<00:02:08.590> blocks<00:02:10.320> it's<00:02:11.320> a<00:02:11.410> constant

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
we have the iron blocks it's a constant

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.710 
we have the iron blocks it's a constant
speed<00:02:12.160> block<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:12.790> if<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:13.000> have<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.120> whole

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
speed block so if you have a whole

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.940 
speed block so if you have a whole
entire<00:02:14.110> rail<00:02:14.800> of<00:02:15.220> fire<00:02:15.700> blocks<00:02:16.060> under<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:16.950> you

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
entire rail of fire blocks under it you

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.100 
entire rail of fire blocks under it you
can't<00:02:18.190> will<00:02:18.340> keep<00:02:19.060> out<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.269> constant<00:02:19.840> speed

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
can't will keep out the constant speed

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.600 
can't will keep out the constant speed
it<00:02:20.440> won't<00:02:20.620> go<00:02:21.400> down<00:02:21.430> any<00:02:22.170> like<00:02:23.170> notice<00:02:24.100> smooth

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
it won't go down any like notice smooth

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.720 
it won't go down any like notice smooth
sail<00:02:24.970> all<00:02:25.180> right<00:02:25.360> through<00:02:25.630> there<00:02:26.549> so<00:02:27.549> that's

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
sail all right through there so that's

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.000 
sail all right through there so that's
pretty<00:02:28.030> much<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.299> for<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.810> false<00:02:29.019> book<00:02:29.350> well

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
pretty much it for the false book well

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.910 
pretty much it for the false book well
um<00:02:30.250> minecart<00:02:31.120> blunt<00:02:31.420> because<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.750> few<00:02:31.959> more<00:02:32.140> the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
more complex um they're not really

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.690 
more complex um they're not really
working<00:02:35.019> right<00:02:35.290> now<00:02:35.320> I<00:02:35.440> don't<00:02:35.530> think<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:36.640> I'm

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
working right now I don't think so I'm

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.610 
working right now I don't think so I'm
not<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.239> in<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.480> future<00:02:37.660> but<00:02:38.560> for

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
not you of that in the future but for

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.259 
not you of that in the future but for
now<00:02:38.799> those<00:02:39.160> are<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.340> main<00:02:39.579> things<00:02:39.610> we<00:02:40.180> have

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
now those are the main things we have

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.370 
now those are the main things we have
the<00:02:42.329> constants<00:02:43.329> beauty<00:02:43.690> of<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.870> slow<00:02:44.140> down

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
the constants beauty of the slow down

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.280 
the constants beauty of the slow down
the<00:02:44.560> brake<00:02:44.769> blocks<00:02:45.070> you<00:02:45.940> have<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.420> speed

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
the brake blocks you have the speed

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.100 
the brake blocks you have the speed
boosting<00:02:47.650> blocks<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.280> that's<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.850> basics<00:02:49.780> as

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
boosting blocks and that's the basics as

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.590 
boosting blocks and that's the basics as
I've<00:02:50.410> said<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:51.040> now<00:02:51.970> we're<00:02:52.180> going<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.450> go<00:02:52.570> out

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
I've said and now we're going to go out

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.819 
I've said and now we're going to go out
here<00:02:53.760> when<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:54.820> want<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.030> come<00:02:55.209> on<00:02:55.299> my<00:02:55.450> server

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
here when you want to come on my server

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.750 
here when you want to come on my server
what<00:02:56.829> you<00:02:56.920> do<00:02:57.100> is<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:57.489> go<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.670> our<00:02:58.000> spawn<00:02:58.450> area

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
what you do is you go to our spawn area

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.160 
what you do is you go to our spawn area
/<00:03:00.760> spawn<00:03:01.150> is<00:03:01.329> an<00:03:01.450> easier<00:03:01.720> way<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.810> get<00:03:01.959> there

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
/ spawn is an easier way to get there

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.660 
/ spawn is an easier way to get there
but<00:03:02.320> if<00:03:02.590> you<00:03:02.709> come<00:03:02.860> on<00:03:03.040> for<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.250> first<00:03:03.340> time

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
but if you come on for the first time

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.030
