about<00:05:29.290> how<00:05:30.190> the<00:05:30.250> enemy<00:05:30.790> is<00:05:31.090> a<00:05:31.350> stick<00:05:32.350> and<00:05:32.500> try

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
about how the enemy is a stick and try

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.840 
about how the enemy is a stick and try
to<00:05:32.770> try<00:05:33.640> to<00:05:33.700> I<00:05:34.860> don't<00:05:35.860> know<00:05:36.010> the<00:05:36.280> replica

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
to try to I don't know the replica

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.520 
to try to I don't know the replica
almost<00:05:37.240> a<00:05:37.360> replication<00:05:37.990> worried<00:05:38.290> that<00:05:38.410> I'm

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
almost a replication worried that I'm

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.740 
almost a replication worried that I'm
thinking<00:05:38.830> of<00:05:39.010> but<00:05:39.250> just<00:05:39.850> try<00:05:40.000> to<00:05:40.030> kind<00:05:40.450> of<00:05:40.570> look

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
thinking of but just try to kind of look

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.060 
thinking of but just try to kind of look
at<00:05:40.900> it<00:05:41.020> from<00:05:41.110> their<00:05:41.289> perspective<00:05:41.440> and<00:05:41.979> then

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
at it from their perspective and then

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.409 
at it from their perspective and then
you<00:05:42.130> see<00:05:42.280> I<00:05:42.310> pick<00:05:42.580> up<00:05:42.729> right<00:05:43.000> here<00:05:43.180> and<00:05:43.240> then

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
you see I pick up right here and then

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.690 
you see I pick up right here and then
I'm<00:05:43.510> like<00:05:43.539> oh<00:05:43.840> shit<00:05:44.260> Carter's<00:05:44.770> mufuckin<00:05:45.370> right

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
I'm like oh shit Carter's mufuckin right

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.670 
I'm like oh shit Carter's mufuckin right
now<00:05:45.940> I<00:05:45.970> know<00:05:46.630> what<00:05:46.840> it's<00:05:46.990> about<00:05:47.050> to<00:05:47.320> do<00:05:47.470> but

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
now I know what it's about to do but

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.130 
now I know what it's about to do but
call<00:05:47.890> it<00:05:48.130> so<00:05:48.970> then<00:05:49.120> I<00:05:49.270> guess<00:05:49.479> it<00:05:49.840> kills

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
call it so then I guess it kills

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.310 
call it so then I guess it kills
everybody<00:05:50.500> on<00:05:50.919> the<00:05:51.010> mat<00:05:51.330> on<00:05:52.330> their<00:05:52.600> team<00:05:52.840> it

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
everybody on the mat on their team it

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.540 
everybody on the mat on their team it
doesn't<00:05:53.830> kill<00:05:54.180> me<00:05:55.470> or<00:05:56.470> my<00:05:56.680> teammates<00:05:57.190> I<00:05:57.340> think

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
doesn't kill me or my teammates I think

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.909 
doesn't kill me or my teammates I think
the<00:05:57.669> new<00:05:57.850> kill<00:05:58.510> everybody<00:05:58.870> in<00:05:59.140> the<00:05:59.320> match<00:05:59.530> on<00:05:59.860> a

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
the new kill everybody in the match on a

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.520 
the new kill everybody in the match on a
modern<00:06:00.400> warfare<00:06:00.550> 2<00:06:00.850> but<00:06:01.140> kills<00:06:02.140> all<00:06:02.320> them

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
people who so far seem like a I don't

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.940 
people who so far seem like a I don't
know<00:06:17.020> to<00:06:17.770> moab<00:06:18.400> game<00:06:18.700> place<00:06:19.020> so<00:06:20.020> I<00:06:20.380> think<00:06:20.620> this

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950 
know to moab game place so I think this

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.100 
know to moab game place so I think this
one<00:06:21.160> is<00:06:21.190> uh<00:06:21.340> this<00:06:21.760> is<00:06:21.970> a<00:06:22.000> to<00:06:22.600> me<00:06:22.750> this<00:06:22.900> is<00:06:22.960> a

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
one is uh this is a to me this is a

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.960 
one is uh this is a to me this is a
pretty<00:06:23.350> impressive<00:06:23.919> one<00:06:24.340> not<00:06:24.520> because<00:06:24.789> of<00:06:24.820> the

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970 
pretty impressive one not because of the

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.340 
pretty impressive one not because of the
fact<00:06:25.150> that<00:06:25.270> I'm<00:06:25.479> the<00:06:25.539> one<00:06:25.720> that<00:06:25.870> got<00:06:26.020> it<00:06:26.200> but

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
fact that I'm the one that got it but

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.409 
fact that I'm the one that got it but
because<00:06:26.440> you<00:06:27.160> know<00:06:27.310> planet-killer<00:06:27.850> fern<00:06:28.180> it's

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
because you know planet-killer fern it's

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:30.330 
because you know planet-killer fern it's
kind<00:06:28.600> of<00:06:28.690> hard<00:06:28.930> to<00:06:28.990> get<00:06:29.229> and<00:06:29.470> then<00:06:30.130> especially

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
kind of hard to get and then especially
