00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
this game yeah but I did think Alabama

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.360 
this game yeah but I did think Alabama
came<00:00:37.559> out<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.829> played<00:00:37.890> with<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.160> lot<00:00:38.219> of

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
came out and played with a lot of

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.010 
came out and played with a lot of
confidence<00:00:38.760> from<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.120> very<00:00:39.300> start<00:00:39.390> gearing<00:00:39.960> I

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
confidence from the very start gearing I

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.569 
confidence from the very start gearing I
understand<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> competition<00:00:41.129> isn't<00:00:41.309> quite

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
understand the competition isn't quite

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.190 
understand the competition isn't quite
maybe<00:00:41.820> what<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.149> was<00:00:42.300> last<00:00:42.540> week<00:00:42.840> but<00:00:43.020> at<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
maybe what it was last week but at the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.049 
maybe what it was last week but at the
same<00:00:43.410> time<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.680> think<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.340> know<00:00:44.430> Alabama<00:00:44.820> did

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
same time I think you know Alabama did

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.160 
same time I think you know Alabama did
what<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.360> had<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.780> thought<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
what it had to do I thought the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.690 
what it had to do I thought the
offensive<00:00:46.469> line<00:00:46.620> came<00:00:47.010> out<00:00:47.129> performed<00:00:47.550> really

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
offensive line came out performed really

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.400 
offensive line came out performed really
well<00:00:47.789> Blake<00:00:48.239> Sims<00:00:48.510> made<00:00:48.989> some<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.289> good

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
well Blake Sims made some really good

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.200 
well Blake Sims made some really good
throws<00:00:49.800> early<00:00:50.129> now<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> lot<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.489> his<00:00:50.700> those<00:00:50.969> were

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
throws early now a lot of his those were

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.790 
throws early now a lot of his those were
quick<00:00:51.420> screens<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> sidelines<00:00:52.530> stuff

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
quick screens to the sidelines stuff

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.560 
quick screens to the sidelines stuff
like<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.010> but<00:00:53.430> at<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.879> same<00:00:54.090> time<00:00:54.300> they<00:00:54.480> were

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
like that but at the same time they were

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.360

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
nice runs that touched down when they

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.760

to<00:01:24.540> start<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.900> game<00:01:24.990> off<00:01:25.290> yeah<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.830> think<00:01:26.100> he

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
to start this game off yeah I think he

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.859 
to start this game off yeah I think he
completed<00:01:26.549> eight<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.790> his<00:01:26.880> first<00:01:27.119> nine<00:01:27.330> passes

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
completed eight of his first nine passes

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.749 
completed eight of his first nine passes
I<00:01:27.960> think<00:01:28.110> he<00:01:28.170> finished<00:01:28.320> 11<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.890> 13<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.340> he<00:01:29.610> had

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
I think he finished 11 of 13 so he had

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.270 
I think he finished 11 of 13 so he had
some<00:01:29.909> really<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.600> know<00:01:30.720> good<00:01:30.990> stats<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.710> you

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
some really you know good stats and you

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.590 
some really you know good stats and you
know<00:01:32.369> Gary<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.700> thing<00:01:32.850> about<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.210> was<00:01:33.240> he

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
know Gary the thing about it was he

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.420 
know Gary the thing about it was he
seemed<00:01:33.810> very<00:01:33.869> decisive<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.829> mean<00:01:35.009> there<00:01:35.159> was<00:01:35.280> no

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
seemed very decisive I mean there was no

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.460 
seemed very decisive I mean there was no
indecision<00:01:35.909> there<00:01:36.299> he<00:01:36.509> he<00:01:36.930> certainly<00:01:37.229> moved

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
indecision there he he certainly moved

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.899 
indecision there he he certainly moved
the<00:01:37.590> offense<00:01:37.950> well<00:01:38.159> he<00:01:38.280> managed<00:01:38.640> him<00:01:38.729> well

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the offense well he managed him well

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.760 
the offense well he managed him well
he's<00:01:39.060> one<00:01:39.240> bad<00:01:39.390> play<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.840> course<00:01:40.079> was<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
he's one bad play of course was in the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.260 
he's one bad play of course was in the
third<00:01:40.920> quarter<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.490> opening<00:01:41.790> drive<00:01:41.939> when

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
third quarter on the opening drive when

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.630 
third quarter on the opening drive when
you<00:01:42.689> know<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.930> mishandled<00:01:43.409> handoff<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.979> TJ

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
you know the mishandled handoff to TJ

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.920 
you know the mishandled handoff to TJ
Yeldon<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:45.149> other<00:01:45.270> than<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.659> thought

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
Yeldon but other than that I thought

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.539 
Yeldon but other than that I thought
Blake<00:01:46.140> Sims<00:01:46.530> played<00:01:46.829> phenomenally<00:01:47.520> well

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
Blake Sims played phenomenally well

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.749 
Blake Sims played phenomenally well
given<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.720> know<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:49.020> such<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> young<00:01:49.920> young

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
given you know it's such a young young

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.670 
given you know it's such a young young
in<00:01:50.909> terms<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.270> his<00:01:51.450> starting<00:01:51.840> experience<00:01:52.110> but

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
in terms of his starting experience but

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.280 
in terms of his starting experience but
you<00:01:53.130> know<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.280> think<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.960> know<00:01:55.049> again

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
you know I think that you know again

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.200 
you know I think that you know again
both<00:01:55.530> two<00:01:55.950> games<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.460> row<00:01:56.490> he's<00:01:56.790> played<00:01:57.030> well

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
both two games in a row he's played well

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.440 
both two games in a row he's played well
and<00:01:57.479> Jake<00:01:58.049> had<00:01:58.890> his<00:01:59.070> moments<00:01:59.579> some<00:02:00.149> growing

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
and Jake had his moments some growing

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.179 
and Jake had his moments some growing
pains<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:00.869> well<00:02:01.079> but<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.409> can<00:02:01.590> see<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.979> talent

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
pains as well but you can see the talent

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.999 
pains as well but you can see the talent
really<00:02:02.909> really<00:02:03.360> nice<00:02:03.630> arm<00:02:03.930> yeah<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.979> know

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
really really nice arm yeah and you know

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.350 
really really nice arm yeah and you know
Gary<00:02:05.310> there<00:02:05.460> was<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.579> couple<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.939> times<00:02:06.119> that

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
Gary there was a couple of times that

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.819 
Gary there was a couple of times that
when<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.600> really<00:02:06.899> watched<00:02:07.170> him<00:02:07.439> after<00:02:07.740> he

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
when you really watched him after he

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:08.120 
when you really watched him after he
made<00:02:08.009> a

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
made a

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.010 
made a
bad<00:02:08.250> throw<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:09.210> know<00:02:09.270> how<00:02:09.540> is<00:02:09.600> he<00:02:09.810> going<00:02:09.960> to

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
bad throw you know how is he going to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.050 
bad throw you know how is he going to
respond<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.770> he<00:02:11.130> responded<00:02:11.490> a<00:02:11.700> couple<00:02:11.970> of

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
respond and he responded a couple of

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.210 
respond and he responded a couple of
times<00:02:12.270> with<00:02:12.450> nice<00:02:12.660> throws<00:02:13.020> after<00:02:13.320> those<00:02:13.650> bad

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
times with nice throws after those bad

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.190 
times with nice throws after those bad
plays<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:15.060> was<00:02:15.210> really<00:02:15.240> something<00:02:16.080> that

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
plays so that was really something that

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.480 
plays so that was really something that
you<00:02:16.320> looked<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.800> quarterback<00:02:17.220> because

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
you looked for and quarterback because

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.980 
you looked for and quarterback because
he<00:02:17.580> certainly<00:02:17.880> can't<00:02:18.180> carry<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.780> next

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
he certainly can't carry it to the next

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.020 
he certainly can't carry it to the next
play<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.590> again<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:19.980> think<00:02:20.430> what<00:02:20.580> people<00:02:20.730> need

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
play and again I think what people need

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.820 
play and again I think what people need
to<00:02:21.060> realize<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.450> he's<00:02:22.140> still<00:02:22.350> trying<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.740> get

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
to realize is he's still trying to get

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.410 
to realize is he's still trying to get
acclimated<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.850> know<00:02:23.940> he<00:02:24.120> showed<00:02:24.390> some

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
acclimated you know he showed some

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.440 
acclimated you know he showed some
progress<00:02:25.080> as<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.800> game<00:02:26.010> went<00:02:26.220> on<00:02:26.370> today<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.120> I

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
progress as the game went on today and I

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.820 
progress as the game went on today and I
think<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:27.930> this<00:02:28.110> experience<00:02:28.680> will

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
think that this experience will

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.200 
think that this experience will
certainly<00:02:29.190> help<00:02:29.370> him<00:02:29.580> down<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.910> road<00:02:30.060> and

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
certainly help him down the road and

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.310 
certainly help him down the road and
it's<00:02:30.360> always<00:02:30.570> good<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:30.930> have<00:02:31.110> two

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
it's always good to have two

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.740 
it's always good to have two
quarterbacks<00:02:31.590> ready<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.310> play<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.850> what<00:02:33.600> can

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
quarterbacks ready to play and what can

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.480 
quarterbacks ready to play and what can
we<00:02:33.780> say<00:02:34.050> about<00:02:34.080> Cooper<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.830> guy<00:02:34.950> makes<00:02:35.220> plays

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
we say about Cooper the guy makes plays

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.710 
we say about Cooper the guy makes plays
and<00:02:35.730> afterwards<00:02:36.150> he<00:02:36.270> was<00:02:36.390> still<00:02:36.570> disappointed

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
and afterwards he was still disappointed

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.080 
and afterwards he was still disappointed
said<00:02:37.710> that<00:02:37.830> he<00:02:37.920> didn't<00:02:38.160> get<00:02:38.250> all<00:02:38.490> that<00:02:38.940> he

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
said that he didn't get all that he

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.310 
said that he didn't get all that he
could<00:02:39.210> have<00:02:39.330> gotten<00:02:39.510> out<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:39.690> those<00:02:39.840> reception

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
could have gotten out of those reception

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.200 
could have gotten out of those reception
yeah<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.070> you<00:02:41.430> could<00:02:41.610> see<00:02:41.790> him<00:02:41.910> out<00:02:42.150> there

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
yeah and you could see him out there

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.790 
yeah and you could see him out there
trying<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.750> get<00:02:42.930> more<00:02:43.110> out<00:02:43.320> of<00:02:43.350> each<00:02:43.560> one<00:02:43.740> of

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
trying to get more out of each one of

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.800 
trying to get more out of each one of
those<00:02:43.980> Gary<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.520> I<00:02:44.580> think<00:02:44.790> certainly<00:02:45.060> no<00:02:45.270> 25

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
those Gary and I think certainly no 25

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.320 
those Gary and I think certainly no 25
receptions<00:02:46.200> in<00:02:46.620> in<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.460> first<00:02:47.610> two<00:02:47.790> games<00:02:47.820> I

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
receptions in in the first two games I

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.360 
receptions in in the first two games I
mean<00:02:48.510> that's<00:02:48.630> that's<00:02:48.870> quite<00:02:49.350> phenomenal<00:02:49.560> but

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
mean that's that's quite phenomenal but

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.440 
mean that's that's quite phenomenal but
you<00:02:50.460> know<00:02:50.580> there<00:02:50.700> was<00:02:50.790> some<00:02:50.910> other<00:02:51.030> guys<00:02:51.240> it

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
you know there was some other guys it

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.090 
you know there was some other guys it
may<00:02:51.570> showed<00:02:52.110> some<00:02:52.320> things<00:02:52.500> as<00:02:52.650> why<00:02:52.800> we<00:02:52.950> say<00:02:53.070> I

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
may showed some things as why we say I

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.590 
may showed some things as why we say I
thought<00:02:53.310> our<00:02:53.430> Darrius<00:02:53.790> Stewart<00:02:53.880> showed<00:02:54.270> a<00:02:54.300> lot

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
thought our Darrius Stewart showed a lot

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.270 
thought our Darrius Stewart showed a lot
of<00:02:54.630> potential<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.560> know<00:02:55.650> Christian<00:02:56.070> Jones

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
of potential you know Christian Jones

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.070 
of potential you know Christian Jones
went<00:02:56.610> out<00:02:56.730> he's<00:02:57.000> ok<00:02:57.420> just<00:02:57.450> got<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.930> little

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
went out he's ok just got a little

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.840 
went out he's ok just got a little
bruise<00:02:58.350> on<00:02:58.530> his<00:02:58.680> ankle<00:02:58.860> but<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.700> know<00:02:59.820> I

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
bruise on his ankle but you know I

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.160 
bruise on his ankle but you know I
thought<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.270> our<00:03:00.390> Darrius<00:03:00.720> Stewart<00:03:00.810> played

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
thought that our Darrius Stewart played

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.540 
thought that our Darrius Stewart played
really<00:03:01.350> well<00:03:01.470> Cameron<00:03:01.980> Sims<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.370> true

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
really well Cameron Sims the true

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.040 
really well Cameron Sims the true
freshman<00:03:02.970> played<00:03:03.210> a<00:03:03.240> lot<00:03:03.480> he<00:03:03.630> didn't<00:03:03.900> have<00:03:04.020> a

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
freshman played a lot he didn't have a

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.920 
freshman played a lot he didn't have a
throw<00:03:04.620> pass<00:03:05.550> thrown<00:03:05.850> his<00:03:06.030> way<00:03:06.210> but<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.840> know

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
throw pass thrown his way but you know

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.300 
throw pass thrown his way but you know
he's<00:03:07.140> starting<00:03:07.500> starting<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:07.950> see<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.100> lot<00:03:08.250> of

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
he's starting starting to see a lot of

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.150 
he's starting starting to see a lot of
time<00:03:08.640> so<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.900> know<00:03:09.990> again<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.260> think<00:03:10.410> with<00:03:11.070> the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
time so you know again I think with the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.410 
time so you know again I think with the
wide<00:03:11.310> receiver<00:03:11.760> corps<00:03:11.970> there's<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.240> lot<00:03:12.390> of

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
wide receiver corps there's a lot of

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.960 
wide receiver corps there's a lot of
depth<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:13.070> defensively<00:03:14.070> you<00:03:14.550> don't<00:03:14.730> ever

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
depth and defensively you don't ever

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.700 
depth and defensively you don't ever
have<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.420> apologize<00:03:15.480> for<00:03:16.170> getting<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.470> shutout

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
have to apologize for getting a shutout

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.050 
have to apologize for getting a shutout
in<00:03:16.830> college<00:03:17.160> football<00:03:17.310> in<00:03:17.550> this<00:03:17.700> day<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:17.880> age

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
in college football in this day and age

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.330 
in college football in this day and age
they're<00:03:18.360> hard<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.780> come<00:03:19.020> by<00:03:19.200> granted<00:03:19.980> the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
they're hard to come by granted the

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.310 
they're hard to come by granted the
opposition<00:03:20.940> not<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.270> strongest<00:03:21.480> but<00:03:21.960> that<00:03:22.170> is

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
opposition not the strongest but that is

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.690 
opposition not the strongest but that is
certainly<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.710> positive<00:03:23.220> for<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.370> defense

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
certainly a positive for the defense

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.910 
certainly a positive for the defense
plus<00:03:24.210> they<00:03:24.420> got<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:24.690> play<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.870> lot<00:03:25.110> of<00:03:25.260> guys<00:03:25.410> yeah

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
plus they got to play a lot of guys yeah

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.350 
plus they got to play a lot of guys yeah
and<00:03:26.010> i<00:03:26.100> think<00:03:26.130> they<00:03:26.460> obviously<00:03:26.670> played<00:03:27.180> better

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
and i think they obviously played better

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.150 
and i think they obviously played better
i<00:03:27.480> think<00:03:27.570> Eddie<00:03:27.870> Jackson<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.590> return<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:28.920> 80

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
i think Eddie Jackson the return of 80

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.860 
i think Eddie Jackson the return of 80
Jack<00:03:29.430> certainly<00:03:29.880> was<00:03:30.060> huge<00:03:30.330> at<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.540> corner

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
Jack certainly was huge at the corner

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.510 
Jack certainly was huge at the corner
position<00:03:31.050> I<00:03:31.440> mean<00:03:31.710> he<00:03:31.800> made<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.010> really<00:03:32.310> good

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
position I mean he made a really good

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.520 
position I mean he made a really good
play<00:03:32.790> early<00:03:33.150> when<00:03:33.330> he<00:03:33.390> had<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:33.690> strong<00:03:34.050> tackle

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
play early when he had a strong tackle

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.110 
play early when he had a strong tackle
on<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.650> short<00:03:34.950> throw<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.550> you<00:03:35.910> know<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.030> think

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
on a short throw and you know I think

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.699 
on a short throw and you know I think
that<00:03:36.420> made<00:03:36.630> everybody<00:03:36.900> feel<00:03:37.170> somewhat

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
that made everybody feel somewhat

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.740 
that made everybody feel somewhat
relieved<00:03:38.100> with<00:03:38.640> him<00:03:38.850> being<00:03:39.000> back<00:03:39.270> so<00:03:39.480> quickly

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
relieved with him being back so quickly

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.750 
relieved with him being back so quickly
after<00:03:40.050> that<00:03:40.170> knee<00:03:40.470> surgery<00:03:40.950> but<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.610> know<00:03:41.670> I

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
after that knee surgery but you know I

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.430 
after that knee surgery but you know I
thought<00:03:42.060> that<00:03:42.300> he<00:03:42.720> brought<00:03:42.900> a<00:03:42.959> lot<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.200> the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
thought that he brought a lot to the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.990 
thought that he brought a lot to the
defense<00:03:43.740> I<00:03:43.860> thought<00:03:44.040> Cyrus<00:03:44.400> Jones<00:03:44.640> also

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
defense I thought Cyrus Jones also

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.550 
defense I thought Cyrus Jones also
played<00:03:45.390> pretty<00:03:45.630> well<00:03:45.720> at<00:03:45.990> the<00:03:46.140> other<00:03:46.260> corner

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
played pretty well at the other corner

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.560 
played pretty well at the other corner
and<00:03:46.860> seemed<00:03:47.820> like<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.090> defensive<00:03:48.540> line

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
and seemed like the defensive line

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.150 
and seemed like the defensive line
played<00:03:48.959> with<00:03:49.140> a<00:03:49.170> little<00:03:49.440> bit<00:03:49.560> more<00:03:49.740> intensity

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
played with a little bit more intensity

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.620 
played with a little bit more intensity
with<00:03:50.459> Trey<00:03:50.670> DePriest<00:03:50.730> being<00:03:51.300> back<00:03:51.480> at

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
with Trey DePriest being back at

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.660 
with Trey DePriest being back at
linebacker<00:03:51.870> there<00:03:52.740> didn't<00:03:53.130> seem<00:03:53.310> to<00:03:53.340> be<00:03:53.490> as

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
linebacker there didn't seem to be as

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.100 
linebacker there didn't seem to be as
much

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
much

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.510 
much
fusion<00:03:54.560> there<00:03:54.740> with<00:03:54.920> him<00:03:55.040> calling<00:03:55.430> the

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
fusion there with him calling the

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.310 
fusion there with him calling the
defense's<00:03:56.030> thought<00:03:56.480> that<00:03:56.690> was<00:03:56.810> good<00:03:56.960> and<00:03:57.050> as<00:03:57.290> a

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
defense's thought that was good and as a

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.840 
defense's thought that was good and as a
game<00:03:57.590> went<00:03:57.830> on<00:03:57.920> it<00:03:58.100> was<00:03:58.130> really<00:03:58.430> good<00:03:58.550> to<00:03:58.610> look

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850
