okay<00:00:03.590> well<00:00:03.800> we're<00:00:03.920> going<00:00:04.010> to<00:00:04.100> be<00:00:04.220> introducing

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:04.880 
okay well we're going to be introducing

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.150 
okay well we're going to be introducing
today<00:00:05.270> is<00:00:05.569> muscle<00:00:06.020> energy<00:00:06.350> techniques<00:00:06.769> and

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
today is muscle energy techniques and

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.920 
today is muscle energy techniques and
there<00:00:08.090> are<00:00:08.149> many<00:00:08.330> different<00:00:08.480> forms<00:00:08.720> of

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:08.930 
there are many different forms of

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.960 
there are many different forms of
stretching<00:00:09.410> so<00:00:09.769> everybody<00:00:10.190> thinks<00:00:10.460> that<00:00:10.520> more

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:10.970 
stretching so everybody thinks that more

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.150 
stretching so everybody thinks that more
than<00:00:11.060> passive<00:00:11.510> stretching<00:00:11.750> or<00:00:12.500> the<00:00:12.800> active

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
than passive stretching or the active

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.500 
than passive stretching or the active
stretch<00:00:13.400> and<00:00:13.610> passive<00:00:14.030> stretching

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.510 
stretch and passive stretching

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.380 
stretch and passive stretching
well<00:00:15.290> demonstrate<00:00:15.789> passive<00:00:16.789> is<00:00:17.029> when<00:00:17.300> the

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
well demonstrate passive is when the

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.080 
well demonstrate passive is when the
therapist<00:00:17.840> actually<00:00:18.680> brings<00:00:18.890> it<00:00:19.039> up<00:00:19.130> and

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
therapist actually brings it up and

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.270 
therapist actually brings it up and
holds<00:00:20.420> it<00:00:20.570> and<00:00:21.470> everybody's<00:00:21.830> belief<00:00:22.100> is<00:00:22.250> a

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:22.280 
holds it and everybody's belief is a

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.520 
holds it and everybody's belief is a
little<00:00:22.490> bit<00:00:22.580> different<00:00:22.970> from<00:00:23.180> ten<00:00:24.080> to<00:00:24.380> twenty

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:24.530 
little bit different from ten to twenty

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.890 
little bit different from ten to twenty
eight<00:00:24.830> to<00:00:24.980> thirty<00:00:25.010> seconds<00:00:25.730> so<00:00:26.690> that's

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
eight to thirty seconds so that's

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.960 
eight to thirty seconds so that's
considered<00:00:27.380> passive<00:00:27.619> stretch<00:00:28.190> and<00:00:28.670> that<00:00:28.789> can

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
considered passive stretch and that can

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.510 
considered passive stretch and that can
be<00:00:29.029> perform<00:00:29.390> all<00:00:29.510> through<00:00:29.720> the<00:00:29.840> whole<00:00:30.170> body

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
be perform all through the whole body

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.430 
be perform all through the whole body
next<00:00:31.520> one<00:00:31.699> is<00:00:31.940> called<00:00:32.300> after<00:00:32.960> the<00:00:33.079> system

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
next one is called after the system

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.800 
next one is called after the system
stretch<00:00:33.770> so<00:00:34.610> basically<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:35.239> therapist

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:35.810 
stretch so basically the therapist

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.200 
stretch so basically the therapist
brings<00:00:36.079> it<00:00:36.230> up<00:00:36.410> and<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:37.550> client<00:00:38.090> will

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
brings it up and the client will

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.440 
brings it up and the client will
actually<00:00:38.480> hold<00:00:38.720> give<00:00:39.590> a<00:00:39.620> little<00:00:39.800> push<00:00:40.100> so<00:00:40.460> it's

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
actually hold give a little push so it's

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.420 
actually hold give a little push so it's
active<00:00:41.809> the<00:00:41.870> system<00:00:42.260> so<00:00:42.920> both<00:00:43.130> when<00:00:43.280> we're

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
active the system so both when we're

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.530 
active the system so both when we're
working<00:00:43.730> together<00:00:44.530> okay<00:00:45.530> so<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.940> next<00:00:47.059> one<00:00:47.329> is

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
working together okay so the next one is

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.569 
working together okay so the next one is
considered<00:00:48.050> active<00:00:48.320> stretch<00:00:48.829> and<00:00:49.250> active

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
considered active stretch and active

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.540 
considered active stretch and active
stretches<00:00:50.000> when<00:00:50.239> you<00:00:50.329> bring<00:00:50.510> up<00:00:50.950> the<00:00:51.950> leg<00:00:52.160> or

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
stretches when you bring up the leg or

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.819 
stretches when you bring up the leg or
any<00:00:52.850> part<00:00:53.059> of<00:00:53.149> the<00:00:53.210> body<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:53.690> that<00:00:53.780> there<00:00:54.559> and

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
any part of the body and that there and

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.729 
any part of the body and that there and
the<00:00:54.980> client<00:00:55.430> actually<00:00:56.379> performs<00:00:57.379> the<00:00:57.500> stretch

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
the client actually performs the stretch

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.950 
the client actually performs the stretch
set<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.760> you<00:00:58.850> just<00:00:59.000> show<00:00:59.210> how<00:00:59.420> to<00:00:59.480> do<00:00:59.629> it<00:00:59.780> and

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
set so you just show how to do it and

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.359 
set so you just show how to do it and
they<00:01:00.110> perform<00:01:00.500> them<00:01:00.680> themselves<00:01:01.250> over<00:01:03.369> next

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
they perform them themselves over next

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.430 
they perform them themselves over next
stretch<00:01:04.670> will<00:01:05.210> demonstrate<00:01:05.869> resistive

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
stretch will demonstrate resistive

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.620 
stretch will demonstrate resistive
stretch<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:07.610> we're<00:01:07.850> going<00:01:07.970> to<00:01:08.090> do<00:01:08.180> is<00:01:08.330> bring<00:01:08.540> up

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
stretch so we're going to do is bring up

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.969 
stretch so we're going to do is bring up
the<00:01:08.810> leg<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.430> point<00:01:10.640> of<00:01:10.700> resistance<00:01:10.940> and

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
the leg to the point of resistance and

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.300 
the leg to the point of resistance and
have<00:01:12.979> them<00:01:13.190> push<00:01:13.490> against<00:01:13.909> you<00:01:14.560> for<00:01:15.560> seven<00:01:16.100> to

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
have them push against you for seven to

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.730 
have them push against you for seven to
twelve<00:01:16.610> or<00:01:17.150> twenty<00:01:17.330> seconds<00:01:17.960> where<00:01:18.590> you

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
twelve or twenty seconds where you

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.670 
twelve or twenty seconds where you
prefer<00:01:19.299> and<00:01:20.299> then<00:01:20.360> after<00:01:20.780> that<00:01:20.869> amount<00:01:21.140> you

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
prefer and then after that amount you

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.800 
prefer and then after that amount you
tell<00:01:21.860> them<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.040> relax<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:23.420> then<00:01:23.510> bring<00:01:23.720> it

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
tell them to relax and then bring it

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.170 
tell them to relax and then bring it
back<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:24.110> neutral<00:01:24.640> but<00:01:25.640> just<00:01:25.820> make<00:01:26.000> sure

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
back to neutral but just make sure

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.640 
back to neutral but just make sure
whenever<00:01:26.390> you<00:01:26.659> doing<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:26.960> resistive<00:01:27.439> types

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
whenever you doing the resistive types

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.390 
whenever you doing the resistive types
of<00:01:27.950> stretching<00:01:28.880> that<00:01:29.330> there's<00:01:29.600> no<00:01:30.400> pain

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
of stretching that there's no pain

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.070 
of stretching that there's no pain
involved<00:01:31.580> at<00:01:32.240> all<00:01:32.330> there<00:01:32.659> might<00:01:32.780> be<00:01:32.810> a<00:01:32.960> little

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
involved at all there might be a little

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.020 
involved at all there might be a little
discovered<00:01:33.680> that<00:01:34.189> there's<00:01:34.460> burden<00:01:34.820> and

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
discovered that there's burden and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.399 
discovered that there's burden and
tingling<00:01:35.420> any<00:01:35.630> of<00:01:35.750> those<00:01:35.869> different<00:01:36.229> kind<00:01:36.350> of

tingling any of those different kind of

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.950 
tingling any of those different kind of
sensations<00:01:37.009> make<00:01:37.729> sure<00:01:37.939> you<00:01:38.479> stop<00:01:38.780> that

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
sensations make sure you stop that

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.070 
sensations make sure you stop that
stretch<00:01:39.290> and

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
stretch and

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.610 
stretch and
2x<00:01:41.070> scratch<00:01:41.370> is<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.910> static<00:01:42.270> stretch<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:43.530> you

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
2x scratch is the static stretch so you

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.030 
2x scratch is the static stretch so you
can<00:01:43.740> bring<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.980> up<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.730> the<00:01:44.850> point<00:01:45.560> gravity<00:01:46.560> and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
can bring it up to the point gravity and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.920 
can bring it up to the point gravity and
just<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.370> them<00:01:47.490> pull<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.790> there<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.780> they're

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
just have them pull it there so they're

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.600 
just have them pull it there so they're
just<00:01:48.990> performing<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.620> stretch<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.100> way

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
just performing a stretch that way

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.850 
just performing a stretch that way

exercise videos they do they perform a

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.770 
exercise videos they do they perform a
lot<00:01:55.440> of<00:01:55.560> these<00:01:55.650> kind<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.950> techniques<00:01:56.310> em<00:01:56.780> next

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
leg the point resistance again and we

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.120 
leg the point resistance again and we
push<00:03:23.510> against<00:03:23.780> GM<00:03:24.050> for<00:03:24.260> seven<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:24.890> twelve
