00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.509
 we already returned have the answer 

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:08.500
 correct to our question the ideology 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:10.890
 is the study of the answer is of the 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.890
 fishes 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.080
 and although it is not an easy word of 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.660
 pronounce the ideology deals with the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.170
 study of the fish the word it is in 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.080
 Greek later why study fish 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.690
 to begin with, it's not good to know 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.200
 difference between the guitar fish and the 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.900
 lionfish being able to know if a jellyfish is 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.790
 actually a fish or know that a coral 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.280
 It is not a plant or mineral but a 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.989
 living creature the study of fish is 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.629
 more than a classification effort 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.360
 friends in aquariums and laboratories 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.420
 of the world the fish study because we 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.489
 they let us know the state of our planet 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.469
 many fish are sensitive to small 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.050
 amounts of bad chemicals in the water 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.780
 and their diseases or their disappearance 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.839
 the fresh waters of rivers and lakes or of 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.339
 the oceans and seas is a clear 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.070
 indication that the waters are 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:07.979
 polluted ones remember the surface of the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.170
 planet and 71% water so the kingdom 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.259
 of the fish is twice the size that 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.580
 ours from terrestrial humans 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:18.119
 healthy water means fish 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.670
 healthy and healthy fish means 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.670
 a healthy planet not only 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.490
 mammals birds and reptiles rule the kingdom 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.650
 animal there are anonymous heroes in 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.690
 different shapes and sizes 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:37.470
 and more than you could imagine are 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.470
 impressed fish I know yes 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.340
 the two largest groups of fish 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.790
 include the bony fish was take 2 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.770
 and the cartilaginous or chondrichthyan 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:53.189
 what is the difference between other things 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.490
 their skeletons the bony fish have 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.409
 skeletons made of guessing a bone and 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.360
 the cartilage a rigid substance 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.890
 fibrous constitutes the skeleton of a 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.890
 cartilaginous fish like the shark 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.459
 but bony cartilaginous when observing 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.390
 fish the shape of your body its size and 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.569
 location of your mouth 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.220
 the shape of its tail and its color are 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.770
 characteristics that tell us how and 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.030
 where that fish lives and how it adapted to its 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.520
 ambient 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.430
 the shape of your body the streak is a 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.160
 cartilaginous shark prime times 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.470
 like the streak that are flat or convex 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.030
 they move their fins up and down to the 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.250
 swim 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.710
 very similar to the movement of the wings 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.740
 of a bird 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.540
 where they live near the ocean floor in 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.040
 where the unique form of your body is the 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.920
 dream come true of any 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.140
 inhabitant of the background the stripes like this 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.290
 golden stingray eat things like 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.020
 clams oysters and crabs prey that 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.180
 found on the ocean floor when hunting 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.430
 the stripes raise sand clouds 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.000
 discovering your food delights 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.319
 while they fly with their underwater wings 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.060
 also some sharks like this 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.909
 cat shark inhabit the ground 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.969
 oceanic and although it does not have the shape of 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:13.980
 bat of the stripes its flat base 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:16.250
 shows us his preference for the soil 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.250
 Marine 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.760
 the filiform or long thin fish 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.310
 as brunettes tend to slip in the 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.440
 water like the reptiles that are 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.110
 they seem what is the best place to 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.480
 to live in this stealthy way obviously 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.660
 in the rocky crevices besides 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.580
 look thin seen from the front 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.210
 what is the benefit of the compressed form 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.040
 of these angel fish this body shape 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.990
 It is ideal for fast spinning and moving forward 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.940
 explosively over short distances 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.710
 sometimes with this form they usually live 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.020
 where there are many places to hide 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.330
 like coral reefs so a 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.280
 fast start and an agile way to turn 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.790
 is what they need to hide in 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.370
 your home and this way the classic way 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.980
 of a fish is in the form of a tube or as a 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.380
 cylinder with tips perfect for 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.670
 move smoothly in the water is the 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.600
 preferred form by swimmers 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.700
 fast in open water 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.130
 also marine mammals like the 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.549
 dolphin opted for a torpedo shape with 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:21.650
 the evolution both by speed inside 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.300
 like out of the water 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.039
 we already see like the open mouth of a fish 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.289
 sends oxygenated water through its 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.330
 guts but the size and location of 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.920
 his mouth is also a clue what 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.050
 eat and where he lives 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.230
 sometimes with a few large usually 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.960
 as in large pieces 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.450
 sometimes you summon small normally 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.810
 eat small pieces like plankton u 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.180
 floating microscopic organisms a 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.730
 mouth located upwards is fed in 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.920
 the surface a mouth in the middle part 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.090
 front of your head we assume that you 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.400
 they feed with dams that are 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.770
 in front of him a mouth facing towards 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.230
 below it feeds on the bottom like 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.440
 Stripes or the wide variety of catfish 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.450
 like the plecostomus or the nose catfish 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.620
 back find their food where the 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.229
 water touches the sand so to speak 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.460
 when we return to the animal kingdom 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.460
 we will talk about the color and the tails 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.889
 but first let's see if they can solve 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:24.210
 the next animal fact 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.210
 what animal is a fish 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.580
 the starfish 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:38.990
 the jellyfish or bad water if the little horse 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.120
 sea ​​or all of the above 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.690
 do not leave the answer when 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.690
 let's go back
