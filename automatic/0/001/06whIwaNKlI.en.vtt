 morningstar we are a corporation that

 how little the world knows about us 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.050
 We are a company focused on 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.720
 creation and production of new 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.880
 technologies and for the rest of the 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.540
 business we are a company that creates and 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.160
 produces weapons of mass destruction makes 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.170
 four years in one of our 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.050
 major laboratories had a 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.900
 unpleasant accident an accident in 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.850
 the one that we lost two of our elders 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.820
 experiments we have spent a lot of time 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.830
 looking for our searches have us 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:59.310
 brought to a city called loquendo 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.310
 city ​​and they know that we have found them 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.980

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.080

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.710
 dates back to the summer of 1943 when

 Try it 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.190
 Hello 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.610
 big and let's go 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.950
 since I did not know they had so much 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.950
 strength and aim that is strength 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.580
 We've found them seriously, you think 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.440
 be them with the little demonstration 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.960
 that they just gave us is more than 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.740
 enough and the girl matches the 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:30.100
 description hear you will have to 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.690
 accompany us part only let's say that 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.780
 you belong to morningstar 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.350
 current we do not have time for the 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.160
 explanations 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.030
 run 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.030
 I think we lost them 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:58.230
 where I am who are you are we 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.200
 morningstar agents because we 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.120
 want you two are two experiments 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.320
 we've been looking for four 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.410
 years that are not wrong for nothing you 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.940
 you are a robotic simulator unit 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.400
 you were created in the beginning to 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.830
 medical objectives as a replacement for 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.500
 organs by robotic pieces but 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:23.250
 then another use was used as a 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:26.610
 weapon that's impossible I'm human just what 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:29.190
 you seem and that's the goal to look like 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:32.100
 mostly possible to a physical human and 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.530
 mentally ours is impossible you 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.360
 you know it's true or because you think 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.640
 you do not remember anything for four years 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.430
 and your friend is the beginning for the 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.490
 perfect soldier and he is a human 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.560
 genetically altered is fast strong 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.630
 Intelligent I think if there 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.180
 they wrong scott is nothing like that nor 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:54.020
 by far that is due to the hearing aids that 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.160
 worn posts serve as interceptors 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.480
 while they have their 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.040
 skills are diminished 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.020
 considerably 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.630
 they also interfere with our signals 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.630
 that's why it was not so easy to locate 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.430
 are broken what do you mean those 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.800
 they also served to control it and 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.840
 keep it calm the only way in the 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:17.090
 that may be in the combat phase if 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.090
 takes them away in thanks for the information 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.990
 you had to tell him 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.750
 stop there 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.750
 shoot 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:42.140
 what is it that you can do with me maybe I do not 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.140
 but the plane yes that airplane 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:50.939
 I want to get off very fast 

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:54.209
 you still remember me of course what 

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:57.629
 I remember everything and how you feel I do not know 

00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:59.999
 my life is a good lie put on the 

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:02.699
 you heard, it will be more difficult for us 

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:05.189
 locate if the three posts ok but 

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:08.369
 first I will take you home 

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:10.860
 and that's what happened wow impossible in 

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:11.699
 the fair does not sell uav them shut up 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.829
 fool 

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:15.719
 Well, I'll go back to being myself and 

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:19.409
 You will know when we need the neckline 

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:22.249
 smart I do not know 

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:22.249
 how you feel
