just go straight online but that's not

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.380 
just go straight online but that's not
always<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.650> case<00:01:04.790> your<00:01:05.790> friends<00:01:06.210> need<00:01:06.240> to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
always the case your friends need to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.750 
always the case your friends need to
open<00:01:06.810> their<00:01:07.049> servers<00:01:07.560> or<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.220> need<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.460> join<00:01:08.700> a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760

server that's enabled in offline mode
now<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.270> means<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.409> servers<00:01:14.070> don't

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
now that means that the servers don't

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.550 
now that means that the servers don't
take<00:01:14.820> don't<00:01:15.270> make<00:01:15.509> any<00:01:15.780> attempt<00:01:16.380> to
