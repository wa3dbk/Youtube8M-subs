00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.410
 wow, aaa lear arraiÃ¡, I think the saint 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.630
 But you never mentioned the second 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.000
 of the day and of course again on cause 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.350
 the jury of the sea around midday 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.210
 Leave a video now to talk a little 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.980
 more about the new fans that we have 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.990
 to win make a very nice video you 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.060
 for you three countries that had never 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.980
 appeared on another rod are making their 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.060
 debut and by the advent of Ray 3 pilots 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.710
 very good 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.940
 if you could not take a look and 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.219
 this video now has to have a certain 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.140
 relationship with this first video in this 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.629
 video I want to show you how to teach 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.420
 how do you do to identify the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.219
 sex moves through the mini but is 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.590
 As you know, you can win the movie. 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.690
 full of both defict cetera and 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.670
 whenever you make one of these movements 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.170
 You end up reporting minimal to 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.120
 formerly the only way you were 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.010
 announced by the map mne was pulling 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.320
 using a muffler-free weapon 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.460
 Now if you do edson - you also 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.600
 denounced, however, the complaint is less 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.489
 wide open let's talk so you do not 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.170
 appears as a whole red ball 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.880
 time you make the move there was a lot of 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.170
 people are confused in relation to 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.939
 To this 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.950
 a lot of people asking me if it was like this 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.619
 that you appear when you make the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.380
 movements and not actually the shape with 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.030
 that you appear is very discreet but 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.500
 perceptible right 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.880
 if you keep an eye on the minimum you will 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.460
 see that every time your character 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.640
 download anp a dash a kind of a 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.920
 of a wave is a circle and leaves you 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.950
 so from the middle of the character he 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.350
 spreads as if when you pile a 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.000
 water into the water and understand the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.740
 What does that ball do like in 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.090
 back and it is opening up exactly 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.340
 that way I do not know if I was clear on the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.200
 explanation but you understand if you 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.630
 observe the least you'll see 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.939
 It means you're being 5 is 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.040
 displayed on your opponent's mini map 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.680
 including a debtor's property is well 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.409
 interesting because it always 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.670
 demonstrates is that you did not appear in the 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.350
 of the opponent for example 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.189
 when you shoot with a gun without 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.049
 silencer 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.280
 you can see that your arrow from your 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.079
 character gets the tornado 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.060
 red means that you are 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.950
 appearing in the case as a ball 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.230
 even fixed at least when its 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.710
 and when you give the love of 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.450
 both 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.310
 10 as I said, this circle appears in 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.560
 back of the lord of your nose flash 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.810
 expanding, indicating that this same 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.190
 symbol appeared at least of the enemy only 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.710
 that in red indicating to him that a 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.570
 the enemy made a l or die there and 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.640
 clear when the enemy makes a move 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.980
 appears on your mini map also a 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.270
 red circle however this is the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.010
 kind of thing that is not easy on you 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.140
 identify because because I said it is more 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.790
 discreet as well as being faster and higher 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.380
 faster than your mini map than 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.370
 when your opponent gives shots and 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.530
 influencer it also does not give you a 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.060
 very precise where the guy is. 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.370
 it basically indicates that in that location 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.620
 There is someone there like the cession movements 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.200
 are fast movements or the guy gives 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.880
 one dash he does not leave there but like him 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.040
 you can give 2 in a row for giving 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.020
 double dip is too high then when 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.730
 Get there, the fella's already faraway. 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.370
 so it 's more for you to know that 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.440
 has enemies around and a way of 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.960
 you make the most of it is using 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.850
 because I lost iron because peripherals 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.200
 which was one of the worst I've shown in 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.760
 half day video why I said 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.590
 that this video now has few 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.150
 relation to this half day because the 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.970
 peripheral you have a near vision 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.010
 complete the map through a map and 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.110
 It is much easier for you to identify 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.270
 the enemies with the mistakes both not only 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.560
 because the map has at least one mini map of 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.510
 have less 1 as well because you 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.350
 can reach a much greater extent 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.350
 the map 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.110
 then you can see areas is very 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.780
 distant and usually men are 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.790
 made all the time so you 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.620
 will have a very large advantage in this 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.240
 question of where are the enemies? 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.500
 it's not like I said no matter how much it is 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.000
 The moment the guy did it was 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.040
 far from you have to stay closer 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.570
 because you already have average distance 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.670
 You already have to be smart because it's 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.830
 then a very high speed when 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.660
 I play 10 of everything else then the guy already 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.850
 may be approaching well 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.010
 quickly and you through the 10 men 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.170
 using the yoplait peripherals and 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.240
 keeping an eye on the mini map is in 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.650
 relation to this kind of movement you 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.540
 can generate a good advantage whenever 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.580
 always remembering that there is a 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.410
 to hide these movements from the 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.300
 mini map or there is a port that 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.160
 makes you not appear on the map of the 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.780
 the same way a muffler does with 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.890
 that you do not appear on the map when you 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.420
 shoot with a gun 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.520
 right this project is a point of 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.040
 three so-called teacher blasters or 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.470
 explosion suppressor in pt-pr version 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.510
 right 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.970
 is one because I know there is also case 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.830
 you want and you find it necessary to use 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.180
 I'm going to stay here for another video 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.410
 fast car for you hope 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.450
 are you enjoying this coverage? 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.890
 If you're liking, do not forget. 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.630
 leave your limit and if possible your 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.040
 today's favorites should still have two more 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.810
 videos then it stays connected and I go 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:49.170
 staying here a hug to everyone 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.170
 stay with god and it's even a max
