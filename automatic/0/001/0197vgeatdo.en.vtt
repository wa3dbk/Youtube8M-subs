00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.110
 hello we are in the modecor laboratory 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.680
 where we present our new line 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.710
 of transfers studied by me the fashions 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.619
 with together is a line of transfers 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.480
 as you can see the two colors very elegantly 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.600
 green and orange 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.700
 the lines are very thin in color and 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.670
 very dense to bring out the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.649
 gold brushing on the back 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.809
 this will eventually have a lot of effect 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.230
 elegant and refined your sweets vi 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.750
 I will show this band 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.320
 obviously the transfer bracket that 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.230
 has been cut into strips is attached 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.850
 with scotch 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.760
 this allows you to have a band 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.199
 very long 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.800
 which will serve to go for a 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.800
 cake ride 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.530
 put it with a bag as you have 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.079
 seen a very thin line of 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.950
 chocolate and you go to spread with the 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:32.709
 spatula 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:34.209
 in this way very homogeneously one 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:37.420
 time he spread the chocolate before that 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:41.399
 harden the edges so clean 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.399
 to have a completely clean band 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.670
 wait for me to create so it means that 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:53.679
 just create some skin 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:56.549
 above so as to put it in the fold e 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.549
 put it in the fold 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.310
 this too must be put to crystallize 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.530
 always for four five hours at 18 16 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.560
 grades are decorations you can make 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.410
 in series keep ready always in reach 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.180
 of hand to decorate the cakes during the 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.599
 work week always with ours 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:24.150
 we have cut off from the 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:27.580
 sheet an acetate band as you see 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:36.160
 matches perfectly we put on 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:38.730
 chocolate with a spatula 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.730
 align 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.020
 with the use of a dedicated comb 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:58.400
 let's go before you believe to engrave the 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:03:01.380
 chocolate wrap with sponges 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.710
 with some that have curves e 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.020
 however we find in the catalog mode gaulle 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.600
 which are used to give movement to the pieces 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.330
 of chocolate in this case we will do 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.010
 of the spirals therefore when the 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:21.000
 chocolate and cremated you can shape it 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:23.520
 how you want and put it well 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.250
 let's see how to use the 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.030
 decorations made on a glazed cake 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.100
 in this case then we have ours 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:38.240
 band we did before as a tour 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.240
 cake we see the ring 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:48.400
 we see the accepted band 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:51.099
 let's take the band widens like 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.220
 you see it turns out a very thin band 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:04:01.769
 which is an integral part of the dessert e 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:06.250
 very refined in our sponge 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:13.150
 we have our chocolate spiral 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:17.350
 then the aforementioned comma is raised 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:20.350
 chocolate is made in this 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.210
 movement is therefore deformed and how 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.860
 see we have commas 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.860
 these are two very thin 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.770
 in this case you can end up inside 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.310
 doyle where there is a chocolate mousse 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:41.039
 with a raspberry jelly we will go to 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.039
 put raspberries on the cake 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.840
 in this case the dessert could be 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:02.840
 finished but we put ours 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.840
 customization
