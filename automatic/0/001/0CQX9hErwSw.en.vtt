clips<00:02:27.750> off<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.170> one<00:02:28.319> I<00:02:28.349> don't<00:02:28.739> want<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.430> go

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
clips off the one I don't want to go

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.870 
clips off the one I don't want to go
let's<00:02:30.780> see<00:02:30.900> if<00:02:30.989> I<00:02:31.080> can<00:02:31.230> find<00:02:31.410> another<00:02:31.880> cluster

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
let's see if I can find another cluster

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.530 
let's see if I can find another cluster
so<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.420> can<00:02:33.630> show<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:34.069> here<00:02:35.069> we<00:02:35.280> have<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.540> cluster

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
so I can show you here we have a cluster

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.410 
so I can show you here we have a cluster
of<00:02:36.830> there's<00:02:37.830> five<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.310> them<00:02:38.489> here<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:39.060> I'm

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
of there's five of them here so I'm

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.540 
of there's five of them here so I'm
gonna<00:02:39.630> probably<00:02:39.930> out<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:40.800> these<00:02:41.069> five<00:02:41.340> I'm

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
gonna probably out of these five I'm

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.960 
gonna probably out of these five I'm
probably<00:02:41.819> just<00:02:42.000> gonna<00:02:42.420> keep<00:02:42.720> two<00:02:43.459> so<00:02:44.459> this<00:02:44.670> one

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
probably just gonna keep two so this one

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.970 
probably just gonna keep two so this one
you<00:02:45.690> can<00:02:45.810> see<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.110> size<00:02:46.319> compared<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.860> the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
you can see the size compared to the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.900 
you can see the size compared to the
other<00:02:47.220> one<00:02:47.459> I'll<00:02:48.360> cut<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.750> off

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
other one I'll cut it off

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.610 
other one I'll cut it off
I'm<00:02:50.910> gonna<00:02:51.030> cut<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:51.569> off<00:02:51.959> because<00:02:52.290> it's<00:02:52.530> too

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
I'm gonna cut it off because it's too

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.309 
I'm gonna cut it off because it's too
close<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.220> other<00:02:53.340> one<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:54.019> probably<00:02:55.019> take

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
close to the other one and probably take

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.960 
close to the other one and probably take
this<00:02:55.530> one<00:02:55.799> and<00:02:56.069> keep<00:02:56.340> this<00:02:56.549> one<00:02:56.610> that's

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
this one and keep this one that's

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.320 
this one and keep this one that's
pointing<00:02:57.450> right<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.470> Sun<00:02:59.030> so<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.120> come

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
pointing right to the Sun so you come

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.729 
pointing right to the Sun so you come
mature<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:01.080> even<00:03:01.680> just<00:03:01.880> four<00:03:02.880> fingers<00:03:03.299> length

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
mature so even just four fingers length

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.710 
mature so even just four fingers length
this<00:03:04.739> is<00:03:04.920> actually<00:03:05.340> three<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:05.970> might<00:03:06.450> click

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
this is actually three I might click

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.670 
this is actually three I might click
that<00:03:06.959> off<00:03:07.170> completely<00:03:07.769> actually<00:03:08.600> and<00:03:09.680> like

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680

that<00:03:10.920> one<00:03:11.069> mature<00:03:11.489> here<00:03:12.299> we<00:03:12.450> have<00:03:12.540> another

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
that one mature here we have another

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.849 
that one mature here we have another
cluster<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.410> three<00:03:16.400> I'm<00:03:17.400> gonna<00:03:17.519> actually<00:03:18.000> clip

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
cluster of three I'm gonna actually clip

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.099 
cluster of three I'm gonna actually clip
this<00:03:19.859> leaf<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:20.519> this<00:03:20.730> one<00:03:21.000> is<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.600> biggest<00:03:21.959> of

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
this leaf so this one is the biggest of

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.599 
this leaf so this one is the biggest of
the<00:03:22.320> three<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:22.769> I'm<00:03:22.859> gonna<00:03:22.980> clip<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.489> other

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
fruit on but I just find that you get

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.420 
fruit on but I just find that you get
much<00:03:42.780> better<00:03:43.049> fruit<00:03:43.380> if<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.769> thin<00:03:44.100> it<00:03:44.280> out

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
much better fruit if you thin it out

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.110 
much better fruit if you thin it out
there's<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.209> cluster<00:03:45.510> of<00:03:46.010> three<00:03:47.010> I'm<00:03:48.000> gonna

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
there's a cluster of three I'm gonna

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.160 
there's a cluster of three I'm gonna
clip<00:03:48.450> them<00:03:48.690> all<00:03:48.810> out<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.350> leave<00:03:49.560> just<00:03:49.590> one<00:03:50.070> so

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
clip them all out and leave just one so

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.870 
clip them all out and leave just one so
it's<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.260> best<00:03:52.500> in<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:52.980> end<00:03:53.130> if<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.519> do<00:03:53.700> this

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
it's the best in the end if you do this

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.009 
it's the best in the end if you do this
better<00:03:54.420> for<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:54.989> tree<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:56.220> for<00:03:56.910> yourself<00:03:57.299> as

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
better for the tree and for yourself as

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.380 
better for the tree and for yourself as
you<00:03:58.170> can<00:03:58.380> see<00:03:58.560> this<00:03:58.790> this<00:03:59.790> apple<00:04:00.150> trees<00:04:00.359> are

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
you can see this this apple trees are

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.930 
you can see this this apple trees are
just<00:04:00.660> loaded<00:04:01.079> with<00:04:01.500> fruit<00:04:01.799> so<00:04:02.160> I'll<00:04:02.609> stay

if you cop if you don't make your good
cuts<00:04:39.990> right<00:04:40.990> from<00:04:41.259> the<00:04:41.409> get-go<00:04:41.620> you<00:04:41.830> kind<00:04:42.280> of

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
cuts right from the get-go you kind of

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.679 
cuts right from the get-go you kind of
tend<00:04:42.610> to<00:04:42.759> get<00:04:43.680> like<00:04:44.680> this<00:04:45.120> extending<00:04:46.120> branches

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:46.689 
tend to get like this extending branches

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:50.369 
tend to get like this extending branches
over<00:04:46.960> time<00:04:47.219> because<00:04:48.219> I've<00:04:49.050> accidentally<00:04:50.050> cut

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:50.379 
over time because I've accidentally cut

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:53.790 
over time because I've accidentally cut
out<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.740> fruiting<00:04:51.189> wood<00:04:51.219> out<00:04:51.610> of<00:04:51.639> here<00:04:52.060> so<00:04:52.800> you

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
out the fruiting wood out of here so you

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.670 
out the fruiting wood out of here so you
kind<00:04:54.039> of<00:04:54.419> get<00:04:55.419> into<00:04:55.599> that<00:04:55.930> over<00:04:56.259> the<00:04:56.379> years

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
kind of get into that over the years

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.999 
kind of get into that over the years
you're<00:04:56.889> gonna<00:04:56.979> have<00:04:57.219> to<00:04:57.370> get<00:04:57.550> more<00:04:59.009> branches

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
you're gonna have to get more branches

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:01.969 
you're gonna have to get more branches
sticking<00:05:00.190> out<00:05:00.490> out<00:05:00.669> of<00:05:00.699> the<00:05:00.909> main<00:05:01.090> trunk<00:05:01.389> so

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
sticking out out of the main trunk so

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.830 
sticking out out of the main trunk so
prune<00:05:02.979> every<00:05:03.310> year<00:05:03.729> so<00:05:04.150> it<00:05:04.360> doesn't<00:05:04.690> get<00:05:04.780> out

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
prune every year so it doesn't get out

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.420 
prune every year so it doesn't get out
of<00:05:04.990> hand<00:05:05.110> and<00:05:07.319> see<00:05:08.319> how<00:05:08.409> it's<00:05:08.650> going<00:05:08.919> all<00:05:09.190> up

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
of hand and see how it's going all up

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:16.649 
of hand and see how it's going all up
here<00:05:09.940> I'm<00:05:10.120> gonna<00:05:10.979> clip<00:05:11.979> it<00:05:12.129> all<00:05:12.280> out<00:05:15.509> I'm<00:05:16.509> gonna

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:16.659 
here I'm gonna clip it all out I'm gonna

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.330 
here I'm gonna clip it all out I'm gonna
probably<00:05:16.900> clip<00:05:17.259> all<00:05:17.440> that<00:05:17.650> down<00:05:17.889> just<00:05:18.279> make

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
probably clip all that down just make

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.129 
probably clip all that down just make
sure<00:05:18.699> you<00:05:18.879> don't<00:05:19.000> clip<00:05:19.360> out<00:05:19.509> more<00:05:19.840> than<00:05:19.990> a

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
sure you don't clip out more than a

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:27.450 
sure you don't clip out more than a
third<00:05:20.500> of<00:05:21.690> the<00:05:22.690> tree<00:05:23.050> at<00:05:23.439> any<00:05:23.680> time<00:05:26.250> another<00:05:27.250> in

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
third of the tree at any time another in

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.439 
third of the tree at any time another in
there<00:05:27.669> it's<00:05:28.330> a<00:05:28.419> nice<00:05:28.629> day<00:05:28.990> it's<00:05:29.710> warm<00:05:30.240> good<00:05:31.240> day
