the frost sets on there we'll take one

know<00:00:52.620> hopefully<00:00:53.620> you<00:00:53.830> can<00:00:54.040> see<00:00:54.190> that<00:00:54.400> I<00:00:54.750> can't

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
know hopefully you can see that I can't

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:06.320 
know hopefully you can see that I can't
see<00:00:55.930> in<00:00:56.050> the<00:00:56.140> monitor<00:00:56.530> thing<00:00:58.290> so<00:01:01.860> it<00:01:02.860> says<00:01:04.590> 0.55

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
see in the monitor thing so it says 0.55

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
see in the monitor thing so it says 0.55
so<00:01:07.330> about<00:01:08.320> half<00:01:08.530> an<00:01:08.680> inch<00:01:08.770> for<00:01:09.130> yourself<00:01:10.350> and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
so about half an inch for yourself and

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.920 
so about half an inch for yourself and
then<00:01:11.500> you<00:01:11.560> keep<00:01:12.520> this<00:01:12.700> a<00:01:13.000> little<00:01:13.390> bit<00:01:13.570> colder

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
then you keep this a little bit colder

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.859 
then you keep this a little bit colder
one<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.820> there's<00:01:16.000> a<00:01:16.060> little<00:01:16.360> bit<00:01:16.479> more<00:01:16.720> room

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
one and there's a little bit more room

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.930 
one and there's a little bit more room
so<00:01:17.399> it<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:19.509> squeeze<00:01:19.869> it<00:01:19.899> a<00:01:20.140> little<00:01:20.470> bit<00:01:20.619> more

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
so it it squeeze it a little bit more

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.790 
so it it squeeze it a little bit more
makes<00:01:21.940> a<00:01:22.030> little<00:01:22.119> bit<00:01:22.210> better<00:01:22.420> what's<00:01:23.410> up<00:01:24.270> that

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
makes a little bit better what's up that

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:35.190 
makes a little bit better what's up that
and<00:01:26.800> then<00:01:28.830> put<00:01:29.830> a<00:01:30.690> little<00:01:31.690> bit<00:01:32.050> of<00:01:34.200> anti-seize

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
and then put a little bit of anti-seize

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:44.300 
and then put a little bit of anti-seize
on<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:36.840> break<00:01:37.840> on<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.259> air<00:01:39.929> on<00:01:40.929> the<00:01:41.050> threads
