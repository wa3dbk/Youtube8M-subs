very day

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:55.379 
very day
I<00:06:52.539> think<00:06:53.199> the<00:06:53.349> Russ<00:06:53.530> Hall<00:06:53.770> fire<00:06:54.009> of<00:06:54.159> 1914<00:06:55.030> just

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:55.389 
I think the Russ Hall fire of 1914 just

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:57.059 
I think the Russ Hall fire of 1914 just
sort<00:06:55.629> of<00:06:55.689> solidified<00:06:56.319> that<00:06:56.680> connection

00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:57.069 
sort of solidified that connection

00:06:57.069 --> 00:06:59.929 
sort of solidified that connection
forever<00:06:57.610> I<00:06:57.789> mean<00:06:57.969> it<00:06:58.090> was<00:06:58.180> just<00:06:58.539> a<00:06:58.599> tremendous

00:06:59.929 --> 00:06:59.939 
forever I mean it was just a tremendous

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:04.260 
forever I mean it was just a tremendous
time<00:07:00.939> of<00:07:01.620> not<00:07:02.620> only<00:07:02.969> pride<00:07:03.969> in<00:07:04.180> the

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.270 
time of not only pride in the

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.719 
time of not only pride in the
institution<00:07:04.900> pride<00:07:05.259> in<00:07:05.469> the<00:07:05.560> community<00:07:05.740> but

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:06.729 
institution pride in the community but

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:09.390 
institution pride in the community but
that<00:07:06.969> collaboration<00:07:07.779> that<00:07:08.139> cooperation<00:07:08.919> that

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.400 
that collaboration that cooperation that

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.339 
that collaboration that cooperation that
spirit<00:07:10.029> that<00:07:10.060> developed<00:07:10.810> and<00:07:11.020> was<00:07:11.199> just

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:11.349 
spirit that developed and was just

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:13.200 
spirit that developed and was just
really<00:07:11.620> solidified<00:07:12.279> I<00:07:12.310> think<00:07:12.699> in<00:07:12.819> that<00:07:12.969> event

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.210 
really solidified I think in that event

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.179 
really solidified I think in that event
and<00:07:13.419> it<00:07:13.539> carries<00:07:13.870> through<00:07:14.050> still<00:07:14.379> today<00:07:14.740> I

00:07:15.179 --> 00:07:15.189 
and it carries through still today I

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:17.339 
and it carries through still today I
don't<00:07:16.029> think<00:07:16.240> there<00:07:16.449> is<00:07:16.479> a<00:07:16.569> community<00:07:17.169> in

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:17.349 
don't think there is a community in

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:20.040 
don't think there is a community in
Kansas<00:07:17.650> that<00:07:18.099> supports<00:07:18.699> its<00:07:18.990> institution<00:07:19.990> of

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.050 
Kansas that supports its institution of

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.379 
Kansas that supports its institution of
higher<00:07:20.169> education<00:07:20.370> like<00:07:21.370> Pittsburg<00:07:21.849> does<00:07:22.120> for

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:22.389 
higher education like Pittsburg does for

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:26.270 
higher education like Pittsburg does for
