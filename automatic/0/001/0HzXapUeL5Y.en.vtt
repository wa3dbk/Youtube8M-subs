Oh

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.790 

what<00:00:32.279> should<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.640> draw<00:00:33.050> thinking<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.440> great

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
what should I draw thinking of great

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.110 
what should I draw thinking of great
ideas<00:00:35.130> takes<00:00:35.730> up<00:00:35.970> so<00:00:36.270> much<00:00:36.329> time<00:00:37.790> designs<00:00:38.790> from

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
ideas takes up so much time designs from

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.530 
ideas takes up so much time designs from
around<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.690> world<00:00:40.100> hmm<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.970> book<00:00:42.300> should

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
around the world hmm this book should

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.530 
around the world hmm this book should
give<00:00:42.780> me<00:00:42.900> some<00:00:43.110> ideas<00:00:43.670> these<00:00:44.670> designs<00:00:45.300> are

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
give me some ideas these designs are

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.770 
give me some ideas these designs are
great<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.260> some<00:00:47.130> of<00:00:47.310> them<00:00:47.580> seem<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> be<00:00:48.300> formed

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
great and some of them seem to be formed

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.560 
great and some of them seem to be formed
from<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.440> same<00:00:49.770> tiny<00:00:50.100> design<00:00:50.640> being<00:00:50.940> repeated

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
from the same tiny design being repeated

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.790 
from the same tiny design being repeated
over<00:00:51.720> and<00:00:52.110> over<00:00:52.410> again

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.690 

hey<00:00:58.800> dr.<00:00:59.280> ROH<00:00:59.430> take<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.240> look<00:01:00.510> at<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:01.520> you<00:01:02.520> are

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
hey dr. ROH take a look at this you are

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.420 
hey dr. ROH take a look at this you are
right<00:01:03.090> JC<00:01:03.710> this<00:01:04.710> design<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.640> made<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.140> same

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
right JC this design is made of the same

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.059 
right JC this design is made of the same
pattern<00:01:08.430> being<00:01:09.149> repeated<00:01:09.469> over<00:01:10.469> and<00:01:10.859> over

00:01:11.059 --> 00:01:11.069 
pattern being repeated over and over

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:14.599 
pattern being repeated over and over
again<00:01:12.259> you<00:01:13.259> want<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.799> learn<00:01:14.100> more<00:01:14.549> about

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:14.609 
again you want to learn more about

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:18.889 
again you want to learn more about
patterns<00:01:15.509> JC<00:01:16.009> yes<00:01:17.009> dr.<00:01:17.460> Loe<00:01:17.640> let's<00:01:18.329> learn<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
patterns JC yes dr. Loe let's learn the

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.940 
patterns JC yes dr. Loe let's learn the
concept<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.590> patterns<00:01:20.100> together<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:21.950> pattern

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
concept of patterns together a pattern

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.349 
concept of patterns together a pattern
is<00:01:23.310> formed<00:01:24.149> when<00:01:24.899> a<00:01:24.929> set<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.590> shapes<00:01:26.359> numbers

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
is formed when a set of shapes numbers

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.069 
is formed when a set of shapes numbers
or<00:01:27.719> designs<00:01:28.530> are<00:01:28.999> repeated<00:01:29.999> over<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.810> over

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
or designs are repeated over and over

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.830 
or designs are repeated over and over
again<00:01:33.259> patterns<00:01:34.259> are<00:01:34.649> found<00:01:35.219> everywhere<00:01:35.840> in

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
again patterns are found everywhere in

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.520 
again patterns are found everywhere in
our<00:01:37.170> world<00:01:37.469> you<00:01:38.399> can<00:01:38.639> see<00:01:39.030> patterns<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
our world you can see patterns in the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.739 
our world you can see patterns in the
floor<00:01:40.889> tiles<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.759> your<00:01:41.999> room<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.799> flowers<00:01:43.799> in

the triangles on it form a pattern
the<00:02:00.980> pattern<00:02:01.610> is<00:02:01.880> formed<00:02:02.720> by<00:02:03.140> a<00:02:03.410> triangle

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
the pattern is formed by a triangle

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.900 
the pattern is formed by a triangle
followed<00:02:05.210> by<00:02:05.930> an<00:02:06.140> upside-down<00:02:06.920> triangle

being repeated over and over again once
you<00:02:13.820> identify<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.960> pattern<00:02:15.710> you<00:02:16.400> can<00:02:16.610> take<00:02:17.000> it

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
you identify a pattern you can take it

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.370 
you identify a pattern you can take it
forward<00:02:17.740> yourself<00:02:19.690> completing<00:02:20.690> patterns<00:02:21.170> is

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
forward yourself completing patterns is

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.040 
forward yourself completing patterns is
quite<00:02:21.680> easy

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
quite easy

yes JC all you need to do is first
decide<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.580> shapes<00:02:28.970> or<00:02:29.420> numbers<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:30.230> you

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
decide the shapes or numbers that you

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.920 
decide the shapes or numbers that you
will<00:02:30.860> use<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.490> arrange<00:02:32.030> them<00:02:32.420> in<00:02:32.840> a

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
will use and arrange them in a

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.250 
will use and arrange them in a
particular<00:02:33.140> pattern<00:02:34.210> let's<00:02:35.210> take<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.750> look<00:02:36.080> at

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
particular pattern let's take a look at

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.850 
particular pattern let's take a look at
some<00:02:36.860> patterns<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.700> see<00:02:38.330> if<00:02:38.630> we<00:02:38.930> can<00:02:39.140> complete

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
some patterns and see if we can complete

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.690 
some patterns and see if we can complete
them<00:02:40.220> ourselves<00:02:41.590> let's<00:02:42.590> look<00:02:42.980> at<00:02:43.220> this

them ourselves let's look at this

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.050 
them ourselves let's look at this
pattern<00:02:44.300> now<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:45.650> must<00:02:45.890> have<00:02:46.190> noticed<00:02:46.790> that

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060

previous number to the current number to

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.940 
previous number to the current number to
get<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.430> next<00:05:14.030> number<00:05:14.260> so<00:05:15.260> what's<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.770> next

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
get the next number so what's the next

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.469 
get the next number so what's the next
number<00:05:16.460> after<00:05:16.639> 18<00:05:18.130> the<00:05:19.130> next<00:05:19.160> number<00:05:19.849> is<00:05:19.940> 11

some patterns around us are known to be
symmetrical<00:05:29.939> do<00:05:30.930> you<00:05:31.139> remember<00:05:31.439> what<00:05:32.370> line

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:32.969 
symmetrical do you remember what line

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:37.519 
symmetrical do you remember what line
symmetry<00:05:33.599> is<00:05:34.189> if<00:05:35.189> a<00:05:35.430> figure<00:05:35.849> or<00:05:36.029> pattern<00:05:36.870> can

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:37.529 
symmetry is if a figure or pattern can

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:41.119 
symmetry is if a figure or pattern can
be<00:05:37.559> folded<00:05:37.979> into<00:05:38.490> mirror<00:05:39.029> halves<00:05:39.589> so<00:05:40.589> that<00:05:40.620> one

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:41.129 
be folded into mirror halves so that one

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.390 
be folded into mirror halves so that one
half<00:05:41.460> fits<00:05:41.999> exactly<00:05:42.389> on<00:05:43.259> top<00:05:43.740> of<00:05:43.770> the<00:05:44.249> other

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.640 
half fits exactly on top of the other
then<00:05:45.360> we<00:05:45.659> say<00:05:45.960> it<00:05:46.259> has<00:05:46.830> got<00:05:46.860> line<00:05:47.759> symmetry

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
then we say it has got line symmetry

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.159 
then we say it has got line symmetry
this<00:05:49.650> line<00:05:49.979> that<00:05:50.370> divides<00:05:50.610> the<00:05:51.419> figure<00:05:51.870> into

about<00:06:58.970> patterns<00:06:59.599> a<00:06:59.919> pattern<00:07:00.919> is<00:07:01.039> formed<00:07:01.460> when

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:01.639 
about patterns a pattern is formed when

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:04.689 
about patterns a pattern is formed when
a<00:07:01.669> set<00:07:02.000> of<00:07:02.180> shapes<00:07:02.539> numbers<00:07:03.470> or<00:07:03.740> designs<00:07:04.460> are

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:04.699 
a set of shapes numbers or designs are

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:07.270 
a set of shapes numbers or designs are
repeated<00:07:05.180> over<00:07:05.419> and<00:07:05.659> over<00:07:05.900> again<00:07:06.280> while

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 
repeated over and over again while

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.210 
repeated over and over again while
completing<00:07:07.849> continuing<00:07:08.599> patterns<00:07:09.220> identify

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.220 
completing continuing patterns identify

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.939 
completing continuing patterns identify
the<00:07:10.280> pattern<00:07:10.789> rule<00:07:11.169> while<00:07:12.169> completing<00:07:12.710> a

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:12.949 
the pattern rule while completing a

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:15.640 
the pattern rule while completing a
pattern<00:07:13.370> along<00:07:13.759> its<00:07:13.970> line<00:07:14.180> of<00:07:14.240> symmetry<00:07:14.650> draw

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:15.650 
pattern along its line of symmetry draw

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.920 
pattern along its line of symmetry draw
the<00:07:15.710> other<00:07:16.039> half<00:07:16.400> so<00:07:16.909> that<00:07:16.940> the<00:07:17.270> Hoff's<00:07:17.539> fit

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:17.930 
the other half so that the Hoff's fit

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.680 
the other half so that the Hoff's fit
together<00:07:18.349> perfectly<00:07:18.789> when<00:07:19.789> the<00:07:19.970> shape<00:07:20.240> battle

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:20.690 
together perfectly when the shape battle

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.590 
together perfectly when the shape battle
is<00:07:20.810> folded<00:07:21.259> in<00:07:21.380> half
