00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.959 
Simon that circle with like red blue
yellow<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.140> whatever<00:00:34.410> other<00:00:34.649> color<00:00:34.980> buttons

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
yellow and whatever other color buttons

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.299 
yellow and whatever other color buttons
and<00:00:36.239> then<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.380> buttons<00:00:37.680> light<00:00:37.860> up<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.219> you

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
and then the buttons light up and you

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.680 
and then the buttons light up and you
have<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.550> press<00:00:38.790> them<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.360> order<00:00:39.660> that

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
have to press them and the order that

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.810 
have to press them and the order that
they<00:00:40.230> lit<00:00:40.469> up<00:00:40.649> well<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.129> was<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> rhythm<00:00:41.640> game

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
they lit up well that was a rhythm game

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.610 
they lit up well that was a rhythm game
but<00:00:42.090> obviously<00:00:42.540> wasn't<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.840> rhythm<00:00:43.110> video<00:00:43.379> game

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
but obviously wasn't a rhythm video game

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.459 
but obviously wasn't a rhythm video game
so<00:00:44.129> rhythm<00:00:44.460> games<00:00:44.670> existed<00:00:45.570> before<00:00:46.020> parappa

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
so rhythm games existed before parappa

the Guinness Book of World Records

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.560 
the Guinness Book of World Records
classifies<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.369> as<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.670> first<00:01:20.939> rhythm<00:01:21.360> game

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
classifies it as the first rhythm game

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.660 
classifies it as the first rhythm game
but<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.930> would<00:01:22.259> actually<00:01:22.409> classify<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.400> more

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
but I would actually classify that more

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.300 
but I would actually classify that more
like<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> fitness<00:01:24.720> game<00:01:24.930> than<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.650> rhythm<00:01:26.130> game

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
like a fitness game than a rhythm game

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.160 
like a fitness game than a rhythm game
