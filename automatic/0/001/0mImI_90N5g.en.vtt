00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.780
 I'm a little sad too for my 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.340
 teachers because the high conditions 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.120
 the words that the judges told me 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.779
 they were then 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.720
 and bad and they must understand that they were 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.450
 thanks to them I feel that you can 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.950
 get to where you propose and we 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:32.200
 worried that they lived a little crushed 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:35.800
 come on, the hard part is that you can not give 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.710
 more and it was with my best moment I do not want 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.510
 go if you give us cravings anguish and I 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.150
 others if I have done with only we are 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.400
 friends maybe if you're going to name 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.500
 I saw a six-year-old boy I can not 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.700
 put the choreography that I put on you and 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.500
 I 'm putting it on because I know what 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.370
 you can make yourself declare a turn of confidence 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.800
 I am very happy because they are my teachers 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.989
 in as much where it was surprised at the end 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:04.149
 many things that we have subscribed and 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:06.850
 that we see enormous support to guide you 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:09.220
 to see what works best for you 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.060
 as a singer as an artist that's why 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.610
 last week 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.950
 the lady lola courteous committed to 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.750

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.149

 I was doing the same and always 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.640
 you have to move too many arms 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.330
 to sing without moving the arms without moving 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.430
 the feet 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.160
