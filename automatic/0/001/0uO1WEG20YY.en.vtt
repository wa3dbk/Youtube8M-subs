00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.870 
good I'm wait for everything I render
everything<00:02:35.320> should<00:02:35.650> move<00:02:35.860> nicely<00:02:36.370> as<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.670> see

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
everything should move nicely as you see

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.580 
everything should move nicely as you see
right<00:02:37.030> there<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:40.330> will<00:02:40.600> move<00:02:40.870> nicely

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
right there it will move nicely

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.080 
right there it will move nicely
the<00:02:41.920> reason<00:02:42.160> I'm<00:02:42.250> lagging<00:02:42.430> just<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.790> little<00:02:43.000> bit

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
the reason I'm lagging just a little bit

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.640 
the reason I'm lagging just a little bit
because<00:02:43.180> I'm<00:02:43.330> using<00:02:43.450> Camtasia<00:02:43.690> fraps<00:02:44.500> is

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
because I'm using Camtasia fraps is

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.780 
because I'm using Camtasia fraps is
better<00:02:44.860> perhaps<00:02:45.190> what<00:02:45.400> I<00:02:45.430> use<00:02:45.610> on<00:02:45.730> my

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
better perhaps what I use on my

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.690 
better perhaps what I use on my
recording<00:02:46.330> do<00:02:46.750> my<00:02:46.900> recording<00:02:47.290> on<00:02:47.440> but<00:02:48.400> as<00:02:48.520> you

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
recording do my recording on but as you

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.970 
recording do my recording on but as you
can<00:02:48.880> see<00:02:51.150> minecraft<00:02:52.150> does<00:02:52.420> run<00:02:52.800> run<00:02:53.800> pretty

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
can see minecraft does run run pretty

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.110 
can see minecraft does run run pretty
good<00:02:54.190> for<00:02:54.340> me<00:02:54.400> even<00:02:54.520> though<00:02:54.670> I'm<00:02:54.790> recording

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
good for me even though I'm recording

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.480 
good for me even though I'm recording
with<00:02:55.150> Camtasia<00:02:55.800> so<00:02:56.800> this<00:02:56.920> is<00:02:57.040> all<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.250> got<00:02:57.340> to

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
with Camtasia so this is all you got to

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.820 
with Camtasia so this is all you got to

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
thing that I must reiterate is when

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:19.320 
thing that I must reiterate is when
doing<00:03:11.560> this<00:03:17.520> whatever<00:03:18.520> amount<00:03:19.000> of<00:03:19.120> RAM<00:03:19.300> you

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
doing this whatever amount of RAM you

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.210 
doing this whatever amount of RAM you
have<00:03:19.510> when<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:20.020> edit<00:03:20.140> this<00:03:20.440> you're<00:03:20.980> going<00:03:21.100> to

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
have when you edit this you're going to

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.430 
have when you edit this you're going to
change<00:03:21.430> it<00:03:21.580> so<00:03:21.730> I'm<00:03:22.180> using<00:03:22.480> 2<00:03:22.960> gigs<00:03:23.170> of<00:03:23.230> RAM

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
change it so I'm using 2 gigs of RAM

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.380 
change it so I'm using 2 gigs of RAM
half<00:03:23.680> of<00:03:23.800> my<00:03:23.890> normal<00:03:24.160> RAM<00:03:24.310> usage<00:03:24.520> if<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.240> use<00:03:25.360> a

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
half of my normal RAM usage if you use a

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.590 
half of my normal RAM usage if you use a
one<00:03:25.660> gig<00:03:25.840> 102<00:03:26.290> for<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:27.160> 200<00:03:27.730> for<00:03:27.940> 8<00:03:28.150> make<00:03:28.480> sure

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
one gig 102 for to 200 for 8 make sure

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.480 
one gig 102 for to 200 for 8 make sure
