00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.340 
straight up into the the fast-moving
water<00:01:40.940> at<00:01:41.150> the<00:01:41.210> bottom<00:01:41.300> of<00:01:41.510> this<00:01:41.570> rapid<00:01:41.990> and

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
the fly where it needs to be I'm not the

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.970 
the fly where it needs to be I'm not the
best<00:04:08.819> caster<00:04:09.299> but<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:10.140> get<00:04:10.349> that<00:04:10.470> fly<00:04:10.739> where

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
best caster but you get that fly where

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.800 
best caster but you get that fly where
it<00:04:11.040> needs<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.340> be<00:04:11.430> nine<00:04:12.120> times<00:04:12.150> out<00:04:12.540> of<00:04:12.569> ten

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
it needs to be nine times out of ten

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:20.710 
it needs to be nine times out of ten
you're<00:04:12.959> going<00:04:13.079> to<00:04:13.140> be<00:04:13.230> onto<00:04:13.409> that<00:04:13.500> fish
