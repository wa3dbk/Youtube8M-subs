00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.290
 hi friends, how are you going to prepare 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.630
 an easy and simple recipe a chicken 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.000
 Caribbean to the oven for this 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.250
 recipe we need a direct envelope 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.189
 Baked by mach and a little bacon 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:22.089
 pineapple juice a few slices of pineapple 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:24.759
 cut carrot green pepper and the 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:28.220
 chicken to start 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:32.090
 you just have to open this envelope with 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:36.110
 Easy opening inside contains the 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.199
 little bag and let's open the bag you have 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.660
 to be careful because inside 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:45.360
 contains the closure 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.180
 here we have the closure that will then be 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.040
 for the end to be well hermetic all 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.040
 the bag we open 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.730
 monza 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.110
 and it will simply be adding all the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.110
 ingredients we put the chicken 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.060
 green pepper vegetables 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.110
 the glory 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.600
 pineapple 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.860
 the pineapple juice 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:23.170
 the bacon and we need to add the seasoning 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.170
 which contains the envelope 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:31.910
 and finally we close 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.910
 with the closure that contains the interior 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.229
 we close 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.870
 so that it is completely hermetic 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.229
 now we will mix well all 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.229
 ingredients 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.460
 and in this simple way and 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.820
 we would have ready the chicken to place 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.820
 baked in total one hour at 200 degrees 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.000
 we already have the chicken ready and going 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.810
 cooked in this way is very fast 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.300
 very easy to make and low fat what 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.410
 let stand a couple of minutes before 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.650
 to open 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:23.510
 now we open with the scissors 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.510
 and we put it in this font 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.140
 the truth is that it gives off a scent 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.960
 great 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.670
 and we have our chicken ready and 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.280
 sure you will enjoy it and 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.600
 remember that at ease with life is to be 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.600
 practical and eat healthy 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.810
 and others
