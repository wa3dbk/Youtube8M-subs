bit of road running and then I want to

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.340 
bit of road running and then I want to
integrate<00:00:36.640> also<00:00:37.149> my<00:00:37.329> trail<00:00:37.720> running<00:00:37.930> using

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
integrate also my trail running using

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.440 
integrate also my trail running using
together<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:38.920> that's<00:00:39.579> the<00:00:39.820> most<00:00:39.970> important

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
together and that's the most important

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.750 
together and that's the most important
element<00:00:40.810> of<00:00:40.840> it<00:00:41.050> that's<00:00:41.860> light<00:00:42.220> it's<00:00:42.520> got<00:00:42.670> the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
element of it that's light it's got the

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.819 
element of it that's light it's got the
best<00:00:43.000> benefits<00:00:43.750> like<00:00:43.930> a<00:00:43.989> running<00:00:44.530> shoe<00:00:44.680> is

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
best benefits like a running shoe is

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.940 
best benefits like a running shoe is
very<00:00:45.040> light<00:00:45.250> very<00:00:45.750> flexible<00:00:46.750> but<00:00:47.680> the<00:00:47.800> most

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
very light very flexible but the most

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.130 
very light very flexible but the most
important<00:00:48.940> part<00:00:49.090> about<00:00:49.210> it<00:00:49.270> is<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:49.870> grooves

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
important part about it is the grooves

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.360 
important part about it is the grooves
that<00:00:50.260> you<00:00:50.469> have<00:00:50.649> here<00:00:50.980> are<00:00:53.130> highlighted<00:00:54.130> as

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
that you have here are highlighted as

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.639 
that you have here are highlighted as
two<00:00:54.790> different<00:00:55.660> kinds<00:00:55.930> of<00:00:56.230> groups<00:00:56.379> that<00:00:56.500> you

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
two different kinds of groups that you

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.319 
two different kinds of groups that you
have<00:00:56.829> here<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.550> first<00:00:57.820> one<00:00:58.059> would<00:00:58.270> be

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
have here the first one would be

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.209 
have here the first one would be
basically<00:00:58.750> very<00:00:59.110> close<00:00:59.410> to<00:00:59.559> the<00:00:59.590> road<00:00:59.860> kind<00:01:00.100> of

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
basically very close to the road kind of

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.130 
basically very close to the road kind of
running<00:01:00.579> shoes<00:01:00.790> and<00:01:01.120> then<00:01:01.570> you<00:01:01.719> will<00:01:01.840> see<00:01:01.989> that

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
running shoes and then you will see that

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.270 
running shoes and then you will see that
the<00:01:02.260> grips<00:01:02.500> here<00:01:02.710> are<00:01:02.860> a<00:01:02.890> little<00:01:03.039> bit<00:01:03.190> more

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
the grips here are a little bit more

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.219 
the grips here are a little bit more
trill<00:01:03.730> so<00:01:03.940> that's<00:01:04.089> why<00:01:04.269> it's<00:01:04.509> kind<00:01:05.049> of<00:01:05.110> a

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
trill so that's why it's kind of a

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.649 
trill so that's why it's kind of a
hybrid<00:01:05.409> shoot<00:01:05.860> at<00:01:05.979> me<00:01:06.009> we<00:01:06.399> actually<00:01:07.119> use<00:01:07.329> and

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
hybrid shoot at me we actually use and

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.690 
hybrid shoot at me we actually use and
this<00:01:08.320> is<00:01:08.470> good<00:01:08.680> for<00:01:08.890> people<00:01:08.920> who<00:01:09.310> want<00:01:09.430> to<00:01:09.580> do

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
this is good for people who want to do

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.730 
this is good for people who want to do
both<00:01:11.100> training<00:01:12.100> in<00:01:12.420> basically<00:01:13.799> kind<00:01:14.799> of

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
both training in basically kind of

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.600 
both training in basically kind of
when<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.430> call<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.820> an<00:01:17.970> alternative<00:01:18.689> training

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610
