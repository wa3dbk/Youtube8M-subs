00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:15.129
 distance is not and several 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.370
 centimeters abc.az we put 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.260
 for 1 cube 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.849
 lead carbine points 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.869
 at this year in order for her to hold 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.599

 night clubs 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.070
 in doing so serves to 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.700
 when throwing hours 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.680
 show you how we are 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.770
 what makes vodka yes that means 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.660
 other things twist which 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.710
 vice captain bindings became 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.600
 why it happens next comes the trailer 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.110
 who claims to pitchfork 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.580
 Viktor Kopeikin 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.110
 bow this criticism using 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.110
 added 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.540
 this phone 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.670
 tons he 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.050
 we fix 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.080
 will serve it so that at the moment of flight 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.480
 when casting 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.010
 and in the year it seemed to push him away 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.370
 overlapping strip 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.890
 but about the darkness there is a sent Kutuz 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.430
 got on the day snap slept than 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.430
 riots how does that look like 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.330
 cable to sticking 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.000
 it limits 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.230
 let's say lifting 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.460
 they were always lying accounted for by one 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.460
 nato by quantity at that distance which 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.900
 which is limited to 1 is a snap 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.820
 it is applied not only to murat 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.410
 The rigging is also used for carp fishing 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.590
 Mostly places with quantity received 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.360
 willow 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.560
 that is, in order to raise Boyle need 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.160
 was a matter 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.520
 because if we use 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.530
 the usual tons of what he just he will go 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.899
 fail brought out 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.219
 or how it 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.199
 committee does not forgive 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:15.239
 prokopov 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.230
 ammunition lifted tired 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.929
 it becomes noticeable to me 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:21.309
 really hide bites 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.939
 increases
