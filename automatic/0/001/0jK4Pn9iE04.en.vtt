00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.480
 love the people that we are in a new 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.280
 video and I 'm going to show you how to improve 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.960
 the performance of jeta 5 is worth 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.000
 increase the fps the frames by 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.589
 second is worth it so the first thing that 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.919
 we have to do is go to the description 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:22.010
 ok with a link that will put gta iv 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:24.410
 It will take you 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.080
 to a web page called can you 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.240
 run it 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.619
 which is to make sure that our 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.619
 computer is 100% 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.890
 trained let's say how to throw the 5 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.960
 you do not have to do it and it's in 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.309
 sure process that you have a computer 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.930
 apt may be needed but I did it 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.690
 well of case 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.700
 I'm going to tell you I do not know what you have to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.890
 download a small file that goes to 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.340
 be here if you are in the google chrome 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.900
 OK 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:01.900
 I can not do it because he already says it 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.900
 to approve it in a file here 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.180
 a little leave the page where it is and 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.280
 then immediately after 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.290
 a very well-known thing this is worth 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.520
 has to get out these two tics bad is 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.110
 obligatory because the first tick comes out 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.600
 this green and another that there is a red X 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.320
 it is very possible that you go to whatever 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.140
 new low tennis courts that are 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.410
 five or ten as much to the whole 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.410
 same 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.970
 As you can see here, I'm going pretty 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.880
 normalito is worth a gtx 740 and hundreds with 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.119
 4 guaranteed gigs 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.009
 and well let's see once 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.869
 let's meet all these requirements that is 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.740
 100% sure that our computer 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:55.049
 can you throw this game we're going to 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.799
 the description and click on a link I think 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.150
 that leave is also called envy voucher 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.640
 inspector envy 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.280
 you expect this and we are going to jump 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.190
 advertising that comes to us friendly 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.590
 it's very light, less than a half 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:17.530
 but none of this is uploaded by child and 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:20.230
 personally they make good and it's going to 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.850
 leave a folder a folder and 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.850
 well, this is an animal 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.480
 we said that and well here as you see 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.020
 we have all the information of the 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.970
 large card 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.320
 I forgot to tell you that if you do not have 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.320
 an nvidia card 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.230
 for example 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.410
 in principle basic functional business 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:52.440
 because this is a media program 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.810
 and I 'm very sorry if you have but we do not 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.070
 will serve to be able to help because 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.070
 I have with 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.830
 here it goes down overclocking show 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.900
 and so we can also regulate the 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.300
 diversity of fans put you 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.060
 let's go we're at the peak of auto by 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.950
 one hundred percent and we will be fa 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.900
 I do not know if we'll get to hear the 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.069
 hotel fans 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.040
 but well here we can see a 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.310
 temperature that is lowering a button and 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.379
 another very important thing is here where 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:32.580
 puts of albert version of we see here to 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:37.800
 this who profiles we put great 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:40.440
 and here you get great car 4 and 5 sorry and 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.540
 grand theft auto 5 launcher click on 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.310
 the launcher if we have pirate is worth 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.190
 because this is the launcher 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.350
 and we are going to apply 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.240
 it puts us like 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.610
 remove some graphics that are not 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.460
 you barely notice it necessary to 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:02.550
 increase what comes to be him 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:07.070
 the performance so well this what 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:10.520
 we can close our eyes all states 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.520
 to work 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:19.460
 but well let's face it and see you 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.460
 inside the game 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.930
 well I with the program I'm recording 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:27.930
 I get positive 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:37.200
 so I 'm saying right now I have 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:40.410
 30 30 in your acts 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.990
 let's go to settings in graphics and here 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.390
 is where we can change the 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.320
 graphics here assured that with the 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:53.360
 distance to 7 we will lower the 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:56.360
 reference for example to 1920 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.820
 new 1280 x 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:04.540
 50 hertz 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:07.790
 because they are not separated 60 249 guys 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.800
 wheel monitors 1 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:16.220
 population density is worth this if you go 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:19.780
 loose if you see that you are justito 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.780
 of very good hardware 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.820
 I recommend you to put it on 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.510
 maximum 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.510
 a little 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:34.239
 teacher of all varieties of 

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:37.109
 society population is quite worth 

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:37.109
 little more 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:47.240
 wanted for the fifth round 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:50.289
 but this just barely this area 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.289
 the sewing chain 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.980
 I prefer that I do not have better 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:07.560
 simply going down with the restriction 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:11.030
 August 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.030
 apply change to the fact 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.600
 and we give to 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.210
 because if it's worth like and the screen is 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.580
 a little 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:27.900
 it's squared 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.900
 but well uploaded the fps to 50 hours 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.889
 many books 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:42.150
 of 30 that goes to me at the beginning I went up to 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:44.720
 56 seconds are schools very 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.720
 important 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.050
 good but worth the dislike values 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:57.139
 that helped me a lot subscribe no 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:58.849
 you are and good to thank you for 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:02.150
 the acceptance that has been my 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:03.319
 last video is worth nothing is everything I hope 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.479
 what you liked 

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:07.479
 see you in the next few hours goodbye
