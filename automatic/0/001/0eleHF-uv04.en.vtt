why<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.829> took<00:00:38.070> them<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.280> long<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:39.000> actually<00:00:39.390> get

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
why it took them so long to actually get

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.290 
why it took them so long to actually get
this<00:00:39.750> car<00:00:39.989> into<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.350> game<00:00:40.559> because<00:00:41.520> it's<00:00:42.030> just

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
this car into the game because it's just

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.030 
this car into the game because it's just
one<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.899> cars<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.559> game<00:00:43.770> needs

one of the cars that this game needs

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.750 
one of the cars that this game needs
this<00:00:44.340> there's<00:00:44.969> no<00:00:45.210> way<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.719> game<00:00:45.989> could<00:00:46.260> have

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
this there's no way this game could have

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.279 
this there's no way this game could have
got<00:00:47.760> away<00:00:47.879> with<00:00:48.030> not<00:00:48.390> putting<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.079> it's

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
got away with not putting the in it it's

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.680 
got away with not putting the in it it's
just<00:00:49.379> very<00:00:49.980> very<00:00:50.309> fitting<00:00:51.180> at<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> end<00:00:51.600> of

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
just very very fitting at the end of

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.150 
just very very fitting at the end of
Japan<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.320> thought<00:00:52.500> would<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.800> added<00:00:53.070> it

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
Japan and I thought would have added it

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.729 
Japan and I thought would have added it
in<00:00:53.250> with<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.430> DLC<00:00:53.850> then<00:00:54.149> but<00:00:54.780> they<00:00:54.899> didn't<00:00:55.350> and

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
in with the DLC then but they didn't and

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.799 
in with the DLC then but they didn't and
they<00:00:55.860> didn't<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.520> then<00:00:56.850> they<00:00:57.000> finally<00:00:57.390> did

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
they didn't and then they finally did

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.810 
they didn't and then they finally did
with<00:00:58.140> Maori<00:00:58.500> habits<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.039> it's<00:00:59.219> amazing

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
with Maori habits and it's amazing

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.099 
with Maori habits and it's amazing
because<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.210> actually<00:01:00.329> get<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.570> drive<00:01:00.870> this

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
because I actually get to drive this

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.579 
because I actually get to drive this

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
thing over any other supercar really and

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.399 
thing over any other supercar really and
I<00:01:38.790> think<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.180> kind<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.450> obvious<00:01:39.600> why<00:01:39.990> anyone

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
I think it's kind of obvious why anyone

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.960 
I think it's kind of obvious why anyone
would<00:01:40.770> go<00:01:40.920> for<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
would go for this is that it's the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.569 
would go for this is that it's the
obvious<00:01:42.119> choice<00:01:42.360> yes<00:01:42.899> but<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.890> makes<00:01:44.159> sense

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
obvious choice yes but it makes sense

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.670 
obvious choice yes but it makes sense
why<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.270> obvious<00:01:45.390> choice<00:01:45.860> so<00:01:47.420> cheap

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
why it's the obvious choice so cheap

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.020 
why it's the obvious choice so cheap
it's<00:01:49.680> also<00:01:49.860> quite<00:01:50.159> cheap<00:01:50.430> compared<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
it's also quite cheap compared to the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.910 
it's also quite cheap compared to the
others<00:01:51.240> along<00:01:51.840> with<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.079> fact<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.409> destroys

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
others along with the fact it destroys
