00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.950
 our world in continuous 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.860
 acceleration and generally those who go fast 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.300
 says to do it to save time but 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.570
 going fast really saves 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.809
 so long 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.809
 and how much it costs we go aboard a 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.580
 bmw x1 a car of which we know i 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.860
 consumption at constant speed 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.520
 our experiment consists of 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.140
 travel the same distance 100 km more 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.140
 sometimes it's at different speeds 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.520
 in this way we will have the possibility of 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.890
 observe how much a journey can 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.619
 become shorter or longer a 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.420
 depending on the speed 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.869
 first try to make our journey 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.320
 100 km at a speed of 80 km 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.259
 then 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.950
 we spent an hour and 15 minutes e 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:25.550
 we consumed 4.48 liters of diesel 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.550
 that is 22.31 km with a book 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.890
 second test 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.890
 we press a little more on the accelerator 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.890
 this time we keep an average speed of 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.650
 100 kilometers an hour using us 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.130
 of course an hour in this case i 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:47.570
 consumption was 5.55 liters ie 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:50.780
 almost 1.1 liters more every 100 km 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.140
 average and therefore of 18.02 km with a liter 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.140
 of fuel 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.130
 no 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.049
 but let's say we are even colder 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.050
 and we go to 120 kilometers per hour for 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.090
 another 100 km we take 50 minutes 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.410
 saving ten minutes of ours 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.650
 precious time but it takes 6.86 liters 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.340
 the average per liter this time is 14.58 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.310
 km that is with the same liter of petrol 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.580
 let's do 3.4 kilometers less 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.319
 when we went to a hundred an hour 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.709
 we are always in a hurry but here we are at 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.870
 140 per hour takes only 43 minutes 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.090
 to do our 100 km 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.569
 but look what happens we have 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.890
 consumed 3.94 liters more than when 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.980
 we were at 80 per hour 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.829
 average consumption reached 11.88 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.709
 kilometers per liter 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:53.349
 in short from 80 to 140 per hour 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.769
 we save about half an hour but so with 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.900
 the same liter of petrol is 10.4 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.730
 km less 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.799
 Do the bill a little and see how much 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.100
 every half hour is valid at the end of the month 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:09.260
 so save some of your time 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.720
 money but gasoline too 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.640
 and since your reflexes remain 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.890
 always the same means that 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.870
 the risks increase both for those on board 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.760
 both for those on the road 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.709
 it is a risk that is not easy 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.319
 to be calculated but high we can 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.879
 guarantee in any case if you don't want to 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.890
 arrive with a half hour delay there is a 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:30.040
 Foolproof method starting half an hour 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.040
 before
