00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
slip over they start from the origami

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.690 
slip over they start from the origami
because<00:01:35.899> you<00:01:36.049> gots<00:01:36.229> myself<00:01:36.409> very<00:01:36.679> quickly<00:01:36.890> but

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
because you gots myself very quickly but

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.910 
because you gots myself very quickly but
I<00:01:37.729> want<00:01:37.969> to<00:01:38.060> do<00:01:38.210> that<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.630> transport<00:01:39.560> them<00:01:39.770> and

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
I want to do that to transport them and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.130 
I want to do that to transport them and
keep<00:01:40.039> them<00:01:40.189> safe<00:01:40.429> let's<00:01:40.670> say<00:01:40.850> you<00:01:40.909> it's<00:01:41.299> snow

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
keep them safe let's say you it's snow

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.029 
keep them safe let's say you it's snow
we<00:01:42.350> need<00:01:42.560> or<00:01:42.679> it's<00:01:42.920> raining<00:01:43.159> or<00:01:43.700> whatever<00:01:44.060> and

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
and then even though they're not really

and then even though they're not really
what's<00:01:47.240> in<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.570> venue<00:01:47.780> you<00:01:47.929> know<00:01:48.140> how<00:01:48.289> it<00:01:48.439> is

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499 
what's in the venue you know how it is

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.739 
what's in the venue you know how it is
if<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:48.799> perform<00:01:49.189> you<00:01:49.280> know<00:01:49.429> that<00:01:49.640> like<00:01:49.850> looks

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
if you perform you know that like looks

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:53.010 
if you perform you know that like looks
you<00:01:50.960> know<00:01:51.109> this<00:01:51.350> just<00:01:51.560> got<00:01:51.740> stuck<00:01:52.009> in<00:01:52.130> my<00:01:52.159> belt

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
you know this just got stuck in my belt

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.789 
you know this just got stuck in my belt
but<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:54.049> never<00:01:54.319> know<00:01:54.439> what's<00:01:54.590> gonna<00:01:54.679> be

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
but you never know what's gonna be

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.499 
but you never know what's gonna be
around<00:01:54.890> that<00:01:55.460> stage<00:01:55.789> so<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:56.119> want<00:01:56.359> to<00:01:56.420> be

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
around that stage so you want to be

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.190 
around that stage so you want to be
protected<00:01:57.219> I<00:01:58.219> so<00:01:58.850> you<00:01:59.359> think<00:01:59.630> that<00:01:59.659> case<00:01:59.960> is

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
protected I so you think that case is

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.309 
protected I so you think that case is
okay<00:02:00.590> but<00:02:01.249> don't<00:02:01.850> use<00:02:02.030> that<00:02:02.060> case<00:02:02.719> for<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:03.020> long

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
okay but don't use that case for a long

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.520 
okay but don't use that case for a long
time<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:04.280> don't<00:02:04.460> want<00:02:04.579> to<00:02:04.639> store<00:02:05.060> your<00:02:05.780> wings

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
time you don't want to store your wings

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.529 
time you don't want to store your wings
in<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:07.219> case<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:07.729> just<00:02:07.789> want<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.090> use<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:08.420> to

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
in the case you just want to use it to

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.350 
in the case you just want to use it to
transport<00:02:09.020> it<00:02:09.590> because<00:02:10.310> if<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:11.000> organism

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
transport it because if the organism

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.360 
transport it because if the organism
fabrics<00:02:11.990> is<00:02:12.200> in<00:02:12.410> a<00:02:12.470> case<00:02:12.740> like<00:02:12.770> that<00:02:12.950> hole

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
fabrics is in a case like that hole

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.850 
fabrics is in a case like that hole
didn't<00:02:13.700> have<00:02:13.819> an<00:02:14.000> oyster<00:02:14.239> for<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:15.019> long<00:02:15.200> time<00:02:15.440> it

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
didn't have an oyster for a long time it

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.860 
didn't have an oyster for a long time it
really<00:02:16.010> does<00:02:16.340> kind<00:02:16.549> of<00:02:16.640> keep<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.269> shape<00:02:17.540> and

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
really does kind of keep that shape and

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.660 
really does kind of keep that shape and
like<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.290> little<00:02:18.560> wrinkle<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.159> that's<00:02:19.519> not

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
like a little wrinkle and that's not

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.380 
like a little wrinkle and that's not
local<00:02:20.030> pretty<00:02:20.239> so<00:02:21.080> as<00:02:21.950> far<00:02:22.220> as<00:02:22.280> cleaning<00:02:23.000> them

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
local pretty so as far as cleaning them

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.390 
local pretty so as far as cleaning them
they<00:02:23.629> don't<00:02:24.019> we've<00:02:24.140> got<00:02:24.319> a<00:02:24.349> lot<00:02:24.680> of<00:02:24.709> clinicals

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
they don't we've got a lot of clinicals

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.680 
they don't we've got a lot of clinicals
all<00:02:25.549> the<00:02:25.640> time<00:02:25.849> because<00:02:26.030> it's<00:02:26.269> kind<00:02:26.450> of<00:02:26.480> one<00:02:26.659> of

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
all the time because it's kind of one of

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.809 
all the time because it's kind of one of
those<00:02:26.810> parts<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:27.200> use<00:02:27.379> once<00:02:27.650> in<00:02:27.739> a<00:02:27.799> while<00:02:28.010> but

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
those parts you use once in a while but

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.479 
those parts you use once in a while but
if<00:02:29.060> you<00:02:29.180> really<00:02:29.510> really<00:02:29.959> really<00:02:30.680> have<00:02:31.099> to<00:02:31.340> I

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
if you really really really have to I

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.630 
if you really really really have to I
would<00:02:31.700> say<00:02:31.730> hand<00:02:32.510> wash<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.290> parts<00:02:33.680> that<00:02:33.920> are

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
would say hand wash the parts that are

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.520 
would say hand wash the parts that are
dirty<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.569> need<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.840> like<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.260> know

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
dirty and that you need to like you know

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.250 
dirty and that you need to like you know
look<00:02:36.829> made<00:02:37.519> of<00:02:37.610> a<00:02:37.670> clean<00:02:37.909> of<00:02:38.120> usually<00:02:39.049> it's<00:02:39.140> the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
look made of a clean of usually it's the

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.899 
look made of a clean of usually it's the
bottom<00:02:39.590> because<00:02:39.739> it's<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.099> arms<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:40.579> the<00:02:40.670> park

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
bottom because it's the arms of the park

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.180 
bottom because it's the arms of the park
victims<00:02:41.269> to<00:02:41.480> being<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:41.930> on<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.349> floor<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:43.159> you

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
victims to being it on the floor so you

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.160 
victims to being it on the floor so you
can't<00:02:43.459> want<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:43.700> take<00:02:43.819> it<00:02:43.970> just<00:02:44.120> by<00:02:44.239> hand<00:02:44.540> and

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
can't want to take it just by hand and

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.410 
can't want to take it just by hand and
you<00:02:45.739> put<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:45.980> little<00:02:46.099> slope<00:02:46.400> of<00:02:46.579> water<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.239> kind

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
you put a little slope of water and kind

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.000 
you put a little slope of water and kind
of<00:02:47.510> do<00:02:47.659> this<00:02:47.780> with<00:02:48.019> it<00:02:48.200> if<00:02:48.530> you're<00:02:48.709> just<00:02:48.920> the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
of do this with it if you're just the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.380 
of do this with it if you're just the
bottom<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.459> then<00:02:49.549> watch<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:49.760> really<00:02:50.180> quickly

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
bottom and then watch it really quickly

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.599 
bottom and then watch it really quickly
and<00:02:50.510> then<00:02:50.780> hang<00:02:51.019> it<00:02:51.049> again

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
and then hang it again

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.080 
and then hang it again
don't<00:02:53.599> try<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.900> wash<00:02:54.260> like<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:55.069> middle<00:02:55.670> parts

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
don't try to wash like the middle parts

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.199 
don't try to wash like the middle parts
with<00:02:56.739> what<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.859> pleats<00:02:58.129> are<00:02:58.430> because<00:02:58.849> you<00:02:59.060> can

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
with what the pleats are because you can

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.910 
with what the pleats are because you can
easily<00:02:59.420> lose<00:02:59.599> the<00:02:59.959> place<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.530> that's<00:03:00.650> kind<00:03:00.890> of

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
easily lose the place and that's kind of

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.190 
easily lose the place and that's kind of
hard<00:03:01.099> to<00:03:01.129> like<00:03:01.250> you<00:03:02.000> know<00:03:02.290> don't<00:03:03.290> iron<00:03:05.200> the

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
hard to like you know don't iron the

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.319 
hard to like you know don't iron the
Isaacs<00:03:06.620> wings<00:03:06.829> this<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:07.370> origami<00:03:07.670> so<00:03:07.940> fabric

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
Isaacs wings this is origami so fabric

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:09.580 
Isaacs wings this is origami so fabric
if<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.510> are<00:03:08.720> in<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:08.989> chances<00:03:09.290> are<00:03:09.379> you<00:03:09.500> gonna

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
if you are in it chances are you gonna

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.569 
if you are in it chances are you gonna
earn<00:03:09.859> it<00:03:10.010> immediately

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
earn it immediately

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.110 
earn it immediately
so<00:03:11.290> China<00:03:12.290> wrought<00:03:12.650> iron<00:03:12.920> like<00:03:13.310> if<00:03:13.670> you<00:03:13.879> don't
