00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
those subtle real life things that

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.620 
those subtle real life things that
receivers<00:01:20.250> do<00:01:20.369> all<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> time<00:01:20.880> when<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.509> get

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the extension then you get the offensive

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.499 
the extension then you get the offensive
pass<00:01:23.070> interference<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.759> if<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.909> do<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.330> as

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
pass interference but if you do it as

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.120 
pass interference but if you do it as

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
you're about to go up like he does and

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.100 
you're about to go up like he does and
it<00:01:26.580> actually<00:01:26.790> does<00:01:27.240> impact<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.750> play<00:01:27.900> like

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.920 
it actually does impact the play like
you<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.380> see<00:01:28.530> his<00:01:28.850> his<00:01:29.850> arm<00:01:30.119> kind<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.570> extends

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
you can see his his arm kind of extends

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.090 
you can see his his arm kind of extends
out<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> little<00:01:31.290> bit<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.680> they<00:01:31.829> still<00:01:32.070> can't

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
out a little bit and they still can't

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.580 
out a little bit and they still can't
get<00:01:32.850> back<00:01:33.180> far<00:01:33.600> enough<00:01:33.630> now<00:01:34.110> he<00:01:34.140> probably

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
get back far enough now he probably

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.960 
get back far enough now he probably
wasn't<00:01:34.890> going<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.250> able<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.610> anyway

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
wasn't going to be able to anyway

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.319 
wasn't going to be able to anyway
because<00:01:36.290> we<00:01:37.290> all<00:01:37.439> know<00:01:37.470> about<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:37.979> catcher

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
because we all know about this catcher

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.210 
because we all know about this catcher
but<00:01:39.329> yeah<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:40.140> actually<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.680> pretty<00:01:40.860> dope

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
but yeah that actually is pretty dope

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.670 
but yeah that actually is pretty dope
man<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.490> cannot<00:01:41.939> deny<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.869> little<00:01:43.439> push
