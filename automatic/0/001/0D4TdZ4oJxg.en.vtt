00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
I'm thinking of doing he's doing one of

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.020 
I'm thinking of doing he's doing one of
these<00:00:36.809> once<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.320> week<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:38.219> I'll<00:00:38.370> carry<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.850> from

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
these once a week and I'll carry on from

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.819 
these once a week and I'll carry on from
that<00:00:39.239> kind<00:00:39.510> tool<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.079> did<00:00:40.320> from<00:00:40.559> trading

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
that kind tool that I did from trading

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.560 
that kind tool that I did from trading
from<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> last<00:00:41.370> one<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.120> can<00:00:42.360> see<00:00:42.540> for

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
from the last one so you can see for

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.209 
from the last one so you can see for
example<00:00:42.840> Terry<00:00:43.469> will<00:00:43.649> probably<00:00:43.890> start<00:00:44.040> from

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
example Terry will probably start from

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.010 
example Terry will probably start from
60<00:00:44.670> care<00:00:44.850> next<00:00:45.120> time<00:00:45.270> something<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:45.809> that

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
60 care next time something like that

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.410 
60 care next time something like that
and<00:00:46.200> from<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.190> Terry<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.120> then<00:00:48.300> we'll<00:00:48.390> all

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
and from this Terry and then we'll all

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.959 
and from this Terry and then we'll all
do<00:00:48.719> will<00:00:48.930> turn<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> player<00:00:49.530> who's<00:00:49.800> 150<00:00:50.670> k<00:00:50.850> in

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969

that<00:03:40.450> i<00:03:40.480> coming<00:03:40.750> back<00:03:40.900> with<00:03:41.050> salt<00:03:41.260> on<00:03:41.320> quite<00:03:41.530> a

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
that i coming back with salt on quite a

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.930 
that i coming back with salt on quite a
few<00:03:41.650> plays<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:42.190> this<00:03:42.280> is<00:03:42.400> only<00:03:42.519> after<00:03:42.730> the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
few plays and this is only after the

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.210 
few plays and this is only after the
first<00:03:43.180> hour<00:03:43.480> or<00:03:43.720> so<00:03:43.900> maybe<00:03:44.110> because<00:03:44.980> I<00:03:45.010> let's

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
first hour or so maybe because I let's

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.460 
first hour or so maybe because I let's
do<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.400> basically<00:03:45.760> i<00:03:45.880> started<00:03:46.209> this<00:03:46.299> at<00:03:46.450> 9pm<00:03:46.930> at

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
do it basically i started this at 9pm at

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.199 
do it basically i started this at 9pm at
night<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:47.950> then<00:03:48.310> obviously<00:03:48.519> i'd<00:03:48.880> do<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.090> to

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
night and then obviously i'd do it to

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.850 
night and then obviously i'd do it to
the<00:03:49.330> 9pm<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:49.959> next<00:03:50.290> now<00:03:50.410> because<00:03:50.650> that's<00:03:50.769> a

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
the 9pm the next now because that's a

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.270 
the 9pm the next now because that's a
full<00:03:50.890> 24<00:03:51.519> hours<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:53.560> reason<00:03:53.769> I<00:03:53.950> do<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:54.100> is

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
full 24 hours so the reason I do that is

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.160 
full 24 hours so the reason I do that is
because<00:03:54.519> it<00:03:54.790> kind<00:03:55.030> of<00:03:55.090> maximizes<00:03:55.630> the<00:03:55.720> chances

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
because it kind of maximizes the chances

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.780 
because it kind of maximizes the chances
of<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.500> place<00:03:56.680> selling<00:03:56.980> because<00:03:57.340> I<00:03:57.489> can<00:03:57.670> list

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
of the place selling because I can list

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.460 
of the place selling because I can list
them<00:03:57.940> up<00:03:58.030> overnight<00:03:58.360> so<00:03:58.750> obviously<00:03:59.140> I've<00:03:59.290> got

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
them up overnight so obviously I've got

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.530 
them up overnight so obviously I've got
nine<00:03:59.860> at<00:04:00.010> night<00:04:00.040> pick<00:04:00.640> up<00:04:00.760> some<00:04:00.940> players<00:04:01.180> list
