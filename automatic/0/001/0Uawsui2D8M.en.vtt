00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
way I planted it was a little bit higher

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
and for those of you that have clay

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.180 
and for those of you that have clay
soils<00:02:03.429> this<00:02:03.819> is<00:02:03.940> gonna<00:02:04.090> be<00:02:04.330> an<00:02:04.420> important<00:02:04.960> tip

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
soils this is gonna be an important tip

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.700 
soils this is gonna be an important tip
plant<00:02:06.190> almost<00:02:06.600> above<00:02:07.600> your<00:02:07.960> soil<00:02:08.259> grade

pointing in what's referred to as a berm

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.559 
pointing in what's referred to as a berm
sometimes<00:02:11.200> what<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:11.620> do<00:02:11.680> is<00:02:12.100> dig<00:02:12.760> out<00:02:12.880> a<00:02:13.090> large

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
sometimes what I do is dig out a large

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.010 
sometimes what I do is dig out a large
wide<00:02:14.290> area<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.430> dig<00:02:15.760> wider<00:02:16.270> than<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:16.959> do

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
wide area so I dig wider than I do

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.680 
wide area so I dig wider than I do
deeper<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.860> then<00:02:18.220> I<00:02:18.250> mound<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:18.970> native<00:02:19.450> soil

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
deeper and then I mound that native soil

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.510 
deeper and then I mound that native soil
back<00:02:19.959> around<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.440> root<00:02:20.620> ball<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.220> tree

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
back around the root ball of the tree

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.630 
back around the root ball of the tree
the<00:02:21.910> reason<00:02:22.390> being<00:02:22.630> clay<00:02:23.380> soil<00:02:23.740> isn't<00:02:24.280> that

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
the reason being clay soil isn't that

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.520 
the reason being clay soil isn't that
great<00:02:24.910> at<00:02:25.060> drainage<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.690> that<00:02:26.020> will<00:02:26.230> kill<00:02:26.500> a

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
great at drainage and that will kill a

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.650 
great at drainage and that will kill a
conifer<00:02:26.980> quicker<00:02:27.340> than<00:02:27.580> anything<00:02:27.790> is<00:02:28.120> poor

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
conifer quicker than anything is poor

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.540 
conifer quicker than anything is poor
drainage<00:02:28.930> so<00:02:29.530> think<00:02:29.830> not<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:30.250> much<00:02:30.400> about

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
drainage so think not so much about

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.690 
drainage so think not so much about
digging<00:02:30.910> deep<00:02:31.270> holes<00:02:31.569> but<00:02:32.200> wide<00:02:32.620> holes<00:02:33.160> that

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
digging deep holes but wide holes that

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.520 
digging deep holes but wide holes that
will<00:02:33.850> loosen<00:02:34.150> your<00:02:34.480> soil<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.930> little<00:02:35.200> bit<00:02:35.350> and

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
will loosen your soil a little bit and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.820 
will loosen your soil a little bit and
then<00:02:35.650> mound<00:02:36.130> it<00:02:36.400> above<00:02:36.850> that

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.340 

so<00:02:41.830> our<00:02:41.920> next<00:02:42.040> conifer<00:02:42.670> is<00:02:42.880> also<00:02:43.390> a<00:02:43.420> pine<00:02:43.720> pinus

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
so our next conifer is also a pine pinus

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.490 
so our next conifer is also a pine pinus

to finish with what I consider one of

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.080 
to finish with what I consider one of
those<00:03:37.930> conifers<00:03:38.530> it's<00:03:38.830> sort<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.190> waiting<00:03:40.060> for

this<00:03:41.290> is<00:03:41.440> Picea<00:03:41.980> pungent<00:03:42.670> straw<00:03:43.330> now<00:03:44.019> right

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
this is Picea pungent straw now right

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.350 
this is Picea pungent straw now right
now<00:03:44.530> when<00:03:44.830> you<00:03:44.920> look<00:03:45.070> at<00:03:45.250> you<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.610> sort<00:03:46.209> of<00:03:46.239> an

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
now when you look at you a sort of an

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.660 
now when you look at you a sort of an
off<00:03:46.480> green<00:03:46.959> kind<00:03:47.680> of<00:03:47.830> color<00:03:48.040> not<00:03:48.280> all<00:03:48.489> that

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
off green kind of color not all that

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.300 
off green kind of color not all that
exciting<00:03:49.180> but<00:03:49.690> eventually<00:03:50.470> it<00:03:50.680> will<00:03:50.860> take<00:03:51.100> on

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
exciting but eventually it will take on

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.160 
exciting but eventually it will take on
some<00:03:51.730> new<00:03:51.970> growth<00:03:52.330> that'll<00:03:52.720> have<00:03:52.840> a<00:03:52.870> yellow

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
some new growth that'll have a yellow

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.560 
some new growth that'll have a yellow
tone<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.890> it<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.190> eventually<00:03:54.580> it<00:03:55.030> will<00:03:55.060> keep

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
tone to it and eventually it will keep

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.780 
tone to it and eventually it will keep
some<00:03:55.900> of<00:03:55.930> that<00:03:56.050> yellowy<00:03:56.680> golden<00:03:57.459> tone

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
some of that yellowy golden tone

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.820 
some of that yellowy golden tone
throughout<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.480> year<00:03:58.810> and<00:03:59.019> I've<00:03:59.440> seen

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
throughout the year and I've seen

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.729 
throughout the year and I've seen
pictures<00:04:00.160> of<00:04:00.370> some<00:04:00.790> mature<00:04:01.239> Picea<00:04:02.200> pungent

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
pictures of some mature Picea pungent

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.310 
pictures of some mature Picea pungent
straw<00:04:03.160> that<00:04:03.670> are<00:04:03.760> absolutely<00:04:04.510> stunning<00:04:05.200> and

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
straw that are absolutely stunning and

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.259 
straw that are absolutely stunning and
eventually<00:04:06.040> hope<00:04:06.220> this<00:04:06.430> one<00:04:06.640> will<00:04:06.820> get<00:04:07.060> there

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
eventually hope this one will get there

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:07.770 
eventually hope this one will get there
too

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
too

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.630 
too
so<00:04:08.080> sometimes<00:04:08.590> you<00:04:08.980> got<00:04:09.100> to<00:04:09.130> wait<00:04:09.310> for<00:04:09.340> them<00:04:09.550> to

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
so sometimes you got to wait for them to

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.240 
so sometimes you got to wait for them to
grow<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:10.209> sometimes<00:04:11.200> you<00:04:11.530> have<00:04:11.620> to<00:04:11.769> wait<00:04:11.980> for

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
grow and sometimes you have to wait for

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.800 
grow and sometimes you have to wait for
them<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.550> take<00:04:12.730> on<00:04:12.760> those<00:04:13.239> distinct

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
them to take on those distinct

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.090 
them to take on those distinct
characteristics<00:04:14.620> that<00:04:14.769> you<00:04:14.890> want<00:04:16.950> so<00:04:17.950> let's

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
characteristics that you want so let's

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.670 
characteristics that you want so let's

now first off I just like to say part of

now first off I just like to say part of
the<00:04:26.350> flora<00:04:26.620> I'll<00:04:26.860> get<00:04:27.100> that<00:04:27.220> out<00:04:27.280> of<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.610> way

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
the flora I'll get that out of the way

the flora I'll get that out of the way
when<00:04:28.630> I<00:04:28.660> bought<00:04:28.930> this<00:04:29.169> tree<00:04:29.530> as<00:04:29.650> you<00:04:29.770> can<00:04:29.919> see

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
when I bought this tree as you can see

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.040 
when I bought this tree as you can see
it's<00:04:30.280> pretty<00:04:30.400> large<00:04:30.760> it<00:04:31.120> was<00:04:31.450> in<00:04:31.810> bad

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
it's pretty large it was in bad

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.080 
it's pretty large it was in bad
condition<00:04:32.680> and<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:32.890> branching<00:04:33.430> here<00:04:33.640> is<00:04:33.790> very

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
condition and the branching here is very

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.450 
condition and the branching here is very
sparse<00:04:34.540> but<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:35.020> root<00:04:35.380> condition<00:04:35.950> is<00:04:36.100> really

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
sparse but the root condition is really

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.850

what<00:04:36.940> concerned<00:04:37.390> me<00:04:37.510> I<00:04:37.840> got<00:04:38.140> a<00:04:38.169> good<00:04:38.350> price<00:04:38.650> on

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
what concerned me I got a good price on

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.150 
what concerned me I got a good price on
it<00:04:38.919> large<00:04:39.370> tree<00:04:39.760> took<00:04:40.060> it<00:04:40.180> home<00:04:40.390> I<00:04:40.660> was<00:04:40.780> excited

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
it large tree took it home I was excited

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.560 
it large tree took it home I was excited
pulled<00:04:42.160> it<00:04:42.310> out<00:04:42.340> of<00:04:42.430> the<00:04:42.550> pot<00:04:42.820> and<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.240> roots

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
pulled it out of the pot and the roots

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.870 
pulled it out of the pot and the roots
looked<00:04:43.900> bad<00:04:44.169> what<00:04:44.530> do<00:04:44.590> I<00:04:44.680> mean<00:04:44.860> by<00:04:44.890> bad<00:04:45.250> well<00:04:45.790> if

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
looked bad what do I mean by bad well if

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.730 
looked bad what do I mean by bad well if
you<00:04:45.970> could<00:04:46.090> picture<00:04:46.330> fettuccini<00:04:47.080> looking

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
you could picture fettuccini looking

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.150 
you could picture fettuccini looking
black<00:04:48.039> bad<00:04:48.460> so<00:04:49.270> I<00:04:49.539> returned<00:04:50.260> it<00:04:50.440> heavily<00:04:50.860> which

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
black bad so I returned it heavily which

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.040 
black bad so I returned it heavily which

- Linda chalker Scott you heard us
discuss<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.509> issue<00:04:55.720> of<00:04:55.960> root<00:04:56.590> pruning<00:04:56.830> and

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
discuss the issue of root pruning and

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.650 
discuss the issue of root pruning and
how<00:04:57.250> to<00:04:57.310> deal<00:04:57.610> with<00:04:57.639> trees<00:04:58.090> like<00:04:58.389> this<00:04:58.599> one

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
how to deal with trees like this one

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.469 
how to deal with trees like this one
that<00:04:59.289> were<00:04:59.440> severely<00:05:00.129> root<00:05:00.520> bound<00:05:00.729> and<00:05:01.150> the

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
that were severely root bound and the

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.839 
that were severely root bound and the
roots<00:05:01.720> were<00:05:01.900> in<00:05:01.990> overall<00:05:02.470> bad<00:05:02.740> condition<00:05:03.340> so

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 
roots were in overall bad condition so

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:05.850 
roots were in overall bad condition so
far<00:05:04.090> about<00:05:04.330> eight<00:05:04.509> months<00:05:04.840> in<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:05.080> ground<00:05:05.110> no

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
far about eight months in the ground no

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.369 
far about eight months in the ground no
worse<00:05:06.099> the<00:05:06.340> wear<00:05:06.550> hasn't<00:05:07.180> deteriorated<00:05:07.539> in

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
worse the wear hasn't deteriorated in

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:09.600 
worse the wear hasn't deteriorated in
any<00:05:08.530> way<00:05:08.740> whatsoever

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
any way whatsoever

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.820 
any way whatsoever
hopefully<00:05:10.330> the<00:05:10.449> branching<00:05:10.900> will<00:05:11.020> improve<00:05:11.470> in

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
hopefully the branching will improve in

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.710 
hopefully the branching will improve in
the<00:05:12.099> future<00:05:12.430> as<00:05:12.550> it<00:05:12.699> gets<00:05:12.819> acclimated<00:05:13.479> to<00:05:13.509> its

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
the future as it gets acclimated to its

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.930 
the future as it gets acclimated to its
new<00:05:13.870> home<00:05:13.900> and<00:05:14.530> if<00:05:14.710> it<00:05:14.800> doesn't<00:05:14.979> I'm<00:05:15.310> okay<00:05:15.789> with

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
new home and if it doesn't I'm okay with

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.869 
new home and if it doesn't I'm okay with
that<00:05:16.090> too<00:05:16.330> so<00:05:17.050> next<00:05:17.289> week<00:05:17.620> part<00:05:18.099> 2<00:05:18.340> of<00:05:18.370> our
