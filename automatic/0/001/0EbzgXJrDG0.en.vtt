what I use little container the Y

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.069 
what I use little container the Y
dropper<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.629> use<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> sand<00:00:56.600> to<00:00:57.600> set<00:00:57.750> my<00:00:57.840> pipes

in so that way

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:08.030 
in so that way
let's<00:01:02.969> go<00:01:03.120> see<00:01:05.689> so<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.840> way<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.650> need<00:01:07.830> to

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
let's go see so that way if I need to

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.880 
let's go see so that way if I need to
set<00:01:08.970> them<00:01:09.090> up<00:01:09.150> high<00:01:09.330> that's<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.290> second<00:01:10.530> Paul

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
set them up high that's in a second Paul

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.980 
set them up high that's in a second Paul
and<00:01:11.490> it's<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> shank<00:01:12.180> opening<00:01:12.600> comes<00:01:12.810> up

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
and it's in the shank opening comes up

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.210 
and it's in the shank opening comes up
and<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.260> bowl<00:01:13.439> comes<00:01:13.650> up<00:01:13.770> like<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.920> said<00:01:13.950> up

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
and the bowl comes up like I said up

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.280 
and the bowl comes up like I said up
high<00:01:14.369> or<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.060> can<00:01:15.240> adjust<00:01:15.330> them<00:01:15.750> however<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.080> need

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
high or I can adjust them however I need

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.090 
high or I can adjust them however I need
to<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:17.790> know<00:01:17.820> what<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.000> mean

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
to you know what I mean

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.320

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
so that's what I use and how many stands

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.700 
so that's what I use and how many stands
back<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:24.810> heater<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.200> that's<00:01:25.229> why<00:01:25.439> started

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
back then heater so that's why started

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.600 
back then heater so that's why started
using<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.549> what<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.759> had<00:01:26.880> nothing<00:01:27.150> else<00:01:28.610> all

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610

at<00:01:32.370> some<00:01:32.640> point<00:01:32.910> I'll<00:01:33.120> start<00:01:33.360> using<00:01:33.920> q-tips

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
at some point I'll start using q-tips

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.850 
at some point I'll start using q-tips
and<00:01:36.290> I'll<00:01:37.290> fill<00:01:37.530> up<00:01:37.620> the<00:01:37.710> bowl<00:01:38.990> dump<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.230> can

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
and I'll fill up the bowl dump this can

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.500 
and I'll fill up the bowl dump this can
out<00:01:41.010> call<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.430> put<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> few<00:01:41.790> drops<00:01:41.880> out<00:01:42.120> hole<00:01:42.390> in

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
out call it put a few drops out hole in

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.460
