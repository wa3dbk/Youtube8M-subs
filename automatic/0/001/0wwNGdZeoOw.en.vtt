00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.330
 going well 

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:15.269
 so for once I'm not sitting next to a poker player 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.279
 like a painter poker player 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.179
 and a very attractive one 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:24.839
 to introduce her to Michel Rentsch Maike du percent 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.839
 played heads-up against Boris Becker 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.659
 how did it come to explain why word came to Monaco here 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:33.380
 I'm closer to him 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.770
 Awarded so know with the Premier in the m Poker League years 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.420
 because we have finished first we are not qualified to do so 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.540
 and that was the price this month that you came here to Monte Carlo against 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.060
 Boris Becker can play extra for this again 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.060
 in Bones if win against him I did not do that unfortunately 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.690
 I suffer underestimated 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.890
 get a few hundredweight lighter eclectic 5 meters on the travel expenses 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.360
 and here the stay for three days and finished Andrus price 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.350
 but he played in the game yesterday 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.159
 the tournament was sponsored the tournament was sponsored I got that 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.170
 as a consolation prize got the entry extended 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.620
 and often stay longer after three days 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.730
 Price in that 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.430
 in% me for you 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.760
 It went very well it was my first live tournament 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.790
 that was one with a three-thousand-port of his 300 Hausener blunder 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.920
 and around 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.910
 I could not do anything better 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.210
 that was just perfect as it went yesterday went pretty much here 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.950
 late milk Klopp from Funky plane flown out between two threesome 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.620
 made sure 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.110
 and it was to the end of those 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.190
 Serhat definitely exhausting 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.460
 Bures played for the heads-up against book rehearsals like Franzen or how 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.210
 Piel 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.500
 Picture you need to flatten from the heads up 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.560
 That's why it dares say 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.480
 I was up front right from the start. ReiÃŸig put pressure on him a bit 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.840
 he has put back more or less but then in the big 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.180
 Park won against me 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.970
 m hamlet by taking the best place and then but what happened Nadal um 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.240
 in principle, I met the hatred on the flop 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.480
 he knows little 8 on your re-encountered and then lay by others 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.929
 I was in principle 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:20.579
 If he was twice as strong as I was an aspiring one then I will 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.019
 won a small park 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.239
 but otherwise he actually plays quite well 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:31.269
 they're piling up on those bloody qualified scans per click 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.839
 So what counts today? 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:36.579
 how do you play there or what to eat the freeroll to sacrifice he diminishes 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.110
 So little harvest can sign up for the normal tours 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.299
 there's the animal ones 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.040
 3 register the pulpit with 5000 DAX now, then there's Nidec well 2000's 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.749
 Animal Zwo where I've played with 5000 heads, there's the single with 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:51.679
 ten thousand 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:55.749
 and there's the prize-winning knowledge the GT race bucks and plays around the CAS 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:58.759
 Every day you have a meal at the same time each day 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.299
 are mostly depending on which in a certain than ten percent 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.360
 between two and three thousand players and when Adolf comes in one 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.519
 Exter are in principle the checks to the tips are easy since I have the points for 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.680
 the rankings and more often CTO of a whole sea Hyundai has been 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.269
 considered an effect and I have around 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.079
 In the middle of the month got the first place 1 ground 9 million 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.579
 Tips 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.319
 and around 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.529
 I have to allow that is quite funny for us because one I'm in 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:30.769
 Principle with whether it grew up love 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.059
 also on 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:35.859
 Because he took from Germany, two years came for us in the area 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.539
 In fact, little villages know where this is 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:41.990
 that was then I think in principle not at all or at home 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.050
 Ayad Mai also gave the bald game against Wales at 8 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.679
 from s 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:51.419
 Maybe here's Bucher Bollig in the area 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.739
 call her own there 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:54.529
 in the 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:58.009
 Parton kidney was playing with where in principle in Walldorf in the sign of this 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:59.729
 only a known name 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:03.259
 that's why there are regular tournaments and small tournaments then 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:06.399
 Prizes can win prizes big tournaments would have to play in the 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:09.399
 Casino go so I'm from time to time 

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:13.939
 So in Jena is very nice bathing-so it means how far into the 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.219
 bed 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:17.519
 50 km 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.029
 so accordingly 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.769
 it is okay too 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.419
 good then samples for their good trip home 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.639
 Have a nice last evening in Monte Carlo and maybe you can see 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.069
 hopefully in the year 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:32.349
 also the charity click 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:33.349
 that was Meike Wendt
